TO THE RIGHT HONO∣RABLE AND VERTVOVS LA∣DIE, THE LADIE HARINGTON. MADAME, the late pestilence in Couentrie, which occasioned my translation &c. of this Hi∣storie, moved me also, in part, to addresse the same unto your Honour. For being altogether restrained then, from free practise of my profession abroad, & no lesse impatient of idle∣nesse at home, I could not readily thinke of a better course to spend that vacation, than in an Argument having a reference to mine old Grammaticall Muses, and according; in some ort, with my latter studies in Physick. What howres therfore, either the doubt∣ful or diseased estate of my neighbours, together with the meditati∣ons of mine owne mortalitie would afford, I employed gladly in the said Subiect. Againe, for as much as the selfe same cause debarred me from accesse unto your house at Combe (a dutie that otherwise the vi∣cinitie of our aboad did require) I fully resolued at the finishing of those my Sedentary labours, to presēt the same to your view: therby to sheild my selfe (whom it pleased you before time to grace with kind entertainmēt) from the iust imputation of rude negligence in that behalfe. But now, since the same citie so dangerous the yeare before, is become a retyring place of safety for your Houshold, & hath to mee alreadie yeelded fit opportunitie to excuse my former absence personally by word of mouth, I have presumed nevertheles to dedicate the same unto your Honour, as a token of my thankeful∣nesse for your bounteous favour, farre above the proportion of my
deserts, and an earnest penny of that propense minde, which I carie to honour your name, in the best maner I could deuise. And verily calling to my remembrance how courteously you have vouchsafed heretofore to accept even at second hand my trauailes in this kinde, and with good words testified oftentimes the content∣ment you received therin, I had no reason to doubt the like accep∣tance of that which out of a loving and devote heart I offer first unto your selfe. Lastly, when I consider, how together with sincere pietie, rare wisdome, and other eminent vertues, there is seated in your person a singular affection to advance good literature, with an extraordi∣narie respect of learned men, I knew no means out of my small fortunes to do you greater honour, than by entituling you as Patro∣nesse of that, which may benefit young Scholers, my countrimen, that would be learned: to give knowledge unto the word, that all the profit or pleasure whatsoever, which shall grow unto them, from these endeavours of mine, are derived immediatly from you and for your sake bestowed upon them. These motives, right Honorable, as well of my first enterprise, as of chusing your Patronage, if it please you to approue, (the onely thing that I humbly crave at your hand for this present) I shall not only thinke my pains well taken and choise as well made: prising your acceptance to the worth of a competent guerdon: but also con∣tinue my hearty prayers unto the Almightie for your perfect health, proceeding in a vertuous course of life, with increase of true Honour here upon earth, and after the revolution of many new yeares, for eternall happinesse in the highest Heaven. Your Honours most readie at command, Philêmon Holland.
To the Readers. THAT yee may with better contentment reade these Historicall reports of the twelve first CEASARS, which SVETONIVS hath de∣livered most truely, compiled as compendiously, and digested right methodically; I have thought it good with some few advertisments praemised, to commend the same unto you. First therefore, whereas by the iudgement of the best learned, and the Analogie of other Histories, hee seemeth to affect nothing so much as uncorrupt & plaine trueth, (the prin∣cipall vertue of an Historiographer) for bearing to meddle with those Nerv, Traia▪ and Hadri∣nus  secretarie he wa. Emperours in whose daies he flourished; because he would not thrust himselfe into danger by revea∣ling, nor betray the libertie of a writer in concealing the faults; much lesse incurre the note of Flatterie, extolling above measure the good parts of Princes then living; and to that purpose penned their lives, who were lately deceased, as one said very well, eadem libertate qua ipsi vixerunt: if happlie in prosecuting of this point, he hath recorded ought that may be offensive to chast and modest mindes, yee shal do well to glaunce over with your eye such places lightly, as I with my pen touched vnwillingly. Secondly, for as much as he continueth in generall the Narrations of the said Princes, from before their Nativitie unto their Death & Funerals: and in the severall discourses, of their ages, affaires, vertues, vices, feature & lineaments of bodie, first, after an uniform maner, proposeth throughout certain heads summarily, and then exemplyfieth the same in due order by perticulers (a most lightsome method and way of teaching) keeping him selfe still to the Subiect matter, without any digressions at all: my advise is, that for your more expedite course in reading the whole, yee direct your minde thereunto. Now, for that his IVLIVS CHASAR sorteth not with the rest, but appeareth  as whose aun∣cestours, birth, childhoode, &c. be not set downe; (which maime I impute rather to the iniurie of time, than unto the purpose or oversight of the Authour) I have in some sort supplyed that defect, with the labours of LEVVIS VIVES, TORRENTIVS and others, which I finde praefixed in the last and best Editions. Thirdly, considering that brevitie is many times the mother of Obscuritie, may it please those among you, who are not so conuersant in such concise writings, as admit not one word superfluous, to have recourse, for the clearing of some doubts unto the margin, as also to those briefe Annotations, which for their sakes, out of mine owne readings, to∣gether with the select observations of BEROALDVS, SABELLICVS, TORRENTIVS and CASAVBONVS I have collected. Which also will ease them of many difficulties that his succinct style and termes, not elswhere obvious, interlaced, may otherwise breed. Finally, if there happen to occur some Errata, that might escape either my pen in wri∣ting, or the ordinarie diligēce of meane Correctors in the printing ye will of your iudi∣cious candour, I hope, either passe them over with connivency, if they be literall, or else taxe with some easie censure in case they bee materiall: So long as for your full satis∣faction, ye may with small paines before yee begin either to read or iudge, correct what is amisse, according to the Examen and Review annexed to the end of all. Farewell.
A SVPPLEMENT TO THE BEGINNING OF C. IVLIVS CEASAR DICTATOR. THE IVLIAN linage, as most men are perswaded, is descended from Ascanius Iülus, the sonne of Aeneas by Creusa: which Iülus, after he had left Lavinium, built long Alba: wherein also he reigned. Others, grounding vpon a more assured evidence, have thought it good to de∣rive the same rather from Iülus the son of Ascanius. For when after the death of (this) Ascanius▪ the Kingdome of the Latines was devol∣vedor retur∣ned unto againe upon Sylvius the sonne of Aeneas and Lavinia, the charge of Religion & sacred ceremonies of the Latin and Troian Nation both, remained yet still in the race and progenie of Iülus: out of which are sprung the Iulij. These (Iulij) with certaine other most noble families of Latium, Tullus Hosti∣lius King of the Romanes, after he had rased Alba, translated to Rome, and raunged among the . Late it was, re they rose and mounted to high place of Magistracie; but were recko∣ned almost in the last ranke of the  of auncient Nobilitie: & of them, the Iüli are the  . For C. Iulius, (sonne of Lucius) surnamed also Iülus, was Consull together with P   Rufus, in the yeare after the foundation of Rome citieor rather 265, accor∣ding to the Chronolo∣gy annexed unto Titus Livius. 264. AndBy the computati∣on of Dio∣nyfius, T. Livius, Cs∣siodorus & others. seaven yeeres after,C. Iulius, or Iūlus. his sonne, with Q. Fabius Vibulanus (Consull) the second time. Againe, some space of time comming betweene, Vopiscus Iulius, sonne of Caius and Nephew of Lucius, bare the Consulshippe with L. Aemiliusal. Ma∣mercus Mamercinus third time Consull, in the yeereor 28, af∣ter the Chro∣nologie a∣foresaid of Dionyfius. 280. I finde likewise, that in the yeeremore tru∣ly 303 302. Caius Iulius, sonne of Caius, and nephew of Lucius, was a decemvir for the enacting and  of Lawes, and that in the former Ele∣ction of that Magistracie: as also, that Caius Iulius sonne of Caius and Nephew of Caius, be∣came Consull with Marcus Geganius Macerinus, in the yeare307, by Livius ac∣ 306. and the selfe same man a second time, with Lucius Verginius Trirostus in the yeere319. 320. 47 318: and immediately in theSo ∣med. yeere next following, a third time, with the same Verginius now twice Consull. And thus much for the Iūli. For to reherse and collect all them of that familie, together with the honorable places of everie one, which were many in number, and of sundry kindes; is not our purpose: and besides, the thing it selfe is apparent and upon record in the publick Registers. Moreover, I have observed in the Iulian line, a certaine house also of the Mentones: and among them, one Caius Iulius, colleague in the Consulshippe with T. Quints Pennus Cincin∣natus, in the 322. yeere after the foundation of the citie. I finde likewise, Caius Iulius Denter to be master of the Horsemen, when Caius Claudius Crssus Sabinus Regillensis was Dictator, for to hold their solemne assembly of Election, in the yeare 405. There were besides of these Iulij, others going vnder the name of Libones: and of the same race one triumphed; to wit, Lucius Iulius, sonne of Lucius and nephew of Lucius; companion in the Consulate which Marcus Attili∣us Regulus, in the yeereHply Pompn 2 of the tribe Pompun 486. But, as touching Caius Iulius sonne of Lucius, and surnamed Caesar , whom Suetonius also ment in the 55. chapter of Iulius Caesar, and Cicero prai∣seth in his Brutus, and in the second booke of his Oratour, I doubt, whether this addition (Stra∣bo,) should not be taken as a by-name. For, otherwise there is in our ands a peece of siluer coine, with the inscription of Lucius Iulius, sonne of Lucius, and surnamed Strabo. The Epi∣gramme of the former is extant among the Antiquities of Rome citie, in this maner. C. Iulius, L. F. Caesar Strabo, AEd. Cur. Q. Trib. Mil. Bis XVIR. AGR. Dnd. ADTR. IV D. Pontif. To conclude, I have met with writers, who reckoned also among the Iulij, certaine* Annales: which, for mine owne part verily, I could never yet light upon, in searching the Records & Chro∣nicles. But in the eight booke of the Familiar Epistles (of Cicero) and namely in the seaventh letter there, of M. Caelius unto Cicero, there is mention made among others, of one L. Iulius, sonne of Lucius, Pomp. Annalis: where the writing (as I suppose) is not very certaine and
acknowledge. For besides that the better corrected Copies call him Villius, (for Iulius) Liuie also hath expresly & plainely written in his fortieth booke, that one Lucius Villius a Tri∣bune of the Commons, made a Law which prouided and ordained, in what yeere of mens age they might sue for everie kinde of Magistracie, and be capable thereof. Whereupon, unto that  was giuen this surname, to be called Annales Thus farre Liuius. Hereunto may    moreouer; that the Kinred Iulia, is reckoned in the Tribe Fabia (and not Pomp∣), as we have noted in the fortieth chapter of Augustus. I am of opinion therefore, that safer    account the Annales among the Villii, and not the Iulii. But thus much hereof, by the ay, and as it were passing by; Now proceede we to the rest. In the linage  then, there was a familie also of the Caesars. But what the reason should be of that surname, it is not certainely knowne; no more, than who he was, that first bare the saide . For, before Caesar the Dictator, and his father and grandfather, there were Iulii na∣ Caeares. As for example; He, who (as Livie witnesseth in his 27. booke) was in the second unick warre sent from the Senate to Crispinus the Consul, about the nomination of a Dicta∣tour. As for the terme Caeares, those usually the Romane tongue surnamed so, who were borne, either by rpping their mothers wombes▪ or with a  . bush of haire growing on their heads, or elsecum  . Some adde moreouer the tale of an Elephant slaine in Africk, which the inhabitants there call Caesar: and vpon that verie cavse, this surname first befell unto Caesar the Dictatours . But Spartiaus and Servius, the Authors hereof, are of the meanest credite and au∣thoritie. For not his progeny alone, of all the Iulii, had this surname, but many others besides of   and , both long before and also together with him. before Iulius  the Dictator, there were, Sext. Iulius, sonne of Caius, nephew of Lucius, together vvith Lucius Aurelius Orestes, in the yeere after the foundation of Rome . 596: Also . Iulius sonne of Caus, nephew of Sext, was colleague vvith L. Marcius Phi∣ in the beginning of the Sociall vvarre in the yeare after the cities foundation597. af∣ter the a∣boue said Chronolo∣gie. 662. and in the next yeere after, Lucius Iulius sone of Lucius, and Nephew of Lucius, bare the Consulate with Pub.  Lupu. Neither before these, were anie of the Caesars renomed or aduan∣ced to the highest Office663. of . Many▪Consul∣ship. Frater pa∣truelis. yeeres after, out of the same familie, Lucius Caesar, son of Sextus and cosi Germane to that C. Iulius Caesar, who beg at the Dictator, and attained only to the , who also died at Psae without any evident sicknesse, euen as he did his shoes  in a morning, that L. Caesar I say, came to be Consull. Well. Caesar the Dictator was borne at Rome (when Caius Marcius and Lucius Valerius Flaccus were Consuls) vpon the fourth day before the Ides of Quintilis, which moneth after his death, was by vertue of the Lavv Antonia called for that cause, Iulie, His bringing up hee had vvith his mother Aurelia, daughter of Caius Cotta, and his aunt by the fathers side Iulia, the vvife of Mar. Whereupon grevv the love that he tooke (a Petritian though he vvere) to the  Fation; and the hatred he bare to Sulla. The Greeke and Latine tongue, the precepts also   of Oratorie, e learned of M. Antnius Gupho, a French man borne.

THE HISTORIE OF Caius Iulius Cesar Dictator, written by Caius Suetonius Tranquil∣lus. CAESAR in the sixteenth yeare of his age, lost his (a) Father:CHAP. 1. A. V. C. 670. and in the Sequentibus Coss.

Certaine it is, that SVLLA, when he had denied a good while the re∣quest of those right worshipfull persons, and his singular good friends intreating in his behalfe, and yet they persisted earnest suiters still for him, being thus im∣portuned and at length overcome, brake forth aloud into these words, either in a Diuine prescience, or some pregnant coniecture, Goe to (quoth hee) my Mrs: Take him to you, since yee will needes have it so: but know this withall; that he whose life and safety yee so much desire, will one day be the overthrow of the Nobles, whose side yee have maintained with mee▪ For in this CAESAR there be many MARII.

THERMVS the Pretour: By whom being sent into Bithynia for to levie a Fleet, he made his aboade with K. NICOMEDES: not without a foule rumour raised, that he prostituted his bodie to be abused by the King. which rumour he augmented himselfe, by comming againe into Bi∣thynia within fewe dayes, vnder a colour of calling for certaine money, which should be due to a (b) Libertine and (c) Client of his. The rest of his soulderie he caried with better fame and reputation: and at the winning of MITYLENAE, THERMVS honored him with a (a) Civike guirland. HE was a Souldiour also vnder SERVILIVS ISAVRICVS in Cilicia, but it3. was not long: For vpon certaine intelligence given of SVLLA his death, and theA. V. C 676. hope withall of the new dissention that was stirred & set on foote by M. (a) LE∣PIDVS, he returned in all hast to Rome. And notwithstanding hee was mightily solicited by many large offers and faire promises, yet forbare he to ioyne in so∣cietie with LEPIDVS, partly distrusting his Surnamed so of the people in Cilicia na∣med auri, whom he sub∣dued. nature, and in part doubting the present oportunitie, which he found nothing answerable to his expectation. HOVVBEIT when that ciuill discord and sedition was (a) appeased, hee judici∣ally4. accused for So variable and indiscreet extortion CORNELIVS DOLOBELLA, a man who had beene Consull, and triumphed.

After this upon the pay∣ment vnto them of L. talents being set a shoare, he delayed no time, but present∣ly put his Fleet to Sea againe, embarked, and never gave over pursuing the said Pirates, vntill he had over-taken them: and no sooner were they within his po∣wer, but as hee often times had threatned in mirth, hee put them all to death. Now whiles MITHRIDATES wasted the Countries next adjoyning, because he would not be thought to sit still & doo nothing in this dangerous & doubtful state of confederate Nations and Allies to the Romaines, he left Rhodes whether
he had directly bent his course, gathered a power of Auxiliarie Souldiers, expel∣led the Governour under the King out of the Province, and so kept the Cities and States in their alleageance, which were wavering and at the point to re∣volt. IN his Militarie (a) tribuneship, which was the first dignitie after his returne5. to Rome, that befell vnto him by the voyces and election of the people, hee as∣sisted with all his might C. Cota▪ M. Crass, & C. Pompeus. who were the chiefe. those Patrones of the Commons, who stoode out for the restitution of their Tribunes authoritie; the force and strength where∣of SVLLA had abated. Hee effected moreouer thus much, by vertue of an Act proposed by A Tribune of the Com∣mons. PLOTIVS, that L. CINNA his wiues brother, that they, who together with him in the time of the ciuill discord aboue-saide, tooke part with LEPIDVS, and after the Lepidus. Consuls death, fled vnto Sertorius, might returne safely into the Citie, and enjoy their freedome. As touching which matter, himselfe made an Oration before the body of the people. BEING Treasurer. Questour hee made as the auncient manner was Funerall Orati∣ons6. out of the publique Pulpit called Rostra, in the praise of IVLIA his Aunt by the Fathers side, and of his wife CORNELIA, both late deceased. And in the commendation verily of his said Aunt, speaking of the pedigree and descent by both sides, namely of her selfe, and also of her Father, hee maketh report in these termes: Mine Aunt IVLIA (quoth he) by her Mother is lineally descended from Kings, and by her Father vnited with the race of the immortall Gods: For, from Ancus Marcius are derived the Marcij surnamed Reges, id est▪ Kings, which name my Mo∣ther was stiled with: and from VENVS the IVLII draw their originall of which house and name is our familie. So then, in this stock there concur and meete together, as well the sanctitie and sacred Maiestie of Kings, who among men are most powerfull, as the religious Caeremonies and seruice of the Gods, in whose power Kings themselues are. In the place of CORNELIA departed, hee wedded POMPEIA, daughter of Q. POMPEIVS, and Neece to L. SVLLA. But her afterward hee divorced, su∣specting that she had beene naught with P. CLODIVS, of whom there went so constant a report abroade, how at the celebration of certaine publique Divine ceremonies, he being disguised in womans aparel had accesse secretly unto her, that the Senate by Decree directed a Commission to Iustices Inquisitours, for to sit upon the pollution of those sacred Rites and Of the God∣desse Bona▪ which wee ce∣lebrated in Cae∣sars house, be∣ing the Ponti∣ex.

C. Phlip. 5. yeeres, wherein ALEXANDER had conquered the whole world, hee presently made earnest suite for his discharge and licence to depart, thereby to take the first oportunitie of all occasions to compasse greater enterprizes at home within the Citie: and being moreover much disquieted and dismayed with a dreame the night before (for he imagined in his sleepe that he had carnall company with his owne Mother) the Divinours and Wizards incited him to the hopes of most glorious atchievements, making this exposition of his dreame, that thereby was portended unto him the Sove∣raigntie
of the whole world, considering that his Mother whom hee saw under him betokened nought else but the subjection of the earth, which is counted the Mother of all things. DEPARTING therefore thence before his time was fully expired, hee went8. unto the (a) Latine Colonies, which were now devising and in counsell to sue for the freedome of the Citie of Rome, and no doubt had solicited and excited them to attempt some tumult and trouble in the State, but that the Consuls for the avoiding of this very dunger, kept back the Legions for a while which were enrolled for to be sent into Cilicia. AND yet for all that, soone after he projected greater designes within the Ci∣tie.9. For, not many daies before he entred upon his Aedileship, suspected he wasA. V. C. 688. to have conspired with M. CRASSVS (That had been Consul. a man of Consular degree) with P. SVL∣LA likewise and Or L. rather. P. ANTRONIVS, (who after they were Consuls elect stoode condemned for suing indirectly and by corruption for that place) to set upon the body of the Senate in the beginning of their yeare; and that after they had mas∣sacred whom it pleased them, M. CRASSVS should usurpe the Dictatourship; himselfe be chosen by him Maister of the Horsemen: and so when they had set∣led the State at their pleasure, SVLLA and ANTRONIVS should be restored a∣gaine unto their Conslship. Of this conspiracie, TANVSIVS GEMINVS ma∣keth mention in his Storie, M. BIBVLVS in his Edicts and C. CVRIO the Father in his Orations. CICERO likewise seemeth to signifie as much in a certaine E∣pistle unto AXIVS wherein hee reporteth that CAESAR established in his Con∣sulship that Kingdome and roiall government, which he plotted and thought up∣on when hee was Aedile. TANVSIVS writeth farther, that CRASSVS either repenting himselfe, or else upon feare, was not present nor kept the day appoin∣ted for the said massacre▪ and therefore CAESAR neither gave that signall which by agreement hee should have given. Now agreed it was as CVRIO saith, that he should let his gowne fall from his shoulders. The same CVRIO yea and M. ARTORIVS NASO doo write, that he conspired also with CN. PISO ano∣ble young Gentleman, who being in suspition for a conspiracie within the Ci∣tie, had the Province of Spaine extraordinarily and without his owne suite besto∣wed upon him: and complotted it was, that both hee in forraine parts abroade* Who was slaine by Spa∣nish Horse∣men, of whom hee had the conduct. and himselfe also at Rome should at once make an insurrection for to alter the State; and that, by the occasion and meanes of the So called of a riuer, neere into which they dwelt beyond the Po.

As for the chasing and baiting of wilde beasts, the Stage plaies & solemne sights, he exhibited thē both jointly with his cōpa∣nion in Office, and also severally by himselfe. Whereby it came to passe, that howsoever the charges of these Solemnities were borne in commune by them both, yet he alone went away with all the honour and thanke thereof: Neither did M. BIBVLVS his Colleague dissimule the matter, but utter as much, when
he said that the same befell unto him which unto POLLVX: For like as (quoth he) the Temple erected in the Common Market place of Rome unto Geminis fra∣ribus, that is, Costor and Pol∣lux, who com∣monly be cal∣led Gemini fra∣tres both the Twin-brethren, beareth the name of CASTOR alone: even so my munificence in expence and CAESARS together in setting out these games and plaies, goeth under the name of CAESAR onely.

Wherein, consi∣dering how deepely hee engaged himselfe in debt, the same morning that hee was to goe unto the assemblie for the Election, when his Mother * kissed him he told her (by report) afore-hand, that he would never returne home but Pon∣tife. And so farre overweighed he (a) two most mightie Competitours, who o∣therwise for age and dignitie much outwent him, that in their owne Tribes hee alone caried more voices, than both of them in all * throughout.

And verily prevailed hee had, and gone cleare away with it (for many there were alreadie drawne to his side, and among the rest, Quintus Ci∣cero CICERO M. Cicero. the Consuls brother) but that a speech made by M. CATO emboldened the whole house, and confirmed all the Senatours in their former sentence, who now were at the point to yeeld unto him. And yet for all this, he ceased not to hinder their proceedings, untill such time as a troupe of Romaine Knights, who stood round about the place in Armes for Of Consul and Senate guard and defence, threatned to dispatch him out of the way, in case hee continued still in his obstinate contumacie, holding and shaking their drawne Swords so neere unto him, as that his next fellowes forsooke him as he sate with them, and very few taking him in their armes and putting their Plutarch na∣meth Curio for one of them Gownes betweene, hardly and with much a doo saved him from violence.

Pompeius. another▪ But not able to match the Nobles and better sort, nor to make his part good with them drawing in one line, as they did, whom hee sawe in great fre∣quencie to runne by heapes together, so fully bent to mae resistance, that pre∣sently they left their officious attendance upon the new Consuls, hee gave over this action. BVT, whereas CECILIVS METELLVS Surnamed Nepos (as Vae∣rius witnesseth) for his riotous life and beha viour. a Tribune of the Commons, pro∣posed16 most turbulent and seditious Lawes, malgre his Colleagues with all their opposition, he shewed himselfe a stout ab better and maintainer of him: most stifly bearing him out in the cause, so long untill both of them were by an in∣junction and decree of the Senatours remooved from the administration of the Common wealth. Howbeit presuming neverthelesse to continue in his magi∣stracie, and to execute his jurisdiction, when he understood once that some were ready to prohibite him by force and Armes, hee sent away his Serjeants, cast off his (e) embrodered purple Robe, and retired privly to his owne house, mind∣ing there to keepe himselfe quiet in regard of the troublesome time. And when two daies after, the multitude flocked unto him willingly and of their owne ac∣cord, promising after a very tumultuous manner their helpe and assistance in the recoverie of his former place and dignitie, he repressed them. Which thing hap∣pening thus beyond all expectation, The Senate which was hastily met toge∣ther about that riot and uprore, gave him hartie thankes; and that by the prin∣cipall and noblest personages among them, sent for him into the (f) Curia, and
after they had in most honourable termes commended him, they restored him fully to his Office, and reversed their former Decree. HE fell againe into another newe trouble and daunger, being called into17. question as one of CATILINES conspiracie, both before the Questor NOVIVS NIGER in his house, and that by L. VETTIVS Indice, some reade Indice, that is, as if In∣dex were his surname. who appeached him; and also in the Senate▪ by P. CVRIVS: unto whom for that he detected first, the plots & de∣signments of the Conspiratours, were rewards appointed by the State. CVRIVS deposed that he knew so much by CATTILINE: and VETTIVS promised to bring forth even his owne hand-writing which he gave unto CATILINE: But this was such an indignitie as CAESAR in no wise thought tollerable; whereup∣on, craving the testimonie of CICERO by which he proved, that himselfe mere∣ly of his owne accord had given some information unto him of the said Conspi∣racie, e prevailed so much that CVRIVS went without those rewards. As for VETTIVS, after his goods were arrested and stresses taken, his houshold-stuffe rifled, himselfe evill entreated, beaten, and in the open assemblie of the multitude even before the ROSTRA wel-neere pulled in peeces, him he clapt up in prison. After the same sort he served NOVIVS the Questour, because hee suffered him, (g) a superiour Magistrate of State, to be accused and defamed in his house. Ex praetura whereby it ap∣peareth he was Praetor Viba. AFTER this Pretourship of his, having the Government of the farther18. Province in Spaine allotted unto him, hee tooke order with his Creditours (thatA. V. C. 69. were in hand to stay him) by the meanes of certaine (a) sureties who came in and undertooke for him: and before the Governours of the Provinces were dis∣posed-of by the State, with Commissions sealed for their jurisdiction and other affaires, with allowance and furniture also set out for them accordingly, he con∣trarie to all right and custome put himselfe in his journey: were it for feare of some judiciall proceeding intended against him whiles he was a private person, or because he might more speedily succour the Allies of the Romaines, who cra∣ved helpe, it is uncertaine. Well, when he had setled the Province in peace, he made as great hast to be gone▪ and not expecting a Successour hee departed, as well to ride in Triumph as to take upon him the Consulship. But after the Writs and Proclamations were out for the great Assemblie to Election (ofA V. C 695. Consuls) when he might not be pricked nor propounded (Consull) unlesse hee entred the Citie in qualitie of a private Citizen, and Cato, and his followers. many withstoode him la∣bouring as he did to be dispensed-with for the Lawes, forced he was for feare of being put by the Consulship to forgoe (b) his triumph. OF the two Competitours with him for the Consulship, to wit, L. LV∣CEIVS19 and M. BIBVLVS, hee made choise of LVCEIVS to be his Compani∣on in Office; vpon this compact and condition, That since hee was a man not so gracious, but better monied than himselfe, he should of his owne purse pro∣nounce in the name of both, & promise to deale monies among the Centuries. Which devise being known the Optimates. Nobles and great men who were afraide, that being once a soueraigne Consull. Magistrate, & hauing a collegue ready at his beck to agree & consent with him, he would both dare & do any thing; perswaded with BIBVLVS to make promise of as great a Donation as the other did: and the most part of them contributed their monies thereunto. Yea, CATO himselfe verily was not against it, but saide, This Largesse stoode with the good of the weale
publique. Heereupon created Consul hee was with BIBVLVS. For the same cause, the saide Nobles and principall persons of the Citie gaue order, that the Consuls for this yeere following, should haue (b) the Prouinces and Commissi∣ons of least affaire and importance, to wit, the looking vnto Forrests & Woods, vnto Lanes and Pathes. CAESAR taking this wrong and disgrace most to the heart, made court all that euer he could vnto CN. POMPEIVS, who had taken offence against the Senatours, for that hauing vanquished K MITHRIDATES, his Acts and Decrees were no sooner ratified and confirmed. He reconciled al∣so vnto POMPEIVS, M. CRASSVS, an olde enemie ever since that Consulship, which they bare together with exceeding much jarring and disagreement: Hee entred likewise into a Societie with them both, vpon this contract, That nothing should be done or passe in the administration of the Common-weale, that dis∣pleased any of them three. WHEN he was entred into this Honourable place of Consulship; hee (first20 of all that ever were) ordained, That all Acts, as well of Senate as People shouldA. V. C. 695. day by day as they (a) were concluded, bee recorded also and published. Hee brought-in likewise the ancient custome againe, that in what (b) moneth hee had not the Knitches of rods with Axes borne before him, a publique Officer called ACCENSVS should huiser him before, and the Serjeants or Lictours follow after behinde. Hauing promulged the Lawe Agraria, as touching the division of Lands among the Commons, when his fellowe Consull with∣stoode and resisted his proceedings, hee drave him out of the Common-place, by violence and force of Armes. The morrow after, when the saide BIBVLVS had made his complaint in the Senate of this outrage, and there would not one be found that durst move the house about so great a garboile and hurlibur∣ly as that was, nor give his censure thereof (as often times in lighter Turbis alias culp, that is, Trespasses or offences. tumults and stirres there had passed many Decrees) hee drave him to such a desperate feare, that untill hee went quite out of his magistracie, hee kept close with∣in house and never prohibited , by pronoun∣cing out of the Augurs lear∣ning, that the day was nefatus & non comiti∣alis, that is no Law-day. any proceedings else, but by way of Per edicta, some read, per list es, that is, by his Sernts and Officers. E∣dict. From that time forward, CAESAR alone managed all the affaires of State, even as hee would himselfe: in so much as diuers Citizens pleasantly conceited, when so euer they signed, subscribed, or dated any writings to stand vpon record, would merily put it downe thus, Such a thing was done, not when CAESAR and BIBVLVS, but when IVLIVS and CAESAR were Consuls: setting downe one and the same man twice, by his name and surname: yea, and soone after, these verses were commonly currant abroad, Non Bibulo, quidquam nuper, sed Caesare, factum est: Nam Bibulo fieri Consule, nil memini. CAESAR of late did many things, but BIBVLVS not one: For nought by Consul BIBVLVS, can I remember done. The Stellat champian fields held consecrated & religious by our Auncestors, together with the Campane territorie reserued to yeeld rent and pay tribute for a Subsidie to the Common-weale, hee divided without casting At the discre∣tion of x. men dputed Com∣missioners for that purpo. lots, among

The Pub∣licanes making request for some For that they had takē things at too high a rate. easement hee relieued, by striking of a third part of their rents, and warned them openly, that in the setting and letting of the new commodities and renenues of the Citie, they should not bid and offer too much. All other things likewise he gaue and graunted, according as euery mans mind and desire stood thereto, and no man gaine-said him: but, went any about to thwart him, he was soone frighted away. M. CATO, when hee seemed to in∣terrupt and stop his proceedings, hee caused to be haled violently out of the Se∣nate house by an Officer, and committed to prison. As L. LVCVLLVS stoutly withstood his doings, he put him into so great a feare of sundry Actions and cri∣minations, that hee was glad to come and fall downe before him at his knees. When CICERO pleading vpon a time in Court, had lamented the wofull state of those times: the very same day, at the Three a clock in the after-noone. ninth houre thereof, hee brought P. CLODIVS his enemie to be adopted into the house and name of a Commo∣ner; one who long before had laboured in vaine to goe from the Nobles, and be incorporate among the Commons. Last of all, it is credibly reported, that he induced by rewards, against all those in generall of the contrary faction, Indicē, others read Iudic m id est Vettius Iudex. an appeacher, to professe that he was sollicited by some for to murder POMPEIVS;* L.

ABOVT the same time, hee tooke to wife CALPVRNIA the daughter of L.21. PISO, who was to succeede him in the Consulate; and affianced hiw owne daughter IVLIA vnto CN. POMPEIVS, rejecting and casting off her for∣mer spouse Whom hee promised in marriage the daughter of Cn. Pompeius. SERVILIVS CAEPIO, by whose helpe especially a little before, he had impugned BIBVLVS. After this new contracted affinitie, hee began (in Counsell) to aske (a) POMPEIVS opinion first; whereas before, hee was wont to begin with CRASSVS: notwithstanding also the custome was, that the Con∣sul should observe that order all the yeere following, in asking the Senatours sentences, which he began with, the first day of Ianuarie. BEING backed therefore by the favour and assistance of his wives Piso▪ Father22. and Cn. Pompeius. Sonne in Law, out of all that choice of Provinces hee chose especially the Gaules, the wealth and commoditie whereof might fit his hand, and mini∣ster matter sufficient of (a) triumphs. And verily at the first by vertue of the Law (b) VATINIA he tooke vpon him the gouernment of (c) GALLIA CISALPINA together with ILLYRICVM. Soone after by the meanes of the Senate, that al∣so which was called (d) COMATA: For, the nobilitie feared, least if they had denied him it, the people would have bestowed the same also vpon him. With joy whereof he grew so haughtie and proud, that he could not hold and temper himselfe, but after some fewe daies make his boast in a frequent Senate house, that he had gotten now what he desired in despite of his aduersaries, and full ore against their wills; and therefore from that time forward, would (e) insult vpon all their heads: whereupon, when one by way of reproach denied that and said, That it was no easie matter for a woman so to doo: he answered againe, as
it were alluding merily to another sence, That, euen in Assyria there some time raigned Queene SEMIRAMIS: and that the women named (f) Amazones held in times past a great part of Asia in subjection. WHEN hee had borne his Consulship, C. MEMMIVS and L. DOMITIVS23 Pretours for the time beingvvhether they should be re∣pealed or stand in force., put to question his Acts passed the former yeere:A V. C 696. wherevpon hee referred the examination and censure thereof unto the body of the Senate but seeing they would not undertae the thing, after three daies spent to no purpose in vaine brables and altercacions, he departed into his Province. And immediatly hisWhen he was Consul. Questour (a) for to prejudice him, was drawne into trou∣ble & indited upon certaine crimes. Within a while himselfe also was brought judicially to his triall, and accused by L. ANTISTIVS a Tribune of the COM∣MONS: but by appealing unto the Colledge of the Tribunes, hee prevailed through their favour thus much (in regard of his absence about the affaires of Common-weale) that he should not be liable to the accusation. For his better securitie therefore against future times, he travailed much to obligue and make beholden unto him the Magistrates every yeare: and of those Competitours who sued for any honourable Office, to helpe or suffer none other to come unto the place, but such as covenanted with him, and undertooke to defend & main∣taineFor that hee was extraordi∣narily absent, longer than the Law Sempronia did permit. him in his absence. For assurance of which their covenant, he stuck not to require of some an oath, yea, and a bill of their owne hands. BVT when L. DOMITIVS a (a) Candidate for the Consulship threatned o∣penly,24. that were he once Consul, he would effect that which he could not whileA. V. C. 698. he was Pretour, yea, and take from him his Armies, hee made meanes to draw CRASSVS and POMPEIVS unto Luca a Citie within his Province: with whom hee dealt effectually, that for to give DOMITIVS the repuise, they should both sue for themselues to be Consuls the second time, and also labour that his go∣vernment might be prorogued or continued for five yeares longer; and he effe∣cted both. Vpon this confidence hee presumed to assume unto those Legions which hee had received from the State, others beside, maintained partly at the Cities charges, and in part with his owne private purse. And one Legion aboue the rest, enrolled from out of the Countries beyond the Alpes, hee termed by a French word, For named it wasThe bird Ga∣lerita or Cassita, so called of a crest, upon the head. This Le∣gion it should seeme ware Pumes of fea∣thers in their crests of Hel∣mets, where∣upon it tooke that name. Alauda. Which, being trained in militarie discipline, armed also and set out after the Romaine fashion, hee afterwards en∣franchized throughout and made free of Rome. Neither from this time forward forbare he any occasion of warre, were it never so unjust or dangerous: picking quarrels as well with confederate Nations, as those that were enemies, savage and barbarous; whom he provoked to take Armes: in so much as the Senate one time decreed▪ to send certaine Embassadours for to survay & visite the state of the Gaules: yea, and someNamely Cato, Plutarch. were of opinion, that he shovld be delivered unto the enemies hands. But by reason that his affaires sped well and had good suc∣cesse, hee obtained in regard thereof solemne Supplications both oftner, and to hold more daies than ever any man did (before himselfe.) DVRING the time of his (provinciall) gouernment, which continued nine25. yeares space, these, in manner, were the Acts which hee performed. All that part of Gaule, which from the Forrest and Mountaine Pyrenaeus, the Alpes, and the hill Gebena, is enclosed within the Rivers Rhene and Rhosne, contai∣ning in circuit 3200. miles, not accounting the associate Cities and States
well of the people of Rome, hee reduced into the forme of a Province, and im∣posed upon them a payment of tribute yeerely. The Germanes inhabiting be∣yond the Rhene, he of all the Romaines first assailed by meanes of a bridge which he built over the said River, and those he grievously plagued and gave them ma∣nie great overthrowes. He set upon the Britaines also, a people before time un∣knowne, whom hee vanquished and compelled both to pay money, and also to deliver hostages. In so many prosperous battailes and fortunate exploits, he ta∣sted of adverse fortune thrice onely & no more: once in Britaine, when his Fleete had like to have beene lost and cast away in a violent tempest: a second time in Gaule, where a Legion of his was discomfited and put to flight, neare unto Ger∣gova: and last of all, in the marches of Germanie, when TITVRIVS and AVRVN∣CVLEIVS his Lievtenants were forlayed by an ambush and put to the sword. WITHIN the compasse of which very same time, hee lost by death, first, his26 Aurelia a Dame of sin∣gular chastitie Mother, then his daughter (IVLIA) and not long after hisneptem, alij ne∣potem, that is, Nephew. Neece by the saidA. V. C. 700. daughter. And in this meane while, the Common-wealth being much troubled and astomed at the murder of CLODIVS,By Milo when the Senate thought good there should be but one Consul created, namely CN. POMPEIVS, hee dealt with the Tribunes of the Commons (who intended that hee should be the Colleague in Office with POMPEIVS) to propose this rather unto the People, That they would grant leave unto him in his absence, whensoever the terme of his govern∣ment drew toward an end, to sue for his second Consulship: because he might not be constrained upon that occasion, and whiles the warre was yet unfinished, to depart out of his Province. Which whē he had once obtained at their hands, reaching now at higher matters, and full of hopes, there was no kind of largesse, no manner of dutifull Office either in publique to the whole Citie, or privately unto any person that he omitted and left undone. His FORVM or stately Hall he began to build with the money raised of the spoiles gotten in warres: the very plot of ground whereon it should stand, cost himThat is, a hundred milli∣ans of Sester∣ces, and 20, as Pme writeth, lib 36 Cap. 15. if Gareanus readeth truly, Millies aucen∣tis. Millies sestertium and above. He pronounced also a solemne Sword-fight and Feast unto the people, in the ho∣nour and memoriall of his Daughter, a thing that never any man did before him. And to cause an expectation of these solemnities in the highest degree, the vi∣ands & whatsoever pertained unto the feast, albeit he had agreed with Btchers and Victualers for the same at a certaine price, he provided neverthelesse by his Domestica∣tim. houshold-servants. All the notable and well knowne sword players, when and wheresoever they fought so, as upon the mislike and displeasure of the beholders they were in danger to be killed in the place at their commaundement, he tooke order and charged they should be had away by force and reserved for himselfe. As for new-Fencers and young beginners, hee trained them neither in any pub∣lique Schoole, nor under professed Mrs: of that Facultie, but at home in private houses, by Gentlemen of Rome, yea, and Senatours also, such as were skilful in their weapon and in feates of Armes praying and beseeching them earnestly (as appeareth in his Epistles unto them) to take the charge of every one severally, and to have a speciall care to instruct each one, and giue them rules in their exer∣cises. The legionarie Souldiours pay in money he doubled for ever. And so of∣ten as there was plenty of corne, hee gave them their allowance of it without stint and measure and other-while he bestowed upon every one a slave or bond∣servant, yea and possessions by the poll.
MOREOVER, to retaine still the bond of acquaintance, affinitie, and good27. will of POMPEIVS, OCTAVIA his sistersSo, hee was great Vnkle unto her▪ like as he was to Octa∣vivs Agustus, the Emperour. Neece wedded unto C. MARCEL∣LVS, hee affianced and made sure unto him: but withall, he craved his daughter to wife, promised in mariage before unto FAUSTUS SULLA. Hauing thus ob∣ligued and brought to his devotion all those about him, yea, & the greater num∣ber of Senatours, by crediting out his money unto them, either gratis, or vpon a slight cōsideration: those also of other sorts & degrees, either invited kindly by himselfe, or resorting unto him of their owne accord, hee gratified with a most magnificent and bounteous (a) congiarie. The freed men besides, yea, and the Servants and Pages belonging to every one, according as any of them were in favour with theirOr Patrone. Lord and Maister, tasted of his liberality. Moreover, there was not a man sued in Court judicially and in danger of the Law; there was not any deepely engaged and endebted unto their Creditours; there were no prodi∣gall young spend-thrifts, but he was their onely supporter, and most readie at all assaies to helpe them: unlesse they were those that either had committed such grievous crimes, or were so low brought, or had been so excessiue in riot, as that they could not possibly be relieved by him. For such as these, hee would say in plaine termes and openly, there was no other remedie but civill warre. No lesse carefull and studious was he to alure unto him the hearts of Kings,28 yea, and whole Provinces throughout the world: unto some, offering in free gift the deliverie of Captives and prisoners by thousands at a time: unto others, sen∣ding aide secretly and under-hand without authoritie or commission of Senate and people, whether and as often as they would: and more than this, adorning with goodly building and excellent peeces of work the mightiest Cities of Italie, Gaule, Spaine, yea, and of Asia and Greece. This he did so long, untill all men now were astonied thereat: and when they cast with themselves whereto this might tend, at last M. CLAVDIVS MARCELLVS the Consul, after a preface and pre∣ambleA. V. C. 703. made to his Edict, namely, That he would speake as touching the maine point of the Common-weale, proposed unto the Senate, That for as much as the warre was now ended, and peace abroad established, there might be one sent to succeede him, before his time was fully expired; also, That the victorious Armie ought of right to bee dismissed and have their discharge from warfare: Item, that in the High Court and assembly for the Consuls election his name should not bee propounded, considering POMPEIVS afterward had anulledi plebisito. that Act of the people (by vertue whereof it was graunted that he might be cho∣sen Consul in his absence.) Now it had fallen out so, that hee making a Law as touching the right of Magistrates, in that Chapter and branch thereof, wherein he disabled those who were absent for being capable of honours and dignities, forgat to except CAESAR: and soone after, when the said Law was once engros∣sed and engraven in brasse, & so laid up in the Treasurie, corrected his error and oversight. Neither was MARCELLVS content to deprive CAESAR of his Pro∣vinces, and to put him by the priviledge of a former Act passed in especiall fa∣vour of him, but he made a motion moreover, that those inhabitants, whom by the Law Vatinia CAESAR had planted in the Colonie of Novocomum, should leese the freedome which they had, as Citizens of Rome: For that this prerogative of theirs had been graunted by ambitious meanes, and beyond that prescript num∣ber which was appointed and warranted by the Decree in that behalfe.
CAESAR highly displeased and troubled at these proceedings, and judging it, (as he was heard by report many times to give out) an harder matter for him a29 principall man of the Citie, to be deposed and thrust downe from the high∣est and first place of degree into the second, than from the second into the low∣est and last of all) withstood him with all his might and power, partly by the opposition and negatiue voice of the Tribunes, and in part by SERVIUS SUL∣PITIUSA. V. C. 904. the other Consull. Also in the yeare following when C. MARCEL∣LUS who succeeded his cousen GERMAIN by the fathers side MARCUS, in the cōsulship▪ assaied to bring the same about, he bribed & made sure vnto him, with a mightie summe of mony, AEMILIUS PAULUS, companion with him in office, and C. CURIO a most violent Tribune▪ to sticke unto him, & defend his honor. But seeing all things carried still against him more obstinately than before, & the new Consuls elect take the contrarie side & bent another way, he wrote unto the Senate, and by his letters humbly besought them, not to suffer the benefit granted unto him by the people to be taken from him: or if they did, yet to giue order that other Generals like wise as well as hee, might leave their Armies: presuming confidently, as men thinke, vpon this, himselfe should be able whēsoeuer he pleased to assemble together his souldiers more easily thē POMPEIUSTO levy new. But with his aduersaries he wold haue treated by way of Capitulation in these termes, that after he had discharged and sent away 8. Legions, and giuen over the prouince of Gaule beyond the Alpes, he might be allowed 2. legiōs with the prouince on this side the Alpes: or if not so, yet atleast wise one, together with ILLYRICUM, vntil such time as he were created cōsul. But perceiuing that the Senate came not betweene nor interposed their au∣thoritie to stop the course intended against him, & his aduersaries denied flatly to admit all manner of capitulating & composition concerning the common∣wealth, he passed into the hither part of Gaule, & having kept the Assizes there and executed his provinciall jurisdiction stayed at Rauenna, with full resolution to be reuenged by open warre, in case there had passed frō the Senat, any sharp and cruell decree, touching the Tribunes of the Commons opposing thēselues in his behalfe, & quarrell: And verily this was the colour and occasion which he pretended of ciuill warre: yet men thinke there were some other causes & motiues thereto. Cn. POMPEIUS was wont to giue out that for as much as CAESAR was not able of himselfe and with his owne priuate wealth, either to consummate and finish those stately workes & aedifices which he had begun, or to satisfie the expectation of the people which he had raised & wrought of his comming, therefore he intended to trouble the state and set all on a garboyle. Others say, that he feared least he should be compelled to giue an accoumpt of those things which in his first Consulship he had done against the sacred Au∣spices, the lawes, and prohibitions of the Tribunes (in the name of the people) considering that M. CATO had threatned and professed eftsoones, & not with∣out an oath, that no sooner should he and his armie be parted, but he would ju∣dicially call his name in question & bring him to his answere: Also for that it was commonly spoken abroad that if he returned ones in qualitie of a priuate person, he should after the example of MILO plead before the iudges, with a guard of armed men about the Court and Tribunall. And this seemeth to bee more probable by that which ASINIUS POLLIO writeth, who reporteth, that in the battaile of Pharsalia, whē he beheld his aduersaries before his face, slaine
and put to flight, he vttered this speech word for word. Loe, this was their own doing: this would they needes haue, And I CAIUS CEASAR after so many worthie exploites atchieved should haue beene a condemned man, had I not craued helpe of mine armie. Some are of opinion, that being so long inured & acquainted with soueraigne command, & weighing his owne puissance & the power of his enemies, in ballāce one against the other, took the occasion & opportunitie to usurpe that absolute dominion, which in the uerie prime of his years he aspired unto; and of this mind, it seemeth CICERO was, who in his 3. book of duties writeth, that CEASAR had alwaies in his mouth, these verses of EURIPIDES . Which CICERO himselfe translated thus. Nam si violandum est ius, imperij gratia Violandum est, alijs rebs pietatem colas. For if thou must do wrong by breach, Of lawes, of right and equitie, Tis best thereby a Crowne to reach, In all things els keepe pietie. When word therefore was brought unto him, that the Tribunes inhibiti∣on31 & negatiue voice was put down, and themselues departed out of the Citie:A▪ V▪ C▪ 705, hauing immediatly sent before certaine Cohorts priuily, because no suspition might arise, he dissimuled the matter, & was present in person to behold a pub∣like Game, viewed, and considered the plotforme according to which he was about to build a Schoole of sword fencers, and according to his usuall manner gaue himselfe to feast & banquet often. After this presently vpon the Sun-set∣ting, he tooke vp certaine Mules from the next Bakersmil-house; set thē in their geires to his wagon, and as closely as possibly he could with a small retinewe and companie about him put himselfe in his Iournie; and when by reason that the lights were gone out, he had lost his way, after he had wandred a long time, at the length meeting with a guide by that time it was day, he passed on foote through most narrow crosse lanes and by-pathes untill he recovered the right way againe. Now when he had ones ouertaken his Cohorts, at the riuer Rubi∣con, which was the utmost bound of his province, he rested & stoode still a little while▪ thē casting in his mind, how great an enterprise he went in hand with, he turned vnto them that were next unto him and said. As yet my maisters wee may well returne backe; but passe we once ouer this little bridge, there will be no dealing but by force of armes and dint of sword. As he thus staied, and stood doubtfull what to doe, a strang sight he chanced to see in this manner. All of a suddaine their appeared vnto him a certaine man of an extraordi∣nary stature & shape withall, sitting hard by, & piping with a reed. Now when beside the shepheards & herdmen many soldiours also from their standing wards ran for to heare him, & among them the Trumpetters likewise, he caught from on of thē a Trum pet, leapt forth to the riuer, & begining with a mightie blast to sound the battaile, kept on his pace to the very bancke, on the otherside. Then CEASAR, Let vs march on quoth he & goe whither the tokēs of the Gods & the iniurious dealings of our enemies call vs. The dice be throwne: I haue set vp my rest. Come what will of it. And thus hauing conueyed his armie ouer the riuer, he ioyned with the Tribunes of the commons, who vpō their expulsion out of the Citie were come vnto him, & in a ful & frequēt assēblie, with shedding teares & rēting his garmēt down the brest, besought3 the faithfull helpe & assistance of his soldiers. It is supposed also that he promised unto every on of thē a knights liuing: which happened upō a vain & false perswasiō, for whē in his speech & exhortatiō unto thē, he shewed euer & a non the (ring▪) finger of his left hand, & therwith auouched & promised for the satisfaction & contentmēt of al those by whose meanes he should maintaine his honour & dignitie, that he would willingly (b) plucke the ring from off his owne finger: those that stood hinmost in the assem∣bly,
who might better see than heare him speak, took that for spoken which they imagined by bare sight, and so the speech went for currant, That hee promised them the dignity of wearing the ring (of gold) together with 400000 (sesterces.) THE order▪ proceeding a final complement of those Acts, which from thence34 forth he atchieved, summarily goeth in this maner. He seized into his hands and held PICENUM, VMBRIA, & HETRURIA. L. DOMITIVS, who in a factious tu∣mult was nominated to be his successor, & kept CORFINIVM with a garison, he subdued & forced to yeeld: and when he had dismissed him, hee marched along the coast of the AdriatickThat is Ve∣nus-gulfe. sea, to Brundis, whether the Consuls & POMPEIVS were fled, intending with all speed to crosse the narrow Seas: whose passage af∣ter he had assaied by all manner of lets to hinder & stop (but in vaine) he turned his journey and took the way directly to Rome. And when he had curteously mo∣ved the Senatours to give him meeting in the Senate house, there to treat & con∣sult T as touching the State of the Common-weale, he set upon the most puissant forces of POMPEIVS, which were in Spaine under the conduct of three Lieute∣nants, M. PETREIVS L. AFFRANIVS & M. VARRO: having given out before among his friends and openly professed, that he was going to an Armie without a (a) Captaine; and would returne from thence to a (b) Captaine without an Ar∣mie. And albeit the besieging of Massilia, which Citie in his journey forward, had shut the gates against him, & exceeding scarcity of corn & victuals was some im∣peachment & stay unto him, yet within a short time he overcame & subdued all. FROM hence having returned to the City (of Rome) againe, & passed over into35. Macedonie, after he had held POMPEIVS besieged for the space wel-neare of 4.A. V. C. 706. moneths, & that within most mighty trenches & strong rampiers, he discomfi∣ted at the last in the Pharsalian battel & put him to flight: and following him hot∣ly in chase as he fled to Alexandria, so soone as he understood that he was slaine, and perceived likewise that King PTOLOMAEVS laid wait for his owne person also, he warred upon him▪ which, to say a truth, was a most difficult & dangerous peece of worke, by reason that he managed it, neither in place indifferent, nor time convenient, but in the very Winter season, and within the walls of a most wealthy & politick enemie, being himselfe in distresse & want of all things, and unprovided besides to fight. Having atchieved the victory, he graunted the king∣domeA. V. C. 707. of Aegypt unto CLEOPATRA & her younger brother, fearing to reduce it into the forme of a Province, least at any time, beeing governed under some L. President of a more stirring spirit & violent nature than others, it might give oc∣casion & yeeld matter of rebellion. From Alexandria he went over into Syria, & so from thence into Pontus, upon the urgent newes as touching PHARNACES; Whom, notwithstanding he was the sonne of that great MITHRIDATES, & ta∣king the opportunitie of the troubles & civill warre among the Romanes, made warre, yea, and now bare himselfe presumptuous and overbold for his manifold victories & great successe, yet within 5 dayes after his arrivall thither, & 4. houres after he came into sight of the enemie, he vanquished and subdued in one onely battaile: eft-soones & oftentimes recounting the felicity of POMPEIVS, whose708. A. V. C. 709. hap it was, to win his principall name for warfare, of so owardly a kinde of ene∣mies. After this, he defeited SCIPIO and IVBA, repairing the reliques of that side in Africk, and the children of POMPEIVS in Spaine. IN all the civill warres, hee sustained no losse or overthrow but by his owne36 Lieutenants: of whom, C. CVRIO was slaine in Affrick: C. ANTONIVS yeel∣ded
himselfe into the hands of his enemies in Illyricum: P. DOLABELLA in the same Illyricum lost his fleete, and CN. DOMITIVS his armie in Pontus. Himselfe fought his battailes alwaies most fortunatly, and never was so much as in any ha∣zard, save only twice: once before Dyrrachium, where being discomfited and put to flight, when he saw that POMPEIVS followed not on in chase, he said of him, That hee knew not how to use a victorie. A second time, in Spaine, at the last battaile that ever he fought, what time, being in great despaire, hee was of mind even to have killed himselfe. HAVING finished all his warres, he rode in 5. triumphs: to wit, when he had37 vanquished SCIPIO, 4. times in one and the same moneth, but certaine daies be∣tweene:A. V. C 708. 709. and once againe, after hee had overcome the children of POMPEIVS. The first and most excellent triumph that hee solemnized, was that over Gaule: then followed the Alexandrine; after it the Pontick; next thereunto the Affrican: and last of all the Spanish: every one set out diversly, with variety of Ordinance, provision and furniture. On the day of his Gaules triumph, as he rode along the A Streete in Rome. Velabrum, he had like to have beene shaken out of his Chariot, by reason that the Axel-tree brake. Hee mounted up into the Capitoll by torch-light, having xl. Elephants on his right hand & left, bearing (a) branches and candlesticks. In his Pontick triumph, among the Pageants and shewes of that pomp, he caused to be caried before him the title & superscription of these three words, Veni, vidi, vi∣ci, I came, I saw, I conquered: signifying, not the acts atchieved by warre, as other* Sicut caetri. Conquerours, but noting his expedition in despatching the warre. THROUGHOUT the Legions of old Souldiers, he gave in the name of pillage,38 unto every footman (over and above the (a) 2000. sestertij, which he had paied at the beginning of the civill tumult) (b)Or rather cena, that is, 20000. 4000. sestertij: and to the horse-men (c)Rather qua∣drag, that is 40000. 24000. a piece. He assigned lands also unto thē, but not lying all together, because none of the owners should be thrust out (of their livings.) Among the people (of Rome) beside x. modij of corne, & as many pints of oyle, he distributed & dealt 300 Sesterces also by the poll, which hee had in times past promised, with an over∣deale of 100. a peece to boote,By which reckoning the proportion to horsemen was double. for time. Hee remitted moreover one yeeres house rent, unto all tenants in Rome, if it amounted to 2000. Sestertij and not a∣bove: but to those in Italie, if the said rent exceeded not 500. Furthermore, hee* That is, for bearing so long. made them a generall great feast, & distributed a dole of raw flesh: yea, and after his victorie in Spaine he gave them 2. dinners: For, deeming the former of them to have beene made niggardly and not beseeming his liberality, he bestowed up∣on them 5. daies after, another, and in most large and plenteous manner. 39 HE exhibited shewes of sundry sorts (as namely) a sword-fight of Fencers at sharpe: hee set forth Stage Plaies likewise in severall quarters and (a) Regions of the Citie throughout, and those verily acted byVieerationē: which as some thinke Porfi, calleth  and is ex∣pounded  where∣upon the Geni∣us of such mer∣riments, is na∣med . A. V. C. 708. x To gratifie all strangers that conflowed to Rome. Plaiers in all languages: Semblably, the solemne games (b) Circenses, hee shewed; and brought foorth Champions also to performe their devoir, and represented a naval-fight. At the saide solemnity of sword-plaiers, there fought to the uttrance in the Mar∣ket place of Rome, FVRIVS LEPTINVS, descended from the race of Pretours, and A. CALPENVS, one who had beene sometime a Senatour, and a pleader of causes at the barre. There daunced the (c) Pyrrhick warlike daunce, the chil∣dren of the Princes and Potentates of Asia and Bithynia. During the Stage plaies aforesaid (d) D. LABERIVS a Gentleman of Rome acted his owne Poem or Enterlude: For which, being rewarded with 500. thousand Sesterces, and a ring
of gold, he passed directly frō the Stage by the (e) Orchestra, to take up his place a∣mong the Knights in the 14. foremost seates. At the Games Circenses, against which the Cirque was enlarged on both sides and moed round about, there drave the Steedes drawing Chariots foure and two together, yea and mounted the vaunting Horses from one to another, the greatest gallants & bravest young Gentlemen of the Nobilitie. The (f) warlike Trojan Game was performed by a two-fold troupe of greater boyes and lesse. The hunting or baiting of wilde beasts was presented five daies together. And the last day of all, there was a fight betweene two battailes of 500. footmen, 20. Elephants, and 30. horsemen on a side, put to skirmish one against the other. For, to the end that they might have more scope to bicker together▪ the (g) goales were taken up and removed: but in steed of them were pitched twoOr Tents▪ Campes confronting one another. As for the (h) Champions above-said, they having a place for to exercise their feats of Activitie set out and built for the present time, strove for the prize or best Game three daies together in the Region of Mars field. To set out the Nauma∣chie or naval battaile, there was a place digged for a great poole, in the lesse (i) Coeta; wherein certaine gallies as well with two ranks of Oares as with three; the ships of Tyros also & of Aegypt encountred, being manned with a great num∣ber of fighting men. To behold these sights and shewes, such a number of peo∣ple resorted from all parts, as most of the strangers either within the streetes of the Citie or in the high waies without, were faine to abide within booths pitch∣ed of purpose: yea, and often-times very many were in the presse crowded and crushed to death; among whom were two Senatours. TVRNIN after this to set the State of the Common-weale in good order,40 he reformed the Kalender, which long since through the Prelates default, by their liberty of interlacing (moneths and daies) at their pleasure, was so confu∣sed, that neither the feastivall holidaies of harvest fell out in Sommer, nor those of the vintage in Autumne. And he framed the whole yeare just unto the course of the Sunne, that it should containe 365. daies; and by abolishing the leape mo∣neth, one (a) day every fourth yeare might be inserted betweene. Now to the end that the computation of the times to come, might from the Calenis Ia∣uxarijs . new Kalends of Ianvarie agree the better, betweene November and Decem∣ber, he put two other moneths. So as, that yeare wherein all this was ordained, had 15. moneths, reckoning the ordinarie interlaced moneth, which by course and custome fell just upon the said yeare. HE made up the full (a) number of the Senatours, and chose unto that place41 According to the Law Ca. new (b) Patritij. The number of Pretours, Aediles, Questors, and of other (c) inferiour Magistrates hee augmented. Such as were displaced and put downe by vertue of the Censors Office, or otherwise by sentence of the Iudges con∣demned for unlawfull briberie, and suing indirectly for any Office, hee re∣stored to their former roomes. In the election of Magistrates he parted with the people thus farre forth; as (excepting the Competitours of the Consulship) for all the number besides of Candidates, the one halfe should be declared those whom the People were disposed to propound, the other halfe, such as him∣selfe would nominate. Which nomination passed by certaine bills sent a∣bout unto the Tribes, in a briefe kind of Writ after this manner: CAESAR DIC∣TATOVR unto this or that Tribe (greeting) I commend unto yov, such an one
and such an one, that by vertue of your voices and suffrages they may have and hold the dignitie they sue for. He admitted unto honorable places the childrenContrary to the Law Corne∣lia. of those who had been proscript and outlawed. He reduced all Iudgements unto two sorts of Iudges, name∣ly of the Knights degree and the Senatours: As for the Tribunes of the Treasurie or cham∣ber of the Citie, which had been the third, he utterlyDisabled thē for being Iud∣ges. abolished. The generall survay and numbering of the people he held, neither after the accustomed (d) manner, nor in the usuall place, but streete by streete, and that by theAs who best knew the num∣ber of their tennants and inhabitants in their houses. Land-lords & owners of messuages and te∣nements standing together: and whereas 3020000 Citizens (e) received allowance of corne from the State, he brought and reduced them to the number of one hundred & fiftie thousand. And to the end that no new conventicles & riots at any time might arise about this review, he ordained, That every yeare, in the place of those that were deceased, the Pretour should make a new supply and choise by casting lots, out of such as had not beene reckoned and enrolled in the former survey. MOREOVER, when as to the number of 80000. (Romaine) Citizens were bestowed42 in sundry Colonies beyond the Sea; hee made a Law for the more frequent inhabiting of the Citie (of Rome) thus exhausted and dispeopled; That no Citizen above 20. yeares of age, and under 40. (unlesse he were a sworne (f) souldiour to the State, and so bound by his oath) should remaine out of Italie above 3. yeares together: Item, That no Senatours sonne, except hee lodged within the house or Pavilion, or belonged to the (g) familiar triall of a chiefe Magistrate, should travaile (forth of Italie.) Item, That no Grasiars should keep and reteine fewer than a third part of free borne young men, among the keepers of their cattell. All professours of physick at Rome, and teachers of the liberall Arts, he enfranchi∣zed Citizens: that both they themselves might more willingly dwell in the Citie, & others beside desire there to inhabite. As touching money lent out; when he had quite put down the expectation of (h) cancelling debts, (at thing that was often Either by the Tribunes of the Cōmons, or the debters themselves.moved) hee decreed at length; That all debtours should satisfie their Creditours in this manner: Namely by an estimate made of their possessions, according to the worth and value as they purchased them before the civill warre, deducting out of the principall whatsoever had beene paide or set downe in the Obligations for the use: by which condition, the third part wel-neare of the money credited forth, was lost. All the Societies and Colledges, saving those that were of auncient foundation, he dissolved. The penalties of hainous crimes he augmented: And whereas the rich & wealthier sort fell to wickednes so much the sooner, because they wentIn the free State before the Emperors, Citizens of Rome might depart before sentence pro∣nounced, & so avoid with cō∣demnation and losse of goods. into banishment, and saved their whole patrimonies and estates: (i) parricides ther∣fore and wilfull murderers (as CICERO writeth) hee deprived of all their goods; other manslaiers besides he fined with the losse of one halfe. HE ministred Iustice and decided matters in Law, most painfully and with passing great43 severitie. Such as were attaint and convict of (a) extortion, hee removed even from their Senatours place and degree. He brake the mariage of a man that had beene Pretour, ma∣rying a wife presently after two daies that she was divorced and went from a former hus∣band, albeit there was no suspition at all of adulterie and naughtinesse. Hee ordained cu∣stomes and imposts of forraine merchandize. The use of Licters, likewise the wearing of purpleOr scarlet in graine. cloathes and of pearle he tooke away, saving onely in certaine persons and ages, and upon special daies. The Law Sumptuaria, (b) to represse excessive cost in fare, he executed most of any other: And for this purpose, he set certaine Watchmen and Warders in sundry places about the shambles and markets where victuals were sold, to lay hold upon all cates and viands contrarie to the prescript rule of the Law in that behalfe, and to bring the same unto him. Otherwhiles also, he sent secretly his owne Officers & Souldiours, to fetch away such meates our of the very dining Parlors and banquetting roomes, even when they were set upon the bord, if happily they had any way escaped the hands of the foresaid warders. FOR, as concerning his purpose to adorne and beautifie the Citie of Rome with gallant44 works, as also to maintaine & amplifie the Empire, hee had more matters in his head and greater every day than other. Principally his intent and meaning was, to build so stately a temple in the honour of Mars, as the like was no where to be seene; having filled up and laid levell that huge pit, wherin he had exhibited the shew of a Naval battel: & also to erect
an exceeding great Theater, fast adjoyning to the Mount Tarpeis. Itē, to reduce the whole corps of the civill Law to a certaine meane and mediocrity: and out of that huge and diffused number of Lawes, to choose out the best and necessa∣rie points, and those to bring into as few volumes as possibly might be. Item, to erect publiquely the greatest Libraries that he could, as wel of Greeke as Latine Authors: committing unto (a) M. VARRO the charge, both to provide the said books, and also to digest & place them in order. Item to lay the Meeres & Fennie Plashes POMPTINAE drie: to draw & let forth the lake Fucinus: to make a cawsie or high-way, from the Adriatick Sea, by the ridge or side of the Apennine hill, as farre as to the river Tibris, & to digge through the (b) Isthmus. Moreover, to bridle the Dakes who had invaded Pontus and Thracia: and soone after, to make warre upon the Parthians by the way of Armenia the lesse▪ but not to give them battell before he had made (c) triall of them. Amid these purposes and designes, death prevented him. Concerning which, before I enter into speech, it shall not be im∣pertinent to deliver summarily those points which concerne the snape, feature, and proportion of his body: his habite & apparell: his fashions and behaviour: and withall, what may touch both his civill and also his martiall affaires. OF stature he is reported to have beene tall; of complexion white & cleare;45 with limbs well trussed and in good plight; somewhat full faced; his eies black, lively, and quick; also very healthfull, saving that in his latter daies he was given to faint and swoune sodainly; yea, and as he dreamed, to start and be affrighted: twice also in the midst of his martiallInter re ge∣renda vel agen∣das, that is, cum acie ordina∣rt, Plutarch. Whiles he was setting his Ar∣mie in battaile ray. affaires, he was surprized with the () fal∣ling sicknes. About the trimming of his body, he wasOr fantasti∣call. over-curious: so as he would not onely be notted & shaven very precisely, but also have his haire pluc∣ked, in so much as some cast it in his teeth, and twitted him therewith. Moreo∣ver, finding by experience, that the deformity of his bald head was oftentimes subject to the scoffes and scornes of back-biters and slaunderers, hee tooke the same exceedingly to the heart: and therefore he both had usually drawne downe his haire that grew but thin, from the crowne toward his forehead: and also of all honours decreed unto him from the Senate and People, he neither received nor used any more willingly, than the priviledge to weare continually the trium∣phant Lawrel guirland. Men say also▪ that in his apparel he was notedHis attire different from others, or of a new fashion which the Greekes call . for singu∣larity, as who used to goe in his Senatours purple studded robe, trimmed with a jagge or frindge at the sleeve hand: and the same so, as hee never was but girt over it, and that very slack and loose: whereupon, arose (for certaine) that saying of SVLLA, who admonished the Nobles oftentimes, To beware of the boy that went girded so dissolutely. HE dwelt at first in theA Streete i Rome much frequented. Suburra; but after he was high priest, in the streete46 Sacra, in an edifice of the Cities. Many have written, that he was exceedingly ad∣dicted to neatnesse in his house, and sumptuous fare at his Table. The Mannor house which he founded out of the very ground, & with great charges finished in the territorie Nemorensis, because it was not wholly answerable to his minde, he demolished and pulled quite downe: although as yet he was but of meane estate and deepely endebted. Finally, this speech goeth of him, That in his expeditions he caried about with himThe paving tiles of marble &c, whereof such floores are made. pavements of checker worke made of quarels square cut, so as they might be taken asunder, and set againe together. HE made a voyage (as they say) into Britaine, in hope of pearles: and47
otherwhiles, in comparing their bignesse, would with his owne hand peise them to finde their weight. For to get and buy up pretious stones, engraved and chased peeces, Images, and painted Tables of antique worke, he was ever most eager and sharp set. Slaves likewise, if they were any thing fresh and new come, trimly set out with all, and fine, he procured at an exceeding price, such as him∣selfe also was ashamed of: so as he forbad expresly the same should be brought in any of his reckonings and accoumpts. IT is reported of him, that in all the Provinces which he governed, hee fea∣sted48 continually, and furnished two Halls or dining chambers ordinarily; the one, wherein eitherThus Turne∣bus expoundeth it: But it may be meant of the meaner ort of his Cohor, prae oria, who were Sag or pall at: to put a difference betweene them & the persons of better qua ty, who were Toga. Gaules in their warlike habite, or Greeks in their cloakes; the other, in which the gown'd Romaines, together with the more noble and honourable personages of the Provinces sat. The domesticall Discipline of his house hee kept so duly, so precisely, and with such severity, in small matters as well as greater; that hee bound with fetters and yrons his Baker for serving up secretly unto his guests other bread than to himselfe: And a freed man of his owne (whom otherwise he did set very great store by) he put to death, for disho∣nouring by adulterie a Romaine Gentlemans wife, albeit no man made com∣plaint thereof. HIS good name for continencie and cleane life, nothing verily blemished,49 save onely the aboade and inward familiaritie with NICOMEDES: but a foule staine that was, which followed him with shame for ever; yea, and ministred taunting and reproachfull matter unto every man. I omit the notorious verses of CALVUS LICINIVS. ————Bithynia quicquid, EtThat is, K. Nicomedes. paedicator Caesaris, unquam habuit, Looke what it was that Bithyne Land had ever more or lesse; And he that CAESAR did abuse, in filthie wantonnesse. I let passe the invectives and accusatorie actions of DOLABELLA and CVRIO the Father: In which, DOLABELLA for his part, termeth him the Kings Concu∣bine in the Queenes place, and the inner roome of his Licter: and CVRIO▪ nameth him NICOMEEDES hisStabul▪ filth and harlot, yea and the Bithynian Brothel house. Io∣verpasse likewise those Edicts of BIBVLVS, wherein he published his colleague, and made him knowne, by the name of the Bithynian Queene: saying moreover, That before, he had loved the King, and now cast a fansie to the Kingdom At which ve∣rie time, as M. BRVTVS makes report, there was one OCTAVIVS also, a man upon distemperature of his braine given to jest and scoffe over broadly, who in a most frequent assembly, after he had called POMPEIVS, King, saluted him by the name of Queene: C. MEMMIVS likewise layd in his dish, that he stood with the rest of the stale Catamites as Cup-bearer, to serve NICOMEDES with wine at a full feast, where sate at the Table divers Merchants and Occupiers, Citizens of Rome, whose names he putteth downe. But CICERO not conten∣ted herewith, that in certaine Epistles he had written, how by the Guard or Pen∣sioners of the said King beingDeductum, or Euctum, that is, brought out of his owne bed than b nto the kings. conveied into his bed-chamber, hee lay downe upon a bed of gold, arraied in purple: and so the flower of youth and maiden∣head of him, who was descended from (a) Venus, became dfiled and desteind in Bithynia. One time also, as CAESAR in the Senate house pleaded to the cause and in the behalfe of NYSA NICOMEDES his daughter, and therewith rehear∣sed
up the gracious favours that the King had done unto him, Let be (quoth he) these matters I pray you, and away with them, since it is well knowne, both what hee be∣stowed upon you, and also what you gave to him. Finally, in the Triumph over Gaule, his Souldiers among other Sonnets (such as they use to chaunt merily when they followe the (triumphant) Chariot) pronounced also these verses so com∣monly divulged. Gallias Caesar subegit, Nicomedes Caesarem, Ecce Caesar nunc triumphat, qui subegit Gallias; Nicomedes non triumphat, qui (b) subegit Caesarem. CAESAR did subdue the Gaules, and him hath NICOMEDE. Behold, now CAESAR doth triumph, who did the Gaules subdue: But NICOMEDE triumpheth not who CAESAR hath subdu'd. AN opinion there is constantly received; That he was given to carnall plea∣sures,50 and that way spent much: also, that he dishonoured many Dames, and those of noble houses: by name among others, POSTUMIA the wife of SER∣VIVS SVLPITIVS; LOLLIA, wife to A. GABINIVS; TERTVLLA, M. CRASSVS his wife, and MVTIA the wife of CN. POMPEIVS. For, certaine it is, that not onely the Curiones, both Father and Sonne, but many others also re∣proached POMPEIVS; That for whose cause, he had put away his owne wife after she had borne him three children, and whom hee was wont with a deepe sigh and groane to callThat is, A∣dulterer: For that Aegysth committed a∣dultery with Clytemnestra the wife of A∣game. AEGISTHVS; his daughter (I say) afterwards, hee espoused; upon a desire of power and greatnes by that mariage. But above the rest, he cast affection to SER∣VILIA the mother of M. BRVTVS; for whom both in hisProximo, alij let pro, that is, first,  Bibulo. last Consuiship he had bought a pearle that cost him46875. pound sterling, or 150000. Frch crowns▪ according to Budaus. sixe millions of Sesterces: and also unto whom during the civill warre, over and above other free gifts, hee sold in open port sale, faire Lands and most goodly Manors at a very low price: what time verily, when most men mervailed that they went so cheape, CICERO most plea∣santly and conceitedly, That yee may know (quoth hee) shee hath the better penny∣worth in the purchase, (a) Tertia deducta est. For it was thought that SERVILIA was bawd also to her owne daughter TERTIA, and brought her to CAESAR his bed. NEITHER forbare he so much as mens wives in the Provinces where he was51. governour, as appeareth even by this his Distichon, taken up likewise by his Soul∣diours at the Gaule Triumph. (a) Vrbani, servate uxores; moechum calvum ad ducimus, Auro in Gallia stuprum emisti, hic sumpsisti mutvm. HE was enamoured also upon Queenes, and among them he loved EVNO,52. the Moore, wife of BOGUDES (King of Mauritania) upon whō, as also upon her husband, he bestowed very many gifts and of infinite value, as NASO hath left in writing: but most especially hee fancied CLEOPATRAOf which the Aegyptians Kings had al∣waie ready rigged 800 as Appian writeth. For, with her, hee both sate up many times and feasted all night long even untill the breake of day; and also in the same Barge or Galley called Thalamegos, had passed into Aegypt, almost as farre as to Aethiopia, but that his Armie refused to followe: and in the end having trained her into the Citie of Rome, he sent her back againe, not with∣out exceeding great honours, and enriched with many rewards: yea, and suffe∣red her to call the sonne she bare, after his owneThat is Pto∣lomaeus Caes. name. Whom verily, some Greek writers have recorded, to have been very like unto CAESAR both in shape
and also in Incessu, in his gang or man∣ner of going. gate: And M. ANTONIVS avouched unto the Senate, that by the same resemblance he knew him to be his sonne: averring withall, That C. MA∣TIVS, CAIVS OPPIVS & the rest of CAESARS friends knew as much. Of whō, C. OPPIVS (as if the thing were so pregnant, that it required some Apologie & defence) put forth a book entituled thus: TAAT HE WAS NOT CAESARS SONNE, WHOM CLEOPATRA FATHERED VPON HIM. HELVIUS CIN∣NA, a Tribune of the Com confessed unto many persons, That hee had a Law drawne out in writing & in readines, which CAESAR being absent himselfe cō∣maunded him to propose, to this effect, That it might be lawfull for him to marrie Quas et quot, ducere llet, even an Alien. what wives and as For other wise,  was unlawfull. And Antnius was the first Romaine that had two wives at once. many as he would for to get children upon. And that no man need at all to doubt how infamous he was, both for (b) uncleannesse of body against kinde, and also for adulteries, CVRIO the Father in a certaine Oration calleth him a woman for all men, and a man for all women.

What should a man
say more? which of all there Oratours that practised nothing else but Oratorie, will you preferre before this CAESAR? who is there in sentences either quicker or com∣ming thicker? who for words, yeelded more gallant or more elegant? Hee seemeth whiles he was yet but young, to haue followed that forme of eloquence one∣ly, which STRABO CAESAR professed: out of whose Oration also intitu∣led, Pro Sardis; he transferred some sentences, worde for word, into his owne; called Diuinatio. It is said, that in his Take it ge rally for the whole Actio Pronunciation, he used an high and shrill voyce; an ardent motion; and earnest gesture, not without a lovely grace.

For in certaine copies I find that it had not so much as this Inscription, Pro METELLO: but Which he wrote for, or  Metellu. quam scrip∣sit METELLO: being (as it is indeede) a speech comming from the person of CAESAR, cleering METELLVS and himselfe, against the criminations and slaunders of common backebiters to them both. The Oration likewise, Orat,  Mi.

Neither held he off, and detracted fight, but in his latter daves: being then of this opinion that the oftener he had gotten victorie, the lesse he was to venture and make tryall of fortune; Also, That a victorie could gaine him nothing so much, as some disasterous calamitie might take from him. No e∣nemie put he ever to flight, but he discamped him and draue him out of the field. By this meanes he gave them whom hee had once discomfited, no time to be thinke themselues. In any doubtfull and dangerous service, his manner was to send away the horses, and his owne with the first: to the ende, that when all meanes of flight were gone, they might of necessitie be forced the ra∣ther to stand to it and abide to the last. The horse he used to ride upon was strangly marked, with feete resembling61 verie neere a mans, and the houes cloven like toes, which horse was foaled a∣bout home: and when the Soothsayers of their learning had pronounced; that he presaged unto his owner the Empire of the whole world, verie carefull hee was to reare him and nourish him. Now when as the beast would abide no man els to ride him, himselfe was he that backed him first. The full pourtraict and proportion of which horse, he dedicated also afterwards before the Temple of Venus (a) Genitrix. Many a time himselfe alone renued the battaile when it was discomfited,62 stāding in their way that fled & holding thē one by one backe: yea & by wrea∣thing their throats he turned them againe vpō the enemies.

Of his constant resolution these be no lesse tokens, if not greater (which I shall now reherse).

At Alexandria being busie about the assault and winning of a bridge where64 by a sodaine sallie of the enemies he was driven, to take a boat, & many besides made hast to get into the same, he lept into the sea, and by swimming almost a quarter of a mile recouered cleare the next ship: bearing up his left hand all the while, for feare the writings which he held therein should take wet, and draw∣ing his rich coate (a) armour after him by the teeth, because the enemie should not haue it as a spoyle.

For he awed and chastised them not in all places nor at all times: but only when the enemie was very neere at hand: and then especially was he most severe, and precise in exacting and executing of discipline: in so much as hee would not give thē warning of the time; either of journey or of battaile, but kept thē rea∣die, intentive & prest to be ed forth vpō a suddaine, everie minute of an houre, whether soeuer he wold; this did he also many times without any cause, especi∣ally upō rainie daies & festivals.

And thus upon a time, when the expectation of IVBA his comming was terrible, he called his soldiers togither: and in a publike speech unto them.

As touching his soldiers trespasses and delinquencies, he neither obser∣ued and tooke knowledge of them all, nor yet punished them fully to the67 Pro modo, , pro more. . after the manner of militarie dis∣cipline. proportion. But as he made streight inquisition after those who trayterously forsooke their colours, and were mutinous, and proceeded against them with rigour so, at others he would winke. Sometimes also, after a great battaile and victorie obtained, he released them all of militarie duties; permitting them in all licentiousnesse to roist and royot wantonly here and there: beeing wont to giue it out, That his souldiers (perfumed though they were with Odours: and be∣smeered with sweete oyles) could fight valiantly. Neither called he them in his publike oration, plaine soldiours, but by a more pleasing name, Fellow∣soldiers. Furthermore he maintained them so trim and braue, that he stucke not to set them out in polished armour, damasked with filuer and gold: as well for goodly shewe, as because they should in battaile take better hold and keepe the same more surely for feare of damage and losse.

Moreouer, being now be∣come Emperour & Lord of all some of them he aduanced euen frō the lowest degree unto the highest place of honour.

That if he had vsed the helpe of robbers by the high∣way side of cutters and swasbucklers in maintaining of his owne dignitie; he would not faile but requite them and be thankefull euen to such. He never entertained malice & hatred against any man so deepely but wil∣ling73 he was to lay downe the same upon occasion offered. Notwithstanding, C. MEMMIVS had made most bitter invectives against him, and hee againe written unto him as bitterly, yet soone after when the said MEMMIVS stoode for the Consulship, hee friended him all that he could with his good word and procured him voyces. When C. CALVUS after certaine Libels and de∣famatorie Epigrams against him, dealt by the mediation of friendes for a re∣conciliation, he of his owne accord wrote first unto him.

Because I deeme, quoth he, that those of my house ought to be cleere as well of suspition as of crime: The moderatiō & clemencie which he shewed as well in the menaging of the75 ciuil war, as in his victorie, was admirable: Whē POMPEIVS denounced in mi∣natory terms, that he would reckē him for an enenemie, whosoeuer he was, that failed to maintaine the Cōmon-wealth: He for his part pronounced openly, That he wold make sure account of them to be his, who stoode indifferent betweene and were Neuters.

At the battaile of Pharsalia he cryed out, spare all Citizens; & afterwards gran∣ted unto everie one of his owne soldiers (none excepted) this fauour to save each of thē one of the aduerse part, whom he would: neither were any found or knowne slaine but in the uerie medly, except AFRANIVS, FAUSTUS, & L. CEASAR the younger and even these uerely, men thinke, were not with his good will put to death. Of whom notwithstanding: both the former, to wit, AFRANIVS & FAUSTUS, after pardō obtained had rebelled and entred into armes againe & L. CEASR for his part, when in cruell manner by fire & sword he had made hauock of his freed men & bondseruants, spitefully slew the verie wild-beasts also which CEASAR had prouided against the solemnitie of a pub∣like shew to be exhibited before the people. To cōclude, in his very latter daies he permitted al those also whom beforetime he had not pardoned to return into Italy, to gouern as magistrates in the Citie, & to cōmand as generals in the field. Yea the very Statues of L. SVLLA & POMPEIVS which the cōmons had oer∣thrown & cast up & down, he erected again in their due places. And if after this, there was any plot intended or word spoken against him by his aduersaries to his hrt, he chose rather to represse than to revenge the same. And so, diuerse conspiraces detected and night conuenticles; hee found fault with no farther then thus, by giuing notice in some edict and proclamation.
That he had intelligence therof. And as for such as gaue out bitter speeches of him, he thought it sufficient in an open assemblie to give them an Admoni∣tion, not to persist therein.

Neither for all this, was he willing afterwards to put away the infamous note of affecting and seeking after the title of a King: albeit he both made answere unto a (a) Comnoner saluting him by the name of a King, That he was CAESAR and no King: and also at the Lupercali, when ANTONIUS the Consul imposed the Diademe oftentimes vpon his head before the ROSTRA, did put it backe againe, and send it into the Capitoll to (b) Iupiter Optimus Maximus.

This gave occasion to the Conspiratours for to hasten the execution of80 their designe, least of necessitie they should be driuen to assent thereto. Their counsels therefore and conferences about this matter, which before time they
held dispersed here and there, and proiected oftentimes by two & three in a companie, they now complotted altogither, for that by this time the very peo∣ple joyned not in the present state, seeing how things went; but both in secret and openly also distasted such soueraintie, and called earnestly for protectors and maintainers of their liberties.

is the author thereof: And the uerie day next preceeding his death, those troupes of horses which in his passage ouer the Riuer Rbicon hee had conse∣crate and let go loose ranging here and there without a keeper, (as he under∣stood for certaine) for bare their meat and would not to die for it, touch any, yea, and shed teares aboundantly. Also, as he offered sacrifice, the Soothsayer SPVRINA warned him to take heede of danger toward him, and which would not be differred after the Ides of March. Now; the verie day before the said Ides, it fortuned that as the birde (a)Or Regavio∣lus quasi re arium.

Hereupon, as also by reason of sickelinesse, he doubted a good while whether he should keepe at home and put off those matters which he had purposed to debate before the Senate, or no? At the last, being counselled and perswaded by DECIVS BRVTVS, not to disappoint the Senatours who were now in fre∣quencie assembled and stayed for his comming long since; he went forth when it was well neere eleuen of the clocke. And whenAb Obvi q∣dam, vel Ovi, 1, one Ori. one met him by the way, & offered him a written pamphlet, which layd open the conspiracie, and who they were that sought his life, he shuffled the same among other skroes and writings which he held in his left hand as if he would haue red it anone.

At which piller for a long time they used still to sacrifice, to make vowes and prayers, to determine and end certaine controversies interposing alwaies their oth by the name of CAESAR. CAESAR left behind him in the minds of certaine friends about him, a sus∣pition,86 that he was neither willing to have lived any longer, nor cared at all for life: because he stood not well to health, but was euermore crasie: & there∣upon neglected as well all religious warnings from the Gods, as also what re∣ports soeuer his friends presented unto him.

Others contrariwise are of opinion; that seeing as he did how he was forelaied on euerie side, and confessing, it were better once for all to undergoe those imminent daungers, than alwaies to stand in feare thereof, he was wont to say: It concerned not himselfe so much as it did the state, that hee should liue and bee safe: As for him▪ he had gotten long since power and glorie enough: marie the Common-wealth (if ought but well came to him) should not bee at quiet, but incurre the troubles of Ciuill warre▪ the issue whereof would be farre worse then euer it had beene. This one thing verily, all men well neere are agreed upon, That such a87
death befell unto him as himselfe in manner wished. For not onely uppon a time when he had read inCyripaedia, 8 XENOPHON, how CYRUS beeing at the point of death gaue some order for his funerall, hee setting light by so lingering and slow a kind of death, had wished to die quickely and of a suddaine; but also the verie daie before he was killed, in a certaine discourse mooved at supper in MARCUS LEPIDUS house uppon this point, What was the best ende of a mans life? preferred that which was sodaine and unloo∣ked for. He died in the In the 8, Sep∣timane. 56. yeare of his age and was canonized among the88 Gods, not onely by their voice who decreed such honour unto him, but also by the perswasion of the common people. For at those Games and playes which were the first that AUGVSTVS his heire exhibited for him thus Consecrate. deified, there shone a blazing starre for seuen dayes together, arising about the eleuenth houre of the day; and beleeved it was to be the soule of CAESAR received up into heaven. For this cause also uppon his Image there is a starre set to the uerie Crowne of his head. Thought good it was to damme vp (b) the Court where in hee was murdred: to name the Ides of March (c) Parricidium, and that the Senate should neuer meete in Counsell upon that day. Of these murderers, there was not one in manner that either survived89 him aboue three yeares, or died of his naturall death.

THE HISTORIE OF Octauius Caesar Augustus, written by Caius Suetonius Tran∣quillus. THat the principall name & linage of the OCTAVII, dwelt in times past at Velitrae, there be many evidences to shewe: For, both a street in the most frequented place of the said towne long since carried the name OCTAVIVS, and also there was to be seene an Altar there consecratedOr to Octa∣vivs: Octaviv Consecrata: by one OCTAVIVS, who being Generall of the field in a warre against the borderers, whē he happened to be sacrificing to Mars▪ upon newes brought that the enemie gave a suddaine charge, caught the Inwards of the beast sacrificed halfe raw as they were, out of the where they were a boyling or rosting. fire; cut and offered them accordingly: & so entred into battaile and returned with vic∣torie. There is beside, a publike Act extant upon record, wherein decreed and provided it was, that everie yeare after, the inwards in like manner should bee
presented unto Mars, and the rest of the sacrifice remaining, carried backe unto the Octauij. Eagen inter Rom. o llect▪ These Octauij, being by K. TARQVINIVS PRISCVS naturalized Romaines2 soone after translated and admitted by SERVIVS TVLLVS, into the Senate among the Patritians, & Nobles, in processe of time ranged themselues with the commons, and with much adoe at length, by the meanes of IVLIVS of sa∣cred Memrie returned to the Patritian degree again: The first of these that by the peoples election bare any Magistracie, was C. RVFVS: who having beene Questor begat Cn. and C. From thē descended two families of the OCTAVII, and those for their estate of life farre different. For Cn. and all the rest from him one after another, attained to places of highest honour but CAIVS and his posteritie everie one evē unto the father of AVGVSTVS, (such was either their fortune or their will,) staied in the order and degree of gentlemen, and rose no higher.

His father contenting himselfe with bearing office like another Burgesse in his owne Bourrough, being left welthie by his father, grew to a good estate, and lived to be an olde man, in much peace and tranquilitie.

Neither have I founde any more, as touching the Aunce∣stours of AVGVSTVS by the Fathers side: OCTAVIVS his father, from the verie beginning of his age, was of great3 welth and reputation; so that I cannot but mervaile, that hee also hath beene reported by some a banquer or monie changer: yea and one of the (a) dea∣lers of monie and servitours employed in CAMPVS MARTIVS, by those that stand for offices: For having beene from his verie cradle brought vppe in wealth highly and plentifully; he both attained unto honorable dignities with facilitie, and administred the same with credite and reputation.

For having discomfited in a great battaile the Bessi and the Thracians, he dealt so well with the Allies and confederats of that Kingdome: that there be certaine letters of M. TVLLIVS CICERO extant, wherein he ex∣horteth and admonisheth his brother QVINTVS, (who at the same time, little to his credite & good name, administred the procōsulship of Asia) for to imitate his neigbour OCTAVIVS, in doing well by the Allies, and winning their love thereby. As he departed out of Macedonie before that he could professe himselfe to4 be a suiter for the Consulship, he died a suddaine death▪ leaving these children
behind him alive, namely two daughters OCTAVIA the elder, which hee had by ANCHARIA: OCTAVIA the younger, and AVGVSTVS likewise, by ATIA. This ATIA was the daughter of M. ATIVS BALBVS, and IVLIA the sister of C. CAESAR. BALBVS by his fathers side was an ARICINE, a man that shewed Senatours Images and armes in his house: by his mother linked to MAGNVS POMPEIVS in the neerest degree of consanguinitie. And having borne the of∣fice of Pretorship he among the XX. Commissioners devided by vertue of the Law IVLIA, the lands in the territory of CAPVA among the Commons. But M.

To enter into this row me unlesse it be of ne∣cessitie & with devout chastitie, men make it scrupulous & are affraide: upon an old conceived opinion, as if unto as many as came thether rashly and inconsi∣derately, a certaine horror and fearefulnes were presented. And verily, this was soone after confirmed by this occasion: For when the new Land lord & posse∣ssor of that farme house, either by chance & at unwares, or els to try some ex∣perimēt, went into it, there to take up his lodging, it happened that in the night within verie fewe houres after, being driven out from thence by some sodaine violence, (he knoweth not how,) he was found in manner halfe dead, together with bed and all, before the dore, Being yet an infant, surnamed he was THURINVS, in memorial of the begin∣ning7 of his Auncestours: or else because in the countrie about Thurij, when hee was newly borne, his father OCTAVIVS fought a battaile against the Fugi∣tiues. That he was surnamed THVRINVS, my selfe am able to report by a god and sufficient evidence, as having gotten an olde little counterfeit in
brasse representing him being a child: which had in yron letters and those al∣most worne out, this name engraven. This said counterfeit, being given by me unto the Hadrian the Emperour▪ Prince, is now devoutely kept and worshipped among other his bed chamber Images. Moreover called he is oftentimes in taunting wise by M. ANTONIVS in his Epistles; THVRINVS: and himselfe writeth unto him backe againe as touching that point, nothing but this▪ That he marvaileth why that former name of his should be obiected unto him as a reproach. Afterwardes, he assumed the surname of C. CAESAR▪ and after it of AVGVSTVS: the one by the last will of his great Vncle, by the mother side, the other by the uertue of MVNATIVS PLANCVS his sentence: For when some gave their opinion, that he ought to be stiled ROMVLVS, as if he also had beene A Founder of the Cittie, PLANCVS preuailed, that he should be called rather AVGVSTVS: not onely for that it was a new Surname, but also greater and more honourable, because Religious and holy places, wherein also any thing is consecrated by bird flight, and feeding of them be called AVGVSTA, ab auctu. i. of grow∣ing, or else ab avium gestu gustuve: i. Of birds gesture and feeding. Like as ENNIVS also teacheth writing in this manner. Auguste Augurio postquam inclyta condita Roma est. After that Noble Rome was built by sacred flight of Birds. He was 4▪ yeares old when his father died: and in the xij. yeare of his age8 he praised in a publike assemblie, his Grand-mother IVLIA deceased. Foure yeeres after hauing put on his virill robe, he had (a) militarie (b) gifts bestow∣ed upon him at the African tryumph of CAESAR, albeit by reason of his yong yeares he had not once serued in the warres: Soone after, when his Vnkle (CAE∣SAR) was gone into Spaine against Cn. POMPEIVS children, he followed with in a while, (being as yet not well recovered out of a greevous sicknesse,) euen through waies infested by enemies, with verie few in his traine to accompany him, and hauing suffred shipwracke besides: whereby he mightily won his Vn∣cles love, who quickely approved his towardly behauiour and disposition, over and above his diligence in travaile▪ Whē CAESAR, after he had recovered Spaine and brought it to his subiection, intended a voiage against the otherwise called , Daci, and from thence against the Parthians, he being sent afore to Apollonia, became a Stu∣dent there and followed his booke. And so soone as he had certaine intelligēce that CEASAR was slaine, and himselfe made his heire: standing in doubt and sus∣pense a long time, whether he should implore the helpe of the Legions os no? at length he gave over that course verily, as too hastie & untimely, but whē he was returned againe to Rome, he entred upon his inheritance, not withstanding his mother made some doubt thereof & his father in law MARTIVS His mothers husband. PHILIPPVS a man of Consular degree much disswaded him there fro. And from that time having levied & assembled his forces, he governed the cōmon welth first ioint ly with (c M. ANTONIVS and M: LEPIDVS for the space almost of 12: yeres, and at the last for xliiij: yeares by himselfe alone: Having thus laid open the very sum as it were, of his life, I will goe through9 the parts there of in particular: not by the times but by the seuerall kinds ther∣of. to the end the same may be shewed and knowne more distinctly: Five civill warres he made to wit, at Mutine, Philippi, Perusium in Sicilie, and at Actium. Of which the first & last were against M: ANTONIVS: the secōd against BRVTVS
and CASSIUS the third against L. ANTONIUS brother to the Triumvir, the 4. against Sex. POMPEIUS, Cn. POMPEIUS his sonne. Of all these warres he tooke the occasion and quarrell from hence, namely, reputing and iudging in his mind nothing more meet and conuenient than the revenge of his unkles death and the maintenance of his acts and proceedinges. No sooner was he returned from Apollonia, but he purposed to set upon BRV∣TUS and CASSIUS at unwares: and (because upon foresight of daunger they10 were fled secretly out of the way) to take the course of law, and in their absenceA, V, C 710▪ to endite them of murder. As for the Plaies and games for CEASARS victory because they durst not exhibit them, whose lot and office it was so to do, him∣selfe set them forth. And to the end that he might go through all other matters also more resolutely; he professed himselfe to labour for the Of the com∣mons. Tribuneship in the rowme of one who fortuned to die: albeit he was one of the Nobility, though not of the Senate. But seeing that M. ANTONIUS the Consul withstood his at∣tempts, where as he hoped he would have beene his principall friend in that suit: and vouchsafed not unto him so much as the assistance of his owne pub∣like authority, or helpe procured from others in any thing, without he agreed and covenanted to yeeld unto him some exceeding consideration: he betooke himselfe unto the protection of those Nobles & chiefe Senatours unto whom he perceiued that ANTONIUS was odious: in this regard especially, that  Antonius. he endevored all that he could by force of armes to expell DECIMUS BRVTUS besieged at Mutina, out of that province which by CEASAR was granted and by the Senate confirmed unto him. And thereupon by the aduice and perswasion of some he set certaine persons priuily in hand to murder ANTONIUS; which perilous practise of his being detected and fearing still the like danger to him∣selfe, he waged the old soldiers with as beautiful a larges as possiblie he could,A. V. C. 711. for the defence as well of his owne person as of the state. And being appointed to lead this armie thus levied, in qualitie of propretour & together with HIR∣TIUS and PANSA, who had entred upon the Consulship▪ to aide D. BRVTUS, he made an end of this warre committed unto him within three moneths, in two fought fieldes. In the former of which, ANTONIE writeth that he fled, and without coat armour or horse appeared at length after two dayes and shewed himselfe. But in the battaile next following, well knowne it is, that he performed the part not onely of a Captaine but also of a soldier▪ and in the very heat and midst of the medly, by occasion that the Standerd bea∣rer of his owne Legion was grievously hurt, he supported the Aegle with his owne shoulders As masse & heavie as it was. and so carried it a good while. During this warre, when HIRTIUS had lost his life in the conflict, and11 PANSA soone after of his wound, it was bruited rifely abroad, that both of them were by his meanes slaine: to the ende that having defaited ANTONIUS, and the Common-wealth beeing bereift of both Consuls, he alone might seize uppon the victorious armies. And verily the death of PANSA was so deepely suspected that GLYCO the Physitian was com∣mitted to ward and durance, as if he had put poyson into his wound. AQVIL∣LIUS NIGER addeth moreover and saith, that the one of the Consuls, to wit, HIRTIUS, was in the verie confused medly of the battaile killed by AVGUS∣TUS himselfe.
But so soone as he understood that ANTONIE after his flight was intertained12 by M. LEPIDVS: that other Captaines also and armies consented to take part withProprtibus: of Pomperus and the common wealth. if you read pro petri∣ i. with the Nobilitie the side▪ he forsooke without all delaies the cause of the Nobles and principall Senatours: and for the better pretence of this change and alterati∣on of his minde, craftily and uniustly alleadged the words and deedes of cer∣taine of them▪ as if (a) some had given it out of him: That he was a boy, (b) O∣thers, that he was to beEt tollendum. adorned, and * honoured: That neither himselfe nor the olde beaten soldiers might be rewarded according to their desarts. And the better to approove his repentance of the former side and faction that he tooke: He fined the Nursines, in a great summe of monie, and more than they were able to pay; For that upon the Monuments or Tombe of those Citizens that were slaine in the battaile at Mutina (which at their common charges was reared) they wrote this Title, That they died for the Libertie and Free-dome of their Cittie. Being entred into Societie with ANTONIE and LEPIDVS, hee finished13 the Philippian warre also, (although he was but weake and sickely,) and thatA. V. C 712. with two battailes▪ in the former being discamped and driven out of the field, hardly hee escaped by flight and recovered the Regiment or wing of ANTONI∣US. Neither used he moderately the successe of his victorie, but when hee had sent the head of BRVTUS to Rome for to bee bestowed under the Statue of CAESAR, he dealt cruelly with the Noblest and most honourable prisoners, and not without reproachfull words: so farre forth verily, that to one of them, making humble suite and prayer for his Sepulture, he answered, (by report) in this wise. That it would be anone, at the dispose of the fules of the Aire: and when others, to wit, the (a) Father, and sonne together intreated for their lives; he commanded them either to cast lots or trie by combate whether of them should have life granted▪ and so beheld them both as they dyed, whilest the father who offred himselfe to die was slaine, and the sonne voluntarily take his death. Whereuppon the rest, & amongst them M FAVONIUS that worthie follower of CATO, when they were brought forth with their yrons and chaynes to execution, after they had in honorable termes saluted ANTONIUS by the name ofSoveraine commander Emperour, openly reviled and let flie at him most foule and rayling words. Hauing parted betweene them their charges & offices after this victorie, whē ANTONIUS undertook to settle the East in good order, and himselfe to bring the olde Soldiers backe into Italie, & to placethem there, in the lands & teritories belonging to the free Townes and Burowghes, he kept himselfe in favour neither with the said old soldiers, nor the former posses∣sors of those lands: whilest the one sort complained, that they were disseized: and the other, that they were not well entreated according to their hope, for so good deserts. At which verie time, he forced L. ANTONIUS (who confidently presuming14 upon the Consulship which he then bare, & his brothers power withall, wentA. V. C. 713. about to make an insurrection and alteration in the state) to flie unto PERV∣SIA, and there for verie hunger compelled him to yeeld▪ but yet not without great jeopardie of his owne person, both before and after the warre: for whē at a certaine solemne sight of stage plaies; he had commanded an ordinarie and cōmon soldier who was set within the (a) 14. ranks, to be raised by an officer, &
thereupon a rumor was carried and spred by his malicious ill willers and back∣biters, as if presently after torture he had put the same soldier to death. There lacked verie little, but that in the concourse and indignation of the militarre multitude, he had come to a mischiefe and beene murdered. This onely saued his life: that the man for a while missed, sodainely was to be seene againe alive and safe without any harme done unto him. About the walls of Perusia, as hee sacrificed, he had like to haue been intercepted by a strong companie of sword fencers that sallied out of the Towne. After he had forced PERVSIA; he proceeded to the execution of verie many,15A. V. C. 714. & euer as any went about either to crave pardon or to excuse themselues, with this on word he stopped their mouthes, Die yee must.

Ides of March, at the Alter built in the honor of IVLIVS (CAESAR) of famous memorie. There have been others who wrote, that of verie purpose he tooke armes and made this warre to the end that his close aduersaries and those who rather for feare, then of good will held in, upon occasion given and opportunitie by L. ANTONIUS there leader, might be detected: that having once vanquished them and confiscated their goods, the rewards promised unto the olde soldiers he might the better performe. The warre in SICILE he began betimes and with the first, but drewe it out16 along time; as being often intermitted▪ one while, for the repairing and rig∣ging of his fleete which by two ship-wrackes in tempest, (and thatWhen com∣monly it is clme in those Seas. in summer time) he had lost: another while▪ by occasion of peace made at the earnest cry of the people, for the provision of their victuales cut off and kept from them: and the famine thereby dayly growing: untill such time as having built neweA.

In which when he had trained and exercised his sea forces whole winters, he overcame POMPEIUS betweene A port town in , Milae andAn har∣bour neere Messanah. A. V. C, 718. Naulochus▪ at the verie houre and instant time of which Naual bat∣taile, he was suddenly surprized with such a sound sleepe, that his friends were faine to waken him and raise him out of bed for to give the signall. Wherupon occasion and matter was ministred (as I thinke) toMarcus, the Triumvir. ANTONIUS, for to cast this in his teeth, that he could not so much as with his eyes open see directly before him the battaile set in ray, but lay like a sencelesse bocke on his backe, looking onely into theFor Gods helpe. skie aloft: nor once arose and came in sight of his sol∣diours, before that M. AGRIPPA had put his enemies 12 ships to flight. Others blame and charge him both for a speech and deede also of his: as if he should crie out and say, That seeing his owne regiment of ships were cast away by tempests, he would even against the will of NEPTVNE obtaine victorie. And verily the next day of the (a) Circensian Games, he tooke out of the solemne pompe there she∣wed, the Image of the said God: Neither in any other warre lightly was hee in more and greater dangers For hauing transported one armie into Sicilie, when he sailed backe againe for to waft ouer the rest of his forces from the conti∣nent and firme Of . land, he was at unwares overtaken and surpried by DE∣MOCHARES and APOLLOPHANES the Lievetenants and Admirals of
POMPEIUS, but at the length with uerie much ado, he escaped with one one∣ly barke In like manner as he travailed by land unto (b) Regium neere Locrse, kenning a farre ofSext. POMPEIS gallies sayling along the coasts, and weening them to he his owne, he went downe to the shore, and had like to have been caught and taken by them. And even then as he made shift to flie and escape through by-waies aud blind-lanes: a bond-seruant of AEMILIVS PAVLUS a companion of his, taking it to the heart that his Maisters father PAVLUS, was in times past by him proscribed and outlawed, and imbracing, as it were, the good occasion and opportunitie of revenge now offered, gave the attempt to kill him. After the flight ofSext. POMPEIUS, when M. LEPIDUS one of his In the Tri∣umvirate. Collegues, whome hee had called forth of Afrike to his aide, bareA. V. C. 718. himselfe proude uppon the confidence of xx. Legions, challenged a soue∣rainetie over theM. Antonius and  Augustus. rest, and that, with terrour and menaces: hee stript him of all his armie, and uppon his humble submission and supplication, pardoned his life, but confined him for ever to Circeij. Some Cri∣tickes begin here a newe Chapter. The Societie of M. ANTONIUS wauering alwaies in doubtfull teames and uncertaine, and notwithstanding many and sundrie reconciliations, not well knit and confir∣med, he brake of quite in the ende: and the better to proove and make good that he (c) had degenerated from the ciuill behauiour and modestie of a (Ro∣maine) Citizen, he caused the last will and testament of the said ANTONIE, which he had left at (d) Rome, and therein nominated even the Children of CLEOPATRA among his heires to be opened and red in a publike assem∣blie. Howbeit when hee was judged by the State an enemie, hee sent backe unto him those of his neerest acquaintance and inward friendes and among other C. SOSIUS, (e) and T. Cn. Domitius DOMITIVS, being Consuls at that time still. The Bononians also, for that of olde they were dependantes of the Antonij and in there retinue and protection, hee by a publicke ActA. V. C. 722. acquit and pardoned for not entring into a confederace with all Italie, (f) on his side. Not long after, he vanquished him in a Nauall battaile before (g) Actium, what time by reason that the fight continued untill it was lateA. V. C. 723: in the euening hee was forced to lodge all night conqueror as he was, on ship board. When he had retired himselfe from Actium into the Iland Samos for his17 winter harbour, being disquieted with the newes of his soldiers mutinie de∣manding rewardes and discharge from service; those I meane, whom after the victorie atcheived hee had from out of the whole number sent before to Brindis, he went againe into Italie: but in crossing the Seas thither; twice was he tossed and troubled with Tempests: first betweene the promontories or Capes of Polponensus and Actolia: againe, about the Mountaines or Cliffes Ceraunij. In both which places, part of his pinnaces were cast away and drowned: and with all, the verie takling of that shippe wherein he embarked was rent and orne a sunder: yea, and the rudder thereof quite broken. Nei∣ther staied he at Brindis above 27, daies, that is to say untill hee had setled hisA. V. C▪ 724 soldiers and contented them in their desires and requests: but fetching a com∣passe about Asia, and Siria, sailed into Aegypt where after hee had laied seige unto ALEXANDRIA, whether ANTONIE and CLEOPATRA were together fled▪ He soone became Mais. of that Cittie. And as for ANTONIE,
who now (all to late) made meanes for conditions of peace hee enforced to make himselfe away, and Viditque mor∣: In some copies we read thus:  mortam Cleo∣patram,  And he saw  dead: For he heard onely of Anto∣nies death and saw the sworde wherewith hee wounded him∣selfe. saw him dead And to CLEOPATRA whom most gladly he would have saved alive for to beautifie his tryumph hee set the (a) PSYLLI to sucke out the venime & poyson within her bodie: for that suppo∣sed it was she died with the sting of the Serpent (b) Aspis: This honour he did unto them both, namely to burie them in one sepulcher: and the Tombe by them begun, he commanded to be finished. Young ANTONIE the elder of those twaine whom he had by FVLVIA, he caused to be violently haled from the Statue of IVLIVS CAESAR of famous memorie, unto which, after many prayers but all in vaine; he was fled as to sanctuarie, and so killed him. Likewise CAESARIO, when CLEOPATRA gave out openly that she had con∣ceived by his His great Vnkle indeede but father by adoption: father CAESAR, he fetched backe againe from the place whither he was fled, and put him to death. The rest of the Children of ANTONIE and the Queene togither, he both saued (no lesse than if they had beene linked in neere Alliance unto himselfe,) and also according to the state of euerie one of them, he maintained and cherished respectively. About the same time, when he beheld the Tombe together with the corps of18 ALEXANDER the great, taken newly foorth of the vaute or secret Chappell where it was bestowed; he set upon it a coronet of gold: and strewing flowers thereupon worshipped it: And being asked the question, whither hee would* Or  i. the bodies  Tombes of the Ptolemoees, If you read , it is ment of . looke upō the PTOLOMES also? he answered that he was desirous indeed to see a King but not the (a) dead. When he had reduced Aegypt in the forme of a province, to the end that he might make it more fruitfull and fit to yeeld corne and victuals for the Cittie of Rome, he skowred and cleansed by helpe of soldi∣ers, all those ditches where into Nilus overfloweth, which by long time had been choaked with mud. And that the memorie of his Actiake victorie might be more renowmed among posteritie, he built the Cittie Nicopolis over against Actium, and ordained certaine games and plaies there, everie 5. yeeres: and hauing enlarged the old Which stood upon the saide promontarie actium. Temple of Apollo: and the place werein he had en∣camped; he beautified with Navall spoiles and then consecrated it to Neptune and Mars. After this, sundry tumults and the verie beginnings of commotions and in∣surrections,19 many conspiracies also detected before they grew to any head, he suppressed: and those, some at one time and some at an other▪ Namely first one of LEPIDVS the younger: then, another of VARRO MVRAENA, and FANNI∣VS CAPIO: soone after that, of M.

As for AVDASIVS and EPICADVS, they had entended to carrie away IVLIA his daughter and AGRYPPA, his Nephew (out of those Ilands wherin they abode confined) unto the armies: and TELEPHVS purposed upon a deepe conceite that the soveraintie of dominion was by the Destinies and will of God due unto him, even to lay upon him and the Senate violent hands. And more then that,
one time there was taken neere vnto his bed-chamber by night, a camp-slave belonging to the ILLYRIAN armie, who had deceiued the porters and got∣ten thither with a wood knife at his side, but whether he were out of his wits, or feigned himselfe mad, it was uncertaine: for nothing could bee wrung out of him by examination upon the racke and torture.20 Foraine warres he made in his owne person ij in all and no more: that is toA. V. C. 721. 727. say, the (a) Dalmatian, when he was yet a verie youth: and the Cantabrian, af∣ter he had defaited ANTONIE. In the Dalmatian warre, he was wounded also: for in one battaile he gat a blow upon his right knee with a stone: and in an o∣ther, not his leg onely, but also both his armes were hurt with the fall from a (b)* Or turret of woode. bridge, The rest of his warres he managed by his Lieftennants: yet so as that in some of them namely the Pannonian and the Germaine; hee would either come betweene times, or else remaine not farre of: making his progresse from the Cittie of Rome, as farre as to Rauenna, or Millaine or to Aquileia. He subdued partly by his owne conduct in proper person, and in part by21 his Lieftenants hauing cōmission immediatly from him & directed by his au∣spicies Cantabria, Aquitaine, Pannonia and Dalmatia together with all Illyri∣cum, Rhaetia likewise, the Vindelicis, the Salassians and the Nations inhabiting the Alpes. He repressed also the Incursions of the Dukes, having slaine three of their Generals with a great number of them besides. And the Germaines he remooved and set further of; even beyond the riuer Albis. Howbeit, of these the Suevians and the Sicambrians, because they yeelded themselues, he brought over into Gaule, and placed them in the lands next unto Rhene. Other Nations being mal-content, he reduced unto his obedience. Neither made hee warre upon any people without iust and necessarie causes: and so farre was he from desire of enlarging his Empire, or aduancing his martiall glorie, that he com∣pelled certaine princes and potentates of the Barbarians, to take an oath in the Temple of Mars (a) the Revenger for to continue in their allegiance, & in the protection and peace which they sued for: yea and from some of them he as∣saied to exact a new kind of Hostages, even Vusuall in those daies. women, for that he perceived, that they neglected the pledges of the males. And yet he gave thē libertie, as oftē as they would, to receiue their hostages againe. Neither proceeded he at any time against those, who either usually or trecherously above the rest tooke armes & rebelled, to any punishmēt more greivous then this, euen to sell thē as captives: with this condition, that they shold not serve in any neighbour Country, nor be manumised and made free within the space of Or 20▪ rather 30. yeares. By which fame of vertue and moderation that went of him, he induced and drew the very Indians and Scythians, Nations knowen by report and heere say onely, to make suite of their owne accord by Embassadours, for amitie of him and the people of Rome. The Parthians also, when as he laied claime unto Armenia, yeelded soone unto him: and those militarie Ensignes which they had taken from M. CRASSVS & M. ANTONIVS, they delivered unto him againe at his demaund: and moreover, offred hostages unto him. And finally when there were many Competitours together at one time claiming a title to the Kingdome, they would not allow of any, but one by him elected. The temple of Ianus Quirinus, which from the foundation of the City be∣fore22 his daies had once and twice beene shut, he in a farre shorter space of time
(having peace both by sea and land) shut a third time. Twice he rod on horse∣backe* Tertio. or ter. thrice. (b) ovant into the City: once presently upon the Philippian warre; and againe, after the Sicilian. He kept three Triumphes riding in his chariot: to wit, the Dalmatian, the Actiak, and the Alexandrian▪ and these continued all for three dayes together. Of shamefull foiles and grievous overthrowes, he received but two in all:23 and those in no place else but in Germanie; namely when LOLLIVS and Quintilius Varus. VA∣RVS were defaited. That of LOLLIVS, was a matter of dishonour more than losse and domage; but the other of VARVS, drew with it in manner utter de∣struction as wherein three Legions with their Generall; the Lieutenant; andA. V. C. 738 762 (a) Auxiliaries, all were slaine. Vpon the newes of this Infortunity▪ he proclai∣med a set watch both day and night through the City of Rome; for feare of some tumult and uprore: and the commissions of Presidents and Deputies o∣ver Provinces, he renewed and enlarged their time of government: to the end, that the Allies of the people of Rome might bee kept in a leageance by gover∣nours, such as were both skilfull and also acquainted with them. Hee vowed also the Great (Romaine) Games and Playes to the honour of IVPITER OPT. MAX. If Si Resp. in me∣liorem statum vert sset. the Commonwealth turned to better State. This happened, during the time of the Cimbrian and VVhich al∣so was called Bellum sociale, wherein▪ the Associate nati∣ons in Italy re∣belled: of which Rebelli∣on the Authors were the Marsi.

For, therewith (by report) hee was so troubled and astonied, that for certaine moneths together hee let the haire of beard and head grow still and wore it long, yea and other whiles would runne his Vpon an opi∣nion of the Painims▪ that if they did njurie to their owne bodies they should sooner pacifie the Gods. head against the dores, crying out, QUINTILLVS VARVS, Deli∣ver up thy Legions againe. And the very (b) day of this infortunate calamity he kept every yeere mournfull, with sorow and lamentation. 24 In warfare & feates of armes, he both altered and also instituted many points: yea and some he reduced to the auncient manner. (a) Militarie disci∣pline he exercised most severely. He permitted not so much as any of his Lieu∣tenants, but with much adoe and discontentment, to visite other-whiles their wives; and never but in the (b) winter moneths. A Romaine Knight, for cut∣ting off the (c) thombs of two young men his sonnes, to avoid the militarie oath and warre service, he set in open pot sale, himselfe (I say) and all his goods. Whom notwithstanding, because he saw the (d) Publicanes about to buy, and bid very well for him, he appointed and delivered to his owne Freed man; that being confined and sent away unto his living & lands in the Country, he might permit him to live as Free. The tenth Legion, for being stubborne and unwil∣ling to obey, he dismissed all and whole with ignominie.

Those centurions who forsooke their Stations, he punished with death, even as well as the com∣mon soldiors of their bands: and for other kinds of Delinquencie he put them to shame sundry waies, as cōmanding them to stand all the day long before the Praetorium sometimes in their single Or wast∣coates, without their Saga: coates and ungirt; other-whiles with ten Or mee∣ting poles, in token of Re∣gradation or putting downe to a lower place. foote perches in their hands; or else carying turfes of earth. After the civile warres, he called none of his soldiours either in any publike speech, or by way of edict or proclamation, by the name of (a) Fellow soldiours,25
but plaine Souldiours. Nay hee would not suffer them otherwise to be termed so much as by his sonnes, or his wives sonnes: thinking it was a more affected manner of Appellation than stoode either with martial Law, or the (a) quiet∣nes of those times, or the maiestie of himselfe and his house: (b) Libertines he emploied in soulderie unlesse it were at Rome about skarfires by night, (not withstanding there was feared some tumult and uprore by occasion of great dearth and scarcity) but twice onely: once in garizon for defence of those Co∣lonies which bounded fast upon Illyricum; a second time for keeping the banks of the riuer of Rhene▪.

These he bestowed most sparily; and when he did, it was without suit made therefore: and many times upon the cō∣mon (d) and base souldiers. He gave unto M. AGRIPPA after a nauale victory in Cilicia a blew streamer. Those Captaines onely who had triumphed, albeit they were both companions with him in his expeditions, and also partakers of his victories, he thought not meete to be rewarded with any gifts at all: because they also had power to bestow the same upon whom they would. Moreover he deemed nothing lesse beseeming a perfit and accomplished Captaine, than hast-making and rashnesse. And therefore, these mots and sentences were rife in his mouth. , : As also, Sat celeriter fieri, quicquid fiat satis bene. His saying was, That neither battaile nor warre was once to be under taken, un∣lesse there might be evidently seene more hope of gaine than feare of domage: for such as sought after the smallest commodities▪ not with a little daunger, he likened unto those, that angle or fish with a golden hooke: for the losse whereof, if it happened to be knapt or broken off▪ no draught of fish whatsoever, was able to make amends.26 He managed magistracies and honorable places of government before due By the lawes Annuar. oe, or Anuales. time; some of them also of a As the Tri∣umvirate: new kinde; and others in As the Tri∣bunes authori∣tie and Cen∣sureship▪ perpetuity. The Consulship hee usurped and entred upon in the twentieth (a) yeere of his age, presenting forcibly and in hostile manner his legions before the City, sending some of purpose to demaund it, euen in the name of the Armie for him.

For, whereas they were exorable and would bee oftentimes intreated by fa∣vour and prayer, to respect the persons of many; hee alone was very carnest, that none might bee spared: among the rest, hee proscribed C. TORANIVS also, his owne Tutour and guardian, yea and the companion in the Office of Aedileship with his father OCTAVIVS. IVNIVS SATVRNINVS writeth moreover, that after the proscription was ended, when M. LEPIDVS had in the Senate-house excused all that was past and given good hope of clemencie for the time to come, because there had beene execution enough done alrea∣die: he on the contrarie side professed openly, That hee had determined no o∣ther end of the saide proscription, but that hee might have liberty still to pro∣ceede in all things as he would. Howbeit, in testimonie of repentance for this rigour and obstinacie of his, hee honoured afterward with the dignitie of Knighthood Or Vinius, for so was his Pa∣trone named. T. IVNIVS PHILOPAEMEN, for that hee was reputed to have in times past hid his owne Patron, that was proscribed. In the same Trium∣virate, hee incurred many waies the ill will and heart-burning of the people: for he commaunded that PINARIVS a Gentleman of Rome, (what time as he himselfe made a publike speech in an assembly whereunto hee had admitted a multitude of Paganes, that is to say, such as were no souldiours, and espied him there to take notes of something that he delivered before the souldiours, supposing him to be over busie and a spie,) should be stabbed to death even in his sight: yea, and hee terrified TEDIVS AFER, Consull elect, (because hee had maliciously in some spitefull termes depraved something that he had done) with so great menaces, that in a melancholy hee cast himselfe headlong and brake his owne necke. Likewise, as Q. GALLIVS the Pretour held under his robe a paire of duple writing tables, when hee came of course to doe his duty and salute him; he suspecting, that he had a (short) sword hidden underneath, and not daring straight-waies to search him farther, for feare something else than a sworde should bee found about him; within a little while after cau∣sed him to be haled out of the Tribunall seate of Iudgement, by the handes of certaine Centurions of Souldiours, and put to torture like a bondslave; yea & seeing he would confesse nothing, commanded him to be killed; having first
with his owne hands plucked his eies out of his head. Howbeit AVGVSTVS writeth, that the said GALLIVS by pretending to parle secretly with him, laid waite for his life; whereupon hee committed him to prison, and afterwards dismissed and enlarged him onely to dwell in Rome: and that in the end hee pe∣rished either by shipwracke, or else by the hands of theeves who forlayed him.

But considering better with himselfe, that were he once a private person, he could not live without daunger; and withall, that it would greatly hazard the Common wealth, to be put into the hands and dispose of many; he continued in the holding thereof still. And whether the event en∣suing, or his will heerein were better, it is hard to say. VVhich will of his, as hee pretented oftentimes when he sate in place, so hee testified also by a cer∣taine edict in these wordes: O that I might establish the Common wealth safe and sound in her owne Base or Pied∣stall. proper seate, and thereof reape that fruite which I desire: even that I may be reported the Author of an excellent estate, and carie with mee when I die this hope, that the ground worke and the foundations of the Common-wealth which I shall lay, may continue and abide stedfast in their place. And verily what hee wished, As if he had beene a God himselfe; ac∣cording to the saving. Sns  fingit fortu∣am ibi. himselfe effected and brought to passe, having endevoured and done his best every way, that no man might repent of this newe estate. For the Citie beeing not adourned according to the maiestie of such an Em∣pire and Subiect to the casualties of Deluges and fires, hee beautified and set out so, as iustly he made his boast, that where he found it built of bricke, hee left it all of marble. And for the safety therereof, hee performed as much for future posterity as could be fore-seene and provided for by mans wit and rea∣son. 29 Publike works he built very many whereof the chiefe and principal was his Forum or stately Hall of Iustice, together with the temple of MARS the Revenger: The temple of APOLLO in Palatinus; The tēple likewise of IUPITER the Thunde∣rer, in the Capitol. The reason why he built the said Forū, was the multitude of men & their suites: which because, (a) ij. would not suffice, seemed to have need of a third also. And therfore with great speed erected it was for that publike use, even before the temple of MARS was finished. And expresly provided it was
by law, that in it publike causes should be determined apart, and choosing of Iudges (or Iuries) by it selfe. The temple of Mars hee had vowed unto him, in the Philippian warre which hee tooke in hand for the revenge of his fathers death. He ordained therefore by an Act, that heere the Senate should be con∣sulted with, as touching warres & triumphs: that from hence those Pretours or Governours who were to goe into their provinces should be honorably atten∣ded & brought onward on their way: and that hither they should bring the en∣signes and ornaments of triumph, who returned with victorie. The temple of Apollo he reared in that part of the Palatine house, which being smitten with lightning was by that God required, as the Soothsayets out of their learning had pronounced: hereto was adioyned a gallerie, with a librarie of Latine and Greeke bookes. In which temple, he was wont in his old age both to sit often∣times in counsaile with the Senate, and also to over-see & review the Decuries of the Iudges. He consecrated the temple vnto IVPITER the Thunderer, upon occasion that he escaped a daunger, what time as in his Cantabrian expedition, as he travailed by night, a flash of lightning glaunced upon his licter, & strucke his seruant stone dead, that went with a light before. Some works also he made under other folkes names, to wit his nephew, his wife and sister; as the Gallerie and stately Pallace of His daugh∣ters children by Agrippa. LVCIVS and CAIVS: likewise the Gallerie or Porches of LIVIA and OCTAVIA: the Theatre also of MARCELLUS. Moreover di∣vers other principall persons hee oftentimes exhorted to adorne and beautifie the City, every man according to his ability either by erecting new monu∣ments, or else by repairing and furnishing the old. By which meanes many an Aedifice was by many a man built: as namely the temple of Hercules and theAtriū libertatis A trium, quasi aithriō. A place where learned men were wont to meete and conferre, as our Merchants doe in the Royall Exchange. built not unlike unto it with arched walks on every side standing upon pillers: & as this cloi∣ure was called Peristylium, so, the open yard within, A tra or Subdid.

AGRIPPA. 30 The whole space of the City he devided into (a) wards and streetes. He ordained, that as Magistrates or Aldermen yeerely by lot should keepe and governe the former: so their should be Maisters or Constables elected out of the Commons of every streete, to looke unto the other. Against skarefires he devised night-watches and watchmen. To keepe downe Inundations and Deluges, he enlarged and cleansed the channell of the River Tiberis, which in times past was full of rammell and the ruines of houses, and so by that meanes narrow and choaked. And that the Avenues on every side to the City might be more passable, he tooke in hand himselfe to repaire the high way or Caw∣sie Flaminia, so farre as to ARIMINNUM▪ and the rest he committed to sundry men who had triumphed, for to ave; and the charges thereof to be befraied out of the money raised of spoiles and sackage. The sacred Churches and Chappels decayed and ruinate by continuance of time, or consumed by fire he reedified: and those together with the rest hee adorned with most rich ob∣lations; as who brought into the Cell, or Tabernacle of Iupiter Capitolinus at one Donation, 16000 pound weight of gold, besides pretious stones valued at 50 millions of Sesterces. But after that hee entred now at length upon the High priesthood when31 A. V. C. 741.
LEPIDVS was once dead, which he never could finde in his heart to take from him whiles he lived: what bookes soever of prophesies & destinies went com∣monly abroad in Greeke and Latine, either without authors, or such as were not authenticall and of credite, he caused to be called in from all places, to the number of 2000 & aboue: and when he had burnt them, he reteined those only of Sibyls prophesies. And even of those also he made some special choice: and bestowed them close in two litle Desks or coffers under the base & piedstoole of APOLLO PALATINVS. The yeeres revolution reduced as it was into or∣der by IVLIVS of sacred memory, but afterwards through negligence troubled and confused, he brought againe to the former calculation. In the dispose whereof, he called the moneth Sextilis (rather than September wherin he was borne▪) by his owne name, because in it there befell unto him both his first Consulship & also notable victories. Of all the Religious & priests, but especi∣ally of the vestall virgins he augmented the number, the dignity and the com∣modities also. And whereas in the rowme of any vestall Nun deceased, there must another of necessity be chosen & také, he perceiving many to make suite that they might not put their daughters to the lottery; protested and bound it with an oath, that if any one of his owne Nieces or daughters daughters were of competent age he would present her to the place. Divers auncient ce∣remonies also which by little & little were disused and abolished, he restored a∣gaine, as namely the (a) Augurie of SALVS, the Flaminship of IVPITER, the sacred Lupercal, the (b) Saecular playes and the Compitalitij. At the Lupercall So∣lemnities, he commanded that no beardlesse boyes should runne. Likewise, at the Secular playes, he forbad young folke of both sexes, to frequent any shew exhibited by night; unlesse it were in the company of some auncient person of their kindred. The Tutelare Images of crosse-wayes called Lares Compitales he was the first that ordained to adorne twice in the yeere with flowers of the spring & sommer seasōs. The principal honour next unto the immortall gods, he performed to the memoriall of those worthy Captaines, who had raised the Romaine onpire from a small thing to so high and glorious a state. And therefore both the works & monuments of every of them he repaired & made againe, reserving their titles and inscriptions still; and all their Statues also in triumphant forme and shape he dedicated in both the Porches or galleries of his Hall of Iustice. And in a publick edict he professed thus much, That he de∣vised it to this end, That both himselfe whils he lived, and the Princes or Emperours his successors for the ages to come, might be called upon and urged by their subiects and Citizens to conforme themselnes as it were to their pattron and example.

Many most daungerous enormities and offensive abuses, which either had32 continued by custome and licentious liberty during the civill warres, or else crept in and began in the time of peace to the utter ruine of the Common∣wealth, he reformed.

Where upon, he disposed streng guards, and set watches in convenient places: he repressed those Robbers and Hacksters, he visited and surveyed the foresaid Prisons: and all Colledges or Guilds save onely those of auncient found ati∣on and by law erected, he dissolved and put downe.

The debts & actions commenced against such as had been troubled and sued a long time in the Law, by whose mournfull habite & distressed estate their adversaries sought for nothing but pleasure and the fulfilling of their wils he anulled & denounced this condition withall, that if any one would needes bring them into new trouble againe, he should be liable to the like daunger of punishment or penalty as the molested party was.

But seeing that most of them refused & were loth to execute this burdensome office of iudging, he hardly granted that each Decurie should have their yeeres Quarto quo{que} anno: everie 4, yeare. vacation by turnes; and that the law matters which were wont to be pleaded and tried, in the Vppon cer∣taine daves of those mo∣neths, during which, there were Sports & Reuels and the licentious▪ feast Saturnalia. mo∣neths of November & December should be let passe & omitted quite. 33 Himselfe sat daily in Iudgement, yea and other whiles untill it was darke night, lying if he had not his health, in a licter which was of purpose set before the tribunall seate, or else in his owne house: and he ministred iustice not onely with exceeding severity, but also with as great lenity. For when upon a time there was one accused for a manifest parricidy, because he should not be sowed up in a leather (a) male or budget (a punishment that none suffred but such as had cōfessed the Fact) he examined (by report) upon interrogatiues in this ma∣ner, Certes thou never murderedst thy father, diddest thou? Againe, when as a matter was handled before him as touching a forged will, & all the witnesses that set their hands & seales thereto, were attaint by the (b) Law Cornelia, he de∣livered unto the Commissioners who had the hearing & deciding together, of the cause, not onely the two (ordinatie) tables of condemnation and acquitall, but a third also; whereby they might have their pardon, who were certainly knowne to have beene seduced & brought to be witnesses as is before said, ei∣ther by fraudulent practise or error & over-sight. As for the appeales in Court, he yeerely assigned those which were for the City-Suiters unto Pretours of the City; but if they were for Provinciall persons unto certaine men of the Con∣suls degree, such as he had ordained, in every province one, for to be in com∣mission and to determine provinciall affaires. 34 The lawes made before time he revised & corrected: some also hee or∣dained & established a-new: as namely (a) Sumptuaria, as touching expenses
at the bord: Of (b) Adulteries & De pdicitia, or impudicitia unnaturall filthinesse cōmitted with the male kind: Of (c) indirect suite for offices. Of the (d) mutuall mariages of Senatours and Gentlemen with Commoners. This act last named, when he had amended and reformed somewhat more precisely and with greater severitie then the rest, he could not carie cleerely and go through with, for the tumult of those that refu∣sed so to do, but that part of the penalties at length was quite taken away or els mitigated; an Of living unmarried. immunity also & toleration (of widow-head) graunted for After the de∣cease of a for∣mer wife or husband. 3 yeeres, & the rewards besides augmented. And notwithstanding all that, when the order of Gentlemen stood out stifly & stoutly calling in open sight, & pub∣likely for the repealing of the said Statute; he sent for GERMANICUS his chil∣dren, and taking some of them himselfe, & bestowing the others in their fathers armes, shewed & presented them unto their view signifying as well by the ge∣sture of his hand, as by countenance, That they should not be loath nor think much, to imitate the example of that young Gentleman.

The number of Senatours growing still to a shameful & confused company35 (for there were not of them so few as a 1000, and some most unworthy, as who after CAESARS death were taken into the house for favour or bribes; whō the common people termed Abortiv: Some reade or∣civos or orcinos, velut Orcoseu rra natos . obscure & base. abortive, (as it were untimely births or born before their time): he reduced to the auncient 300. stent & honorable reputation: and that in two elections the former, at their own choise, wil, & pleasure, whereby one man chooseth his fellow.

Orchestra; together with priviledge to keepe their place at the solemne publique feasts. Now, to the end that being thus chosen & allowed (as is above said) they might with more reli∣gious reverence & lesse trouble execute the functions belonging to Senatours: he ordained, That before any one sat him downe in his chaire, he should make devout supplication & sacrifice with frankincense & wine, at the And that they should not need to come and salute him, but save that labour. altar of that God, in whose temple they assembled for the time: and that ordinarily the Se∣nate should not be holden oftner then twice in a moneth, to wit upon the (c) Calend, & (d) Ies of the same: and that in the moneths Haply, by easo of u∣tage that was not o be neg∣lected. September & October, none els should be bound to give attendance, save those that were drawne by lot: by whose number, Decrees might passe. Furthermore, he devised to insti∣tute for himselfe, & that by casting lots, a privie Counsell for 6 moneths: with whom he might treat before hand of businesses and affaires to be moved unto a frequent Senate-house fully assembled. As touching matter of greater impor∣tance
put to question, he demanded the opinion of the Senatours, not after the usuall manner & in order, but as it pleased himselfe: to the end that everie man should bend his mind so intentively thereto, as if he were to deliver his owne advise, rather then give assent unto another. Other things there were besides, wherof he was the author and beginner:36 and among the rest: That the Acta Senat and not Sena∣tuonsulta: H meaneth Diur∣n acta . the proceedings that passed there every day of sitting. Acts of the Senate should not be pblished nor appeare upon record: Item that no magistrates after that they had left or given up their honora∣ble places, should est soones presently, be sent as governours into an provinces.

Dcem virs should summon and assemble the (a) Centum viral court, and call the Centum virs to the speare, which they onely were wont to do, that had borne the office of Questour shippe. And to the end that more men might beare their part in administration of37 the common weale, he devised new offices: to wit, The overseeing of the publike workes, the surviying of the waies streetes, and causies, of the water courses or conduits, of the channel of Tybris, and distributing corne among the people. Also the prouost∣ship of the Cittie: One An office which 3: me ioinctly bare: Triumvirate, for chusing Senatours; an another for re∣viewing & visiting the troupes or cornets of horsemen, so oftē as need required.

He re∣quired also and demanded, that so often as the Consulship was conferred upon him he might have for one; ij. colleagues or cōpanions in office: but he cold not obtaine it; whilest all men with one voice cried out, That his maiestie was abridged enough alreadie, in that he bare not that honourable office by himselfe, but with another. Neither was he more sparing in honorably rewarding martial prowes, as who38 gave order, that to 30.

Senatours Children, to the end they might be sooner acquainted with the af∣faires of State, he permitted to put on even at the first their viril gown: to weare likewise the Senatours robe poudred with broad headed purple studs; and to have their places in the Senate house. Also at their first entrance into warfare, he allowed them to be, not onely O men of Armes. militarre Tribunes in the legions, but also cap∣tainesColonels of 1000. foremen▪ over the Transrctia∣nis. horsemen in the wings.

That no slaue, who had ever beene bound and imprisoned, or examined by torture should obtaine the freedome of the Cittie, in any kind of enfranchisement what soeuer. The olde manner of going and wearing apparell also, he endevoured to bring into use againe.

He gaue the Aediles in charge not to suffer any person from thence forward, to abide or stay, either in the Common place or the Cirque▪ but (d) in a gowne, laying a side all clokes or mantills thereupon. His liberality unto all degrees of Citizens he shewed often times as occa∣sions41 and opportunities were offred: for both by bringing into the Cittie in the ALLEXANDRINE Tryumph the treasures of the (Aegyptian Kings he cau∣sed so great plentie of monie, that usurie fell, but the price of Landes and Lordships arose to auerie high reckoning: and also afterwards, so often as out of the goods of condemned persons there was any surplusage of monie remaining above their fines; he granted for a certaine time the free lone and use thereof to as many as were able to put in securitie for the principall, by an obligation in duple the summe. The substance and wealth of Senatours hee augmented, and whereas the valew thereof before amounted to the summes of Duple the worth of Gen∣tlemen. 800000.

Hee gave Largesses: Congiaries often times to the people but lightly they were of diuerse summes, one while 400, another while 300. and some times 200▪ and fiftie Sesterces: and he left not so much as boyes under age, whereas they had not wont to receive such congiaries, unlesse they were above eleuen yeares olde: Hee measured out also to the people by the Poll, Corne in times of scarcitie oftentimes at a verie lowe price, and otherwhiles freely, without payinge there∣fore: and as for the Tickets, of monie, he dupled the summe in them con∣teined, And that you may know, hee was a prince more respectiue of thrift and42 holesomenes, than desirous of popularitie, praise, & honour: when the people cōplained of the want & dearth of wine, he checked and snibbed thē with this most severe speech, That his sonne in lawe AGRIPPA had taken order good enough that men should not be athirst, by conueighing so many waters into the Cittie Vnto the same people demanding the congiarie; which indeede was by him promi∣sed, he aunswered; That his credite was good, and he able to performe his word: but when they earnestly called for one which hee had never promised, hee hit them in the teeth by an edict or proclamation with their dishonestie, & impudencie: assuring them, that give it he would not although he had in∣tended it. And with no lesse gravitie and resolution, when uppon his proposing & publi∣shing of a congiarie, he found that many in the meane time were manumised and inserted into the number of Citizens, he reiected such, and said; they should not receiue any, unto whom he had made no promise: and to all the rest hee
gave lesse than he promised: that the summe which he had appointed, might hould out and be sufficient. When upon a time, there was great barrainnesse and scarcitie of corne, being put to an hard exigent and to seeke a difficult re∣medie, in so much as he was driven to expell out of the Cittie, all the sort of young slaves pampered aud trimmed up for sale, as also whole scholes & com∣panies of Novice-fencers and sword players: all strangers and forainers, ex∣cept Physitians and scholemaisters: yea and some of the ordinarie houshold seruants: so soone as the market began to mend, and victuals grew plentifull, he writeth, That it tooke him in the head to abolish those publike doles of Corne for euer: because upon the trust and confidence of them, tillage was cleane laid downe. Howbeit he continued not in that mind long, as being assured, that the same doles might be set up againe one time or other by the ambitious humour (of Princes his successors.) And therefore after this he ordred the matter so indiffe∣rently, as that he had no lesse regard of the Citties fermours of tillage, & other undertakers and purueiours of the publike corne, than of the people and commons of the Cittie. In number, varietie, and magnificence of solemne shewes exhibited unto the43 people he went beyond all men. Hee reporteth of himselfe that he set foorth*   . plaies and games in his owne name foure and twentie times: and for other magistrates who either were absent or not sufficient to beare the charges, three and twentie times Diuers times, he exhibited plaies by everie streete, and those uppon many stages, and acted by plaiers skilfull in all languages not in the Common forum onely, nor in the ordinarie Amphitheater, but also in the cir∣que. In the enclosure called Septa, he never represented any sportes but the baiting and coursing of wild beasts and the shewes of champions-sight; ha∣ving built woodden scaffolds and seates for the nonce in Mars field. In like manner, he made the shew of a Navall battaile about the River Tiberis, having digged of purpose a spacious hollow pit within the ground, even there where∣as now is to be seene the grove of the CAESARS. On which dayes he bestowed warders in diverse places of the citie, for feare it might be endāgered by sturdie theeues and robbers, taking their vantage, that so few remained at home in their houses. In the Cirque he brought forth to doe their deuour. Charioters, Run: ners, and killers of savage beasts: otherwhiles out of the noblest young gen∣tlemen of all the Cittie. As for the warlike Riding or Turnament called Trie, he exhibited it oftenest of all other, making choyse of boyes to performe it, as well bigger as smaller▪ supposing it a matter of antiquitie▪ a decent and hono∣rable maner besides, that the towardly disposition and proofe of noble bloud should thus be seene and knowne. In this solemnitie and sport, he rewarded, C. NONIVS ASPRENAS Or lamed. weakened by a fall from his horse, with a wreath or chaine of gold, and permitted both himselfe and also his posteritie to beare the surname of TORQVATVS▪ But afterwards he gave over the repre∣sentation of such pastimes, by occasion that ASINIVS POLLIO the Ora∣tour, made a grievous and invidious complaint in the Senate house, of the fall that AESERNINVS his nephew tooke, who likewise had thereby broken his legge. To the performance of his stage plaies also and shewes of sworde fight, he employed some times even the Gentlemen and knights of Rome: but it was before he was inhibited by vertue of an Act of the Senate. For after
it verily, he exhibited no more, save onely a youth called L, IVIVS, borne of worshipfull parentage, onely for a shew: that being a dwarfe not two foote high, & weighing but 17. l'. yet he had an exceeding great voice. One day of the sword fight that he set forth, he brought in for to behould the solemnitie, euen through the midst of the Shew place, the Parthians hostages who then were newly sent (to Rome) and placed them in the second His lightnes was more to be noted than his short stature: For wheras the full height is 6: foote and the weight some∣what above 100: : this  of 2▪ foot s vnder that  portion the : ranke or row o seates  se or behind at his backe high∣er, and therfore  of: or  in a second seat from him of the one side, but in the same ranke fo ho∣nor sake: a∣bove himselfe: His manner was moreover, before the usuall daies of such spe∣ctacles and solemne sights, and at other times, if any strang and new thing were brought over unto him, and worthie to be knowne, to bring it abroad for to beseene upon extraordinary daies, and in any place whatsoever. As for exam∣ple, a Rhnoceros within the empaled or railed enclosure called Septa▪ a Tigre upon the stage: and a Serpent 50: cubits long, within the Hall Comitium. It for∣tuned that during the great Circeian games which he had vowed before, he fell sicke: whereby he lay in his litter and so devoutly attended upon the sacred chariots called Thnsae. Againe, it happened at the beginning of those plaies, which he set out when he dedicated the temple of Marcellus, that his curule chaire became unioincted, and thereby he fel upon his back: Also at the games of his nephewes when the people their assembled were mightily troubled & astonied, for feare that the Theater would fall: seeing that by no means he cold hold them in, nor cause them to take heart againe, he removed out of his owne place, and sat him downe in that part thereof which was most suspected: The most confuse and licentious māner of beholding such spectacles, hee refor∣med and brought into order; mooved thereto, by the wrong done to a Se∣natour, whom at Puteoli in a frequent assemble sittinge at their right solemne Games, noe man had received to him and vouchsafed a rowne. Hereupon when a decree of the Senate was passed, That so often as in any place44 there was ought exhibited publikely to be seene, the first ranke or course of Scates should be kept cleere and wholly for Senatours: he forbad the Embassadou of free nati∣ons and confederats to sit at Rome within the Orchestra: because he had found, that even some of their libertines kind were sent in embassage. The soldiers hee severed frō the other people. To maried men that were cōmoners, he assigned several rewes by thēselues. To Noble mens childrē under age his   or a rancke of their owne: own quarter: and to their teachers and governers the next thereto. He made an Act also, that not one of the base Commons wearing blacke and sullied gownes should sit so neere as the midst of the Theatre. As for women he would not allow them to behold so much, as the sword Fencers, (who customarily in the time past were to be seene of all indifferently) but from some higher And by con∣sequēce farther of. loft above the rest, Spectare con  . sit∣ting there by themselues. To the Vestall Nunnes he graunted a place a part from the rest within the Theatre, and the same iust over against the Pre∣tours Tribunall.

From these shewes and sights he would be absent many houres together, and otherwhiles whole dayes: but first having craved leave of the people, & recommended those unto them, who should sitte as presidentes of those Games in his turne. But so often as he was at them, he did nothing els but intend the same: either to avoide the rumor and speech of men, whereby his father CAESAR (as he said himselfe) was commonly taxed, namely for that in beholding those solemnities he used betweene whiles to give his mind to read▪ letters & petitions, yea and to write backe againe: or els uppon an earnest desire and delight he had, in seeing such pastimes, pleasure and contentment, wherein he never dissinuled, but often∣times frankely professed. And therefore he proposed and gave of his owne at the games of prise and plaies even of other men, Coronets and rewards. both many in number, and also of great worth: Neither was he present at any of these Greeke games (a) and solemnities, but he honored everie one of the Ac∣tors and provers of Maisteries therein according to their deserts.

In summe all those in generall, who had any hand in those publike games or set them forward a∣ny way, he deigned good rewards and had a speciall respect of them. The priui∣ledges of Champions he both maintained entier, and also amplified. As for sword fencers he would not suffer thē to enter into the lists, unlesse they might be discharged of that profession, in case they became victours. The power to chastice Actours and plaiers at all times and in everie place (granted unto the Magistrates by auncient law) he tooke from them, save onely during the plaies and uppon the stage. Howbeit he examined streightly neverthelesse at all times either the matches or combats of Champions called (b) Xystici, or the fights of sword fencers.

He equalled it also after a sort, and in some part with the verie Cittie of Rome in priviledges and estimation: by devising a new kind of Voices: Suffrages which the decurions or elders of Colonies gave every one in their owne Towneshippe, as touching Maiestrates to bee

Certaine Cities, confederate and in league with Rome, howbeit by over-much libertie running headlong to mis∣chiefe and destruction, hee deprived of their liberties. Others againe, either deepely in debt he eased, or subverted by earthquake he reedified, or able to al∣ledge their merits and good turnes done to the people of Rome hee endowed with the franchises of Latium; or else with freedome of Rome. There is not, I suppose, a Province, (except Affrick onely and Sardinia) but hee went unto it. Into these Provinces after he had chaced SEXTUS POMPEIUS thither, he pre∣pared to saile out of Sicilie and to crosse the Seas: but continuall stormes and extreame tempests checked him: neither had hee good occasion or sufficient cause afterwards to passe over unto them. 48 All those kingdomes which he wan by conquest and force of armes, unlesse some fewe, hee either restored unto those Princes from whom hee had taken them, or else made them over to other. KK. mere Aliens, Princes, his Associ∣ates hee conioyned also together among themselves by mutuall bonds of alli∣ance, as being a most ready procurer and maintainer of affinity and amity of every one; neither had he other regard of them all in generall than of the very naturall members and parts of his owne Empire. Moreover, he was wont to set Guardians and Governours over the saide Princes, when they were either young and under age, or lunatick and not well in their wits; untill such time as they were growne to ripe yeeres, or began to come againe to themselves. The children of very many of them, he both brought up and also trained and instru∣cted together with his owne. 49 Out of his militarie forces, he distributed both Legions and Auxiliaries by Provinces. He placed one fleete at Misenum, and another at Ravenna, for the defences of the Superi, called otherwise the Adriatich Sea: Venice gulfe. upper and Inferi, other∣wise. Tuci, or . i. the Tuskane Sea. nether Seas. A certaine number of Souldiours he selected for a guard, partly of the City, and in part of his owne person, ha∣ving discharged the regiment of the People of Spaine. Calagurritanes; which hee had retained about him, untill he vanquished ANTONIUS▪ and likewise of the Germaines which hee had waged among the Squires of his body, unto the disasterous overthrow of VARUS: And yet he suffred not at any time, to remain within the City more then 3 cohorts, and those without their pavilions. The residue, his manner was to send away to wintering places & sommer harbours about the
neighbour-townes. Moreover, all the souldiours that were in any place what∣soever, hee tied to a certaine prescript forme and proportion of wages and re∣wards, setting downe according to the degree and place of every one, both their times of warfare, and also theFees, pensi∣ons, land and living. commodities they should receive after the terme of their service expired & their lawfull discharge, least that by occasion of old age, or for want, they should after they were freed from warfare, be so∣licited to sedition and rebellion. And to the end, that for ever, and without any difficulty, there might be defrayed sufficient to maintaine and reward them ac∣cordingly, he appointed a peculiar Treasuri for soldiors with newDucentfimis et quinquagsi∣misr um ven ∣lium onis etiā damnatorum . with the two hundeth peny, and the fiftieth peny of wares sold: with the goods also of condemned persons. revenewes devised for their maintanance. And that with more speede and out of hand word might be brought, and notice taken what was doing in every province, hee disposed along the rode high-waies, within small distance one from ano∣ther; first, certaine young men as posts; and afterwards swift wagons to give intelligence. This he thought more commodious, and better to the purpose, that they who from a place brought him letters might be asked questions also, if the matters required ought. 50 In charters, patents, writs, bils and letters he used for his seale, at the first, the image of (a) SPHINX: Soone after, that of ALEXANDER the great: and last of all, his owne; engraven by the hand ofA cunning Lapidaie and graver in preti∣cu, stones.

Not to reckon up, how many and who they were of the adverse faction, that he vouchsafed pardon & life; yea, and suffred to hold still a principall place in the City: he was content and thought it sufficient, to punish IUNIUS NOVATUS and CASSIUS PATAVINUS, two commoners; the one with a fine of money and the other with a slight banishment: notwith∣standing that IUNIUS NOVATUS in the name of young AGRIPPA had di∣vulged a most biting and stinging letter, touching him, and CASSIUS PATA∣VINUS at an open table and full feast▪ gave out in broad termes, That he wan∣ted neither harty wishes nor good will to stab him.

And farther than this he neither for the present nor afterwards inquired into the matter. Likewise, when TIBERIUS grieved and complained unto him of the same indignity in a letter, and that uncessantly and after a violent manner, thus he wrote back againe: De not m good TIBE∣RIUS in this point follow and feed the humor of rourYoung im∣putin▪ his col∣ler & cruelty to the heate of youth & hote bloud: measu∣ring Tiberius by himselfe. age neither set it too neere your heart, That there is any man who speaketh euill of me; For it is enough for us, if no man be able to doe us harme 52 Albeit, he wist well enough, that Temples were usually graunted by de∣cree even unto Proconsuls, yet in no Province accepted hee of that ho∣nour, but ioyntlie in the name and behalfe of himselfe and of Rome.

When the people offered and instantly forced upon him the Dictatourship, he fell upon his knees, cast his gowne from off his shoulder, bared his brest, and with detestation of the thing, besought them not to urge him farther. 53 The name and title ofDom n, or S. Lord (a) he alwaies abhorred as a contumelious & reproachfull terme. When upon a time, as he beheld the plaies, these words were pronounced out of a ComoedieOr Enterude Mmo., O good and graciousOr Sr. Lord: whereupon the whole assembly with great ioy and applause accorded thereto, as if they had beene spoken of him: immediatly both with gesture of hand and snew of countenance, he repressed such undecent flatteries: and the next day reproved them most sharply by an edict: neither would hee ever after suffer himselfe to be called DOMINUS, no not of his owne children and nephewes either in ear∣nest or boord.

His minions & inward friends he would have to bee great and mighty men in the City; yet so, as they should have no more liberty than other Citizens, but be subiect to lawes and iudgements as well as the rest When ASPRENAS NONIUS (b), a man of neere alliance & acquain∣tance with him was accused by CASSIUS SEVERUS, for practising poison, & pleaded for himselfe at the Barr, hee asked counsell of the Senate, what they thought in duty he was to do? For I stand in doubt, quoth he, least being here pre∣sent as an advocate, I should acquit the prisonerOr offender. defendant and so hinder the course of law; againe, if I be absent & faile him, least I might be thought to forsake and pre∣iudice my friend: Whereupon, by all their consents, he sat there in theWithin the Bar, among the Advocates, as a well willer. Pues cer∣tain houres, but spake never a word nor affourded so much as a cōmendatorie speech in the defendants behalfe, as the maner of friends was to do in the triall of such cases. He pleaded the causes even of his very clients, and by name, of a certaineOr Targua∣tier, Starie some take this for a proper name of some souldiour of his. shield-bearer, (c) whom in times past he had called forth to serve him in the wars: he spake I say in his defence, when he was sued in an action of the case. Of all those that were thus in trouble, he delivered one & no more from making his appearance in Court: and him verily no otherwise, but by earnest praiers & entreating the Accuser before the Iudges: and him he perswaded at length to let fal his action. And CASTRITIUS it was▪ a man, by whose meanes he came to the knowledge of MURENAES conspiracie. How much, and for what demerits of his, he was beloved, an easie matter it57 is to make an aestimate. The acts & decrees of the Senate concerning his ho∣nors I passe over, as which may be thought wrested frō them either upon mere necessity or bashfull modesty. The Gentlemen of Rome of their owne accord and by an uniforme consent celebrated his birth feast alwaies for 2 daies to ge∣ther. All States & Degrees of the City, yeerely upon a solemne vow that they
made, threw small pieces of brasse-coine intoInto the rai∣led or empaled place named Septa▪ where sometime was that Lake. CURTIUS lake for the preser∣vation of his life & health. Semblably, at the Calends of Ianuarie every yeere they offred a newyeeres-gift in the Capitol unto him, although he were absent. Out of which masse & grosse sum he disbursed as much money, as where with he bought the most pretious Images of the Gods, and dedicated them in divers streets: as namely APOLLOIn the So∣makers sreet. SANDALIARIUS, & IUPITERIn the Tra∣gaedians street. TRAGAEDUS, andAli{que}. In re∣stitution &c. others besides. For the reedification of his house inMount Pa∣latine. Palatine consumed by fire, the old soldiours, The Decuries (of the Iudges) the Tribes, & many se∣verall persons by themselves of all sorts, willingly & according to each ones a∣bility brought in their monies together. Howbeit, he did no more but slightly touch the heapes of such money as they lay, & tooke not away out of any one above one single7d. ob. denier. As he returned out of any province, they accompa∣nied him honorably, not onely with good words & luckyFaustis omi∣bus. or, nomina∣tus. . names. wisnes, but also with songs set in musicall measures. This also was duly obserued, that how often so ever he entred Rome, no punishment that day was inflicted upon any person. 58 TheOr addition A. V, C. 758 surname in his stile of PAYER PATRIAE, they all presented unto him with exceeding great & unexpected accord. The Commons, first, by an Embassage which they sent unto Antium▪ then, because he accepted not ther∣of, at Rome as he entred the Theater to be hold the plaies, they tendered it a se∣cond time themselves in great frequencie, dight with Lawrell branches & Co∣ronets. Soone after, the Senate did the like, not by way of decree nor acclama∣tion, but by VALERIUS MESSALLA, who had commission from them all, to relate their minds in this maner. THAT, quoth he, which may be to the good and happinesse of thee & thy house O CAESAR AUGUSTUS (for in this wise we think, that we pray for perpetuall felicity &Felicit itm Rep. et lata hic: pro, fel. ci∣tatem et lta . prosperity to this Common∣wealth.) THE SENATE according with the people of Rome, do iointly salute thee by the name ofFather of the Courey. PATER PATRIAE. Vnto whom, AUGUSTUS with teares standing in his eyes, made answere in these words, (For I have set the very same downe, like as I didSicut Messella those of Messala) Now that I have (mine honorable Lords) at∣tained to the heighth of all my vowes and wishes, what remaineth else for me to crave of the immortall Gods, but that I may carie with mee this universall consent of yours unto my lives end? Vnto ANTONIUS MUSA his Physitian, by whose meanes he was recove∣red59 out of a dangerous disease, they erected a Statue, by a generall contribution of brasse, iust by the image of AESCULAPIUS.

Certaine Cities of Italy began their yeere that very day, on which he first came to them. Most of the Provinces, over & above Temples & AltarsAs if he had beene  Demi-God., ordained almost in every good Towne, solemne Games & Playes every fifth yeere in his honor.60 Kings his friends and Confederates both severally every one in his own king∣dome built Cities calling them Caesareae, and iointly altogether intended, at their common charges fully to finish the temple of Iupiter Olympicus at Athens which long time before was begun, & to dedicate it unto his Genius. And oftentimes, the said Princes leaving their realmes, going in Romaine gownes, without Di∣adems & regall Ornaments, in habit & manner of devoted Clients, performed
their dutifull attendance unto him day by day: not at Rome only, but also when he visited and travailed over the provinces. For as much as I have shewed already what his publique cariage was in pla∣ces61 of Commaund and Magistracies: in the managing also and administration of the Common-weale throughout the world both in warre and peace: Now will I relate his more private and domesticall life: as also what behaviour heeA. V: C. 711: 745 shewed and what fortune hee had at home, and among his owne, even from his youth unto his dying day. His mother he buried during the time of his first Consulship, and his sister OCTAVIA in the 54 yeere of his age. And as he had performed unto them both, whiles they lived, the offices of pietie and love in the best manner: so when they were dead, he did them the greatest honours he possibly could. He had espoused, being a very youth, the daughter of P. SERVILIUS ISAU∣RICUS:62 but upon his reconciliation unto ANTONIE after their first discorde at the earnest demaund of both their soldiours, that they might be conioyned and united by some nere affinitie, he tooke to wife (ANTONIUS) daughter in law CLAUDIA, the naturall daughter of Dame FULVIA by P. CLODIUS: a young Damosell, scarce mariageable. And upon some displeasure, falling out with FULVIA his wives mother, he put her away, as yet untouched and a vir∣gine▪ Soone after, he wedded SCRIBONIA, the wife before of two husbands, both men of Consular dignity, and by one of them a mother. This wife also he divorced, not able to endure, as hee writeth himselfe, her shrewd and per∣verseA: V. C: 715: conditions: and forthwith, tooke perforce from TIBERIUS NERO, LIVIA DRUSILLA his lawfull wife & great with child. Her he loved entirely, her he liked onely, and to the very end. Vpon SCRIBONIA he begat IVLIA By LIVIA he had no issue, although63 full faine he would. Conceive once she did by him; but she miscaried, and the Infant was borne before time. As for IVLIA, hee gave her in mariage first to MARCELLUS the sonne of his sister OCTAVIA, even when he was but newly crept out of his childes age. Afterwards, when MARCELLUS was departed this life, he bestowed her upon M. AGRIPPA, having by intreatie obtained of his sister, to yeeld up unto him her right and interest in her sonne Her daugh∣ters husband: in law. For, at the same time AGRIPPA had to wife one of the It seemeth the younger: MARCELLAE (her daugh∣ters) and of her body begotten children. When this AGRIPPA was likewise dead, he cast about and sought for divers matches a long time, even out of the ranks of Romaine Gentlemen, and chose for her, his wives sonne Emperour after him. TIBERIUS: whom he forced to put away a former wife then with child, and by whom hee had beene a father already. M. ANTONIUS writeth, that he had affianced the said IVLIA first, to ANTONIE his sonne: and afterwards to COTISO King of the Getes: what time ANTONIE himselfe required to have a  the Median K. of Armena or els he meaneth : Kings daughter likewise to wife. 64 By AGRIPPA and IULIA he had 3 nephewes, CAIVS, LUCIUS, and64 ARIPPA: nieces likewise twaine, IULIA and AGRIPPINA. IULIA he besto∣wed in mariage upon LUCIUS PAULUS, the Censors sonne: and AGRIPPI∣NA upon GERMANICUS, his , or ▪ his wiues nephewe, and both true; sisters (a) Nephew. As for CAIUS and LUCIUS he adopted them for his owne children at home in his house, having bought them of AGRIPPA their Father by the brazen coine Per , vel  as  bram. and (b) the balance. Whom being yet in their tender yeeres, he emploied in the charge of the cō∣mon
weale: and no sooner were they Consuls Elect, but hee sent them abroade to the government of Provinces and conduct of armies. His daughter and ∣ces above named, hee brought vppe and trained so, as that hee acquainted them with housewiferie, and set them even to carde, spinne and make cloth: for∣bidding them streighly either to say or doe ought but openly in the sight and hearing of all men, and that which might be recorded in their day Of accomp▪ bookes. Certes, so farre forth he prohibited and forewarned them the companie of strangers, that he wrote uppon a time unto L. Or . TUCINIVS, a noble young gentleman and a persona∣ble, charging him that he passed the bounds of modestie, in that he came once to Baiae for to see and salute his daughter: his nephewes, himselfe for the most part taught to reade, to write (c) & to swimme, besides the rudiments & first introductions to other Sciences. But in nothing travailed hee so much as in this, that they might imi∣tate his handwritinge▪ Hee never supped togither with them, but they satte at the nether ende of the Table: neither went hee any Iournie, but hee had them either goinge before in a Wagon, or else abovt him rydinge by his side.65 But as joous and confident as hee was in regard both of his issewe, and also of the discipline of his house, fortune failed him in the proofe of all. His daughter and niece either of them named IVLIA  with all kinde of leawdnesse and dishone∣stie he sent out of the way as banished: ij. of his Nephewes. CAIVS (a) and LVCIVS both, hee lost in the space of 18. moneths, CAIVS died in Lycia, LVCIVS at Massilia. His third nephewe AGRIPPA, togither with his wives sonne TIBERIVS (b) hee adopted his sonnes in the Forum of Rome by an Act of These Actes were called L∣ges Curiatae: made in a  hament of all the Curiae, in nomber 30, in∣to which, Ro∣main divided the Cittie. These lawes Sext. Papyr  collected into one Booke, and called it was  Papy∣rianum. , others red Stoidum, & Hrridum. i Sottsh & rude. all the Curiae. But of these twaine within a small time hee cast out of his favour, yea and confined aside unto  AGRIPPA, for his base Or that his daughter had beene Phoebe disposition and fell nature. Moreover he tooke much more patiently the death, than the reprochfull misdemeauours of his children. For, at the infortunitie of CAIVS and LVCIVS he was not extreamely dismaied and cast downe: mary, of his daughter & her leawd pranckes, he gave notice in his absence to the Senate, and that in writing, which his (c)  red openly before them: and for very shame he absen∣ted himselfe a long time and avoyded the company of men: yea, and that which more is, once he was of mind to put her to death. And verely, when as, about the same time a freed woman of his named PHOEBE, one of them that were privie to her naughti∣nes, knit her own neck in a halter, & so ended her dayes, he gave it out, that he wisht with all his heart he had beene * Phoebes father. Confined thus when she was, he debarred her wholly the use of wine, and all manner of delicate trimming and decking her bodie: neither would he permitte any man, one or other, bond, or free to have accesse unto her without his privitie and leave asked: nor unlesse he might be certified before, of what age, of what stature and colour hee was, yea and what (a) markes and skars he caried about him. After 5. yeares ende, he remooved her out of the and  , lib 1. Iland into the Continent where shee abode at more libertie somewhat, and not so streightly looked unto: For, to call her home againe once for all, he could by no meanes bee intreated: as who, many a time when the people of Rome besought him, earnestly and were ve∣ry instant with him in her behalfe, openly before a frequent assembly of them cursed such daughters and such wives: saying God blesse yee al from the like. The infant that his niece IVLIA bare after she was condemned, hee forbad expressely to take know∣ledge of, & to give it the rearing. As touching his nephew AGRIPA seeing him to proove nothing more tractable, but rather braine sicke every day more than other, he transported him (from Surrentum) into an Iland and enclosed him there, besides with a guard of soldiers. He provided also by an Act of the Senate, that in the same place he should be kept forever. And so often, as there was any mention made either of him or his ij. Daughter : neice. IVLIE, he used to fetch a sigh and grone againe, and with all to breake out into this speech. Wuld God I never had wedded bride Or else without any childe had died.
Friendship with any persō as he did not easily intertain, so he maintained & kept the same most cōstantly; not honoring only the vertues & deserts of euery man66 according to their worth, but enduring also their vices & deliquences at least wise if they exceeded not: for out of al that nūber of his depēdants ther wil hard∣ly be any found, during his frendship to have bin plunged in adversity & therby overthrown: except SALVIDIENVS RVFVS whom he had before advanced to the dignitie of Consul; & CORNELIVS GALLVS promoted by him to the pro vostship of Aegypt, raised both from the verie dunghill. The one of these for pra ctising seditiously an alteration in the state: & the other for his unthankeful andA, V. C, 714. 728, maltious mind, he forbad his house & all his provinces. But as for GALLVS, whē as both by the menaces of his accusers, & also by the rigorous Acts of the Senate passed against him, he was driuen to shorten his owne life: AVGVSTVS cōmēded verely their kind harts to him for being so wroth & grieuing so much in his behalfe: howbeit for GALLVS sake he wept, & complained of his owne hard fortune, in that he alone might not be angrie, with his friends, within that measure as he would himselfe: all the rest of his fauorites flowrished in power & welth to their lives end, as chiefe persons every one in their ranke: notwith∣standing some discontentment & mislikes came between. For otherwhiles, hee found a want in M. AGRIPPA of patience, and in MAECENAS of Taciturnitie & secrecie; when as the M. Agrippa: one upon a light suspicion of his cold love, : or , as i Au∣gustus, had loo∣ked sternely or strangly upon him. & affection, with a ielousie besides, that MARCELLVS should be preferred before him left all & went to MITYLENAE: the Mecaens. other (b) unto his wife TERRNTIA revealed a secret, as touching the detection of MVRENAES conspiracie. Himselfe al∣so required semblably mutual benevolence of his friends, as wel dead as living. For although he was none of these that lie in the winde to mung and catch at Inheritances, as who could never abide to reape any cōmoditie by the last will & testamēt of an unknown person; yet weighed he most strictly & precisely the Finall or last. supreme iudgments & testimonies of his friends concerning him, delivered at their deaths: as on who dissimuled neither his grief in case a man respected him slightly & without honorable tearmes; nor his ioy, if he remembred him thank∣fully & with kindnes. As touching either legacies or parts of heritages, as also portions left unto him by any parents whatsoever, his manner was either out of hand to part with the same unto their children, or if they were in their mino∣rity, to restore all unto them with the increase, upon the day that they put on their virile gownes, or else whereon they maried. A patron he was (to his freedmen) and a Maist. (to his bondservants) no lesse67 severe, than gratious & gentle▪ Many of his enfranchised men he highly honou∣red and imployed especially: by name, LICINIVS ENCELADVS, with others. His seruant COSMVS, who thought & spake most hardly of him, he proceeded to chastice no farther, than with hanging a paire of fetters at his heeles: As for Diomedes his Steward, who walking together with him, by occasion of a wild Bore running full upon them, for very feare put his Maist, between him∣selfe and the Beast, hee imputed unto him rather timiditie, then to bee any fault else: and although it were a matter of noe small perill, yet because there was noe prepensed mallice, hee turned all into a iest. Contrariwise, the selfe same man, forced to death PROCILLVS a freed man of his and whome hee set geatest store by, because hee was de∣tested for abusing mens wives. Or . GALLVS his Clerke or setary: scribe, had receiued 500: deniers
For making on priuie unto a letter of his hands: but he caused his legges to be broken for his labour. The paedagogue and other servitours attendant uppon CAIUS his sonne, who taking the vantage of his sickenesse and death bare themselues proudly and insolently in his ▪ province and therein commit∣ted many outrages, he caused to be throwne headlong into a River, with hea∣vie weights about their neckes.68 In the Prime and flower of his youth he incurred sundrie waies the infa∣mous note of a vicious and wanton life. Sext. POMPEIUS railed uppon him as an effeminate person. M. ANTONIVS layed to his charge, that he earned his unkles adoption, by suffring the filthy abuse of his bodie: Semblably, LUCIVS brother to the said MARCUS enveied against him, as if he had abandoned and prostituted his youth (deflowred and tasted first by CAESAR) unto A. HITIVS also in Spaine for 300000: sesterces: and that hee was wont to sindge his legges with red A kind of . hotte Walnutshels, to the end the haire might come up softer: The verie people also in generall one time on a day of their So∣lemne Stage playes, both construed to his reproach, and also with exceeding great applause verified of him a verse pronounced vppon the Stage, as touching a priest of (Cybele) mother of the Gods playing upon a Timbrell; Vides (a) ne Cinaedus rbem digito temperat. That he was a common adulterer his verie friends did not denie: but they69 excuse him for sooth: saying, That he did it not upon filthy lust, but for good rea son and in pollicy: to the end he might more easily search out the plots & pra∣ctises of his adversaries, by the meanes of women & wiues, it skilled not whose. M. ANTONIVS obiected against him besides his over hastie mariage Whome hee could not for∣beare, but many when she was, great with childe. with LIVIA, that he fetched a certaine Noble dame, the wife of one who had beene Consul, forth of a dining parlour, even before her husbands face, into his own bed chamber, and brought her thither backe again to make an end of the ban∣quet with her haire all ruffled, even while her eares were yet glowing red. also that he put away His owne wife. SCRIBONIA, because she was too plaine & round with him, upon griefe she tooke, that a Concubine was so great & might do so much with him: as also that there were bargaines and matches sought out for him by his friends, upon liking: who stucke not to view & peruse both wiues, & young mai∣dens of ripe yeares, all naked, as if TORAVIVS the baud were a selling of them: Moreover he writeth thus much to himself, after a familiar sort, as yet being not fallen out flatly with him, nor a professed enemy: What hath changed and altered you? Is it because I lie with a Queene, she is my wife. And is this the the first time? Did I not so 9. yeares since? Alas good sir. you that wold haue me cōpany with OCTAVIA my wife onely tell me true▪ know you for your part none other women but DRVCI LA go to: so may you fare well & have your health, as when you shall read this letter, you be not redy to deale carnally with Tertia. , Rufaas louers ve to name their sweete hearts. TERTVLLA or TERENTILLA, or RVFILLA, or SALVIA TITISCENIA or with all of them. And thinke you it skilleth not, where and whom you lust after and meddle with? Moreouer, much talke there was abroad, of a certaine supper of his more70 secret, ywis then the rest, & which was commonly called * (a) Dodecatheos: At which, that their sat guests in habit of Gods & goddesses, & himselfe among thē adorned insteed of Apollo: not onely the letters of ANTONIE, who rehearsed most bitterly the names of every one do lay in his reproach, but also these ver∣ses without an author so vulgarly knowne and rife in everie mans mouth:
Cum primum istorum conduxit mensa Choragum, Sexque Deos vidit Mallia, sexque Deas: Impia dum Phoebi Caesar mendacia ludit; Dum noua Diuorum caenat adulterium: Omnia se a terris tunc numina declinarunt.

Shrines longer stay. The rumor of this supper was increased by the exceeding dearth & famine at that time in Rome: and the very next morrow, there was set up this cry & note within the Cittie. That the Gôds had eaten up all the Corne: and that CAESAR was become , al∣ beds or, Tolos, Sutche∣ons in ∣tecture. Apollo in deede, but yet Apollo the (a) tortor: under which surname that God was worshipped in one place of the Cittie. Furthermore, taxed hee was for his greedie grasping after pretious house furniture and costly Corinthi∣an Vessels: as also for giving himselfe much to dice play. For, as in time of the proscription, there was written over his statue; Pater Argentarius, Ego Corin∣thiarius.* Not coun∣terfaite as at the supper overnight. My father was a Banking-monie changer, And I am now a Corinth-Vessell-munger. Because it was thought he procured some to be put into the bill of those that were proscribed, even for the love of their Corinthian-Vesselles: so afterwardes, during the Sicilian warre, this Epigrame of him went currant abroad. Postquam bisclasse victus naues perdidit. Aliquando ut vincat, ludit assidue aleam. Since time he lost his ships at Sea in fight defaited twice; That win he may sometime, he playes continually at dice. Of these criminous imputations or malicious slanders (I wot not whether)71 the infamie of his unnatuall uncleannesse he checked and confuted most easily by his chast life both at the present and afterward. Semblably the invidious opinion of his excessiue, and sumpteous furniture: considering, that when he had by force won ALEXANDRIA, he retained for himselfe out of al the kings houshold stuffe and rich Implements, no more but on cup of the pretious stone Or Murrha. Th  Myrrh▪ and soone after, all the brasen vessels which were of most vse, hee melted everie one. Mary for fleshly lust otherwise and wantonnes with women he went not cleere, but was blotted therwith. For afterwards, also as the report goes; he gave himselfe overmuch to the deflowring of young maides whome his wife sought out for him from all places. As for the rumour that ran of his diceplaying he bashed no whit thereat▪ and he played simply without Art and openly for his disport, even when he was well striken in yeares: and besides the moneth (a) December, upon other play dayes also, yea and worke daies too. Neither is there any doubt to bee made thereof. For in a certaine Epistle written with his owne hand: I supped, quoth hee, my Tiberius with the
same men: there came moreover to beare us companie these guests, VINI∣CIVS, & SALVIVS the father. In For Talorum lusus fuit . supper time we played Or bones. like olde men, both yesterday and to day. For when the Betweene di∣shes or courses of services. dice were cast (b) looke who threwe the chaunce, Canis or Senion, for everie die he staked and layed to the flooke a denier: which he tooke up and swooped all cleane, whose lucke it was to throw Venus. Againe in another letter. We liued full merily, my TIBERIUS, during the feast (c) Quin∣quatria: for, wee played everie day: wee haunted I say and heat the dicing house. Your Drusus : brother did his deede with many great shouts and outcries: Howbeit, in the ende he lost not much: but after his great losses gathered uppe his crummes pretily well by little and little beyond his hope and exspectation. I for my part, lost 20000. Sesterces in mine owne name: but it was when I had beene over liberall in my gaming, as commonly my manner is. For, if I had called for those loosing-hands which I forgave my fellow gamesters, or kept but that which I gave cleane away. I had wonne as good as 50000. cleere. But I choose rather thus to doe. or my bountie exaleth me unto caelestial glo∣ry. Vnto his daughter thus he writeth, I haue sent unto you 250. deniers: just so many as I had given to y guests a peece, if they would have played togi∣ther in supper time either at cockeall, or at even and odde. For the rest of his life, certaine it is, that in everie respect he was most continent, and without suspition of any vice. Hee dwelt at first, hard by the Forum of Rome above the winding staires72 ANULARIAE, in an house which had been CALVUS the Oratours: Afterwards in the mount Palatium: howbeit in a meane habitation, belonging sometime to HORTENSIVS, and neither for spacious receite nor stately setting out, and trim furniture, conspicuous: as wherein the galleries were but short, standing uppon pillers made of (soft) Albane stone: and the Refection Roumes without a∣ny marble or beavtifull pavements. For the space of 40. yeares and more, hee kept on bedchamber winter and summer: and albeit hee found by experience the Cittie not verie holesome in the winter for his health, yet continually he wintred there: If hee purposed at any time to do ought secretly, and without interruption: hee had a speciall roome alone by it selfe aloft which hee called (a) Syracusae. Or Techn∣phyon: Hither would hee withdrawe himselfe orderly, or else make a steppe to some Country house neere the Cittie, of one of his Libertines. Was hee sicke at any time? Then hee used to lie in MAECENAS his house. Of all his retyring places of pleasure, hee frequented these especially, that stood along the Maritime tract, and the Isles of Campania; or else the townes nere adioyning to the Cittie of Rome, to wit, Lanuvium, Praeneste and Tibur: where also within the Porches of Hercules Temple, he sat verie often to minister iustice. Large palaces and full of curious workes hee misliked: And verily, those that were sumpteously built he rased downe to the verie ground: his own, ∣ting the winter sun ne. as little as they were, he adorned and beautified not with trim statues and gay painted Tables, as with open For shad in Summer: walks, pleasant . as whales within pooles, &c. groves, and such things, as for their antiquitie and rarenesse were notable: Of which sort were at Capreae the huge members of monstrous * fishes and wilde beasts: the bones that are saide to bee of the Gyants, and the armour of the demigods and worthies in olde time: How slenderly provided he was of houshold stuffe and furniture otherwise73

He wore not lightly any apparell but of huswifes cloth, made within house; by his wife, his sister, his daughter and neipces. His gownes were neither streight and skant, nor yet, wide and large. His Senatours robe neither with overbroad studs of purple guarded, nor with narrow. His shoes underlaide somewhat with the highest, that hee might seeme taller than hee was. As for the raiment which hee used a∣broade, and his shooes, hee had them at all times layed readie within his Bedchamber, against all suddaine occurrents and unlooked for occasions whatsoeuer. He feasted daily: and never otherwise than at a set Coena rect, or rect, abso∣lutely, or diffe▪ rence of spor∣tula. table: not without great74 respect and choise of degrees and persons.

Spie of his. Hee came to the bourde himselfe when he made a feast, sometimes very late, and otherwhiles left the same as soone: and then his guests would both fall to their suppers before he sat downe,, and also continued sitting still after hee was gone. The suppers hee made consisted ordinarily of three dishes Tribus ferculis, not such as ours be: but framed in manner of Tropees, with devises that some meates might lye flat others hang thereupon. of meate and when hee would fare most highly of 6: at the most; and as he entertained his guests in no exceeding sumpteous manner, so he welcomed them with all the kindnesse and curtesie that might be.

Vpon this Or, did eate. retchlesse neglect of diet, he used divers times to take his supper alone, either before his other guests were set and fell to meate, or else after all was taken away, and they risen: whereas, at a full bourd he would not touch a bit. 77 Hee was by nature also a very small drinker of wine. CORNELIUS NE∣POS reporteth of him, that his usuall manner was during the time hee lay encamped before Mutina to drinke at a supper not above thrice. Afterwards, whensoever hee dranke most liberally hee passed not Ex hac in ob∣servanti, vol, ex ac obser∣vanti: upon this due obser∣ving of his, to cate when his stomack called for it, & not els. sixe Sextants; or if hee went beyond, he cast it up againe.

In all, at the most not above a good pint, or a small wine quart, cal∣led Sextarius,  of 18 ounces. day time. In steede of drinke hee tooke a sop of bread soaked in colde water; or a peece of a Coucumber, or a young lectuce head, or else some new gathered apple, , as we say, betwixt meales. sharpe and tart, standing much upon a winish liquour within it. 78 After his noones repast hee used to take his repose, and to sleepe a while, in his cloathes as he was, with his shooes (a) on, stretching (b) out his feete, and holding his hand before his eyes. After supper hee retired himselfe into a lit∣tle Closet (c) or Studie. And there continued hee by a candle farre in the night, even untill he had dispatched the rest of that daies businesse, either all or the most part. From thence, he went directly to his bed: Where, hee slept at the most not above seaven houres: and those verily not together but so, as in that space of time hee would awake three or foure times: and if hee could not recover his sleepe thus broken and interrupted (as it happened other∣whiles); hee would send for some to reade or Acdum, or aridum. i. dried, but yet of a wi∣nish tast. tell tales; and by their meanes* Or, to bold him with talke. catch a sleepe againe, and drawe the same out often after day-breake. Nei∣ther would he ever lie awake without one sitting by his beds side. Much offen∣ded hee was with want of sleepe (or waking) early in a morning: and if hee were to bee awakened sooner than ordinarie, either about some worldly af∣faires of his friends, or service of the Gods, because hee would not preiudice thereby his owne good or health; hee used to stay in some of his familiar friends upper roomes and loft, next to the place where his occasions lay. And even so, many a time for want of sleepe, both as he was caried through the streetes, and also when his licter was set downe, hee would betweene whiles take a nap and make some stay. 79 Hee was of an excellent presence and personage, and the same through∣out
all the degrees of his age most lovely and amiable; negligent though hee were in all manner of pikednesse, for combing and trimming of his head so carelesse, as that he would use at once many Barbers, such as came next hand, it skilled not whom: and one while hee clipped, another while hee shaved his beard; and yet at the very same time, he either read, or else wrote somewhat. His visage and countenance, whether he spake or held his peace, was so mild, so pleasant and lightsome, that one of the Nobles and Potentates of Gaule; confessed unto his Country-men, he was thereby onely staied and reclaimed, that he did not approach neere unto him, under colour of conference as hee passed over the Alpes, and so shove him downe from a steepe cragge to breake his necke, as his full intent was. Hee had a paire of cleere and shining eyes: wherein also, (as hee would have made men beleeve) was seated a kinde of Di∣vine vigour: and hee ioyed much, if a man looking wistly upon him helde downe his face, as it were against the brightnesse of the Sunne. But in his olde age he saw not very well with the left eye. His teeth grewe thinne in his head, and the same were small and ragged: The haire of his head was somewhat curled and turning downeward; and withall of a light yellowe colour. His eye-browes met together: his eares were of a meane bignesse: his nose both in the Toward his forehead. upper part, bearing out round, and also beneath somewhat with Dedctiore, or as some ex∣pound it, sharp & thin, Lepton. the longest. Of colour and complexion, hee was betweene a browne Inter aquilum candidum{que}, somewhat tan∣ned and sunne∣burnt, as Casan∣on seemeth to interpret it. and faire white. His stature but snort: (and yet IULIUS MARATHUS his freed∣man writeth in the Historie of his life, that hee was five foote (a) and nine in∣ches high). But as lowe as the same was, the proportionable making and fea∣ture of his limmes hid it so, as it might not be perceived, unlesse he were com∣pared with some taller person than himselfe standing by. 80 His body, by report, was full of spottes: having upon the brest and bellie naturall markes which hee brought with him into the worlde; dispersed, for the manner, order, and number, like unto the starres of the celestiall Charlemaine his waine. beare; as also certaine hard risings of thicke brawnie skinne, occasioned in divers places by the ytching of his bodie, and the continuall and forcible use of the Much like a curry comb.

In his left hucklebone (b), thigh and legge, hee was not very sound▪ in so much, as many times for griefe thereof he halted on that side: but by a remedie that he had of Sand (c) and Reedes, he found ease and went upright againe. Also, the fore-finger of his right hand hee perceived otherwhiles to be so weake, that* Destillationi∣bus icinore vi∣tiato. What if we thus point and read? De∣, iocinore vitiato: to this sence. That he was much suiect to rhewmes by occasiō that his liver was diseased, to wit, obstructed or stopped. being benummed and shrunke by a crampe upon some colde, he could hardly set it to any writing, with the helpe of an hoope and finger stall of horne. Hee complained also of the griefe in his (d) bladder, but voiding at length little gravell-stones by urine, he was eased of that paine. 81 All his life time hee tasted of certaine grievous and daungerous sicknes∣ses, but especiallie after the subduing of CANTABRIA: vvhat time, by rea∣son of his liver diseased and corrupted by Destillations, hee was driven to some extremitie: and thereby of necessitie entred into a contrarie (a) and despe∣rate course of Physicke: For, seeing that hote fomentations did him no good,
forced hee was by the direction and counsell of ANTONIUS MUSA his Phy∣sitiā, to be cured by colde. He had the experiēce also of some maladies which came (b) yeerely and kept their course at a certaine time. For about his (c) birth-day, most commonly he was sickish and had a faintnesse upon him: like∣wise in the beginning of the (d) Spring, much troubled hee was with the inflation of the midriffe and Vnder the short . hypochondriall parts: and whensoever the winde was southerly, with the murr and the pose. By occasion whereof, his body beeing so shaken and crasie, hee could not well endure either colde or heat. 82 In winter time clad he went against the colde with foure coates, together with a good thicke gowne, and his Wastcoate or Peticoate bodie of wool∣len: well lapped also about the (a) thighes and legges. During Sommer he lay with his bed chamber dores open, and oftentimes within a cloisture suppor∣ted with pillers, having water (b) walming out of a spring, or running from a  in a Conduit; or else some one to make (c) winde hard by him. Hee could not away so much as with the Winter sunne shine: and therefore even at home hee never walked up and downe in the aire withoutOr Bond∣grace. a broad brimd Hat upon his head. He travailed in a licter, and never lightly but in the night. The iourneyes that he made were soft and small: so as if hee went from Rome but to Tibu (a) or Preneste, he would make two daies of it. Could hee reach to any place by sea: hee chose rather to saile thither, than goe by land. But as great infirmities as he was subiect unto, hee maintained and defended his body with as much care and regard of himselfe: but principally by seldome In hot waters. ba∣thing (e): For, anointed hee was very often and used to sweate before a light fire: and then upon it to be dowssed in water luke warme, or else heated with long standing in the Sunne. And so often as he was to use the Sea waters hote, or those of Which natu∣raly were hot standing upon a veine of  stone. Albul for the strengthening of his sinewes, hee contented him∣selfe with this: namely to sit in a wooden bathing Tub, which himselfe by a Spanish name called DURETA, and therein to shake up and downe his hands and feet one after another, by turnes. 83 The exercises in (Mars) field of riding on horse-backe and bearing armes, he laid aside immediatly after the civile warres, and tooke himselfe, first, to the little (a) tennis-ball, and the hand-ball blowne with (b) winde. Soone after, he used onely to bee Either o horse backe, or in a charrlicter caried and to walke, but so as that in the end of every walke he would take his runne by iumpes, lapped and wrapped within a light garment caled Two foote & a halfe square. Sestertius (c) or a thinne vaile and sheete of linnen. For his recreation and pastime, his manner was sometime to angle or fish with the hooke, otherwhiles to play with cockall bones, or These the Romaines cal∣led Veneres su∣as, their play∣feres and dear∣ in a ho∣nest sence no such as the Greeks in  uncleane signi∣fication▪ named .  bagga∣ges, Catamites trundling round (e) pel∣lets, or else with nuttes even among little boyes; vvhom hee would lay for, and seeke out from all parts, if they were of an amiable countenance and could * prattle pretily with a lovely grace, but principally those of the Moores and Syrians kind. As for Dwarfes, crooked and mishapen Elves and all of that sort, he could not abide such, as being the very mockeries of natures work, and of unlucky .
Eloquence, and other liberall professions he exercised from his very child∣hood right willingly, and therein tooke exceeding great paines. During the84 warre at Mutina, notwithstanding that huge heape of affaires and occurrents, (by report) he read, he wrote, hee declaimed every day. For afterwards, nei∣ther in the Senate-house, nor before the people, ne yet to his souldiours made he ever speech, but it was premeditate and composed before: albeit hee wan∣ted not the gift to speake of a sodaine and ex tempore. Now, for feare least his memorie at any time should faile him, least also he might spend too much time in learning by rote, hee began to reade and rehearse all out of his written copie. His very speeches also with folke by themselves, even with LIVIA his wife about any grave and serious matters were never but penned and put downe in writing▪ out of which hee would rehearse the same, that hee might not speake otherwise ex empore or lesse than was meete. His pronunciation and utterance was sweete, carying with it a peculiar and proper sound of his owne: and continually he used the helpe of a Phonascus to moderate his voice: but sometimes when his throate was When he was hoarse, by ea∣son of rhewme. weakened, he delivered his orations to the people, by the mouth of a Crier. Many compositions he made in prose, of sundry arguments. Of which he85 would reade some in a meeting of his familiars, as it were in an Auditorie▪ as namely a Reioinder, called Rescripta, unto BRUTUS, against Vticensis. CATO. Which volumes, when for the most part, hee had rehearsed, being now well stricken in yeeres and growing wearie, hee made over to TIBERIUS for to be reade through. In like manner hee wrote certaine Exhortations unto Philosophie, and somewhat of his owne life: which hee declared in XXX. Libris, or rather xiii. according to , and all old Copies. thirtie bookes, even unto the Cantabrian warre, and no farther. As for Poetrie hee dealt in it but superficially. One Treatise there is extant written by him in Hexametre ver∣ses, The argument whereof, is Sicilie, and so it is entituled. There is another booke also, as little as it, of Epigrammes: which for the most part hee studied upon and devised whiles hee was in the Baines. For, having in a great and ar∣dent heat begun a Called Aiax. Tragaedie, when he saw his stile would not frame thereto and speede no better, he defaced and wiped it quite out. And when some of his friends asked him, How AIAX did? he answered, that his AIAX was Was wiped away or blot∣ted out with a spunge: allu∣ding to Aiax that fell upon his own sword: whereof So∣phocles made a Tragaedie en∣tituled Aiax. fallen upon a (a) Spunge. 86 The Eloquence that he followed was of an Elegant & temperate kind: wherein he avoided unapt and unfit Sentences, as also the stinking savours, as himselfe saith, of darke and obscure words: but tooke especiall care how to expresse his minde and meaning most plainely and evidently. For the better effecting whereof, and because hee would not in any place trouble and stay reader or hearer, hee stucke not either to put Prepositions unto Verbes, or to iterate Coniunctions very oft: which being taken away breed some obscurity, although they yeeld a greater grace. As for those that affect (a) new-made words, such also as use old termes past date, hee loathed and reiected alike, as faulty, both the sorts of them in a contrary kinde. Those he shooke up divers times, but especially his friend MAECENAS, whose (b) Murobrecheis Curled lokes or feakes, glib and dropping againe with sweat. cincinnos for these were his termes he evermore curseth and taxeth, yea and by way of (c) imitation merrily scoffeth at. Neither spared he so much as TIBERIUS for hunting otherwhiles after old words out of use, and such be obscure and hardly
understood. As for MARCUS ANTONIUS, he rateth him as if he were fran∣tick, for writing that which men may rather wonder at, than under stand. And pro∣ceeding to mocke his lewd and unconstant humour in choosing a kinde of e∣loquence by himselfe, he added thus much moreover. And are you in doubt to imitate CIMBR (d) ANNIUS and VERANIUS FLACCUS, so that you might use the wordes which CRISPUS SALUSTIUS gathered out of , who wrote a booke of Antiquities, so called. CATOES Ori∣gines? or rather transfer the rolling tongue of Asiatick Oratours, full of vaine words, and void of pithy sentences into our language and manner of speech? And in a cer∣taine Epistle, praising the ready wit of AGRIPPINA By his daugh ter Iulia, and M. Agrippa the mother of Ca∣lgula. his owne niece, But you have neede, quoth hee, to endevour that neither in writing nor in speaking, you be troublesome and odious. In his daily and ordinary talke certaine phrases hee had which hee used very87 often and significantly: as the letters of his owne hand writing doe evidently shew: In which, ever and anon, when hee meant some that would never pay their debts. He said, They would pay ad At the Greek Calendas at latter  for the Greeks had no Ca lends, no more than the La∣ties ∣as, i. rewe moones to be∣gin their mo∣neths with. And yet the word seemeth to be derived of Kal in Greeke. Calendas Graecas. And when he exhor∣ted men to beare patiently the present state what ever it was, Let us content our selves, quoth hee, with this Read . Saturnal. 2. CATO. To expresse the speedy expedition of a thing done hastily. Quicker, would he say, than SPARAGES can be sodden. Hee putteth also continually for Stltus *, Baceolus  A foole.: For Vel  a , vel ∣lus, a Blax, vel . Pullus, Pulleiaces: and for Ceritus, Vacerrosus; and in steede of Male se habere, Vapie se habere: and for Languere, Betizare, which commonly we meane by Lachanizare Or for . i. Pulgium, Puleiacem.. Semblably, for, simus, sumus; and dmos, in the genetive case singular for . And never used hee these two words otherwise, that no man should thinke it was a fault rather than a custome. Thus much also have I observed, especially in his ma∣nuscripts, That he never cutteth a word in sunder: nor in the end of any Or ∣sare. rewes transferreth the overplus of letters unto those next following, but presently putteth them downe even there underneath, and encloseth them (within a compasse line). 88 Orthographie, that is to say, the forme & precise rule of writing set down by Grammarians, he did not so much observe: but seemeth to follow their o∣pinion rather, who thinke, Men should write according as they speake. For, where∣as oftentimes he either exchangeth or leaveth cleane out, not letters onely but syllables also, that is a common errour among men. Neither would I note thus much, but that it seemeth strange unto mee, which some have written of him, namely, That he substituted another, in the place of a Consulare Lieute∣nant* Or nes. (as one altogether rude and unlearned) because hee had marked in his hand-writing, ixi, for, ipsi. And looke how often himselfe writeth darkly by way of ciphring, hee putteth . b. for . a.. c. for . b. and so forth after the same manner, the letters next following in steede of the former: and for. x. a du∣ple  a. Neither verily was he lesse in love with the studie of Greeke literature: For,89 even therein also he highly excelled, as having beene brought up and taught under the professed Rhetorician Apollodorus of Pergamus. VVhom beeing now very aged, himselfe as yet but young had forth of Rome with him to A∣pollonia. Afterwards, also when he was well furnished with variety of eruditi∣on and learning of (a) SPHAERUS; he entred into familiar acquaintance, with
AREUS the Philosopher and his two sonnes, DRONYSIUS and NICANOR: yet so, as for all that he neither could speake readily, nor durst compose anyIn Greeke: thing. For if occasion required ought, he drew it in Latine, and gave it unto a∣nother for to be translated into Greeke. And, as he was not altogether unskil∣full in Poemes, so he tooke delight even in the (b) olde Comoedie also, which he exhibited oftentimes to be acted in publique solemnities. In reading over and perusing Authors of both Languages, hee sought after nothing so much as holsome precepts and examples, serving to publique or private use: and those, when he had gathered out of them word for word, hee sent either to his inward friends and domesticall Servitours, or to the Commaunders of armies and Governours of Provinces: or else for the most part to the Magistrates of the Citie, according as any of them needed admonition. Moreover, whole bookes he both read from one end to the other unto the Senate, and also pub∣lished oftentimes to the people by proclamation: as namely, the Orations of Q. (c) METELLUS touching the propagation and multiplying of children: those likewise of RUTILIUS concerning the modelAs wel to cut of the expenses of sumpteous aed fices as to prevent danger by Skare-fires. and forme of buildings: thereby the rather to perswade them, That hee was not the first that lookt into both these matters, but that their fore-fathers in old time had even then a care and re∣gard thereof. The fine wits flourishing in his daies he cherished by all meanes possible. Such as rehearsed before him their Compositions he gave audience unto, courteously and with patience: notonely verses and histories, butWhich were not so usually red and reher∣sed in open au∣dience. ora∣tions also and dialogues. Mary, if anything were written of himselfe, unlesse it were done with serious gravity and by the best, hee tooke offence thereat; and gave the Praetours in charge not to suffer his name to be made vulgar and stale, in the trivial contentions (of Oratours, Poets, &c) when they were mat∣ched one with another. For Religious scrupulosity and Superstition, thus by heere-say hee stoode90 affected. Thunder and Lightning hee was much affraide of: in so much as al∣waies and in every place, hee caried about him for a preservative remedie aOr of a sea calfe, wich as Plinie writeth checketh all lightnings: Seales skinne: yea, and whensoever he suspected there would be any extraor∣dinarie storme or tempest, he would retire himselfe into a close secret roome under (a) ground, and vaulted above head: Which hee did, because once in times past, he had beene frighted with a flash of lightning, crossing him in his iourney by night; as we have before related. As for dreames, neither his owne, nor other mens of himselfe, he neglected.91 At the battaile of PHILIPPI. albeit hee meant not to step out of his pavilion by reason of sicknesse, yet went hee forth, warned so to doe by the dreame of hisMedici, Some read, amci, •. a friend: Physitian. And it fell out well for him: considering that after his Campe forced and woon by the enemies, his licter was in that concurse of theirs stab∣bed through and all to rent and torne, as if hee had remained there behind ly∣ing sicke. Himselfe every spring was wont to see many visions most fearefull, but the same proved vaine illusions and to no purpose: at other times of the yeere he dreamed not so often, but yet to more effect. When as hee ordinarily frequented the temple dedicated to IUPITER, the Thunderet in the Capitoll, he dreamed that IUPITER CAPITOLINUS complained, How his worshippers were taken from him perforce: and That hee answered, Hee had placed Thundering
IUPITER hard by him, insteede of aDore keeper, & Or top. Porter: whereuppon soone after hee a∣dorned theOr chime Lanterne of that Temple with aTo raise the porters. Ringe of belles, because such commonly do hange at mensAs beggers do. Gates. By occasion of a vision by night, he begged (a) yearely uppon a certaine day mony of the people, and held out his handOr peeces, worth, ob. q q. hollow to those that brought and offred unto him brasen * Dodkins or mites called Asses. Certaine foretokens and ominous signes he observed as unfallible presa∣ges,92 to wit, if in a morning his shoes were put one wronge, and namely, the left for the right, he held it unluckie: Againe, when hee was to take a∣ny long journey by land or sea, if it chanced to mizzle of raine, hee tooke that for a luckie signe betokening a speedie and prosperous returne. But moo∣ved he was especially with uncouth and supernaturall sights. There happened a date tree to spring forth betweene the very joincts of the stones before his dore, which he remooved and transplanted in the inward court of his dome∣sticallWherin they stood, Gods; taking great care that it might get roote and grow there. Hee joied so much that in the Iland Capreae, the boughes of a very old holmetree hanging and drouping now for age down to the ground, became fresh againe at his comming thither, that he would needes make an exchang with the State of Naples, and in liev of that Iland geve them AENARIA. Certaine dayes also hee precisely observed: as for example: hee would not take a journey any whither, the day after the (a) Nundinae: nor begin any serious matter uppon the Nones of a Moneth: Herein verily avoyding and eschewing nought ese, as he writeth unto TIBERIVS, but the unluckieDusphemian nominis: ominousnesse of the name. Of foraine ceremonies and religions, as hee entertained with all reverence93 those that were auncient, and whereof hee conceived good reason: so hee despised the rest. For having beene instituted and professed (in the sacred myste∣ries of CERES) at Athens, when afterwards he sat judicially upon the Tribu∣nall at Rome to here and determine a controversie as touching the priviledge of CERES priests in Attica, and perceiued that certaine points of great se∣crecie were proposed there to be debated: hee dismissed the assembly and multitude of people standing all about in the Court, and himselfe alone heard them plead the cause; But contrariwise, not onely when hee roade in visitation all over Aegypt, himselfe forbore to turne a little out of his way for to see (a) Apis, but also cōmended his nephew CAIVS, because in ryding through Iurie, he did not so much as onceOr do his de∣votions: make supplication in (b) Hierusalem. And seeing we have proceeded thusIn the histori∣call reports of so great and worthy a prin farre, it would not be impertinent to annex hereto, what befell unto him before hee was borne? What happened94 uppon his verie birth day? And what presently ensued thereupon? Whereby, that future greatnes and perpetuall felicity of his, might be hoped for and ob∣served. At velitre, part of the (Towne) wall in olde time had beene blasted by lightening: uppon which occasion, answere was given by ORACLE, that a Citizen of that Towne should one day be ruler of the world. The Velitrines, in confidence hereof, both then immediatly, and afterwardes also, many a time warred with the people of Rome, even wel neere to their own finall ruine and destructiō. At length (though late it was) by good proofes and evidences it appeared that the said strange accident, portended the mightie
power of AVOVSTVS. IVLIUS MARATHVS reporteth, that some sixe mo∣neths before AVGVSTVS Nativitie, there happened at Rome a prodigie pub∣likely knowne, whereby foreshewed and denounced it was, That nature was a∣bout to bring forth a King (a) over the people of Rome, at which the Senate beeing affrighted made an Act, That no man child that yeere borne should be reared and brought vp. But they whose wives then, were great bellied (for everie one was readie to drawe the hope unto himselfe,) tooke order, That the saide Act, of the Senate shold not be brought into the Cittie Chamber and there enrolled. I reade in the bookes of ASCLEPIADESor Mendesius bearing the name of the Cittie Mendes in Aegypt. Mendes entituled Theologoumenon,Of diuine dis∣courses. Howe ATIA, being come at midnight to celebrate the solemne sacrifice and divine seruice of Apollo, whilest other dames slept, fell fast a sleepe also; and sodainely a (b) ser∣pent crept close unto her, and soone after went forth from her: She therewith being awakened purified her selfe, as she would haue done uppon her husbands companie with her; and presently there arose to bee seene uppon her bodie a certaine marke or specke representing the picture of a serpent, which never af∣ter could be gotten out: in so much as immediatly thereupon shee forbore the publike baines for ever: Also, how in the x. moneth after, she was delivered of AVGVSTVS: & for this cause he was reputed to be the sonne of Apollo. The same ATIA, before she was brought to bed of him, dreamed that her entrails were heaved up to the stars, and there stretched foorth & spred all over the cō∣passe of earth and heaven. His father OCTAVIVS likewise dreamed, that out of the wombe of ATIA; there arose the shining beames of the Sun. The very day on which he was borne, what time as the conspiracie of CATILINE was de∣bated in the Senate house, and OCTAVIVS by occasion of his wives Child∣birth came verie late thither, well knowne it is and commonly spoken, that P.The mother of Augustus. NIGIDIVS understandinge the cause of his stay, so soone as he lear∣ned the hourefamous Astrologer. also when shee was delivered, gave it out confidently, That there was borne the Soveraine Lorde of the Worlde. Afterwardes, when OCTAVIVS leadinge an Armie through the secret partes of Thracia, inquired in the Sacred grove of Liber pater (according to the rites and ceremonies of that Barbarous Religion,) concerning his sonne, the same aunswere hee received from the Priestes there; For, that when the wine was powred uppon the Altars, there arose from thence so great a shining flame, as surmounted theAnd thereby the Horoscope of his Nativity Lanterne of the Temple. and so ascended uppe to Heaven: and that in times past the like strange token happened to ALEXANDER the great, and to none but him, when hee sa∣crificed uppon the same Altars. Moreover, the night next following, heeOr Steeple▪ presently thought he sawe his sonne carrying a stately Maiestie above the ordinarie proportion of a mortall wight; with aOctavius: Thunder bolt and a Scepter (in his hand) with the Triumphant Robes also of Iupiter.

While hee was yet a very babe, (as C. DRVSVS hath left in wri∣ting extant,) being by his nource laide in the evening within a Cradell in swad∣ling bands, beneath uppon a lowe floure: the next morning hee could no where bee seene: and after longe seekinge was found at last, lying uppon a* Augustus
verie high Turret just against the Sunne-rysinge. So soone as hee began to speake, hee commaunded the Frogges to keepe silence, that by the mannour of his Grandsires by the Cittie side, chaunced to make a foule noyse: and thereuppon ever after, the Frogges in that place are not able to croke. A∣bout foure miles from Rome, as yeeIn the way App. goe directly to Capua, it fell out, that sodainely an Aegle snatched a peece of bread out of his hand as hee tooke his dinner within a pleasant grove: and when he had mounted up a very great height, came gently downe of a suddaine againe and restored unto him the same: Q. CATVLVS after the dedication of the Capitol dreamed two nights together: In the former. him thought, that Iupiter Optimus Maximus: Whiles many young boyes, Noble mens sonnes, were playing abovt his Alter, seue∣red one of them from the rest and bestowed in his bosome the publike broade (c) Seale of theOr Ci State to carrie in his hand. And the next night followinge he saw in another dreame the same boy in the bosome of Iupiter CAPITOLI∣NVS: Whome when hee commaunded to bee pulled from thence, prohibited hee was by the admonition of the God, as if the same boy should be brought up for the defence and tuition of the Common-weale: Nowe the morrowe after, chauncing to meete with (young) AVGVSTVS, (whome earst hee had not knowne before,) hee beheld him wistly not without great admiration, and withall openly gave it out, That hee was for all the world like unto that boy of whom hee dreamed. Some tell the former dreame of CATVLVS otherwise: as if Iupi∣ter, (when as a number of those boyes required of him a Tutor) pointed out one of them, unto whome they should referre all their desires: and so lightly touching his lipps, & taking as it were an assay therof with his fingers, brought that kisse backe to his own mouth; M. CICERO having accompanied CAIVS CAESAR into the Capitoll, happened to report unto his familiar friendes the dreame hee had the night before: namely how a boy of an ingenious face and countenance, was let downe from heaven by a golden Chaine, and stoode at the doore of the Capitoll, unto whom Iupiter deliuered a (d) whip: Hereuppon espying at unawares (little) AVGVTVS whom (as yet altogether unknown to most men) his Vnkle CAESAR had sent for to the sacrifice, hee avouched plain∣ly, that this boy was very he, whose Image was represented unto him in a visi∣on as he lay a sleepe. When hee was putting on his virile gowne, it fortuned that his broadWhich Caesar had giuen him instead of ∣carecta. studded Coate with purple; being unstitched in the seames of both shoulders, fell frō about him downe to his feete.

IVLIUS of sacred memorie being about to choose a plot of ground: for to encamp in, about Munda, as he cut downe a wood, chanced to light upon a date tree which he caused to bee spared and reserved as the verie presage of victorie: from the root of it, there sprung immediately certaine shoots which in few dayes grew so fast, that they not onely equallized but over topped also and shadowed their stocke: yea and * doves haunted the same, therein to nestle and breede. notwithstanding that kind of birde cannot of all others away with any hard leaves and rough bran∣ches. Vppon this straunge sight especially, CAESAR, by report was mooved to suffer none other to succeede him in the Empire but his sistersDoues or con∣secrate to Ve from whence the Iulij are descended. By them therefore & the date tree was infigured perpetuall feli∣citie to that name and fa∣milia. Nephewe. AVGVSTVS, during the time that he was retired to Apollonia, went up in the
companie of AGRIPPA, into the Or schoole. gallerie of Theogenes the Or Astrolo∣ger. mathematician. Now, when AGRIPPA, (who inquired first what his owne fortune should be) had great matters and those in manner incredible foretold unto him; AV∣GVSTVS Augstus. himselfe concealed the time of his owne nativitie, and in no wise would utter the same; for feare and bashfulnesse, least he should be found infe∣riour to the other. But when, hardly after many exhortations and much a doe, hee had delivered the same, Theogenes leapt foorth and worshipped him. AVGVSTVS then anone conceived so greate a confidence in his for∣tunes, that hee divulged his Horoscope and the ascendent of his Natiui∣tie: yea and also stamped a peece of silver coyne, with the marke of the Celestiall signe Capricornus, under which figure and Constellation hee was borne. After CAESARS death, being returned from Apollonia, as he entred Rome95 Cittie, sodainely when the skie was cleere and wether verie faire, a certaine round coronet in forme of a raine bowe compassed the circle of the Sunne, and therewith soone after, the monument of IVLIA, CAESARS daughter was smitten with lightening. Moreover in his first (a) Consulship, whiles he atten∣ded to take his Augurie, there were presented unto him, like as to Romulus, 12 Or Vulturs. geirs: and as hee sacrificed, the Livers of all the beasts then killed appeared in open view enfolded double, and turned inwardly from the nether fillet; And no man of skill conjectured otherwise, but that prosperitie and greatnes hereby was portended. Furthermore, the very events, also of all his warres hee foresaw. What96 time as all the forces of the Antonie Lepdus, and Octaius Augu∣stus. Trimvirs were assembled together at Boonia, an Aegle perching over his tent, all to beat ij. Ravens that assailed and fell uppon her of either side, and in the end strucke them both down to the ground: which sight the whole armie marked verie well, and presaged thereby that one day, there would arise betweene the Colleagues of that Triumvirate such discorde, and the like ensued thereof, as after followed. At Philippi there was a cer∣taine And therfore by likelihoode a wizard. Thessalian, who made report of the future victorie: alledging for his au∣thor CAESAR of famous memorie, whose Orspectre.

About Perusia whē he offred sacrifice & could not  Obtaine the fauour of the Gods. speede, but demaunded (a) more beasts still to be killed: behold, the enemies made a sodaine sallie forth, caught up and carried away the whole provision of the Sacrifice. The Soothsayers then agreed uppon this point, Teat those pe∣rilous and adverse calamities which had beene threatned and denounced to him that sacrificed should light all, and returne upon their heads, who got the Inwards; And so it fell out in deed. The day before he fought the battaile at Sea neere Sicilie, as he walked upon the shore, a fish leapt out of the sea and lay at his feeet. At Acti∣m, as hee was going downe to fight the battaile, there met him in the way an Asse with his driver, the mans name was (b) EVTYCHVS, and the beasts Ni∣con: After victorie obtained, hee set uppe the Images of them both in brasse, within that Temple, into which hee converted the verie place where he encamped. His death also (whereof from hence forth I will write) and his deification97 after death was knowne before by many signes most evident, when hee had ta∣ken a review of the Cittie; and was about the solemne Called Lustr purging therof within
Mars fiela before a frequent assemblie of people: an Aegle there was that soa∣red oftentimes round about him, and crossing at length from him unto a house thereby, setled upon the name of AGRIPPA, and iust upon the first A. letter of that name; Which when he perceived, the vowes which the manner was to be made untill the next (a) Lustrum, he commanded his colleague TIBE∣RIVS to nuncupate and pronounce. For, notwithstanding the Tables and (b) in∣struments containing them were now written and in readinesse, yet denied he to undertake those vowes which he should never pay. About the same time the first C▪ in . letter of his owne name, upon a flash and stroke of lightening went quite out of the Inscription that stood uppon his statue: Aunswere was made by the Soothsaiers, that he was to live but iust one hundred dayes after: which number that letter did betoken; And that it would come to passe that hee should bee Canonized and registred among the Gods, because AESAR, the residue of the name CAESAR, in the Tuskane Language signified God. Being about therefore to send TIIVS away into Illyricum and to companie him as far as Beneventum, when diverse suiters, for one cause or other interrupted him, yea and detained him about hearing and determining matters iudicially, hee cryed out alowd (which also within a while was rec∣kenedFor Astra was a water towne with a river also of that name running by it as a prsaging osse,) That were he once out of Rome, he would never after be there againe what occasion soever might make him stay. And so being entered upon his journie he went forward as far as to Astura: and so presently frō thence (contrary (c) to his usuall maner,) with the benefite of a forewind & gentle gale * tooke water by night and sayled over. The cause of his sickenes he caught by a flux of the bellie. And for that98 time having coasted Campanie and made circuit about the Ilands next ad∣ioyning, he bestowed also foure dayes within a retiring place of pleasure at Ca∣pre: where he gave his minde to all ease and courteous affabilitie. It happe∣ned as he passed by the Bay of Puteoli, certaine passengers and souldiers out of a ship (a) of ALEXANDRIA, which then was newly arrived, all clad in white, dight also with garlands, and burning frankincense, had heaped upon him all good & fortunate words, chaunting his singular prayses in these terms. That by him they liued, by him they sayled, by him they enioyed their freedome, and all the ri∣ches they had. At which, he tooke great contentment and was cheered at the heart; Insomuch as thereupon he divided to everie one of his traine about him 40, (b) peeces of gold, but he required an oath againe & assurance of ech one, that they should not lay out that monie otherwise than in buying the wares (c) & commodities of ALEXANDRIA. For certaine dayes together that remained, among diverse and sundrie gifts, he distributed among them over and above, gownes and clokes, with this condition, that Romans should use the Greekish ha∣bite and speake likewise Greeke; the Greekes also weare Romaine attire and use their language. He beheld also continually the youthes exercising themselues (of whome their remained yet some store at Capreae) according to the of the greeke who sometime inhabited those parts. auncient custome. And even unto them he made a feast in his owne sight, permitting them or rather exacting of them, their olde libertie of sporting, of snatching appels and cates, and of skmbling for such small gifts and favours as were sent or skattered abroad. In one word, he forbare no manner of mirth and pastime. The Isle (d) hard by Capreae, he called Apragopolis, of the Idlenesse of such as
out of his traine retired themselues thither. But one of his beloved minions named (f) MASGAAS, hee had wont merily to call , as one would say, The foder of that Iland. The sepulcher of this MASGAAS (who died a yeare before) when he perceived one time out of his dining chamber to be fre∣quented with a sort of people and many lights: he pronounced this verse a loud which he made ex tempore. see the Tombe of The founder KTISTES all on fire. And therewith turning to THRASYLLUS a companion of TIBERIV sitting over against him, and not woting what the matter was, he asked him of what Poets making he thought that verse to be? And when he stucke at the que∣stion and made no answere, he came out with an other to it. Thou seest with lights MASGABAS honoured. Of this verse also he demaunded whom he thought to be the maker? but when THRASYLLVS returned no other answere but this, That whosoever made them, right excellent they were; he laughed a good and made himselfe exceeding merie. Soone after he crossed over to Naples, albeit even then his guts were greatly enseebled & Or if yee dis∣tinguish thus Morbo varante tamen &c yet by reason that his disease ate∣rod, & himselfe was better some time then other, the disease (g) grew variable: yet for all that, the (h) Quin∣quēnal Gymnick games instituted in the honor of him, he beheld to the very end, and so together with TIBERIVS went to the place appointed. But in his return from thence, his disease increased more and more, so as at length he yeelded to it, at Nola: where, having sent for TIBERIVS and called him backe from his journey, he held him a great while in secret tale; neither from that time fra∣med he his minde to any greater affaire. Vppon his dying day, enquiring ever and anone, whether there was as yet99 any sturre and tumult abroad as touching him? hee called for a A looking glasse. mirror, and commanded the haire of his head to bee combed & trimmed▪ his chawes also readie for weakenesse to hang or fall, to be composed and set straight. Then ha∣ving admitted his friends to come unto him, and asked of them whether, they thought he had acted well the Enterlude of his life? he adioyned with all this finall Or chaps. conclusion, for a Plaudite, Now clap your hands and all with ioy resounda shout. After this he dismissed them all, and whiles hee questioned with some that were new come frō the Cittie, cōcerning the daughter of DRVSVS thē sicke▪ sodainely amidst the kisses of LIVIA, and in these words he gave up the ghost, Live minafull LIVIA of our wedlocke, and so farewell. Thus died he an easie death and such as he had euer wisned to have, For lightly, so often as he heard of any body to have departed this life quickely & without all panges, he prayed unto God, that hee and his might have the like As the man∣ner is at the ende of Co∣dies to call for a Piaudite▪ hee persisted ther∣fore in the me∣taphor, and by this paudite, allegoizeta te end of this life, which hee called before Mmumrite.

And even that also was rather a pregnant presage of his minde, than a raving fitte and idle conceit of light braine. For so many souldiers they were indeede of the Prtorian bande: who carried
him forth (dead) into the streete upon their shoulders.

The Se∣nate both in setting out his Funerals, & also in honouring his memorialls, pro∣ceeded so farre in striving, who should shew greater affection, That among many other complements, some were of minde, That the pompe and solemne convy of his obsequies, should passe forth at the Triumphal gate with the image of vic∣torie, which is in the Court Iulia going before: and the chiefe Noble-mens chīl∣dren of both sexes singing a dolefull and lamentable song, others opined, that upon the very day of this funerall, their (b) rings of gold should be layd away and others of ron put on.

THE HISTORIE OF Tiberius Nero Caesar, vvrit∣ten by Caius Suetonius Tran∣quillus. THe Patritian familie CLAUDIA (for, there was likewise1 another Plebeian of that name, neither in power nor dig∣nity inferiour) had the first beginning out ofOr Regil. Regillum a Towne of the Sabines. From thence they came with a great retinue of vassals to Rome newly founded, there to dwell: induced thereto by the counsell of T. TATIUS fel∣low in government of the kingdome with ROMULUS; or (which is the more received opinion) through the perswasion of (a) ATTAOr Cla CLAUDIUS, a principall person of that house, about the 6 yeere after the kings were expelled and so, by the Senatours of Rome; raunged they were among the Patritij. Vpon this, soone after, they received by vertue of a graunt from the whole City, for their Clients & vassals, lands to occupy beyond the river Anio:
and for themselves aLocum. Some read lucum, not in the strict sig∣nification of a sacred Grove, but of a plea∣sant tuft of trees where∣with monu∣ments were beautified: as you may ga∣ther by the Mausoleum of Augustus. place of sepulture under the Capitol: and so forth, in processe of time obtained 28 Consulates, five Dictatures, Censures seaven, Triumphs sixe, and two Ovations. This family being distinguished by sundry fore-names and surnames both, in a generall consent reiected the fore-name of LUCIUS, after that two of their linage bearing that name were convict, the one of robberie, the other of murder. Among surnames it assumed the addition of (b) NERO, which in the Sabine tongue signifieth Strong or stout. 2 Many of these Claudij, as they deserved many waies passing well of the Common-wealth: so, in as many sorts they faulted and did amisse.

Moreover, very well knowne it is, that all the CLAUDII, excepting onely that P.

finde in his hart so much as to change his (e) weede, or to crave any favour at their hands. Nay, some of them there were, who in a brawle and altercation, stuck not to beat the very (f) Tribune of the Commons. Furthermore, aClaudia. A. V.

ANTONIUS. With whom, by occasion that shortly after, an attonement and peace was made betweene all parties, hee returned to Rome; and at the request of AU∣GUSTUS, yeelded unto him his owne wife LIVIA DRUSILLA, who both at that time was great with child, and also had already before brought him a sonne named TIBERIUS, in his owne house. Not long after, he departed this life, and left his children surviving him, namely TIBERIUS NERO and DRU∣SUS NERO. 5 Some have thought that this TIBERIUS (CAESAR) was borne at Fundae, grounding uppon a light coniecture, because his mothers Or his gran∣dame by the mothers side.

Yet there want not some who write otherwise: partly that he was Genitum. borne a yeere before in the Consulship of HIRTIUS and PANSA, and partly the yeere next following, wherein SER∣VILIUS ISAURICUS and ANTONIUS were Consuls. 6 His infancie and childhood both were exeeding Luxriosam . growing a pace to matu∣rity. forward (a) and the same full of toilesome travaile and daunger, by occasion that every where, hee ac∣companied his Parents still, in their flights and escapes. And verily, twice hee had like to have Or discove∣red. descried them with his wrawling at Naples, what time as a little before the forcible and suddaine entrie of the enemie, they made shift secretly to get into a ship: namely once, when hee was taken hastily from his Nources breast: and a second time out of his Mothers lap and armes, by those who as the necessity of the time required, did their best to ease the poore wo∣men of their burden and loade. Hee was caried away with them likewise through Sicilie and Achaia: yea, and beeing recommended to the Lacedae∣monians (who were under the protection of the CLAUDII their Patrones) for to take the charge of him in publique, as hee departed from thence by night, hee was in daunger of his life by reason of a light flaming fire, which suddainly from all parts arose out of a wood: and compassed all the com∣panie in his traine so; as that some part of LIVIAES apparell and the haire of her head was scorched and sienged therewith. The giftes bestowed up∣pon him in Sicilie by POMPEIA the sister of SEXTUS POMPEIUS, to wit, a little Cloake with a button or claspe to it: likewise studds and bos∣ses of golde, continue and are yet shewed to bee seene at Baie. After his re∣turne
into the Cittie of Rome, beeing adopted by M. GALLIVS a Senatour in his last will and testament, hee accepted of the inheritance and entred up∣pon it: but within a while forbare the name, because GALLIVS had sided with the adverse faction and taken part against AVGVSTVS. Being 9. yeares olde he praised his father deceased openly from the Rostrae. Afterwardes, as hee grewe to be a springall, he accompanied in the Actiacke tryumph the Chari∣ot of AVGVSTVS, ryding uppon the steede drawing without the Or spirn∣pole. yoke on the left hand, when as MARCELLVS the sonne of OCTAVIA rode upon the other on the right hand. Hee was president also at the Actiack Games and plaies yea & the Troian Turnament in the Circean solemnities, where he led the troupe of the bigger boyes. 7. After hee had put on his at 17, yeeres of age, virile robe, his whole youth and all the time be∣sides of the age next ensuing, even unto the beginning of his Empire, hee passed for the most part in these affaires following. He exhibited one sworde fight performed by fencers to the outrance, in memoriall of his father: like∣wise another in the honourable remembraunce of his Grandfather DRV∣SVS: and those at sundrie times and in diverse places: the former in the Or great market place. Forum, of Rome: the second in the Amphitheatre: having brought againe into the Lists, even those that were freed before time and discharged from that profession: whom hee now hired and bound to fight, with the summe of one hundred thowsand sesterces.

And when hee had begotten of her a sonne named DRVSVS, albeit shee fitted him well enough and was besidesA. V. C. 744. with Childe againe, enforced hee was to put her away; and foorthwith to wed IULIA the daughter of AVGVSTVS: not without much griefe and heart breake: considering that hee both desired still the companie of AGRIP∣PINA and also misliked the conditions and demeanour of IULIA, as whom he perceived to have had a minde and fansie unto him whiles shee was the wife of a former husband. Which verily was thought also abroade. But as hee grieved, that after the divorce hee had driven away AGRIPPI∣NA, so when hee chaunced but once (as shee mette him) to see her, hee followed her still with his eyes so bent, so swellinge, Readie as it were to run out of his head. and sta∣ring, that streight order was given, and a watch set, shee should never after come in his way nor within his sight. With IVLIA he lived at the first in great concord and mutuall love: but afterwardes hee began to Or disagree. es∣traunge himselfe, and (that which was the more griefe) hee proceeded to part beddes and to lie from her continually, namely, after that the pledge of love, their sonne beegotten beetweene them, was untimely taken a∣way: who beeing borne at Aquileia died a very infant. His owne bro∣ther Who died when he was Consuls A. V. C. 735. DRVSVS hee lost in Germanie, whose bodie he conveyed throughout to Rome going before it all the way on foote.
In his first rudiments and beginnings of civile offices, he pleaded at the8 barre in defence of Archelans; of the Trallians and Thessalians: all of them in sundrie causes whiles AVGVSTVS sat in iudgement to heere their tryall: In the behalfe also of the Ladicenes, Thyaterenes and Chians, who had suffered great losse by Earthquake, and humbly sought for reliefe, he intreated the Senate. As for FANNIVS CAEPIO. who together with VARRO MVRAE∣NA had conspired against AVGVSTVS, hee arraigned of high treason be∣fore the iudges, and caused him to hee condemned: And amid these af∣faires, he Whilest hee was Questour, and but 19 yeares olde. executed a duple charge and function: to witte, the purveyance of Corne and Victualles, whereof there happened to bee scarcitie: and the skouringe or riddance of the worke-house Fstulorum Such as bride wel and houses of correction: prisons▪ the Lordes and Maisters whereof were become odious, as if they had caught uppe and held to worke not onely waifaring persons, but those also who for feare of taking a militarie oath and to be enrolled, were driven to shrowd themselues in such corners and starting holes. His first service in the warres was in the expedition of Cantabria, what9 time hee had the place of a Colonell of a thousand foot∣men. A, V, C. 728, Tribune Militarie. Afterwardes, having theA. V: C: 728, conduct of an armie into the East parts, hee restored the kingdome of AR∣MENIA unto TIGRANES, and from the Tribunall seat did put the Dia∣deme uppon his head. Hee recovered also those militarie ensignes which the Parthians had taken from M. CRASSVS. After this hee governed as Regent that part of Gaule beyond the Alpes, called Comata: which was full of troubles, partly by the incursions of barbarous nations, and in parte through the intestine discorde of Princes and Nobles of the Countrie. Then, warred hee uppon the Rhetians and Vindelici, and so forwarde vppon the Pannonians and Germaines (whom hee vanquished all). In the Rhaetian and Vindelicke warres, hee subdued the Nations inhabiting the Alpes: in the Pan∣nonian, he conquered the Breuci and Dalmatians. In the Germaine warre hee brought over into Gaule 40000▪ that yeelded unto him, and placed them neere unto the Rhene banke, where they had there habitations assigned. For, which Acts, hee entred the Citie of Rome both Ovant (ryding on horsebacke) and also Triumphant mounted uppon a Chariot: being the Primus, some ad prius, i. an∣ rationem, before he had ridden o  or triumphed: A, V, C, 737, 738, 72, 747. first (as some thinke) that was honoured with Triumphant ornaments, a newe kinde of honour and never graunted to any man before: To beare Magistracie hee both beganne betimes, and also ranne through them all in manner joynctly without intermission, namely his Quaesture; Praeture and Con∣sulate. After some space betweene hee became Consul a seconde time, yea and also received the Tribunitian Authoritie for fiue yeares toge∣ther: In this confluence of so many prosperous successes, in the strength also of10 his yeares and perfect health, hee had a full purpose, sodainely to retire him∣selfe and remoove out of the way as farre as hee could.

Some are of opinion, that considering AVGVSTVS his children were nowe well growne, he of his owne accorde yeelded up unto them the place and po∣ssession as it were, of the second In adminstra tion of the cō∣mon weale: degree, which himselfe had usurped and held a long time; following herein the example of M. AGRIPPA, who having preferred M. MARCEILUS, to bee imployed in publike affaires, de∣parted unto MITYLENAE; least by his presence he might seeme to To darken their light hinder them or depraue their proceedings. Which cause even himself, but afterwards, alleadged: Marie, for the present, pretending the satietie that he had of hono∣rable places, and rest from his travailes, he made suite for licence to depart: nei∣ther gave he any eare to his owne mother humblie beseeching him to stay; nor to his father in law, who complained also that hee should be forsaken there∣by and left desolate in the Senate. Moreover; when they were instant still to holde him backe, hee abstained from all kinde of meate foure dayes toge∣ther. At length having obtained leave to be gone, he left his wife and sonne behind him at Rome, and forthwith went downe to Ostia: giving not so much as one word againe to any that accompanied him thither, and kissing very few of them at the parting. As he sayled from Ostia along the coast of Campanie, uppon newes that he11 heard of AVGVSTVS weakenesse, he stayed a while and went not forward: but when a rumor began to be spred of him, (as if he lingred there, waiting some opportunitie of greater hopes,) hee made noe more adoe, but even against winde and wether sayled through & passed over to Rhodes: having taken a de∣light to the pleasant and healthfull situation of that Iland, ever since he arrived there in his returne from Armenia. Contenting himselfe here, with a meane and small habitation, with a ferme house likewise by the Cittie side not much larger nor of greater receite, he purposed to lead a verie civill and private life: walking otherwhile in the Or publike place of exer∣cises.

These words of his were mistaken by those next about him. Whereupon; all the lazars and diseased persons were by commaunde∣ment brought into a publike porch or gallerie and placed there in order accor∣ding to the sundrie sorts of their maladies. At which unexpected sight, being much troubled and perplexed, he wist not for a good while what to do? how▪ beit he went round about from one to another, excusing himselfe for this that was done even to the meanest, poorest and basest of them all This onely thing and nothing else beside was noted, wherein he seemed to exercise the power of his Tribunes authoritie. Being daily and continually conversant about the Schooles and Auditories of professours, by occasion that there arose a great braule among the . Sophisters opposite in arguing cases and declaiming one a∣gainst other, there chaunced to bee one who perceiving him comming be∣tweene and inclining to favorize one part above the other; rayled bitterly at him. With drawing himselfe therefore by little and little, and reyring home to his house, he came forth sodainely againe and appeared with his Lictours: where he cited by the voyce of his cryer to appeare judicially before his Tri∣bunall, that foule mouthed rayling fellow, and so commanded him to be had
away to prison. After this, he had certaine intelligence given him that IVLIA his wife was convict and condemned for her incontinencie and adulteries; also that in his name (by a warrant directed from AVGVSTVS) she had a bill of divorse sent unto her. And albeit, he was glad of these tidings, yet he thought it his part, as much as lay in him, by many letters to reconcile the father un∣to his daughter: yea and how ever she had deserved badly at his hands, yet to suffer her for to have whatsoever he had at any time given unto her in free gift. Now, after he had passed through the time of his Tribunes authoritie, andA. V. C. 752 confessed at last, that by this retyring of his out of the way he sought to avoide nought else but the suspition of Ielousie and emulation with CAIVS and LV∣CIVS: hee made suite, That seeing he was now secured in this behalfe, and they strengthened enough and able with ease to manage and maintaine the second place in government, he might be permitted to returne and see his friendes and acquaintance againe, whose presence he missed and longed after. But hee could not obtaine so much: nay, admonished hee was and warned before hand, to lay a side all re∣gard of his friends and kinsfolke, whom he was so willing to leave and aban∣don before. Hee abode therefore still at Rhodes, even against his will: and hardly by the12 meanes and intercession of his owne mother wrought thus much, that for to cover his ignominie and shame, he might be absent under this pretence, as if he were AVGVSTVS his Lieutenant. And then verily, lived he not onely private to himselfe, but also exposed to daunger, and in great feare of some hard mea∣sure: lying close and hidden in the uplandish and inward parts of the Iland: and avoyding the offices of them that made saile by those coasts, who had frequen∣ted him continually: For as much as no man went into any province that way, as Lord Generall orAs Prator, proprtor, pro∣consul, &c: Magistrate, but he strucke a side and turned to Rhodes. Be∣sides, other causes there were of greater feare and trouble presented unto him. For when as he crossed the seas to Samos for to visit CAIVS,The sonne of his wife Iulia by Agrippa, his wives sonne, president of the East parts, he perceived him to be more estranged than before time through the slaunders and criminous imputations which M. LOLLIVS companion and governour to the saide CAIVS had put into his head. He was drawen also into suspition by certaine CENTVRIONS, whom his favour had advanced, & who at the day limited in their pasport were returned to the camp, That he had deliuered unto manyOr of his friends. (of them) MANDATES of an ambiguous & du∣ple construction, such as might seeme to sound the mindes of everie one and sollicite them to rebellion. Of which suspition being certified by AVGVS∣TVS, hee never rested to call for, and require to have some one of any degree and order what soever, to observe all his deedes and words. He neglected also his wonted exercises of horse and armour: yea and ha∣ving13 laid by theThe gowne. habite of his native Countrie, hee betooke himselfe to a cloke andPantofles or corke shooes after the gree∣kish fashion. slippers. In such a state & condition as this, continued hee almost two yeeres throughout, more dispised and hatefull everie day then other: insomuch as the Meniansians overthrew his Images and statues and upon a time, at a cer∣taine feast, where familiar friends were met together (by occasion that menti∣on was made of him,) there was one stood up who promised CAIVS, That in case he did but command and say the word, he would immediatly sayle to Rhodes and
fetch unto him the head of that exiled person: For so was hee commonly called. And chiefly upon this which was now no bare feare, but plain perill, enforced he was by most earnest prayers not onely of his owne but also of his mother, to require and seeke for to returne which he obtained at length with the helpe somewhat of good fortune. AVGVSTVS had fully set downe with himselfe to resolve upon nothing as touching that point, but with the wil & good liking of his elderCs, his nep∣phew or daugh ters sonne. sonne: now was he, as it happened at that time much offended and displeased with M. LOLLIVS, but to hisHis mothers husband. father in law (TIBERIVS) well af∣fected, and easie to be by him intreated. By the permission therefore and good leave of CAIVS called home he was; but with this condition. That he should not meddle one Iote in the affaires of State: Thus in the 8. yeare after his departure, returned he full of great hopes and14 A. V. C. 755. nothing doubtfull of future fortunes, which he had conceived as well by strang sights, as also by predictions and prophesies even from his very birth. For LI∣VIA whiles she went with child of him, among many and sundrie experiments which she made, and signes that she observed (and all to know whether shee should bring forth a man child or no?) tooke closely an egge from under an hen that was sitting, and kept it warme sometime in her owne, otherwhiles in her womens hands by turnes one after another, so long, untill there was hat∣ched a cock-chicken with a notable combe upon the head.

That ioyfull newes was comming, whereas at the verie same instant as they walked togither TIBERIVS was fully purposed to have turned him headlong downe into the sea, as being a false prophet, (for that things fell out untowardly and contrarie to his former predictions) & one besides; who chaunced for the most part to bee privie unto him of all his se∣crets. 15 Being returned to Rome, and having brought his sonne DEVSVS solemnly into theThere to cō∣mense & shewe the first proofe of pleading at Barre.

But from that time forward was there nothing pretermitted for the augmentation of his state and Maiestie: and much more after that AGRIPPA once was in disfavour and sent away: wher∣by the world tooke knowledge for certaine, that the hope of succession rested onely in him. 16. Nowe was the Tribunitian Authoritie conferred a second time uppon him, and that for the terme of 5. yeeres; the honorable charge and commissi∣on likewise, for to pacifie the State of Germanie was assigned unto him: and the Parthian Embassadours, after they had declared their message at Rome un∣to AVGVSTVS, were commanded to repaire unto him alsoGermanie into his province: But upon the newes that ILLYRICVM revolted, he remooved fromOut of Ger∣manie. A. V. C. 760. thence to the charge of a new warre, which, being of all foraine warres the most dan∣gerous since those with the Carthaginians, he menaged with the power of 15: Legions, & equal forces of Auxiliaries, for the space of 3. yeares in great extre∣mitie of all things, but especially in exceeding scarcetie of Corne. And not∣withstanding that he was oftentimes revoked from this service, yet persisted he unto the end fearing least the enemie so neere a neighbour and so puissant with all, should make head and come upon them, if they first did quit the place and retire. And verily, passing well paied and rewarded was hee for this perseve∣rance of his; as having thereby fully subdued and brought under his subiection all ILLIRYCVM. as farre as reacheth and spreadeth betweene Italie, the king∣dome of Noricum, Thracia, and Macedonie: betweene the river Danubius also and the gulfe of the Adriaticke sea.A. V. C. 762. Which glorious exploit of his was yet more amplified and encreased by the17 opportunitie of an occurrent that fell betweene. For, about the verie same time QVINTILIVS VARVS together with 3. Legions was overthrowne and defaited in Germanie: and no man made any doubt, but that the Germaines fol∣lowing the traine of this their victorie, would have ioyned with PANNONIA in case ILLYRICVM had not beene subdued before. For these his noble Acts, a triumph with many great honours was decreed for him: Some also delivered their sentence, that he should be surnamed PANNONICVS; others would have had the addition of Invincible: and some againe of PIVS, in his Style; But as touching any such surname, AVGVSTVS interposed his negative voyce, pro∣mising and undertaking in his behalfe, that he shold rest contented withi. Augustus. that, which he was to assume after his death: As for the Triumph, himselfe did put it of unto a further day, by occasion that the wholeOf Rome state, sorrowed for the o∣verthrow and losse above saide of VARVS: Neverthelesse, he entred the City in his rich Praetexta or imbrodred purple Robe, with a chaplet of lawrell upon his head: and so mounted up to the Tribunall erected for him in the (a) Septa,
whiles the Senate stoode to give attendance: and there, together with AU∣GUSTUS, in the mids betweene the two Consuls hee tooke his place and sate downe. From whence, after he had saluted the people, hee was honourably conducted round about all the Temples. 18 The next yeere following, being returned into Germanie, when hee percei∣vedA. V. C. 763. that the Varian defeature aforesaid hapned through the rashnesse and neg∣ligence of the Generall, he did nothing at all without the opinion of his Coun∣sell of warre. And whereas hee had used also before, to stand upon his owne bothom, and to rest in his selfe-iudgement alone; then, contrary to his man∣ner hee conferred with many as touching the menagement of the warre: yea, and he shewed more care and precisenesse in every point than his wont was afore-time. Being about to passe over the Rhene, all his provision of victuals strictly reduced to a certaine rate and stint, hee would not send over the water before he had considered (standing upon the very banke of the river) the lode of every Waggon, that no cariages might beeDeponerentur, vel deportar ∣tur. i. transpor∣ted and caried over. discharged or unloaden, but such as were by him allowed and thought necessary. When hee was once on the otherside of Rhene this course and order of life he held: Namely to sit up∣pon a bare banke of turfe, and so to eate his meate: to lie abroad all night, and take his rest oftentimes without tent: to deliver all directions for the day follo∣wing, as also what suddaine service or businesse was to bee enioyned, by wri∣ting; with this caveat and admonition, That whereof any man doubted, hee should repaire unto him at all houres of the night, and seeke for no other expositour but himselfe. Martiall discipline he required most sharply, bringing againe into ure and19 execution certaine kindes of chastisements and ignominious disgraces which had beene used in auncient times: in so much, as he branded with open shame the Lieutenant of a Legion, for sending a few Souldiours with his owne freed∣man ouer the other side of the river a hunting. As for battailes, albeit hee did put as little as might be upon the hazard of Fortune and chaunce: yet entred he upon them with much more resolution, so often as whiles hee watched or studied by a candle, the light suddainly fell downe and went out, when nobo∣dy forced it: trusting confidently (as hee said) upon this signe, which both hee and all his Auncestors had tried and found to be infallible during all their war∣like conducts and regiments. But howsoever hee sped well and had good suc∣cesse in this Province, he escaped very faire that hee had not beene killed by a certaineA Rhuteni qudam. Rhutene (a), who being among those that were next about his per∣son, and detected by his timorous gesture, was apprehended, and with torture forced to confesse his prepensed designment. 20 Being after two yeeres returned out of Germanie to Rome, hee rode in thatA. V. C. 76. triumph which he had differred, accompanied with his Lieutenants, for whom he had obtained (a) triumphall Ornaments. And ere hee turned into the Capi∣toll hee alighted from his Chariot, and bowed himselfe to the knees of hisAugust Caesar. Father, sitting then before him as President. A Captaine and Commaun∣der of PANNONIA named BATON, hee rewarded first, with exceeding great Presents, and then remooved him to Ravenna, in thankfull requitall
for suffering him upon a time, when with his Armie hee was enclosed within the streights, to passe forward and escape. After this, hee bestowed upon the people (of Rome) a solemne dinner, where they sate at a thousand tables▪ and gave besides to them three thousand Sesterces a peece for a Congiarie. Hee dedicated also the temple of Concord: likewise that of Pollux and Castor in his owne name & his brothers, all out of the spoile woone from the enemies. And not long after, when by vertue of an Act preferred by the Consuls,21 That hee should administer the Provinces iointly with AUGUSTUS: and likewiseA. V. C. 766. hold the generall review and muster of the people, hee had performed the same and finished it with a solemne purging called Lustrum, hee tooke his iourney into Illyricum. And being incontinently called backe out of the very way, he cameA. V.

I wote well, it is com∣monly received and beleeved, that when TIBERIUS after private conference was gone forth, these words of AUGUSTUS were over heard by the Cham∣berlaines.

Neither am I ignorant of this also, that some have written and reported of AUGUSTUS, How openly and in plaine termes without dissimuling, hee disliked his churlish behaviour and harshnesse of manners so much, as divers times being in plea∣sant discourse and mery talke, he would breake-of when TIBERIUS came in place: Howbeit, overcome by his wives intreaty and earnest praier he refused not to adopt him; or rather was induced so to doe, upon an ambitious humor and conceite of his owne, that leaving such a successour, himselfe might ano∣ther day be more missed and wished for againe. Yet cannot I be perswaded o∣therwise, but to thinke, that AUGUSTUS a right circumspect, considerate and prudent Prince did nothing, especially in so weighty a businesse, hand over head and without advise: but having duly weighed the vices and vertues of TIBERIUS, esteemed his vertues of more worth: and namely seeing that both he sware solemnly in a generall assembly of the people, That hee adopted him for the (b) good of the Common-weale▪ and also commendeth him in certaine Epistles for a most expert and martiall warriour, yea the onely Defender and Protectour of the people of Rome. Out of which, I have thought good to quote some places heere and there for example. Farewell most sweet TIBERI∣US, and God blesse your conduct and proceeding, warring as you doe for mee and the Muses. Againe, O most pleasant, and (as I desire to bee happy) right valiant man, or , i. thy friends. and accomplished Captaine, with all perfections, adiew. Also, Astouching the order and manner of your Sommer-campe, for mine owne part verily, my TIBERIUS, I am of this minde, That considering so many difficulties and distresses: in regard also of so great sloath and cowardise of Souldiours, no man in the world could performe the service better than you have done. And even they of your traine, who were with you doe all confesse, that this verse may be applied fitly unto you. (c) Vnus homo nobis vigilando restituit rem. One man alone by watchfull sight Our tott'ring state hath set upright. And whether, quoth he, there fall out any occurrent to be considered upon with more care and diligence, or whether I bee displeased and angry at any thing, I have a
great misse, I assure you, of my TIBERIUS: and evermore that verse of HOMER commeth into my remembrance: (d) * Iiad. . Whiles this man beares me company (so well he doth fore-see) We may ev'n out of flaming fire returne, both I and hee. When I heare say and read▪ that you are weakened and growne leane with uncessant and continuall labour, God confound me, if my body doe not quake and tremble. I pray you therefore spare your selfe: least if it come to our eares, that you are sicke, both I and your mother also die for sorrow, and the people of Rome beside, hazard the Em∣pire. It makes no matter, whether Ibe in health or no? Situ non va∣lebis: or, si tu modo Valeb. So you cc∣tue well. if you be not well; The Geds I beseech, to preserve you for us and vouchsafe your health both now and ever, unlesse they hate the people of Rome to death. The death of AUGUSTUS hee divulged not abroad, before that young A∣GRIPPA22 was slaine. This AGRIPPA was killed by a militarie Colonel Tribune, set and appointed to guard him, so soone as hee had read the writ Or warrant▪, whereby hee was commaunded to doe the deede. This writ, whether AUGUSTUS left be∣hind him when hee died, thereby to take away all matter that might minister tumult after his death: or whether LIVIA in the name of AUGUSTUS endi∣ted it, and that with the privity of TIBERIUS, or without his knowledge, it resteth doubtfull. Certaine it is, that when the saide Tribune brought him word, that the thing was dispatched which he had commaunded, he made an∣swere, That he gave no such commaundement, and added moreover, That he should answere it before the Senate: Declining no doubt the envie and hard conceit of men for the present: for within a while after he buried the matter in silence. Having nowe assembled the Senate by vertue and authority (a) of his Tri∣buneship,23 and begun to make a Which hee had penned. speech unto them by way of For the death of Augustus. Consolation: all on a suddaine, as unable to maister his griefe, he fell into a fit of sighing and groaning. Yea he wished, That not onely his voice, but his vitall breath also might faile him▪ and therewith gave the booke unto his sonne DRUSUS to read it out. After this, when the last will or testament of AUGUSTUS was brought in, and none of the witnesses admitted to come in place, but those onely who were of Senatours degree, the rest standing without the Curia & there acknow∣ledging their hands and seales, hee caused it to be read and pronounced by his freed man. The will began in this manner. For as much as sinister fortune hath bereft me of CAIUS and LUCIUS, my sonnes, I will that TIBERIUS CAESAR be mine heire, in the one moity and a sixth part. By which very beginning, their su∣spition* That is to say, in 8 parts of twelve, or 2 third parts was augmented who thought thus, that seeing he forbare not after this sort to make his preface, hee ordained TIBERIUS to be his successour upon necessity, rather than any iudgement and discretion. Albeit hee made no doubt to enter upon his imperiall government imme∣diatly24 and to menage the same, and that by taking unto him a strong guard of Souldiours about his person, that is to say maine force & the very forme of ab∣solute rule & dominion: yet notwithstanding, he refused it a long time: & put∣ting on a most impudent & shamlesse mind, one while he seemed to rebuke his friends that encouraged him thereto, as those who knew not, what a monstrous and untamed beast an Empire was: and otherwhiles with ambiguous answeres
and crafty delaies holding the Senate in suspence when they besought him to take it upon him, yea and humbly debased themselves before his knees▪ in so much as some of them having their patience moved therewith, could endure him no longer: and one among the rest in that tumult cried aloude, Let him either doe it at once, or else give over quite: and another openly to his face up∣braided him in these words, Whereas other men be slacke in doing and performing that which they have promised, he was slacke in promising that which hee did and per∣formed. In the end, as if forsooth he had beene compelled, and complaining withall, that there was imposed upon his shoulders a miserable and burden∣some servitude, he tooke the Empire upon him: and yet no otherwise, than gi∣ving hope, that one day he would resigne it up. His very words are these, Vntill I come unto that time, wherein yee may thinke it meete to give some rest unto mine a∣ged yeeres. The cause of this holding of & delay that he made, was the feare of imminent25 dangers on every side, in so much as he would often say, Hee held a Woolfe by the eares. For there was one of AGRIPPAES slaves named CLEMENS, who had levied & gathered together no small power, for to revenge his Maisters death: and L. SCRIBONIUS LIBO, a noble man▪ secretly complotted sedition and rebellion: yea, and a two-fold mutinie of the Souldiours arose, in Illyricum and in Germanie. Both the armies called hard upon him for performance of many matters extraordinarily: but above all, that they might have equall pay with the (a) Pretorian souldiours. And as for the (b) Germanician souldiours, they verily refused him for their Prince and Soveraigne, as not by them ordained: and with all their might and maine urged GIRMANICUS, who then was their Generall to take upon him the government of the State, albeit he withstood & denied them stoutly, Fearing therefore the issue and danger of this occurrent most of all, he required for himselfe to have that part of the Common-weale in charge, which it should please the Senate to lay upon him: seeing that no man was sufficient to weld the whole, unlesse he had another or many assistants ra∣ther ioyned with him. Hee feigned himselfe also to be sickly, to the end that GERMANICUS might with the better will and more patience abide in expec∣tance either of speedy succession after him, or at least waies of fellowship in the Empire with him. Well, after hee had appeased those mutinies, CLEMENS likewise by a fraudulent wile he over-raught, and brought to his devotion. As for LIBO, because he would not be thought at his entrance newly into the Em∣pire for to proceede rigorously, two yeeres after and not before he charged & reproved him before the Senate, contenting himselfe all that meane space to beware of him onely, and to stand upon his guard. For, as the said LIBO was together with him among other Pontifies sacrificing, hee tooke order, that in steed of the (yron) cleaver, there should be closely laid for him a chopping knife of Lead: And when the same LIBO requested upon a time to have secret talke and conference with him, he would not graunt it, without his sonne DRUSUS might be by: and so long as he walked up & downe with LIBO, he seemed to leane upon his hand; and so, held it sure enough all the while untill their com∣munication was ended. 26 But being once delivered frō this feare he caried himselfe at the beginning very orderly and after a civill sort, yea and somewhat Paulo mins quā priatum egit: or, little better than the port, &c. under the port of a pri∣vate
person. Of very many dignities and those right honourable, which by publique decree were presented unto him, he accepted but few, and those of the meanest kind. His birth-day-mind, falling out in the time of the Plebcian (a) games and plaies exhibited in the Cirque, hee hardly would suffer to be cele∣brated and honoured so much as with the addition extraordinarily of one cha∣riot drawne with two Steedes. Hee forbad expresly, any temples Flamins or Priests to be ordained for him, yea and the erection of Statues and images in his honour, without his leave and permission▪ the which ranne with this onely clause and condition, That they should not be set up among the images of the Gods, but stand with other ornaments of the house. Hee prohibited also by his negative voice the solemne oath of observing and keeping his Acts inviolably: as also to call the moneth Or Novem∣ber rather or in at hee was bon, of his own name. September, TIBERIUS; or or September of his mothers. October, LIVIUS. The forename also in his stile of (b) IMPERATOR; the surname likewise of PATER PATRIAE; as also a (c) Civick Coronet at the fore gate or porch of his Palace he refused. Nay, the very name of AUGUSTUS, haereditarie though it were, he would not put as an addition to any of his Epistles, but those onely which he sent unto Kings and great Potentates. Neither bare hee more than three Consulships: the first but a few dayes▪ the second three moneths; the third in his absence no longer than unto the Fō the Ca∣lerds or first day or Ianuary to the 15 of May. Ides of May. Hee derested flattery and obsequious complements so much, as that hee would admit no Senatour to his Licter side either by way of dutiful attendance,27 or otherwise about any businesse whatsoever. When a certaine One who had beene Cnsuh. Tacitus saith, it was Quintns Haterius. Consulare person was about to make satisfaction unto him, and humbly to entreate and crave pardon by a reverent touching of his knees, he started and fled from him so, as hee fell therewith and Whereby▪ the said Q Haterius had like to have beee kil∣led by the guard. lay along upon his backe. Yea, and that which more is, if in any talke or continued speech there passed words of him smel∣ling of flatterie, hee would not sticke to interrupt the speaker, to checke him, and presently to alter and correct such termes. One there was who called him DOMINUS, that is, Or Lord. S•. but hee gave him warning not to name him any more by way of conmely. Another chaunced to say, His sacred businesses: and a third againe, That he went into the Senate, auctore se. i. by his warrant or auctho∣ritie. Hee caused them both to change those words, and for auctore to say Sua∣sore, that is, by his advise and counsell: and in steede of Sacred, to put in, Laborious and painfull. Moreover, against railing taunts, bad reports and rumours, as also slaunde∣rous libels, verses and songs cast out either of himselfe or those about him,28 he stoode so firme and patient, as that ever and anone he would give out, That in a free state, folke ought to have both tongue and thought free. And when upon a time the Senate called earnestly unto him, That such crimes, and the offenders themselves might be brought iudicially into question; Wee have not quoth hee, so much leasure as to entangle our selves in many affaires. If yee open this window once, yee will suffer nothing else to be done: for under pretence heere of yee shall have the quarrels of every man preferred unto Ad vos. vel  unto us you. There is besides a passing civill Such as might beseeme one Citizen to speake of ano∣ther, and not a Prince of his ▪ A∣pophthegme of his extant which hee uttered in the Senate. If so be quoth he, that hee speake otherwise of mee than well, I will endeavour to give an account of my aedes and wordes, but in case hee continue so still, I will hate him for it a∣gaine.
And these things were so much the more remarqueable in him, for that in29 speaking to them  The Sena∣tours. either one by one severally, or to all at once in generall, yea and in reverencing them, himselfe exceeded in a manner the measure of all hu∣manity. When he dissented one day in opinion from Q. HATERIUS in the Se∣nate: Pardonmee, I beseech you, quoth hee, if I as a Senatour shall speake ought over-frankly against you and then directing his speech unto the whole house. Both nowe, quoth hee, and many times else, my Lords, this hath beene my say∣ing, That a good and gracious Prince, whom yee have invested in so great and so ab∣solute a power, ought to serve the Senate and all the Citizens generally: often times also, yea and for the most part, every of them particularly. Neither repent I that I have so said, for I have ever found you, and doe so still to be my good, my gracious and favourable Lords. Furthermore, he brought in a certaine shew of the common Libertie, by30 preserving entier for the Senate and Magistrates, both their auncient maiestie and also their authority: neither was there any matter so small or so great, per∣taining to publique or private affaires, but proposed it was at the Counsell∣table before the Senatours: as namely, about Tributes, Customes and Reve∣newes of the State: of Monopolies: of building and repairing any publique works: of enrolling or discharging Souldiours: of setting downe the number as well of Legions as of auxiliarie forces: Finally, who should have their place of commaund and government continued by a new commission? or take the charge of extraordinary warres? as also what, in what forme they thought it good to write againe, & to answere letters sent by Kings? A certaine Captaine over a Or wing cornet of horse-men, being accused for an outrage and for robberie, he compelled to make his answere before the Whereas by course he shold have had his ali before the Lord Ge neral, or prince himselfe. Senate. Hee never entred the Curia but alone. And being one time brought in sicke within his litter, (a) he caused al his traine and company to void. 31 That some Decrees were enacted against his minde and sentence, hee never once complained, nor found himselfe grieved. Notwithstanding hee opined, that Magistrates appointed to any charge, ought not to bee absent; to the end that by their presence they might the better intend their function and calling: yet one Pretour elect, obtained the favour of a free Liberam lega∣nem (a) embassage. Againe, when he advised in the Or Trebians Otriculunes behalfe a graunt, that they might bestowe the money in paving a cawsie or high-way, which was by legacie given to the building of a new Theater: hee could not prevaile but that the will of the Te∣stator should stand and be fulfilled. When it fortuned upon a time that an Act of the Senate should passe by going to a side, and himselfe went over to the o∣ther part where the fewer in number were, there was not one that followed him. Other matters also were handled and debated by the Magistrates and the ordinarie course of lawe, and not otherwise: VVherein the Consuls▪ bare so great sway and authority, that certaine Embassadors out of Africk repaired unto them for dispatch, as complaining that they were put-of and delayed by CAESAR unto whom they had beene sent. And no mervaile: For evident it was, that himselfe also would arise up unto the saide Consuls and give them the way. Hee rebuked Generalls of Armies even such as had beene Consuls for not32
writing unto the Senate of their warre exploites: also for consulting with him and asking his advise as touching the graunt of As collars, Chees, speares, chap∣lets &c. militarie giftes, as if it lay not in their owne power to give and dispose all. Hee commended a Pretour for bringing uppe againe the auncient custome, in the entraunce of his go∣uernment, to make an honourable mention and rehersall of his Anncestours before a frequent assembly of the people. The funerall obsequies of cer∣taine Noble personages, he accompanied with the common multitude to the very (a) fire. The like moderation he shewed in meaner persons and matters both when hee had called foorth unto him the Magistrates of the Rhodians, for delivering unto him publike letters from the State without the due (b) sub∣scription, he gave them not so much as one hard worde but onely commanded them to subscribe and sent them away. DIOGENES the professed Grammarian, who was wont to or reade a lecture. dispute and discourse at Rhodes every once a weeke or every 7. day Sabbath, had put him backe and would not admit him into his schoole comming of purpose extra∣ordinarily to here him, but by his page posted him of untill the 7. day. Nowe when the same DIOGENES stood waiting before his gate at Rome to doe his dutie and to salute him, he quit him no otherwise than thus, namely by war∣ning him to repaire thither againe 7. yeares after: when the presidentes and go∣vernours abroad gave him counsell to burden the provinces with heavie tri∣butes and taxes he wrote backe unto them. That it was the part of a good shepheard to sheare his sheepe and not to flay them:33 By little and little he put himselfe forth and shewed his princely maiesty; how ever for a long time, in some variety, yet for the most part, rather mild and grati∣ous than otherwise, and more inclined to the good of the common wealth: and at the first, thus far forth onely interposed he his absolute power & inhibition, That nothing should be doneBeside the le of law. vniustly. Therfore he both repealed certaine consti∣tutions of the Senate, & also very often, when the Magistrates were sitting judi∣cially upon the Bench, to decide matters, he would offer himselfe to joyne as it were in counsell and to be assistant with them, or else just over against them in the fore part (of the Tribunall.) And if the rumour went that any defendant were like by favour to escape cleere; all on a sodaine, he would be in place, and either on the (a) ground below, or else from the Tribunall seat of the L. chiefe Iustice, put the other Iudges and Iurie in mind of the lawes, of their conscience and religion, and of the crime whereupon they sat. Also if any thing were a∣misse and faultie in the publike ordinances and manners of the Cittie, for∣let by occasion of idlenesse or taken up through evill custome, he undertooke to reforme the same. He abridged and restrained the expenses of Stage playes andOf sword∣fencers. games exhi∣bited34 unto the people, by cutting short the wages paied to Actours uppon the stage, and reducing the couples of sword fencers to a certaine number. That Corinthian vessels & manufactures grew to an exceeding high rate, & that three barbels were sold for 30000. sesterces, he grievously complained, and gave his opinion, that there should be a gage set, and a mediocritie kept in houshold fur∣niture: as also that the price of victuals in open market should be ordred yeerly at the discretion of the Senate, with a charge given unto the Aediles for to inhi∣bite victualling houses, tavernes, and thus farre foorth, as they should not suffer any pastry-workes (a) to be set out to sale▪ And to the end, that by his owne ex∣ample
also, he might put forward the publike frugalitie, himselfe at his so∣lemne and festivall suppers caused oftentimes to be served vp to the bord, Vi∣ands dressed the day before and those halfe eaten alreadie, saying. That the side of a wild Bore had in it all the same that the whole. He forbad expressely by an E∣dict, the usuall and daily kisses commonly given and taken: likewise the inter∣course of new yeares gifts sent to and fro: Namely, that it should not continue after the Calends of Ianuarie. He had wont to bestow for his part a new yeares gift foure fold worth that which he received, and to give the same with his owne hand: but being offended that a whole moneth together hee was in his other affaires troubled with such as had not beene with him, nor felt his liberalitie uppon the verie feast, hee never gave any againe after the saide day. Wives of leawd and dishonest life, if ther wanted accusers to call them publikely into question, his advise and sentence was, that their next kinsfolke35 should,According to the maner and custome of their aunce∣stours. more maiorum agree together in common, for to chastice and punish.

But, as well them, as those light women aforesaid he banished all: that none ever after should by such delusion of the law seeke evasion. He tooke from a He deprived him from his Senatours place.

The mor∣row: his levi ie was notable as well in ma∣king choise so slightly as in casting her of so quicly, making but a game of mari∣age another. 36 All foraine ceremonies in Religion▪ the Aegyptian also and the Iewish rites he prohibited: compellingRomaine Citizens. those who were given to that Superstition, for to burne all their religious vestiments: the instruments likewise & furniture what soever thereto belonging. The serviceable youth of the Iewes, under colour of a militarie oth he sent into sundrie prouinces which were in a pestilent (a) and unhol-some aire above others: the rest of that Nation or such as were addicted to the like religiō, he banished out of Rome, upon paine of perpetuall bondage if they obeyed not. He expelled also Astrologers▪ but upon their ernest intrea∣tie and promise to give over the practise of that Art, he permitted them there to remaine. 37 Aspeciall care he had to keepe the peace, and to preserve the state frō out∣rages & robberies, as also from licentious mutinies & seditions. The set guards and garisons of soldiers, hee disposed thicker than the wonted manner was, throughout all Italie. Hee ordained a standing Neere unto the wals therof as  wri∣teth Li. 4. ▪ 5▪ Na.  Campe at Rome, wherein
the Praetorian Cohorts wandering up and downe before that time & dispersed in diverse Innes and ostelries, might be received. All Insurrections of the peo∣ple he punished most sharply; hee tooke likewise much paines to prevent such commotions. There happened upon some discord and variance to be a murder cōmitted in the Theatre: But the principal heads of the factiō, as also the actours themselnes for whose sake the quarrel and fray began, he exiled: neither could he ever be brought for any prayer and intreatie of the people to revoke and re∣store them. When the Commons of Pollentia would not suffer the dead corps of a certaine principall Centurian to be carried with funerall obsequies out of their market place, before they had forcibly extorted out of his heires hands a peece of money to the setting out of a game of Fencers with unrebated swords, he tooke one Cohort from Rome, and another out of K. A petie king about the Alpes. COTIVS Kingdome, dissimuling the cause of this journey, and sodainely discovering their armes and weapons which they closlely carried, and giving alarum with sound of trum∣pets, all at once he put them into the Towne with banner displayed at sundrie gates and so cast into perpetuall prison the greater part of the Commons and Senatours, o Aldermen. Decurions. The priviledge and custome of Sanctuaries, where ever they were, he abolished. The Cyzicenes who had committed some notorious out-rage & violence vpon Romaine Citizens, he deprived generally of their freedom, which in the warre against MITHRIDATES they had by their good service gotten. The rebellions of enemies he repressed: not undertaking therefore, any expe∣dition afterwards himselfe, but by his lieutenant onely: and not by them ve∣rily without lingring delayes, and driven thereto of necessitie. Kings that re∣belliously tooke armes, or were suspected to breake out, hee kept downe with threats rather and complaints, than otherwise by force and open hostilitie. Some of them, whome hee had trained out of their owne Realmes unto him with faire words and large promises hee never sent home againe: as by name MARABODUUS the Germaine, THRASYPOLIS a Thracian: and ARCHE∣LAVS the Cappadocian, whose kingdome also he reduced into the forme of a province. For two yeares together after he came unto the Empire, hee never set foote38 once out of Rome gates. And the time ensuing, hee absented not himselfe in no place unlesse it were in townes neere adioyning, or as farre as Antium when he trauailed farthest: and that was verie seldome and for a few dayes: albeit he promised and pronounced openly oftentimes that hee would visite the pro∣vinces also and armies abroade: yea and everie yeare almost hee made prepa∣ration for a journey, taking up all the waines and wagons that were to be got∣ten, and laying provision of Corne and victuals in all the good Burroughes & Colonies by the way, yea and at the last suffered vowes to be made for his going forth and returne home: in so much as commonly by way of a jest and by∣worde, hee was called (a) CALLIPPIDS, who in a Greeke proverbe is noted to bee alwaies running, and yet never gaineth ground one cubit for∣ward. But being bereft of both his sonnes, of which Adopted. GERMANICVS died in39 Syria, andNaturall. A. V. C. 779. DEVSVS at Rome, he withdrew himselfe into Campania, as to a rety∣ring place: and all men well neere, were fully perswaded and spake it as con∣stantly, that he would never returne but die soone after. Both which had
like indeede to have come to passe. For, in truth he never came againe to Rome: and within some few dayes, neere unto Tarracina, in a certaine part of his man∣nour house (built especially for his owne lodging) and called Spelunca, as hee fat there at supper, a number of huge stones from above chaunced to fall down: whereby many of his guestes at the Table and servitours there waitinge were crushed and squized to death; but hee himselfe beyonde all hope es∣caped, Having made his progresse over Campania, when he had dedicated a Capi∣tol at Capua, and the Temple of AVGVSTVS at Nola, which hee pretended to40 have beene the motive of his journey, he betooke himselfe to Capreae deligh∣ted especially with that Iland because there was but one way of accesse unto it and the same by a small shore and landing place: as being otherwise enclosed round about, partly with craggy rockes & steepe cliffes of an exceeding height; and in part with the deepe sea. But soone after, when the people called him home, and uncessantly besought him to returne, by occasion of an unhappie & heauy accident, wherby at Fieny XX. Strangers that conflowed thi∣ther to see the showes. thousand folke and more, at a solemn fight of sword players perished by fall of an Amphitheater, he passed over into the maine and firme land, permitting all men to come unto him: the rather, for that when he first set forth and went out of Rome, he had given streight commandement by an Edict that no man should trouble him, and all the way voided as many as were comming towards him. Being retired againe into the said Isle, he cast aside all care verily of Com∣mon weale; so farre forth as never after he did so much as repaire and make up41 the broken decuries of horse men: Hee chaunged no militarie Tribunes nor Captaines: no nor any presidents and Governours of Provinces. He held Spaine and Syria both, for certaine yeares, without Consulare Lieutenantes: hee neglected Armenia and suffered it to bee overrunne and possessed by the Parthians: Masia to be wasted and spoyled by the Dakes and Sarmati∣ans, as also Gaule by the Germanes, to the great shame and no lesse daunger of the whole Empire. To proceede, having now gotten the libertie of this secret place, and being42 as one would say remooved from the eyes of people: at lenght hee poured foorth and shewed at once all those vices which with much a do for a longe time he had cloked and dissimuled. Of which I will particularize and make relation from the very beginning. In the Campe when hee was but a newe and untrained souldier, for his excessiue greedinesse of wine bibbing, hee was for (a) TIBERIVS named BIBERIVS, for CLAVDIVS, CALDIVS▪ for NE∣RO, MERO: After being Emperour, even at the very time when hee was busie in reforming the publike manners and misdemeanour (of the Cittie) he spent with POMPONIVS FLACCVS and L. PISO one whole night and two dayes in In eating and drinking: gluttonie and drunkennesse, unto the former of these twaine he presently gave the governement of the province Siria: uppon the other hee conferred the Provostship of Rome, professing even in all his letters and writings; That they were most pleasant companions and friends at all assaies. To Or Sosius Gals. SEX: CLAVDIVS a Senex fomicatour and prodigal dingthrift, who had in times past been by AV∣GVSTVS put to ignominie and shame, yea and by himselfe some fewe dayes before rebuked before the Senate, he sent word, that hee would take a supper
with him: uppon this condition, that he altered nothing, nor left ought out of his ordinarie and customed manner: and namely, that wenches all naked should serue at the Table.

Vnto ASLLIVS SABINVS he gave 200000. Sesterces for a diologue of his making, in which he brought in a com bate or disputation, betweene the Mushrome, the (c) Ficedula the Oister and the (d) Thrush. To conclude, he instituted a new office, forsooth, For the devi∣fing of newe pleasures. &c. a voluptatibus, wherein he placed PRISCUS a gentleman of Rome, and one who had beene Censor. But during the time of his private abode in Capreae, he devised a roome43 with seates and benches in it, even a place of purpose for his secret wanton lusts. To furnish it there were sought out and gathered from all parts, a num∣ber of youngs drabbes and stale Catamites, sorted together▪ such also as inven∣ted monstrous kinds of libidinous filthinesse, whom he termed Spintriae: who being in three rankes or rewes linked together should abuse and pollute one anothers bodie before his face: that by the verie sight of them he might stirre up his owne cold courage and fainting lust. Hee had bed chambers besides, in many places, which he adorned with tables and petie puppets: representing in the one sort, most lascivious pictures, and in the other as wanton shapes and figures. He stored them likewise with the bookes of Elephantis: that none might be to seeke for a patterne of the semblable forme and fashion, in that beastly businesse performed in everie kind. He devised in the woods also and groves here and there, certaine places for lecherie and venereous Acts: where∣in he had within caves and holow rockes youthes of both sexes standing at re∣ceit readie prostitute, in habit of Paniskes and Nymphes; In so much as now men in open place, abusing the vulgar name of the Iland, termed him usually, or  or . Ca∣prineus.44 He incurred yet the infamie of greater and more shamefull filthinesse, such as may not well be named or heard, and much lesse beleeved: to wit, that hee should traine up and teach fine boyes the tenderest and daintiest that might be had (whom he called his little fishes) to converse and play betweene his thighes as he was swimming, and pretily with tongue and teeth seeme to make unto his secret parts, and there to nibble: Whom likewise, as babes of good grouth and strength▪ howbeit as yet not weaned, he should set unto his privie member as unto the nipple of a breast, to sucke. And verily, both by nature and for his yeares, more prone he was and given to lust in this . kind. Therefore, where∣as a certaine painted table of PARRASIVS making, (in which ATALANTA yeldeth her mouth unto MELEAGER in that beastlinesse) was given unto him as a legacie: upon condition, that if he were offended with the argument or matter represented therein, he might in lieu thereof receive a millian of Sester∣ces, hee not onely preferred the saide picture before such a summe of monie, but also dedicated it in his owne bed-chamber. It is reported besides, that be∣ing at sacrifice upon a time, he casting a fansie to the beautifull and well favou∣red face of a youth and servitour as he carried before him the Or incense pa. Censer, coulde not containe, but immediatly and before the complements of sacrifice were
well and fully performed, even there and then, take him a side out of the place and so abuse his bodie: and together with him a brother of his, the minstrel▪ yea and soone after, for that they twitted and upbraided one another for this abo∣minable act, he brake their legges both. Moreover, in what sort he was wont to offer abuse unto the very heads of45 women, and those nobly borne and of good reputation, appeared most evi∣dently by the wofull end of one dame named MALLONIA. For when shee was by force brought unto his bed, and most resolutely; to die for it, refused to suffer any more, than naturally a woman was to suffer: hee suborned certaine promoters falshly to accuse her: and evermore as she pleaded in her owne de∣fence asked her still, whether shee repented not yet of her Obstinacie? which hee followed so long, untill at length shee left the Court, made hast home to her house, and there ranne her selfe through with a Or dagger. sword: after shee had openly and aloud reproched the shag haired and rammish old churle with his filthy & beastly mouth. Wherupon in a by-enterlude called, Atellanicum Exodium, this infamous and shamefull Note, received with exceeding great accorde, was rife and currant abroade in everie mans mouth, That the olde bucke-goat was licking the Or shape, as the kind i of such beasts to do▪ nature of the does (or females.)

Having releeved the want and povertie of some Senatours, because he would not helpe more of them, he denied to succour any other than those, who alledged before the Senate good and just causes of their necessities. By which deede of his; he frigh∣ted the most part upon a modestie and bashfulnesse in them: & among the rest, one ORTALVS, the nephew of Q. HORTENSIVS the professed Oratour, who being of a very meane estate had begotten foure children, by the meanes He had ma∣ried a young wife upon hope of maintenance by vertue of the lawes Papia Popas, and Inla. and perswasion of AVGVSTVS. 48 As touching his publike munificence, he never shewed it but twice: once, when he purposed and published a free lone for 3. yeares of an hundred millians of Sesterces: & againe, when unto certaine Land lords of faire houses and tenements, which situate upon mount Caelius, were consumed with fire, he restored the full price and worth of them. One of these Boones he was forced to grant, by reason that the people in great want of monie called earnestly
for his helpe: what time as by vertue of an Act of Senate hee had ordained, That Vsurers should lay out two (third) parts of their Or patrimo∣ni Stock in lands, tene∣ments and appurtenances immoveable▪ the Debtours likewise make present payment of two parts of their debts; and yet the thing That therby their money might come abroad. was not done and dis∣patched accordingly: The other, for to mitigate the greevousnesse of those . i▪ dbis paid. heavie times.

Moreover, he made very seldome any As of their Generall discharges of olde Souldiours: as expecting upon age their death, and by death gaping for some gaine and vantage. Neither suc∣cored he the very Provinces with his bountiful hand, except it were Asia, by oc∣casion that certaine Cities With allow∣ance of lands, fees or yearely Pnfions for their service▪ therein were by earthquake overthrowne. 49 Afterwards, and in processe of time he gave his mind wholly even to ra∣pine and plaine pillage. It is for certaine knowne, That CN. LENTULUS the* In number 1 Plin. lib. 2, cap. 4. Euseb: Ch∣nic: 13▪ Augur, a man of exceeding great wealth, for very feare & anguish of mind was by him driven to a loathing and wearinesie of his owne life▪ and at his death to make no other heire but himselfe: That dame LEPIDA likewise, a right noble Lady was condemned by him, to gratifie Her husband QUIRINUS, one that had beene Consull, but passing (a) rich and And therfore he hoped to b his heire: childlesse withall: who having before time put her away beeing his wedded wife, twenty yeeres after called her iudicially into question, and laid to her charge, that long agoe she had bought and provi∣ded poison for to take away his life. Besides, as well knowne it is, that certaine Princes and Potentates of Gaule, Spaine, Syria and Greece, forfaited their estates upon so slight a slaunder and impudent imputation, that against some of them nought else was obiected but this, That they had part of their substance and wealth more than by law they might lying in money: yea and that many Cities and private persons lost their auncient immunities and priviledges, as also their right in mines and mettals, Tolls and customes: and finally that VONONES a King of the Par∣thians who beeing driven out of his kingdome by his owne subiects, retired himselfe with an huge masse of Treasure into Antiochia, under the protecti∣on, as it were, of the people of Rome, was perfidiously stript out of all and killed. The hatred that hee bare to his kinsfolke and neere Allies, hee bewraied,50 first in his brother DRUSUS by disclosing a letter of his: wherein hee dealt with him about compelling AUGUSTUS to restore the common Libertie: afterwardes, in others also. As for his wife IULIA, so farre was he from shew∣ing any courtesie or kindnesse unto her when she stoode confined (which had beene the least matter of a thousand) that whereas by an Ordinance of her fa∣thers, shee was shut up within one Towne, hee gave straight order that shee should not steppe out of dores, and enioy the Societie of people and world∣lie commerce: nay, hee proceeded so farre, as to bereave her of that little stocke and housholde-stuffe which her Father allowed her: yea, and de∣frauded her of the yeerely Pension and exhibition for her maintenaunce:
and all, forsooth, under a colour of common right and law; because AUGU∣STUS in his last will and testament had not expresly provided in this behalfe. Being notable well to endure his mother LIVIA, as chalenging to her selfe equall part with him in power and authority, hee avoided both to keepe ordi∣nary and daily company, and also to entertaine long speech or secret confe∣rence with her; because hee might not be thought ruled and directed by her counsailes; which otherwhiles notwithstanding he was wont both to stand in neede of, and also to use. Semblably, he tooke to the very heart the passing of this Act in the Senate, That in his stile as he had the title, sonne of AUGUSTUS, so this addition should runne withall sonne of LIVIA. And therefore it was, that he would not suffer her to be named Mother of her Country. PARENS PATRIAE, nor to receive any re∣markable honour in open place and by publique decree. Oftentimes also he admonished her to forbeare intermedling in greater affaires, and such as were not meet for women; especially after he perceived once, that when the Tem∣ple of Vesta was on fire, she also came thither in person among others, & there encouraged the people and souldiours both, to doe their best and help all what they could, as her manner was to doe in her husbands dayes. By these degrees he proceeded even to secret rancour & malice against her,51 but chiefly upon this occasion, as men report. She had been very earnest with him many a time to enrole one in the (a) Decuries of the Iudges who was made free Denizen & Citizen of Rome▪ but he denied flatly to choose and admit the party, unlesse it were upon this onely condition, That she would suffer a clause to be written & annexed to the Instrument Quorum no∣min, or such like. or Roll, in these words, This graunt was by my mother wrung and wrested from me. Whereat she highly displeased and offended, brought forth out of her Closet & Cabinet certaine old letters of AU∣GUSTUS (written) unto her, as touching his perverse, bitter and intollerable manners; and those she openly read. He againe tooke the matter so greevously, that she had both kept those writings so long by her, and also cast them in his dish so spitefully, that some thinke this was the greatest cause of his departure from the Citie. And verily, for the space of three yeeres compleat, during which time hee was absent and his mother living, hee sawe her but once: and that was no more than one day, and very fewe howers of the same. And af∣terwards as little minde hee had to be by her lying sicke: and when shee was dead, suffering her corps by staying so long above ground (whiles men ho∣ped still of his comming) to corrupt at length and putrifie: after shee was en∣terred, he forbad that she should be canonized and registred in the Catalogue of Saints: pretending as if she her selfe had given that order. Her will hee an∣nulled, all her friends and familiars, even those unto whom upon her death∣bed she had committed the charge of her Funerals, within a short time he per∣secuted and plagued, yea and one of them, to wit, a worshipfull Gentleman of Rome, he condemned to the Or wheele & bucke Ani∣liam: Sme read, in Ant i∣am, or Anticyrā  an Iland: or else Lacunam, a dungeon in the common prison. pump. 52 Of his two sonnes, hee loved neither DRUSUS that was by nature, nor GERMANICUS by adoption, as a father should doe; as taking offence at the vices of the Of Drusus. one. For DRUSUS was of an effeminate minde; given to a loose and idle life. Therefore was not TIBERIUS so neerely touched and grieved for him beeing dead; but presentlie after his funerall, returned to
his ordinarie and accustomed businesse prohibiting vacation , as the mner was in any mourn∣full time. of Iustice to continue any longer. Moreover, when the Iliensian Embassadours came som∣what with the latest to comfort him; he, (as if now by this time the memorie of his sorrow had beene cleane worne out,) scoffed at them and made this an∣swere, That hee likewise was sorie in their behalfe for the lesse they had of HECTOR, so noble and brave a Citizen. As for GERMANICUS, he depraved and disgraced him so, as that not onely he did extenuate and diminish all his worthy exploits as mere vaine and needlesse, but also blamed his most glorious victories, as daungerous and hurtfull to the Common-wealth. Also, for that without his advise, hee went unto Alexandria, (by occasion of an extreame and suddaine famine) hee complained of him in the Senate: yea, and it is verily beleeved, he was the cause of his death, and used the meanes of CN. PISO, Lieutenant of Syria; who soone after beeing accused of this crime, would (as some thinke) have uttered abroad those directions and warrants that hee had so to doe: but that SEIANUS secretly withstood it. For which, TIBERIUS was oftentimes and in many places much Ni Seianus secret obstart  or, Nisi easec, e∣ta chstaret i▪ but that they were in secret delivered, and therefore could not be proved. blamed, and in the night season commonly called upon with this crie and note, Redde Germanicum. i. Giue us GERMANICUS againe. The suspition whereof himselfe afterwardes confirmed and made good, by afflicting in cruell manner the wife also and children of the said GER∣MANICUS. 53 Furthermore, his daughter Increpitum: others read in∣scriptum i. This inscription was in many places set upon his Statues. in law AGRIPPINA, for complaining over∣boldly of him after the death of her husband, he tooke by the hand, and recited unto her a (a) Greeke verse to this effect, If thou hast not soveraine Rule and Do∣minion,* Germanicus his adopted sonnes wife, & daughe to Agrip and Iulia. quoth he, Thinkest thou prety daughter that thou art wronged? and so vouch∣safed her no speech at all after. Also, because upon a time, when shee durst not at supper tast of those appels which he had reached unto her, he forbare to invite her any more; pretending, that she charged him with the crime of attempting her with poison: when as in deede, it was of purpose plotted & packed afore∣hand, both that himselfe should by the offring of such fruit tempt her, and she againe beware most present and assured death. At the last, having untruly ac∣cused her, as if shee minded to flie one while to the Statue of AUGUSTUS, and another while to the Armies, hee confined and sent her away to the Isle Pandataria; and as shee railed at him, hee by the hands of a Centurion with whipping and lashing her over the face strucke out one of her eyes. Againe, when as shee was fully determined to pine herselfe to death: hee caused her mouth perforce to bee opened, and meate to be crammed into her throate: Yea, and after that by continuance in this minde shee consumed quite away and died in the end, hee inveighed against her in most odious and reproachfull termes: having opined first in the Senate, that her birth-day also should bee reckoned among the dismall and unlucky dayes. Furthermore, he expected thankes, as for an high favour done unto her, in that hee strangled her not be∣fore with acord, and so flung her to the Scale. (b) Gemoniae, and in regard of such a singular clemencie as this, hee suffred a Decree to passe, That thankes should bee given unto him, and a Present of Golde consecrated unto IUPITER CAPITO∣LINUS. Whereas by GERMANICUS he had three nephewes, NERO, DRUSUS &5
CAIUS; by DRUSUS one, to wit TIBERIUS, when he was left destitute and fatherlesse by the death of his children, the two eldest sonnes of GERMANI∣CUS, namely NERO and DRUSUS, he recommended to the LL. of the Senate; and celebrated the day of both their Commencements with giving a Or Largesse. Con∣giarie to the people▪ But no sooner understoode he, that upō New-yeeres-day there had beene publique vowes made by the Citie for their life also and pre∣servation, but he gave the Senate to understand, That such honours ought not to be conferred upon any persons, but those that were experienced and farre stept in yeeres, Thereby, having discovered the inward character and canker of his hart, from that day forward hee exposed them to the slaunders and imputations of all men: When also, by sundry subtile devises hee had wrought so, that they might bee both provoked to give railing taunts, and also beeing so provoked come to mischiefe and destruction; he accused them in his letters, heaped most bitterly upon them hainous reproaches, caused them to be iudged enemies to the State, and so hunger-starved them to death; NERO, within the Isle Pontia, and DRUSUS at the very foote and bottome of Palatium. Men think that NE∣RO was driven to To famish his owne selfe wil∣fully. worke his owne death, what time as the Or executio∣er.

As for DRUSUS, kept he was from all foode and sustenance: in so much as hee gave the attempt to eate the very flockes that stuffed the Or bed. mattresse whereupon hee lay: And the Bones and ashes which was done by him of spight. reliques of them both, were so dispersed and scattred abroade, that hardly they could be ever gathered together. 55 Over and above his olde friends and familiars, hee had demaunded twenty out of the number of the best and principall Citizens, as Counsailours and Assistants unto him in publique affaires. Of all these, hee could hardly shewe twaine or three at the most alive: the rest, some for one cause and some for a∣nother he brought to confusion and killed▪ among whom (with the calamity and overthrow of many more) was AELIUS SEIANUS, whom hee had to the highest place of authoritie advaunced, not so much for any good will, as to be his instrument and right hand, by whose ministerie and fraudulent practises he might circumvent the children of GERMANICUS, and so establishe as heire apparent in succession of the Empire the Nephew he had by DRUSUS, as his naturall sonne. No milder was he one iote unto the Greeke Professours and Artists, living56 and conversing daily with him, and in whom hee tooke most contentment. One of them named ZENO, as hee reasoned and discoursed very * exactly of a question he asked, What harsh Dialect Or curi∣ously. that was, wherein he spake? and when hee answered, It was the Dorick▪ he confined him for his labour into Cynaria, sup∣posing that he twitted and reproached him for his olde vacation and absence from Rome because the Rhodians spake Dorick. Semblably, whereas his man∣ner was out of his owne daily readings, to propound certaine questions as hee sate at supper: having intelligence, That SELEUCUS the Grammarian en∣quired diligently of his Ministers and Servitours, what Authors at any time hee had in hand, and so came prepared to assoile the saide questions, first hee forbad him his house and ordinarie Societie, afterwards hee forced him even to death.
His cruell, close and unpliable nature was not hidden no not in his verie57 childhood▪ the which THEODORUS GADARAEUS his teacher in Rhetorick, seemed both at first to fore-see most wisely, and also to expresse and resemble as fitly, when by way of chiding and rebuke hee called him ever and anone Pelon Haimati Pephuramenon;. i. Or mire. clay soaked Clay so tem∣pered becom∣meth verie strong, tough and stiffe. in bloud. But the same brake out & appeared somewhat more, when he became Emperour, at the very be∣ginning: what time as yet he lay for to win the love and favour of men, with a pretence of civill moderation A certaine A scoffing iester. Buffon there was, who as a Fune∣rall passed by, had willed the party whose body was caried forth, to report unto AUGUSTUS, That his Legacies were not yet payed and delivered, which hee* Eato mortu, or care mortu, i. with a loude voice called upon the dead man, &c. had left for the Commons of Rome. Him, he caused to be haled and brought unto his presence, to receive also the debt which was due: and then commaunded him to be led to execution, and so to relate the truth unto his father (AUGU∣STUS). Not long after as he threatned to send unto prison one POMPEIUS a Romaine Knight, for stoutly denying some thing, hee assured him, That of a POMPEIUS he would make him a POMPEIANUS, glauncing by this bitter and biting taunt, both at the mans name & also at the old infortunity of  The Pom∣peani, that took part with Pompeius a∣gainst Iulius Caesar that side. 58 About the same time, when the Pretour came to know of him, whether his pleasure was to holde the iudiciall Assizes, as touching the case of  High trea∣son. Maie∣stie, or no? he made answere, That the Lawes must have their course and be put in execution: and in very truth he executed them with extreame rigour. There was one who from the Statue of AUGUSTUS had taken away the head, for to set the same upon the Statue of another. The matter was debated in the Se∣nate: and because some doubt arose, Who did the deed? inquisition was made by torture.

To conclude, it cost one his life, for suffering in his owne Colonie, honours to be decreed unto him, upon the same day, that they had in times past beene de∣creed for AUGUSTUS. Many parts besides under the colour of gravity and reformation, but rather59 in deede following the course of his owne nature; hee used to play, so cruelly and with such rigour, that some there were, who in verses both upbraided by way of reproach the calamities present, and also gave warning of the future miseries, in this manner.

Which verses at first, he would have had to be taken and construed as made by them who were impatient of any Lordly rule and absolute dominion at Rome: and as if they had beene framed and devised, not so much with any con∣siderate iudgement, as upon Stomach and Choler. And evermore his saying was, Oderint aum probent i Let them hate me, so long as they suffer my pro∣ceedings to passe. But afterwards, even himselfe proved them to be very true and most certaine. Within few dayes after hee came to Capreae, when a Fisher-man, suddainly60 and unlooked for presented unto him (as hee was in a secret place doing some∣what by himselfe) a Being kaly and having a couple of barbe. Barble of an extraordinary bignesse, he caused his face to be rubbed all over with the same fish: as put in a fright, no doubt, for that from the backe side of that Iland, he had made meanes thorough the rough thickets and by-wayes, to creepe and get unto him where he was. And when the poore fellow amid this punishment seemed to reioyce yet, and said, It was happy that he had not offred unto him a lopstar also (which he had caught) of an huge great∣nesse, hee commaunded that his face should be grated and mangled likewise with the said Lopstar.

be most cruell. Whereby especially it appeared, that himselfe was not wont so much to be provoked and set on by SEIANVS: as Quā  quarent occass∣ones submi∣strasse. SEIANVS to serve his turne and feede his humour, seeking as he did all occasions: howsoever in a cer∣taine commentarie which he composed summarily and briefely of his owne life he durst write thus much, That he executed SEIANVS, because he had found that hee raged furiously against the children of GERMANICVS his sonne. Of whom to say a truth, the one himselfe murdred, after he had first suspected SEI∣ANVS, and the other, not before he had killed him. To prosecute in particular all his bloudie deedes would require a long time. It shall suffice therefore to reherse in generall the patternes as it were and examples of his crueltie. There passed not a day over his head, no not so much as any festivall and (a) religious holieday, without execution and punishment of folke. Some suffered even uppon Newyeares day. Accused and condemned there were many together, with their children, and very wives. Straight commaundement and warning was giuen, that the nere kinsfolke of such persons as stood condemned to die, should not mourne and lament for them. Especially rewardes were by decree appointed for their accusers; otherwhiles also for bare witnesses. No informer and promoter was discredited, but his presentmēt taken.

Presently were the Authors and writers punished, and their writings called in and abolished: notwithstanding certaine yeares before they had beene recited even in the hearing of AVGVSTVS, with his good liking and approbation. Some committed to ward, were deprived not onely of their Solace and comfort in studying, but also of the verie use of talking with o∣thers. Of such as were cited peremptorily by writ and processe to aunswere at the barre, some gave themselues (mortall) wounds at home in their houses (as sure to be condemned, onely to avoyd torments and ignominy) others in the open face and middest of the Court dranke poyson: and yet were they with their wounds bound up, and whiles they yet panted betweene alive and dead, haled away to prison.

For that instant verily chid the partie for his saucie and malapert tongue: but after a few daies wrote vnto the Senate, to take order with all speede for the execution of PACONIVS. He increased and strained still more and more this crueltie, by occasion that62 he was galled and fretted at the newes of his sonne DRVSVS his death: For, having beene of opinion, that he died upon some sickenes & intemperate life, so soone as he understood at length, that he was poysoned & so made away by the villanous practise of his wife Daughter of Germanicus & Agrypina, and wife to the said Drusus. LIVILLA and SEIANVS together, he spa∣red not to torment and execute any one whomsoever; so bent and addicted whole daies together to the inquisition and tryall of this onely matter, as that when word came unto him how an host of his an inhabitant of Rhodes (whom by familiar letters he had sent for to Rome) was come, he commanded him out of hand to be put to among other examinates. corture, as if he had beene some neere freinde present at the foresaid examination: but afterwards, when his errour was discovered, and seeing how he had mistaken, he caused him also to be killed. because he should not divulge and make knowne the Done vnto him. former injury. The place is yet to bee seene at Capreae of his butcherly cariage: From which he caused condemned persons after long and exquisite torments to be flung headlong before his face into the sea: where were readie to receive them a number of mariners, who with their sprits, poles, and oares should beate and batt their carkasses: to the end that none of them might have any breath or wind remaining in the bo die: He had devised moreover, among other kinds of torment, what time as men by deceitfull meanes had their lode with large drinking of strong wine, sodainely to knit fast and tie their privie members with (Lute) strings, that hee might cause them to swell and be pent in most dolorous paines occasioned at once as well by the streight strings, as the suppression and stoppage of vrine. And had it not beene that both death prevented and The Astro∣loger, THRASYLLVS also en∣forced him of purpose, (as men say) to put of some designes in hope of lon∣ger life, he would haue murdred a good many more (as it is fully beleeved) and not spared those verie nephewes of his that remained yet alive; considering he both had CAIVS in suspition, and also cast of TIBERIVS, as conceived in adulterie. And it soundeth to truth, that he was minded thus to do. For, ever and anon, he called PRIAMVS happie in that he overlived all his sonnes and daughters. But, how amid these prankes he lived not onely odious and detested, but ex∣ceeding63 timorous also & exposed to the contumelious reproches of the world, there be many evidences to shew. That any soothsayers should be sought unto and consulted with a part without witnesses by, he forbad: As for the Oracles neere adjoyning to the Citie of Rome, he attempted to subvert them all- But being terrified with the maiestie of those Fortanes or chaunce answeres which were delivered In manner of a Lottery. at Praeneste, he gave over: namely, when as he could not finde them, (sealed upp though they were and brought downe to Rome) within the chist until the same was carried backe againe unto the Of Fortune at Preneste.

with him: whereas in the meane time, reserving still the title of the office: he assigned unto them many commissions and matters of charge: and they con∣tinually gave order for execution thereof, by the ministerie of their Legates, Liuetenants and Coadjutours. His Agrippina, his adopted sonne Gericus wife & widow▪ or Liulla be∣fore named, wife to Drusut his naturall sonne. daughter in law, and Nephewes, after they were once condemned, he64 never remooved from place to place otherwise than chained and in a close co∣vered licter sowed up fast: setting his soldiers to prohibite all passengers that met with them, and waifaring persons travailing by, once to looke Because they shold not aske who was within backe thi∣ther, or to stay their pace and stand still. 65 When SEIANVS went about seditiously to worke alteration in the state: albeit he saw now that both his birth day was publikely solemnized, and also his Images of gold worshipped everie where, he overthrew him (I must needs say) at length: but with much adoo, by craftie sleights and guile, rather than by his princely authoritie and Imperiall power. For first, to the end that he might dismisse the man in shew of honour, he assumed him to be his Colleague in the fifth Consulship, which in his For he re∣mained still at Capreae. long absence he had taken upon him for that verie purpose.

Yea & whiles his ships were readie rigged and prepared to what Legions soever he ment for to flie, hee stood looking ever and anon from the highest cliffe that was, to∣ward the markes and signes, which he had appointed (least messengers might stay too long) for to be reared a great way of: thereby to have intelligence, as any occurrent (good or bad) fell out. Nay, when the conspiracie of SEIA∣NVS was now suppressed, he was never the more secure and resolute: but for the space of 9. moneths next ensuing he stirred not out of the Or erme house, in the Isse Capreae. village called Iovis. Beside all this, diverse and sundrie reprochfull taunts from all parts netled66 and stung his troubled minde. For there was not a person condemned, that reviled him not in all sorts openly to his face, yea and discharged uppon him opptobrious termes by libels laid for the nonce in the verie Where the Senatours sat to behold the plaiet. Orchestra, with which contumelies verily, affected he was after a most divers and contrarie manner: so that, one while he desired for verie shame of the world, that all such abuses might be unknowne and concealed: otherwhiles, hee contemned the same, and of his owne accorde broached and divulged them abroade. Fur∣thermore, rated he was & railed at in the letters also of ARTABANVS K. of the Parthians, who charged him with parricidies, murders, cowardise and luxurious roiot: who gave him counsell likewise with all speede possible, to satisfie with a voluntarie death the hatred of his Citizens, conceived against him in the highest degree and most iustly. At the last, being even wearie of him∣selfe in the beginning of such an Epistle as this, hee declared and confessed in manner the verie summe of all his miseries. What shall I write? my LL. of the
Senate, or how shall I write? Nay, what is it, at a word, that I shall not write at this time? The Gods and Goddesses all plague and confound me utterly at once, feeling as I do my selfe dayly to perish. Some thinke, that he foreknew all this by the skill he had ofFor he was wooderfully addicted to the study of Astro∣logie and such curious Arts: future events:67 that he foresaw also long before how great a calamitie and infamie both, would one day betide him: And therfore it was▪ that he refused most obstinate∣ly to take upō him the Empire & the name of PATER PATRIAE, as also stood against the oath, to maintaine his Acts: for feare least within a while after, to his greater disgrace and shame he might be found inferiour, and unworthie of such speciall honours, which verily may be gathered out of the speech hee made as touching both those points, when he saith but thus. That hee would be alwaies like to himselfe, and never chaunge his manners, so long as he continued in his sound wits. Howbeit, for example sake, provided it would be that the Senate binde not themselues to keepe and ratifie the Actions of any one, who by some chaunce might bee altered. And againe, Marie, if at any time, quoth hee, yee shall make doubt of my loyall behaviour and devoted mind unto you (which before it ever happen, I wish my dying day to take me from this minde and opinion of yours, once conceived of me and afterwards chaunged) the bare title of PATER PATRIAE will adde no honour unto me, but upbraide you either with inconsiderate rashnesse, for imposing that Surname uppon mee, or else with inconstancie, for your contrary iudgements of mee. Corpulent he was, big set and strong, of stature (a) aboue the ordinarie,68 broad betweene the shoulders and large breasted: in all other parts also of the bodie (from the crowne of his head) to the verie sole of his foote, of equall making and congruent proportion. His left hand was more nimble & stron∣ger than the right: and his ioynts so firme, that with his finger he was able to bore through a greene and sound Apple: with a fillop also to breake the head of a boy, yea of a good stripling and big youth. Of colour and complexion he was cleere and white: wearing the haire of his head longe behind, in so much as it covered his very necke: which was thought in him to be a fashion appropriate to his linage and familie.

All which properties being odious and full of arrogancie, AVGVSTVS both ob∣served in him, & also went about to excuse & cloke for him before the Senate and people, assuring them, they were the defects and imperfections of nature, and not the vices of the mind. He lived most healthfull.

But aboue all he studied for the knowledge of Wherein ma ny tales or fables are inser ted fabulous historie, evē unto meere fooleries, & matters ridiculous.

In the Greeke tongue, howsoever he otherwise was readie enough and71 spake it with facilitie, yet he used it not every where, but most of all forbare it in the Senate house: in so much verily, as when he came to name (a) MONO∣POLIVM, he craved leave before hand. for that he was to use a strang and fo∣raine worde; yea & in a certaine decree of the Senatours, when this word (b) EMBLEMA was red, he gave his opinion, that the saide word should be chan∣ged, and insteede of that strang terme some latine vocable sought out: and if such an one could not be found, then to utter and declare the thing, though it were in more words and by circumlocution. A certaine Greeke souldier also, being required for to depose and deliver his testimonie, he forbad to make an∣swere, (c) unlesse it were in Latin.

In his returne therefore speedily into Campania he fell sicke at Astura: but being eased a little of that maladie he went forward as farre as to Circeij: and because he would give no suspicion of sickenesse, he was not onely present himselfe at the games exhibited by the garison souldiers there, but also, when there was a wild bore put foorth into the open shew-place for to be baited, he launced dartes at him from aboue, where he was: And presently therewith, by occasion of a convulsion in his side: and for that hee had taken the cold aire upon an exceeding heat, he fell backe by (d) relapse into a more dangerous dis∣ease: How be it, he bare it out a pretie while: notwithstanding that after he was come downe so farre as to Misenum, he pretermitted nothing of his ordinary and daily manner, no not so much as his feasting and other pleasures: partly upon an intemperate humour of his owne, and in part to dissimule and palliate his weakenesse. For, when CHARICLES his Physician, who by vertue of a pasport was licensed to depart and be absent, went foorth from the table and tooke hold of his hand to kisse it, he supposing that he had feltVenas, for Ar∣terias by the trope Catchre sis, for they one ly beat. his pulse, desi∣red him to stay & sit downe againe, and so drew out the supper longer.

when hee had : A. V. C. 772▪ deposed the King of Armenia, and brought Cappadocia into the forme of a Province, in the 34 yeere of his age, he died of a long disease at An∣tiochia, not without suspition of poison. For, besides the blackish and swert spots which were to be seene all over his body, and the frothie slime that ranne forth at his mouth; his heart also (after he was burnt,) they found among the bones all sound and not consumed: the nature whereof is thought to be such, that if it bee infected with poyson, it checkes all fire and cannot possibly bee burnt. But, as the opinion of the world went, his death contrived by the wicked2 plot of TIBERIUS, was effected by the ministerie and helpe of CN. PISO: who about the same time being President of Syria, and not dissimuling that hee was to offend either father or Tiberius him∣selfe, or Germa∣nicus his adop∣ted sonne. sonne (as if there were no other remedie but needes he must so doe) made no spare, but beyond all measure dealt with GER∣MANICUS (sicke as hee was) most rigorously, both in word and deede. For which, so soone as he was returned to Rome, hee had like to have beene pulled in peeces by the people: and by the Senate condemned he was to die. It is for certaine knowne and confessed, that there were in GERMANICUS3 all good parts and gifts as well of body as mind: and those in such measure, as never to any man befell the like: to wit, for shew full of passing beauty, favour and feature; with strength & valour answerable thereto & for wit excellently well seene in eloquence and learning of Greeke and Latine, both kinds: The very attractive ob∣iect, he was of singular The good wil and affection of men, coun∣ted ameng the gifts of fortune benevolence, endowed with a wonderfull grace and effectuall desire to win mens favour and deserve their love.

Both at home and abroad (b) civile he was, in so much as he would goe to free and confederate Cities without any Sergeants or officers. Lictors. Where ever he knew any Sepulchers of brave and worthy men to be, there his use was to offer unto their ghosts. Being purposed to enterre in one tombe the olde reliques and bones dispersed of those that were slaine in that great overthrow with VARUS, he first gave the assay with his owne hand to gather and carie them together into one place. Moreover, to his slaunderers and backbiters (if he lighted upon them); of what quality so ever the persons were, or how great cause so ever they gave, so milde, so remisse and harme∣lesse hee was: that notwithstanding PISO reversed and canciled his Decrees, plagued and persecuted a long time his Dependants, yet could he not finde in his heart to be angry with him, before he had for certaine knowne, that hee attempted his person with poysons and sorcerous execrations: and even then verily, hee proceeded no farther against him, but, more maiorum to renounce all friendshippe with him, and to give his domesticall friendes in charge to bee revenged, if ought happened to himselfe otherwise than well. Of these vertues hee reaped most plentifull fruite; so liked and loved of his4 kinsfolke and friendes, (for I let passe all other affinities and acquaintance
of his) as that AUGUSTUS after hee had continued a long time in suspence, whether he should ordaine him for his Successor or no? recommended him at length unto TIBERIUS for to be adopted: so highly favoured of the Com∣mon people, as that many doe report and write; whensoever hee came unto a place or departed from thence, divers times by reason of the multitude flock∣ing to meete him and to beare him companie, he endangered his owne life in the preasse. As he returned out of Germanie, after the suppressing of seditious tumults and mutinies there, all the Praetorian cohorts every one went out to encounter him upon the way: albeit warning was given before hand by pro∣clamation, That no more than twayne of them should goe forth. But as for the people of Rome, of all sexes, ages, and degrees, they ran out by heapes to meet him xx miles from Rome. How beit, farre greater, and more assured testimonies of mens iudgement5 touching him appeared at, and after his death. The very day wherein he left this life, The Or, the ima∣ges of the Gods within the temples. temples (a) were pelted with stones: the altars of the Gods cast downe: the Domesticall (b) Lares, by some flung out of dores into the street; yea, and new-borne (c) babes of wedded parents throwne forth to be destroi∣ed.

Safe is Rome, safe is our Country, safe is GERMANICUS. Also, when now at the last it was knowne abroad that he was departed this life, the publick sorrow by no comfortable words nor edicts & proclamations could be repressed, but continued still even all the festivall daies of (a) the mo∣neth December. His glory and the misse of him thus deceased, was much aug∣mented also, by the outrages of the times ensuing: whiles all men were of opi∣nion (and not without good reason) That the fiercenesse of TIBERIUS which soone after brake forth, was held in and kept downe by the reverent respect & feare that he had of him. He wedded AGRIPPINA, daughter to M. AGRIPPA and IULIA: by whom7
he had nine children: of which faire issue twaine being yet Infants were taken away by untimely Death: one died when he was now waxen a iolly boy, pas∣sing full of lovely mirth and prety talke; whose counterfait in the habite of CUPID, Augusta. LIVIA dedicated in the Chappell of Venus Capitolina: and the same AUGUSTUS was wont to kisse while it stood in his bed-chamber, so often as he entred into it. The rest survived their father: three of the female sex AGRIP∣PINA, DRUSILLA and LIVIA, borne all one after another in the space of three yeeres: likewise as many male children, NERO, DRUSUS and CAIUS CAE∣SAR: As for NERO and DRUSUS, the Senate upon imputations laid by TI∣BERIUS, iudged them to be enemies untothe State. CAIUS CAESAR was borne the day next The last of August. A. V. C 765 preceding the Calends of Sep∣tember,8 when his Father and C. PONTEIUS CAPITO were Consuls. The place of his Nativitie, by the disagreement of writers, is left uncertaine. CN. LENTULUS GAETULICUS writeth, that hee was borne at Tibur▪ PLINIUS SECUNDUS, within the Country of the Treviri, in a towne called Or Ambiti∣. Ambiati∣num, upon the very The meeting of two rivers. Confluents. For evidence and proofe whereof hee far∣ther saith, That certaine Altars are there to be seene carying this Inscription, Ob Agrippina puerperim. For the child-birth and deliverie of AGRIPPINA. But these verses following, divulged soone after that he came to be Emperour, do plainly shew, that borne he was in the very Camp, where the Legions wintered. In castris natus patrijs nutritus in armis, Iam designati principis, omen erat. Borne in the Camp, in Fathers warres with souldiours rear'd was he; A signe, that then ordain'd he was an Emp'rour for to be. I my selfe do find among the Records, that Antium was the place of his birth. PLINIE refelleth GETULICUS, as if he made a lie by way of flattery, because to the praise of a young and glorious Prince, hee would fetch some argument & matter even out of a Citie consecrated to HERCULES: and was the bolder, as he saith to abuse the said Lie, for that, indeede, a yeere almost before, GER∣MANICUS had a sonne borne at Tibur, named likewise CAIUS CAESAR: of whose amiable childhood and untimely death we have spoken before. And as to PLINIE himselfe, confuted he is by the Calculation of the times. For, they who have recorded the Acts of AUGUSTUS doe all agree, That GERMANI∣CUS was sent into Germanie after the time of his Consulship expired, when as CAIUS was already borne. Neither can the Inscription of the Altar one iote make good his opinion: considering that AGRIPPINA was delivered of daughters twice in that Country. And what child-birth so ever it was, with∣out respect & difference of sex, called it is Puerperium: For that in old time folk used to name little girles also PUERAE, like as little boyes PUELLI. There is besides, an Epistle of AUGUSTUS written, not many moneths before he died unto AGRIPPINA his Niece as touching this CAIUS, (for there was not now living any other Infant of the like name) in these wordes. I have no longer agoe than yesterday taken order with TALARIVS and ASELLIUS, that with the leave of God they bring the boy CAIUS upon the 15 18 of May. day before the Calends of Iune. I send besides with him of mine owne servants a Physician whom GERMANICUS (as I have written unto him) may if he will retaine & keepe with him still. Farewell my AGRIPPINA and endeavour to come well & in health to thy GERMANI∣CUS. It appeareth I suppose sufficiently that CAIUS could not in that place be
borne, unto which he was conveied from Rome not before he was well-neere two yeares old▪ And as for those verses, these selfe same evidences likewise dis∣credite them: and the rather, because they have no Author. We are to follow therefore the onely authority that remaineth, of the Records & publick Instru∣ment: seeing especially that CAIUS evermore preferred Antium before all o∣ther retiring places, and loved it no otherwise than his native soile: yea, and by report, was fully minded once (upon a tedious wearinesse that he had of Rome City), to transferre thither even the very seat and habitation of the Empire. He gat his surname CALIGULA by occasion of a merry word taken up in9 the Camp, because he was brought up there in the habit of an ordinarie (a) and common souldiour among the rest. With whom, how much besides he was able to doe in love and favour by meanes of his education & daily feeding with them, was most of all knowne; when after the death of AUGUSTUS, he onely (no doubt) with He was then but a child, a∣bout 3 or 4 yeeres old▪ his very sight & presence quieted them; what time they were in an uprore & at the very point of furious outrage. For they ceased not to mu∣tinie, untill they perceived that he was about to be sent out of the way for dan∣ger of the sedition, and appointed to the next City adioyning. Then and not before, turning to repentance, they staied and held back his coach, and so by prayer averted the displeasure that was toward them. He accompanied his Father also in the Expedition into Syria: From whence10 being returned, first hee abode in house with his Mother: and after that shee was banished and sent away, hee remained with his great Grandmother LI∣VIA AUGUSTA: whom deceased hee praised in a funerall Oration at the Ro∣stra, when hee was as yet but a very youth in his Praetexta: and then removed he to his Grandmother ANTONIA. From her in the twentieth yeere of his age hee was sent for to Capreae by TIBERIUS, and upon one and the selfe same day, he did on his virile (a) gowne and withall cut the first downe of his beard, without any honourable solemnitie, such as his brethren before him had at their Commencements. Heere, notwithstanding hee was tempted by all the deceitfull traines that they could devise, who would have drawne and forced him to quarrels, yet gave hee never any occasion, having rased out and quite forgotten the fall and calamity of his mother, brethren and neere friends, as if nothing had befallen to any of them: passing over all those abuses which him∣selfe had endured with incredible dissimulation: so obsequious and double di∣ligent besides, to his Grandfather and those about him, that of him it was said and not without good cause, Passienus was the Author of this Apoph∣thegm. A better servant and a worse Mr. there never was. Howbeit, the cruell disposion and villainous nature of his owne, hee could not even then bridle and hold in▪ but both at all castigations and punishments11 of such as were delivered over to execution, most willing he was to be present: and also would haunt Tavernes and Brothel-houses, mens wives also suspected for adulterie, going about from place to place disguised under a (a) peruke of false haire, and in a side (womans) garment: yea, and most studiously gave his minde to learne the artificiall feate of dauncing and singing upon the Stage. And verily TIBERIUS was well content to winke heere at and suffer all, if hap∣ly thereby his fierce and savage nature might have been mollified and become tractable. Which the old man (as he was a Prince right prudent and one most quick of sent) had foreseene well enough long before: in so much as divers times he gave out & said openly, That CAIUS lived to the destruction of him and

And then, being nominated to succeede12 AUGUR in the roume of his brother DRVSVS, before his inuesture & instal∣lation therein, he was aduanced to the sacerdotall dignitie of a Pontifie; a nota∣ble testimonie of his pietie, and towardnesse, when as The royall line and impe∣rial Court beeing desolate and destitute of all other A Bishop. helpes; SEIANVS also suspected and soone after ouerthrowne, he should thus by small degrees arise to the hope of succession in the Empire. Which hope, the rather to confirme, after his wife aforesaid IUNIA was dead in childbirth, he sollicited unto filthie wantonnesse dame ENNIA the wife of NAEVIUS MACRO, then captaine of the guard and Pretorian cohorts: hauing promised her mariage also, in case he ever attained to the Empire: and for assurance here of he bound it with an oath and a bill of his owne hand.

And verily this soundeth to truth, considering there bee some Authors* Tiberius freed-man. who write, That himselfe afterwards professed, if not the murder done, yet at lestwise his intention, one day to doe it.

Neither durst TIBERIUS although hee had an inkling and intelligence of his disguisement, make anie in quisition at all of the matter or proceede to revenge. Thus having obtained the Empire he procured unto the people of Rome, or13 A. V.

As he re∣moved therfore frō Misenū, albeit he was clad in mourning weed & reuerely did attend the corps of TIBERIUS, yet went he among the altars, (a) sacrifices and burning torches in a most thick throng & ioifull traine of such as met him on the way: who beside other luckie & fortunate names called him SIDUS. i. their starr: Pullum. i. their chick, Pupum. i. their babe, and Alumnum. i. their nurceling.14 No sooner was he entred into the citie of Rome, but incontinētly with cōsent of the senate & the multitude rushing into the Curia, after they had annulled the wil of TIBERIUS, who in his testamēnt had adioyned coheire unto him another of his NephewsTiberius the son of Drujus: under age, & as yet in his pretexta, permitted he was alone, to have the ful & absolute power of all, & that with such an vniversal ioy, that in three moneths space next ensuing & those not fully expired, there were by report above 160000.

To this surpassing love of his owne Citizens and Countrie men, was adjoyned the notable favour also of foraine states. For, Artabanns King of the Parthians, professing alwaies his hatred and contempt of TIBERIVS, sought of his owne accord to him for amitie: yea he came in person to a conference with one of his legates (or Lieutenants) that had beene Consul, and passing over Euphrates, adored the The maine standards. Aegles and other militarie ensignes of the Romaines, as also the Images of the CAESARS. Himselfe also enkindled and set more on fire the affections of men by all15 manner of popularitie. When he had with many a teare praised TIBERIUS in a funerall Oration before the bodie of the people, and performed the com∣plement of his obsequies most honorably, forthwith he hastened, to Pandataria and Pontiae, for to translate from thence the ashes of his mother & brother, and that in foule & tempestuous wether, to the end that his pietie & kindnes might the more be seene. And being come to their reliques, very devoutly himselfe with his owne hands bestowed them in severall pitchers with no lesse shewe in pagent wise, having wafted them first to Ostia with a flag (or streamer) pitched in the poupe or sterne of a galley guided by two rankes of Oares and so foorth to Rome up the Tiber, by the ministerie of the most worshipfull gentlemen of Rome: he conveighed them within two Fercules (or frames) devised for the pur∣pose into the Mausoleum; even at noone day whē people were assembled there in great frequencie.

But in remembrance of his father he called the moneth September, GERMANICVS.

That he had done nothing wherefore he should be odious to any person: saying withall, That he had no eares open for informers and Tale-bearers. 16 The Spintriae, inventers of monstrous formes in perpetrating filthie lust, he expelled forth of Rome, being hardly & with much ado intreated not to drown them in the deepe sea▪ The writings of TITVS LABIENVS, CORDVS CRE∣MUTIVS and CASSIVS SEVERVS, which had beene called in and abolished by divers Acts of the Senate, he suffered to be sought out againe, to be in mens hands extant, and usually to be red: seeing that it concerned him principally and stood him upon most, to have all actions and deedes delivered unto posteritie▪ The Breviarie of the Empire, that by AVGVSTVS had beene wont to bee proposed openly, but was by TIBERIVS intermitted, he published: Vnto the Magistrates he granted free Iurisdiction, and that there might be no appealing to himselfe.

To the ende, that the Iudges might bee eased of their labour, unto the foure former decuries hee added a fifth. Hee gave the attempt likewise to bring up againe the auncient manner of Elections, and to restore unto the people their free voices.

Moreover, there passed a de∣cree, that the day one which hee beganne his Empire, should be called (c) Palilia, imploying thereby, as it were a second foundation of the Cittie.
He bare foure Consulships: the first, from the Calends of Iulie for ij. mo∣nethes:17 the second from the Calends of Ianuarie, for 30 dayes: the third untoA. V.

The third, he alone entred upon atIn France: Lions: not, as some deeme, upon pride or negligence: but because, being absent, he could not have knowledge that his Colleague died just against the very day of the Calends. He gave aCongiarium largesse to the people twice, to wit, 300 sesterces to them a peece, and a most plenteous dinner he made as oft unto the Senate and degree of gentlemen, as also to the wives and children of them both. In the latter dinner of the twaine, he dealt over and above, among the men garments to be worne abroad: unto the women and children, Fascias: Some expound these to be ribbands garters and gorgets. gardes welts, or laces, of purple and violet colour. And to the ende, he might aug∣ment the publike ioy of the Cittie with perpetuitie also; hee annexed unto the feast Saturnalia one daye more, and named the same nve∣nalis. He set foorth games of Sword-fencers, partly in the Amphitheater of TAV∣RVS,18 and partly within the Septa in Mars feild, into the which he inserted and brought in, certaine troupes of African and Campane Champions to skirmish by companies. even the very best, selected out of both Countries. Neither was he alwaies himselfe president at these solemnities and publike shewes, but otherwhiles enjoined the Magistrates or else his freinds to take the charge of presidencie. As for stage plaies, he exhibited them continually in diverse pla∣ces and in sundrie sorts: once also in the night season, burning lights through∣out the Cittie. He skattered likewise and flung (among the common people) missils, of many and sundry kinds to skamble for: and dealt man by man, pa∣niers with viandes therein. At which feasting, to a certaine gentleman of* Misilia small gifts. Rome who over against him plyed his chawesfull merily, and fedde right hartily with a greedie stomacke, he sent his owne part: as also to a Senatour for the same cause, his letters patents, wherein he declared him extraordinarily, Prae∣tour. He represented besides, many Cirq-games, which held from morne to euen: interposing one while, the baiting of Or Leopards Panthers; another while the Troie-justing and Turnament. But some especiall sports there were aboue the rest, and then the Cirq-place was laide all over withRed & greene vermillion and * Bo∣rax Minerall: Where none but of Senatours degree ruled and drave the Chariots. Some also he put foorth upon a sodaine, namely when as he beheld from out of the house GELOTIANA, the preparation and furniture of the Cirque, some few from the (a) nextManianis. open galleries jettying out, called unto him for the same. Furthermore, he devised a new kind of sight, and such as never was hearde19 of before: For, ouer the middle An arme of the se Space betweene Baiae and the huge piles or dammes at Puteoli containing three miles and 600 paces well neere, hee made a bridge: having gotten together from all parts ships of burden, and placed them in a duple course at Anchor, with a banke of earth cast thereup∣on, direct and straight after the fashion of the high way Appia. Vppon this bridge he passed to and fro for two dayes together: the first day mounted one a courser richly trapped, himselfe most brave and goodly to be seene with a chaplet of Oke-brances: armed with a battaile axe, a light sargnet and a sword,
clad also in a cloke of gold: the morrow after he appeared in the habit of a Chariotier, ryding in a chariot drawne with two goodly steedes of an ex∣cellent race: carrying before him DARIVS a boy, one of the Parthian hostages with a traine of the Praetorian souldiers marching after in battaile raie: and ac∣companied with the Cohort of his minions in Essodis, el∣gick or French. British wagons, Most men I wote well, are of opinion that CAIUS inuented such a kind of bridge, in emu∣lation of XERXES, who not without the wonder of the world, made a bridge, of planks over Hellesponte an arme of the Sea, somewhat narrower than this: others, that by a bruite blazed abroad of some huge and monstrous peece of worke, hee might terrifie Germanie and Britaine, upon which countries hee meant to make warre. But I remember well that beeing a boy, I heard my Grandfather report and tell the cause of this worke, as it was deliuered by his owne Courteours, who were more inward with him than the rest: namely, That THRASYLLUS the great Astrologer assured TIBERIUS when hee was troubled in minde about his successour, and more enclined to his naturall and lawfull Tiberius, the sonne of Dru∣s. Tiberius the Emperors son. nephew indeede by lineall descent, That CAIUS should no more become Emperour than able torune a course to and fro on horse-backe, through the gulfe of Baiae.

Empire, into the (b) forme of a King∣dome. But being told that he was mounted alreadie above the heigth and state both of Principum, for the Romaine Emperours were called Principes Emperours and also of Kings, thereupon from that time forward hee began to challenge unto himselfe a divine Maiestie: and having given order and commission, that the images of the gods, which either for deuout worship done unto them, or for curious workemanship seene upon them, excelled the rest, (among which was that of IUPITER OLIMPICUS) should bee brought out of Greece unto Rome, that when their heads were taken of, he might set his The portraict and propor∣tiō of his owne owne in the place: he enlarged theThe Palace in that Mount. that stood in Forum Roma∣num.

And some there were who saluted him by the name of IUPITER LATIALIS. Moreover he ordained a Temple peculiarly appropriate to his owne godhead as also priests and most exquisite Sacrifices. Osts. In his saide Temple stood his owne i∣mage all of gold, lively portraied and expressing his full proportion: the which was daily clad with the like vesture as himselfe wore. The masterships of the priest-hood by him instituted, the richest men that were, every time of vacan∣cie purchased: such as made greatest suite and offered most therefore. The Osts or sacrifices aforesaid were these foules (b) Phaenicopteri, Peacocks, (d) Tetra∣ones, (e) Numidicae, (f) Meleagrides and (g) Phesants, and those to be sorted by their kinds; and so every day killed. And uerily, his usuall manner was in the night to call unto the Moone when she was at full and shining bright out for to come and ly with him in his armes: but in the day time, he talked secretly and apart with IUPITER CAPITOLINUS: one while by whispering and rounding one another in the eare, otherwhiles speaking more lowde and not without chiding: For he was heard in threatning wise to utter these words , I will remove and translate thee into the lande of the Greeks: untill such time as being intreated (according as he tolde the tale himselfe) and inuited first by him for to cohabite, he made a bridge over the temple of AUGUSTUS of sacred memorie and so ioyned the Palatium * From the Pala tium to the Ca∣pitoll. and Capitol together. And soone after, to the end that he might be nearer unto him hee layed the foundation of a newe house in the voide base▪court of the Capitoll.

And not content with this infamous imputation of AUGUSTUS, the Actiack and Siculasq: not Singulas{que} Sicilian victories by him atchieved, hee streightly forbad to be celebrated yeerely with solemne holidaies, as beeing vnluckie and hurtfull to the people of Rome.

Neither when shee was dead daigned hee her any honour, but out of his dining chamber beheld her funerall fire as it was burning. His brother TIBERIUS he surprised suddainly at unwares, sending a Tribune (a) of Souldiours, who rushed in upon him and so slew him. Likewise VVhose daughter hee had maried. SILANUS his Father in law hee forced to death, even to cut his owne throate with a Razour, picking quarrels to them both and finding these causes: to wit, that the Silanus. one followed him not when hee tooke sea beeing very rough and much troubled, but staied behind in hope to seize the Cite of Rome into his owne hands, if ought hapned but well unto him by occasion of tempests: Tiberius. the other smelled strongly of a Preservative or Anti∣dote, as if hee had taken the same to prevent his poisons. Whereas, in very truth SILANUS avoided thereby the unsufferable paine of being Sea-sick and the grievous trouble of sayling: and TIBERIUS for a continuall cough that grew still upon him used a medicine. For, his Vnkle His Succes∣sour in the Empire. CLAUDIUS he reserved for nothing else but to make him his laughing-stock. 24 With all his sisters, hee used ordinarily to be naught: and at any great feast hee placed evermore one or other of them by turnes beneath himselfe, while his wife sat above. Of these sisters (as it is verily thought) he defloured DRU∣SILLA being a virgin, when himselfe also was yet under age and a very boy: Yea, and one time above the rest hee was found in bed with her and taken in the manner by his Grandmother ANTONIA; in whose house they were brought up both together. Afterwards also when shee was bestowed in mari∣age upon LUCIUS CASSIUS LONGINUS, a man of Consulare degree, hee tooke her from him and kept her openly, as if shee had beene his owne lawfull wife. Also when he lay sicke, he ordained her to be both heire of all his goods and Successour also in the Empire. For the same sister deceased, hee proclai∣med a generall cessation To signifie a solemne mour∣ning: of Law in all Courts. During which time, a capitall crime it was for any man to have laughed, bathed, or supped together with parents, wife or children. And being impatient of this sorrow, when hee was fled suddainly and by night out of the Citie, and had passed all over Campania, to Saracose hee went; and so from thence returned speedily againe with his beard and haire of head overgrowne. Neither at any time ever after, in ma∣king a speech before the people or to his Souldiours concerning any matters were they never so weighty would hee sweare otherwise than by thePer nomen, se reade Numen i▪ the godhead or di∣vine power: For he equalled her with Vens, and commaunded that she should be worshipped as a Goddesse; and as Dion writeth, named she was Panthea, and women were compelled to sweare by her, as by Iun. name of DRUSILLA. The rest of his sisters, (LIVIA and AGRIPPINA) hee loved neither with so tender affection nor so good respect as whō he oftētimes prostituted & offred to be abused by his own stale catamites. So much the more easily there∣fore
condemned he them in the case of AEMILIUS LEPIDUS, as adulteresses and privie to his treasons and waite-layings addressed against his person. And he not onely divulged the hand-writings which were sought out by guile and adulteries, but also consecrated unto MARS REVENGER those three daggers prepared By them, to wit Lepidus and his two sisters: or by him, for their death. for his death, with a title over them, containing the cause of his so doing. 25 As for his mariages, a man may hardly discerne, whether hee contracted, dissolved, or held them still with more dishonesty. LIVIA ORESTILLA, what time she was wedded unto C. PISO, himselfe, (being one who came in person to the Solemnization of the mariage), commaunded to be brough home unto him as his owne wife: and having within few daies cast her off, two yeeres af∣ter he banished and sent her away; because in the middle time betweene, shee was thought to have Or sought a∣gaine for the company &c. repetijsse. had the company againe of her former husband. Some report, that being an invited guest at the Nuptiall supper, he charged PISO sit∣ting over against him, in these termes, Sirra, see you sit not too close unto my wife: and so, presently had her away with him from the table: and the next day pub∣lished by Proclamation, That hee had met with a mariage after the example of (a) ROMULUS and AUGUSTUS. As touching LOLLIA PAULINA maried al∣ready to C. MEMMIUS, a man of Consular degree and ruler of Armies: up∣pon mention made of her Grandmother as the most beautifull Lady in her time, he all of a suddaine sent and called her home out of Where she was with her husband afore∣said. the Province: and taking her perforce from her husband, wedded her and shortly turned her a∣way: forbidding her straightly for ever the use of any mans body whatsoever. CAESONIA, for no speciall beauty and favour of her owne above others, nor yet because she was in the flower of her youth, (considering shee had beene the mother already of three daughters by another man): but onely for that shee was a most lascivious woman and of unsatiable lust he loved with more ardent affection and constancie: in so much as many a time he would shew her to his Souldiours in her haire, clad in a Souldiours Short cloake or horsemans coats chlamyde. Cassocke with a light Target and an helmet riding close unto him: but to his friends, Like as Can∣ King of Lydia, did to his friend Gyges. starke naked also. When she brought him a A daughter. childe, hee vouchsafed her then, the name of his wife and not before; professing and making it knowne, that in one and the selfe same day, he was become both her husband and also father of the Infant of her body borne. This babe he named IUNIA DRUSILLA: whom hee ca∣ried about with him through the temples of all the Goddesses; and bestowed at length in the lap of Goddesse of good arts and sciences.

Others, whom hee had secretly murdred, he continued never the lesse calling for, as if they were alive: giving it out most untruly some few daies af∣ter, that they had wilfully made themselves away. The Consuls had forgot by chaunce to publish by proclamation his Birth day; For which, hee deprived them of their magistracie: and so for three daies space the Common-wealth was without the soveraine (b) authoritie. His owne Questour, who hapned to be nominated in a conspiracie against him, hee caused to be scourged: and the cloathes out of which hee was stripped to be put under the Souldiours feete, that they might stand more steedily whiles they were whipping him. In semblable pride and violence hee handled other States and degrees of Citi∣zens.

When Cattell which were to feede wilde beasts prepared for baiting, grew to be sold very deere, he appointed malefactours found guilty to be slaughtered for that purpose. And in taking the review of Goales and prisoners therein, as they were sorted according to their offences: he, without once looking upon the ti∣tle & cause of their imprisonment, standing only within a gallerie, cōmaunded al in the mids, a calvū ad calvū (a) . from one bald-pate to another, to be led forth* Medios,   ad calrum. to execution. He exacted of him the performance of a vow, who had promised
to doe his devoir in publick sword-fight for the recoverie of his health: and him he beheld fighting at sharpe: neither dismissed he him before he was vic∣tour, and after many prayers. Another there was, who for the same cause had vowed to die. This man being not very forward to pay his vow, hee caused to be dight with sacred hearbs, and adorned with Ribbands. Infules, like a sacrifice; and so delivered him into the hands of boyes: who calling hard vpon him for the dis∣charge o his vow, should course and drive him through the streets of the City, untill he were throwne headlong downe the steepe Of Tarquini∣us, as some thinke. Rampier. Many honest Citizens of good calling and estate, after he had first disfigured with markes of branding yrons, he condemned to dig in mines, and to make high-waies, or to encounter with beasts: or kept them creeping with all foure like brute beasts within a cage for the nonce: or else slit them through the mids with a sawe. And those whom hee thus served, were not all of them guilty of any grievous offences: but sufficient it was, if they had a base conceite and spake but meanly of some shew that he exhibited: or because they had never sworne stoutly by his These , are of a middle essence, be tweene men & Gods, calle therefore.

And when one Father excused himselfe by reason of sicknesse, hee sent a Licter for him: another of them immediatly after the heavie spectacle of his sonne put to death, he invited to his own (c) bourd; made him great cheere, and by all manner of courtesie provoked him to iocondnesse and mirth. The Maister of his sword-fights and beast baitings, he caused for certaine daies to∣gether to be beaten with (d) chaines in his owne sight: but killed him not quite, before himselfe could no longer abide the stench of his braine by this time pu∣trified. A Poet, the Author of Atellan Enterludes, for a verse that he made im∣plying a iest, which might be doubly taken, he burnt at a stake in the very mid∣dle shew-place of the Amphitheatre. A Gentleman of Rome, whom he had cast before wild beasts, when he cried out, That he was innocent, he commaunded to be brought back▪ and after hee had cut out his tongue, sent him among them againe, (to fight for his life or to be devoured).

Being desirous to have a Senatour torne & mangled peecemeale, he suborned certaine of purpose, who all on a suddaine as he entred into the Curia, should call him enemie to the State, & so lay violent hands upon him: and when they had with their (a) writing yrons all to pricked and stabbed him, deliver him over to the rest, for to be dismembred and cut in peeces accordingly. Neither was hee satisfied, untill he saw the mans limmes, ioints and inwards drawne along the streetes, and piled all on an heape toge∣ther before him. His deeds most horrible as they were, hee augmented with as cruell words.29 His saying was, That he commended and approved in his owne nature nothing more, than (to use his own terme) adiatrepsian. i. unmoveable rigour.

Now when commaundement was given (by the people) That they should be killed; one takes me up his Trout-speare againe into his hand and slew all the other five who were thought the Conquerours. This slaughter he both bewailed in an Edict as most cruell, and also cursed them that endured to see the sight. 31 Hee was wont moreover to complaine openly of the condition of his time wherein he lived, as not renowmed by any publick calamities: Whereas the raigne of AUGUSTUS was memorable for the overthrow of VARUS: that of TIBERIUS ennobled by the fall of scaffolds in the Theater at Fidenae. As for himselfe, like hee was to be forgotten, (such was the prosperity in his daies). And evermore he wished the carnage and execution of his armies. Fa∣mine, Pestilence, and Skarfires, or some opening chinks of the ground. 32 Even whiles he was at his recreations and disports, whiles he set his mind upon gaming and feasting, the same cruelty practised he both in word & deed.
Oftentimes as hee sate at dinner or banquetted, were serious matters examined in his very sight by way of torture: and the Souldiour that had the skill and dex∣terity to behead folke, then and there used to cut off the heads of any prisoners indifferently without respect. At Puteoli, when he dedicated the bridge, which as we noted before, was his owne invention: after hee had invited many unto him from the shore and strond, suddainly hee turned them all headlong over the bridge into the water. And seeing some of them taking hold of the For this bridge was made of barks. helmes for to save themselves, he shooved and thrust them off, with poles and oares in∣to the sea.

One of these Fencers called Or secutores, aforesaid. MIRMILLO∣NES, comming out of the Fence-schoole plaied at wooden wasters with him; and there tooke a fall for the nonce, and lay along at his feete: him he stabbed for his labour, with a short yron skeine that hee had: and withall, after the so∣lemne manner of Victors, ranne up and downe with his garland of Date tree branches. There was a beast brought to the Altar ready to be killed for Sacri∣fice: he comes girt in habite of these At sacrifice. Beast slayers, and with the axe head that he lifted up on high, knocked downe the Minister himselfe, who was addressed to cut the said beasts throat, and so dashed his braines out. At a plenteous feast where there was great cheere, he set up all at once an unmeasurable laugh∣ter: And when the Consuls who sate iust by him asked gently and with faire language, Whereat he laughed so? At what else, quoth hee, but this, That with one nod of my head, I can have both your throats cut immediatly. 33 Among divers and sundry iests and merie conceites of his, as he stoode once hard by the image of IUPITER, he demaunded of APELLES an actour of Tra∣gaedies, whether of the twaine he thought to be the greater and more stately, IUPITER or himselfe? And whiles he made some stay ere he answered, he all to tare and mangled him with whipping cheere, praising ever and anone his voice crying unto him for mercy, as passing sweet and pleasant, even when he groned also under his lashes. So often as he kissed the neck of wife or Or Para∣mor. concu∣bine, he would say withall, As faire and lovely a neck as this is, off it shall goe if I doe but speake the word. Moreover, he gave it forth many a time, That he would him∣selfe fetch out of his wife CAESONIA, though it mere with Lute-strings, what (a) was* By cramping and tortering her therewith the reason that he loved her so entirely? 34 Neither raged he with lesse envie and spitefull malice, than pride and cruelty, against persons, in manner, of all times and ages. The Statues of brave and worthy men brought by AUGUSTUS out of the Capitoll Courtyard for the straightnesse of the place, into Mars-field, he overthrew and cast here and there in such sort, as they could not be set up againe with the Titles and Inscriptions whole forbidding that ever after there should be any where Statue or Image erected unto any person living, without his advice asked and graunt passed. He was of minde also to abolish HOMERS verses: For why may not I, quoth he, doe
that which PLATO lawfully did? who banished Being a . him out of the Cittie that he fra∣med and ordeined. The writings likewise and images of VIRGIL and T. LI∣VIUS, he went within a little of remooving out of all libraties. The Virgill. one of these he carped, as a man of no witte and uerie meane learning: the Lirie. other, for his verbositie and negligence in penning his Historie. Moreouer, as touching Lawiers, (as if he meant to take away all use of their skill and know∣ledge) he cast out these words many times, That he would surely bring it to passe, They should bee able to give none other answere nor councell than according to reason and aequitie. He took from the noblest personages that were, the olde armes and Or Ensignes. badges35 of their houses: Frō TORQUATUS the Or Cheme. collar: frō CINCINNATUS the cur∣led lock of haire: & from CN.

As for King PTOLEMEUS, (of whom I made report before) whē he had both sent for him out of his realme and also honorably intertained him he slewe all of a sodaine, for no other cause in the World but for that as he entred into the Theatre to see the shewes and games there exhibited, hee perceived him to haue turned the eyes of all the people upon him, with the resplendent brightnesse of his purple cassocke. All such as were faire, and caried a thick bush of haire growne long, so often as they came in his way, he disfigured by shaving their heads all behind. There was one ESIUS PROCULUS (whose father had beene a principall captaine of the formost cohort) for his exceeding tall personage and louely fauour withall named (a) COLOSSEROS, Him hee caused sodainly to be pulled downe from the scaffold where he sat, and to be brought into the plaine with∣in the lists: where he matched him in fight with a sword-fenser of that sort which be called Threces, and afterwards with another, all , with shield and helmet. armed. Now when he had giuen the To the  & ▪ foile twice, & gotten the upper hand, he commanded him forthwith to be pinniond & bound fast, & being put into foule and overworne clothes to be led round about the streets to be shewed unto womē, & so to have his throat cut in the end. To conclude there was none of so base & abiect condition, nor of so mean estate, whose commodities & good parts he depraved not. Against the great Prelat stiled by the name K. NEMORENSIS, because he had many yeares already enioyed his sacerdotall dignitie he suborned under hand a com∣current and aduersarie mightier than himselfe. When as vpon a certaine day of publike games, there was greater applause & more clapping of hands than ordinarie at POPIUS the To wit, sword fight. fenser, manumising his slave for ioy of the fortunate cōbate which hee had made, he flung out of the Theatre in such hast, that trea∣ding* Essedari▪ o Champion that vse to fight and play his prises out of a British or Frēch Chario called ▪ vpō his own gown skir he came tumbling down the staires with his head forward: chafing and fuming yea and crying cut That the people of Rome, Lord of all nations, yeelded more honour, and that out of a most vaine and frivolous occa∣sion unto a sword-fenser, than to consecrated Princes, or to himselfe there in perso∣nall presence. No regard had he of chastitie and cleannesse, eyther in himselfe or in others.36 M. LEPIDUS MNESTER the A player counter feiting all partes, and kindes of ges∣ture. Pantomime, yea & certain hostages he kept and loved as the speech went, by way of reciprocall cōmerce in mutuall impunity, Doing & suffering against kind, VALERIUS CATULLUS, ayong gentleman descēded from a familie of Consuls degree, cōplained & openly cried out, that
hee was unnaturally by him abused; and that his uerie sides were weried, and tyred out with his filthie companie, Over and above the incests commited with his owne sisters, and his love so notorious of PIRALLIS that common and prostitute strumpet, there was not lightly a dame or wife of anie worship and reputation, that hee forbare. And those for the most part would he inuite together with their husbands to supper: and as they passed by at his feete, per∣use and consider curiously; taking leasure thereto after the maner of those that cheapen and buy wares in ouvert market: yea and with his hand chocke them under the chin and make them to looke up, if happily any of them in modesty and for bashfulnesse held downe their faces. And then so often as he listed, out he goes from the refection roome, and when he had called her unto him apart that liked him best, hee would within a little after: (even whiles the tokens were yet fresh testifying their wanton worke) returne: and openly before all the cō∣panie, eyther praise or dispraise her: reckoning up everie good or bad part of bodie and action in that brutish businesse. To some of them, himselfe sent bils of divorsement in the name of their husbands absent and commanded the same to be set upon the file and stand in publike record. In riotous and wastfull (a) expense, he outwent the wits and inuentions of37 all the prodigal spend thrifts that ever were; as having devised a new found man∣ner and use of baines, together with most strange and monstrous kinds of meats and meales: namely, to bath with hote and cold Or Oiles ointments: to drinke off and quaffe most pretious and costly pearles dissolued in vinegar: to set upon the bourd at feastes loaves of bread and other viands to them before his guests, all of golde, saying commonly withall, That a man must either be frugall or els CAESAR. Moreover for certaine dayes together, he flung and scattered among the common people from the Lovuer of the stately Hall IULIA, mony in pee∣ces of no meane ualew. He built moreover tall galiaces of ceder (b) timber, with poupes and sternes beset with precious stones, carying sailes of sundrie colours conteining in them barnes large galleries, walking places, and dining chambers of great receit: with vines also and trees bearing apples and other fruit in as much varietie: wherein he would sit feasting in the uery day time a∣mong quires of musicians and melodious singers, and so saile along the costs of Campania. In building of stately Pallaces and mannor houses in the countrey he cast aside all rules and orders as one desirous to do nothing so much as that which was thought unpossible to be done. And therfore he laid foundations of piles where the sea was most raging and deep withal, and hewed rocks of most hard flint & rag: plains also he raised even with mountaines & by digging down hill tops levelled them equall with the plaines: all with incredible celeritie: as punishing those who wrought but slowly even with death. In summ, (and not to reckon vp euerie thing in particular) That infinite wealth and masse of Treasure which TIBERIUS CAESAR left hehind him valued at Vicies ac septi∣es millies 2700. mil∣lians of Sesterces, hee consumed to nothing, before one whole yeare was gone about. Being exhaust therefore and growen exceeding bare, he turned his mind to38 rapine and polling by sundrie and most nice points; of forged calumniation, of sales, of imposts and taxes. He affirmed plainely, that those held not by lawe and rightfully the freedome of Rome Cittie, whose Auncestours had obtained
the grant thereof in these tearmes, to them and their posteritie: unlesse they were sonnes: For, by Posteri. i. Posterity quoth he, ought to be understood none be∣yond this degree of descent. And when the Letters-pattens and graunts of IU∣LIUS and AUGUSTUS, (late Emperours of sacred memorie) were brought forth as evidences, he Deflebat, or deflbat▪ i. he reiected and despised. bewailed the same as olde, past date and of no validitie. Hee charged those also with false valuation and Perpera  edi∣ti Census. wrong certificate of their e∣states, unto whom there had accrued afterward (upon what cause soever) any encrease of substance. The last willes and testamentes of such as had beene principall Centurions of the formost Cohorts, as many I say, as from the be∣ginning of TIBERIUS Empire, had left neither the sayd TIBERIUS, nor himselfe Heire, he canciled for their unthankfulnesse: of all the rest likewise, he held the wils as voide, and of none effect: in case any person would come forth and say, that they purposed and intended, at their death to make CAESAR their Heire. Vpon which feare that hee put men in, beeing now both by un∣knowen persons unto him, nominated Heire among their familiar friends, and also by parents among their children, he tearmed them all mockers and cousi∣ners, for that after such nuncupative wils they continued stil alive: and to ma∣nie of them he sent certaine Mcteas or Mattyas, such as Marchpanes dainties empoisoned. Now such causes as these above-saide he heard judicially debated: having before hand set downe a cer∣taine rate and summe of money, for the raising whereof he sat iudicially in Court: and when that summe was fully made vp, then and not before hee would arise. And (as he was one who in no wise could abide any little delay) he condemned vpon a time by uertue of one definitive sentence above fortie persons, liable to judgement for divers and sundry crimes: making his boast withall unto his wife CAESONIA newly wakened out of her sleepe What a deale he had done, while she toooke her noones repose. Having published an open port sale of the residue remaining of furniture provided to set out all shews and games, he caused the said parcels to be brought forth and sold: setting the pri∣ces thereof himselfe and enhaunsing the same to such a prick, that some men enforced to buye certaine things at an extreame and exceeding rate (whereby they were empoverished and stript of all their goods) cut their owne veines and so bled to death. Well knowen it is that whiles APONIUS SATURNINUS tooke a nap and slept among the seats and stauls where these sales were held; CAIUS put the Or Crier. Bedell in mind not to let slip and overpasse such an honorable person of Pretours degree as he was: considering quoth he, that with his head he had so often nodded and made As it were, to buy ths & that signes unto him, and thus taking that occa∣sion, he never rested raising the price whiles he sat and nodded stil, untill there were fastened upon the man, (ignorant God wote, altogether of any such mat∣ter) thirteene sword-fensers, at nine millians of Sesterces. In Gaule likewise, when he had sould the jewels, ornaments, and houshold∣stuffe39 of his Livilla and Agrippina. sisters by him condemned; their seruants also and uerie children at excessive high prices: finding sweetnesse in the gaine growing thereupon and thereby drawen on to proceede in that course, looke what furniture be∣longed to the old imperiall Court, hee sent for it all from the Cittie of Rome▪ For the cariage whereof, hee tooke vp even the passengers wagons that usual∣ly were hired, yea the uery jades which serued In grinding Corne, and carrying brea mils and backe-houses: In so much, as manie times there wanted bread in Rome: and a number of Termers,
such as had matters depending in lawe, for that they could not make their ap∣pearance in Court at their dayes appointed, by absence lost their suits. For the selling of which furniture, there was no fraude, no guile, no deceitful al∣lurement to be devised that he used not: one while checking each one for their auarice, and rating them because they were not ashamed to be richer than he: otherwhiles making semblance of repentance, in that he permitted persons to have the buying of such things as belongd to the Empire. Intelligence was gi∣ven vnto him, that a certaine wealthy and substantiall man in that province, had paide 200000. sesterces unto his officers (who had the bidding of guests unto his owne table) that by some suttle shift, himselfe might be foisted in among o∣ther guests: neither was he discōtēted that the honor of supping with him was prized so high. The morrow after therfore, as this provinciall man was sitting at a publike portsale, hee sent one of purpose to tender and deliver unto him some frivolous trifle (I wot not what) at the price of 200000 sesterces: and withall to say unto him, That take a supper he should with CAESAR, as a guest inui∣ted by his owne selfe. He levied and gathered new tributes and imposts, such as never were heard40 of before: at the first by the hands of Publicanes; and afterward (by reason of the excessive gaines that came in) by the Centurions and Tribunes of the Pre∣torian cohorts. For he omitted no kind of thing, no manner of person, but he imposed some tribute upon them. For all cates that were to be solde through∣out the Citie, there was exacted a certaine taxation & set paiment, For actions for suits, for judgemēts whersoever cōmensed or drawn in writing, the fortieth part of the whole summe in suite went to his share in the name of a tribute: not without a penaltie, in case anie one were conuinced, to have eyther growen to composition or given the thing in question. The eighth part of the poore porters and Cariers daies-wages: out of the gets also and takings of common strumpets, as much as they earned by once lying with a man, was payed nomi∣ne tributi. Moreover to the chapter of the law, this branch was annexed that there should bee liable to this tribute, not onely the parties themselues that by trade of harlotry gat their living, but even they likewise who kept houses of bawderie: As also that Nec  t  ob∣ ssent. Some interpret this of wedded folke playing false & cōmit∣ting adulteie. wedded persons should paye for their vse of ma∣riage. After these and such like taxes were denounced by proclamation, but not yet41 published abroad in writing, when as through ignorance of the written lawe (a) many trespasses and transgressions were committed: at length, upon instant demaund of the people, he proposed indeede the act, but written in very small letter and within as narrow a place, so that no man might exemplifie the same or copie it out. And to the end that there might bee no kinde of spoile and pil∣lage which he attempted not, he setup a stewes and brothelhouse in the verie Palace, with many roomes and chambers therein distinguished asunder, and furnished according to the dignity and worth of that place. In it there stood to prostitute themselues, maried wives, youths and springals free borne. Then sent he all about to the frequented places as well markets as Halles of resort, certaine Nomenclatours, to inuite and call thither by name, young men and olde, for to fulfill and satisfie their lust. All comers at their entrance payde money (as it were) for usurie and interest. Certaine persons also were appoin∣ted
to take note in open sight, of their names, as ofsuch as were good friends increasing the revenewes of CAESAR. And not disdeining so much as the lucre and vantage arising out of hazard and dice play, hee gained the more by cog∣ging, lying, yea and forswearing (of gamesters). And upon a time, having put over to his next fellow gamester his owne course, to cast the dice for him in his turne: out he goes into the court-yeard and foregate of the house: where, having espied two wealthy gentlem of Rome passing by, he commanded them to be apprehended incontinently, and condemned in the confiscation of their goods: which done he returned in againe, leaping for joy & making his vaunt, That he never had a luckier hand at dice. But when he had once a daughter borne, complaining then of his povertie42 and the heavie charges that lay upon him not onely as Emperour, but also as a father, he gently tooke the uoluntarie contributions and benevolence of men toward the finding of the girle her food, as also for her Dowry another day. He declared also by an edict, that he would receive newyeares gifts: and so he stood the firstOr a Kalendis  the first day, &c. day of Ianuarie, in the porch or entrie of his house PALATINE, readie to take what peeces soever of money came, which the multitude of all sorts and degrees, with full hands and Or laps of their clothes bosomes poured out before him. Fi∣nally, so farre was he incensed with the desire of handling money, that often∣times he would both walke bare-footed up & down, yea & wallow also a good while with his whole body upō huge heapes of coyned gold peeces, spred here and there in a most large and open place. In militarie matters and warlike affaires he never dealt but once: and that43 was not vpon any intended purpose: but what time as he had made a progresse to Mevania, for to see the sacred grove & river of Clitumnus; being put in mind to supply & make up the number of the Batauians whom he had about him for his guard, it tooke him in the head to make an expedition into Germanie. Nei∣ther deferred he this disignement, but having levied from al parts a power con∣sisting of legions and auxiliarie forces; and taken musters most rigorously in every quarter, as also raised & gathered together uictuals & provision of al sorts in that quantity, as never any other before him the like, he put himselfe on his journey. Wherein he marched, one while in such hurrie and haste, as that the Pretorian cohorts were forced (against the manner and custome) to bestowe their ensignes vpon the sumpter beasts backs & so to follow after: otherwhiles, after such a slow and delicate manner, as that he would be carried in a litter vp∣on eight mens shoulders, and exact of the common people inhabiting the neighbour cities adioyning, that the high waies might be swept & watered for the dust, against his comming. After that he was arrived once at the campe, to the end that he might shew44 himselfe a sharpe and severe Captaine. Those Lieutenants who had brought aid with the latest, out of divers and dissituate parts, he discharged with ignomi∣nie and shame. But in the reuiew of his armie the most part of the Centuri∣ons who had alreadie serued out their complete time, yea and some whose terme within uery few dayes would have beene fully expired, he deprived of their places: to wit, the leading of the formost bands, finding fault forsooth with the olde age and feeblenesse of every one. As for the rest, after hee had given them a rebuke for their avarice, he abridged the fees and availes due for
their seruice performed; and brought that same downe to the valew of 6000. sesterces. And having atchieved no greater exploit, than taken to his mercie, ADMINIUS the sonne of CINOBELLINUS King of the Batavorum,. i. the Batavo∣rians. Britains, who be∣ing by his father banished, was fled over sea with a small power and traine a∣bout him, he sent magnificent and glorious letters to Rome, as if the whole Isle had beene yeelded into his hands: warning and willing the carriers euer and anon, to ride forward in their wagon directly into the market place and the Curia, and in no wise to deliver the sayd messives but in the Temple of MARS vnto the Consuls, and that in a frequent assembly of the Senate. Soone after, when there failed matter of warre, he commanded a few Ger∣manes of the De Custodia, or that were prisoners and in vvard Corps de guard, to be transported & hidden on the other side of45 Rhene, and that news should be reported unto him after dinner in most tumul∣tuous manner, That the enemy was come: which done, he made what haste hee could, and together with some of his friends and part of the Pretorian horse∣men he entred the next wood: where after he had cut off the heads of trees and adorned their bodies in manner of Tropaees, hee returned into the Campe by torch-light. As for those uerily who followed him not in this seruice; he re∣proved and checked them for their timorousnesse and cowardise: But his com∣panions and partners in this douty uictorie, he rewarded with a new kind and as strange a name of Coronets: which being garnished and set out with the ex∣presse forme of Sunne, Moons, and Stars he called (a) Exploratorias. Againe, when as certaine hostages were had By his means. away perforce out of the Grammer schoole, and privily sent before, he suddenly left his supper, and with his men of armes pursued them as runawaies, and beeing overtaken and caught againe he brought them backe as prisoners bound in chaines; shewing himselfe even in this enterlude also, beyond all measure insolent and intemperate. Now af∣ter he was come backe to supper, those who brought him word that the bat∣tailes were rallied and come forward in safetie, hee exhorted to sit downe to meate armed as they were in their Corselets: yea and aduertised them out of that most vulgar Verse of VIRGIL. Durarent, Secundisque rebuise serua∣rent.. i. Still to endure in all assayes And keepe themselues for better dayes. Moreover, amid these affaires, he rebuked most sharply in a proclamation, the Senate and people both, in their absence: For that whiles CAESAR fought bat∣tailes and was exposed to so many perils, they could so unseasonably celebrate feastes, haunt also the Cirque, The Theatres, and their retyring places of solace and plea∣sure. Last of all, as if he meant now to make a finall dispatch for ever of the warr46 having embattailed his armie upon the Ocean shore, planted his balists and o∣ther engins of Artillerie in their seuerall places, (and no man wist the while or could imagine what he went about) all at once he commanded them to ga∣ther fish-shels, and therewith to fill their headpeeces and laps, tearming them the spoiles of the Ocean, due to the Capitl, and the Palatium. In token also and memoriall of this brave uictorie, he raised an exceeding high turret, out of which as from a watch-towre, there might shine all night long lights and fires for the better direction of ships at sea in their course. And after hee had pro∣nounced
publikely a donative to his Souldiours, even an hundred good De∣niers a peece; as if thereby hee had surmounted all former precedents of libe∣rality,* As if with 3 l. 2 S 6 pence, they had beene made for ever. Now goe your waies, quoth hee, with ioy, Goe your wayes Isay, enriched and wealthy. 47 Turning his minde after this to the care of his Triumph, hee selected and set apart for the pompe (over and above the Captives and runnagate Barba∣rians) the tallest men of Stature also that were to be found in Gaule: and eve∣rie one that (as hee saide himselfe) was axiothriambentos, that is, worthy to be seene in a Triumph, yea and some of the Nobles and principall persons of that Nation: Whom hee compelled not onely to colour the haire of their heads yellow like burnished gold, and to weare the same long: but also to learne the Germaines language, and to beare barbarous names. He gave commaun∣dement also; that the Gallies with three rankes of Oares, wherein hee had em∣barqued and entred the Ocean, should bee convaied to Rome, a great part of the way by land. Hee wrote likewise unto his procuratours and Officers, To provide the furniture of his triumph, with as little cost as might be: but yet the same in as ample manner as never before was the like, seeing they had both might and right to seize all mens goods into their hands. 48 Before his departure out of that Province, hee intended the execution of an horrible and abhominable designement; even to put to sword those Legions, which long a goe upon the decease of AUGUSTUS, had made a commoti∣on: because, forsooth, they had beset both his father GERMANICUS their Captaine, and himselfe also, then an Infant. And being hardly and with much a-doe reclaimed from such a rash and inconsiderate proiect, yet could hee by no meanes be stayed: but stifly persisted in a full minde and will to  To kill e∣very tenth man of them: tith them. When hee had summoned them therefore to a publique assembly, unarmed, and without their swords which they had put off and bestowed heere and there, he environed them with his Cavallerie all armed. But seeing once, that many of them suspecting where-about he went, slipped away in sundry places for to resume their weapons if any violence were offred, himselfe abandoned the as∣sembly and fled, taking his direct way immediatly to the Citie of Rome; diver∣ting all his bitternesse and crueltie upon the Senate: Whom, (to avert from himselfe the odious rumours of so great and shamefull villanies) hee openly threatned; complaining among other matters that he was by them defrauded and put by his iust and due triumph: whereas, himselfe but a little before, had intimated and denounced upon paine of death, that they should not make nor meddle in any matter about his honours. 49 Being encountred therefore and met upon the way by Embassadours from that most honourable Of Senators Order, entreating him to make speed: with a most loud voice, Come I will, quoth he, I will come, I say and this with me heere, beating oft upon the swords Or haft▪ hilt which he ware by his side. He made it knowne also by an Edict, That he returned in deede, but it was to them alone who wished it, namely, The degree of Gentlemen and the cōmon people. For himselfe would be no longer a Citizen or Prince to the Senate. He commaunded moreover, That not one of the Senatours
should meete him. And thus, either omitting quite or putting of his triumph, hee entred the Citie riding ovant, upon his very birth-day: and within foure moneths after came to his end, having attempted and done notable outrages and very great villanies, but plotting still and practising much greater. For hee had purposed to remove his imperiall Court to Antium, and afterwards to A∣lexandria: but having massacred first the most choise and chiefe persons of both Or Alexan∣drea is Antio∣chea, in old Ma∣nuscripts. degrees. And that no man may seeme to doubt heereof, there were in his secret Cabinet found two bookes bearing divers titles. The one had for the Inscription Gladius. i. the sword: the other, Pugio, that is to say, the dagger. They contained both of them the markes and names of such as were appoin∣ted to death. There was found besides, a bigge chest full of divers and sundry poisons, which soone after being by CLAUDIUS drowned in the Seas, infe∣cted and poisoned the same, not without the deadly bane of fishes killed there∣with, which the tide cast up to the next shores. 50 Of Stature hee was very tall, pale and wan-coloured: of body grosse and without all good making: his necke and shanks exceeding slender: his eyes sunke in his head, and his temples hollow, his forehead broad, and the same furrowed and frowning: the haire of his head growing thinne, and none at all about his crowne: in all parts else hairie he was and shagged. It was therefore taken for an hainous and capitall offence, either to looke upon him as he pas∣sed by from an higher place, or once but to name a Goate upon any occasion whatsoever. His face and visage being naturally sterne and grim, hee made of purpose more crabbed and hideous: composing and dressing it at a looking∣glasse, all manner of waies to seeme more terrible and to strike greater feare. He was neither healthfull in body nor stoode sound in minde; Being a child, much troubled with the falling sicknesse. In his youth, patient of labour and travaile: yet so, as that ever and anone upon a suddaine fainting that came up∣pon him, he was scarce able to goe, to stand, to arise, to recover himselfe and to beare up his head. The infirmitie of his minde, both himselfe perceived, and oftentimes also was minded to goe aside (unto An Isle, where grew the best Ellebor, a pur∣gatiue meete or lunaticke & distracted persons. Anticyra), there to purge his braine throughly. It is for certaine thought, that poysoned he was with a Potion given unto him by his wife CAESONIA: Which in deede was a love Or drinke. medicine, but such an one, as crackt his wits and enraged him. He was trou∣bled most of all with Insomnia want of sleepe; For, he slept not above three houres in a night: and in those verily hee tooke no quiet repose, but fearefull; and ska∣red with strange illusions and fantasticall imaginations: as who among the rest, dreamed upon a time that hee saw the very forme and resemblance of the sea talking with him. And heereupon for a great part of the night, what with tedious wakefulnesse and wearinesse of lying, one while sitting up in his bed, another while roaming and wandering too and fro in his Galleries (which were of an exceeding length) hee was wont to call upon and looke still for the day-light. 51 I should not doe amisse, if unto this mindes sicknesse of his I attributed the vices which in one and the same Or person subiect were of a most different na∣ture: to wit, excessive confidence, and contrariwise, overmuch fearefulnesse.
For, hee that set so light by the Gods and despised them as hee did, yet at the least (a) thunder and lightning, used to winke close with both eyes, to enwrap also and cover his whole head: but if the same were greater and somewhat ex∣traordinarie, to start out of his bed, to creepe and hide himselfe under the bed∣steede. During his peregrination verily and travaile through Sicilie, after hee had made but a scorne and mockerie at the miracles and strange fights in ma∣nie parts there, he fled suddainly by night from Messana, as affrighted with the smoake and rumbling noise of the top of Aetna. And hee that against the Bar∣barians was so full of threats and menaces, when as beyond the river Rhene he rode in a Germaines Chariot betweene the Streights, and the Armie mar∣ched in thicke squadrons together: by occasion onely that one saide, There would be no small trouble and hurliburly, in case the enemie from any place ap∣peared in sight: forth-with hee mounted on horsebacke and turned hastily to the bridges: but finding them full of Camp-slaves and cariages wherewith they were Or guarded▪ choaked as one impatient of any delay, he was from hand to hand and over mens heads conveied to the other side of the water. Soone after likewise, hearing of the revolt and rebellion of Germanie, hee provided to flie; and for the better meanes of flight, prepared and rigged shippes: re∣sting and staying himselfe upon his onely comfort; That hee should yet have Provinces beyond sea remaining for him, in case the Conquerours following the traine of their victorie, either seized the Hill tops of the Alpes (as some∣times the Cimbrians), or possessed themselves of the very Citie of Rome, as the Senones in times past did. Heereupon I verily beleeve that the murderers of him afterwards devised this shift, namely to hold up his Souldiours with a loude lie when they were in an uprore, and to beare them in hand that hee laide violent hands on himselfe, affrighted at the fearefull newes of the field lost. 52 As for his apparrell, his shooes and other habite, hee wore them neither after his owne Country-guise, nor in a civile fashion, no nor so much as in manlike manner, nor yet alwaies, I may tell you, sorting with the state and condition of a mortall wight. Beeing clad oftentimes in cloakes of needle∣worke and embroidred with divers colours, and the same set out with pretious stones: in a coate also with long sleeves: and wearing bracelets withall, hee would come abroade into the Citie. Sometime you should see him in his silkes, and veiled all over in a loose mantle of fine Lawne or Tiffame. Sendall with a traine: one while going in Greekish Or Pantofle slippers, or else in buskins: otherwhiles in a simple paire of broges or high shooes, such as common Souldiours emploied in e∣spiall used. Now and then also was he seene shod with womens Or  pumps. But for the most part he shewed himselfe abroade with a golden (a) beard carying in his hand either a (b) thunderbolt or a three-tined (c) mace, or else a warder* With three graines like an ele speare; or rod called (d) Caduceus (the ensignes all and ornaments of the Gods) yea and in the attire and array of VENUS. Now, for his triumphall robes and ensignes hee used verily to weare and beare them continually, even before any warlike expedition: and sometime the cuirace withall of K. ALEXANDER the great, fetcht out of his Sepulcher and monument. Of all the liberall Sciences, hee gave his minde least to deepe literature and53
found learning: but most, to eloquence:  is facundus: or,  beeing very faire . &c albeit he was (by nature) faire-spo∣ken and of a ready tongue. Certes if it had beene to pleade and declame against one, were he angred once, he had both words and sentences at will. His acti∣on, gesture and voice also served him well: in so much as for very heate and earnestnesse of speech, uneth was he able to stand his ground and keepe still in one place, yet might hee bee heard nothlesse of them that stoode a farre off. When he was about to make an Oration, his manner was to threaten in these termes, Namely, That he would draw forth and let drive at his adversarie the keene weapon and dart of his night-studie by candle light; contemning the milder and more piked kinde of writing so farre forth, as that hee said of SNECA, a wri∣ter in those daies most accepted, That his compositions which he made were plaine exercises to bee shewed onely: and was no better himselfe, than sand without lime. His wont was also, to answere by writing the Orations of those Oratours who had pleaded well and with applause: to meditate and devise as well accusati∣ons and defences of great persons and waighty matters in the Senate; and ac∣cording as his stile framed, either to over-charge and depresse, or to ease and relieve every man with his sentence: having called thither by vertue of his E∣dicts, the degree also of Gentlemen to heare him speake. The Arts moreover and maisteries of other kinds hee practised right studi∣ously,54 even those of most different nature. A professed . Sword-fencer he was and a good Chariotier: A singer withall and a dauncer. Fight hee would even in earnest with weapons at sharpe: and runne a race with chariots in the open Cirque, which he built in many places. As for chaunting and dauncing, he was so hotly set thereupon, that hee could not forbeare so much as in the publick Theaters and Shew-places, but that hee would both fall a singing Or,  with the Tragaedian as he pronounced, and also counterfaite and openly imi∣tate the gesture of the Or Actou. player, as it were by way of praise or correction. And verily, for no other cause proclaimed hee (as it is thought) a wake or Vigile all night long, that very day on which hee was murdred, but that by taking the opportunity of the nights licentiousnesse, he might therewith begin to enter upon the Stage. And divers times daunced he by night: But once above the rest, having raised out of their beds three honourable persons that had beene Consuls, and sent for them at the reliefe of the second watch into the Palace; whiles they were much afraid and doubted some extremity he caused them to be placed aloft upon a scaffold, and then suddainly with a great noise of hant∣bors and sound of shawlmes or Cimbals, out commeth he leaping forth with a palle and cassocke reaching downe to his ankles; and after hee had daunced out the measures to a song, vanished & went his way againe. Now, this man so apt a schollar as hee was to learne all other feates, had no skill at all in A laudable exercise in Rome, as may appeare before in Augustus. swim∣ming. 55 Looke, whom he tooke a love and liking unto, he favoured them all ex∣ceedingly and beyond all reason. MNESTER the famous A Gesturer or dauncer that counterfaited all parts. PANTOMIME he affected so much, as that he bashed not to kisse him even in the open Theater; and if any man whiles The said Mnester. he was dauncing or acting a part, made never so little noise and interrupted him, hee commaunded the party to be pulled out of his place, and with his owne hand scourged him. A Gentleman of Rome chaun∣ced to keepe some sturre whiles the said MNESTER was upon the Stage: unto
him hee sent word peremptorily by a Centurion to depart without delay, and goe downe to Ostia (there to take Sea) and so to carie unto King PTOLOMAE∣US as farre as into Mauritania his letters in writing tables, The tenour whereof was this, To this bearer, whom I have sent hither to you, see you doe neither good nor harme. Certaine Fencers called Or Retiarij, as some think. Others take it to be a generall name of all Sword-fencers. THRACES hee made Capitaines over those Germaines that were of his Guard and Squires to his body. As for the A faction or crew of fencers opposite to the Thraces or Reti∣arij, whom in respect of the Thraces, he fa∣voured not. Mir∣millones, hee deprived them of their armour. One of them named COLUM∣BUS, fortuned to foile his concurrent, howbeit hee had gotten before some small hurt: He made no more adoe but put poison into the wound, which thereupon he called COLUMBINUM. So much addicted and devoted was he, to the Prafiae fac∣tioni. greene faction of Chariotiers, that day by day hee would take his sup∣pers and make his abode, in their Or lodging,  Of that green livery. hostelrie. Vpon EUTYCHUS a , cuins equi causa, some interpret it o∣therwise thus. To Incitatus, for whose horse sake taking In∣cicatus to be the name of the Maister, & not of the horse, because in the Poet Martiall, there is menti∣on made of In∣citatus a fa∣mous Chariot ricer & a muli∣tier. Yet L. Ve∣rus Antoninus erected an I∣mage of gold for on horse that he had named Voluce whiles he lived: and a sepulcher when he was dead. And why might not this brair  sicke Prince be as absurd? Chariot∣driver, he bestowed in hospitall gifts at a certaine banquet, two millions of se∣sterces. To one of their Chariot-steedes named Incitatus, for whose sake (be∣cause he should not be disquieted), he was wont the day before the games Cir∣censes, by his Souldiours to commaund the neighbours there adioyning to keepe silence, besides a Stable all built of marble stone for him, and a manger made of Ivorie: over and above his caparison also and harnois of purple, toge∣ther with a brooch or pendant Iewell of pretious stones at his poictrell: he al∣lowed an house and familie of servants, yea and houshold-stuffe to furnish the same: all to this end, that guests invited in his name might be more finely and gaily intertained. It is reported moreover that he meant to preferre him unto a Consulship. 56 As he rioted thus and fared outragiously, many there were who wanted no hart & good will to assault his person. But after one or two conspiracies de∣tected, when others for default of opportunitie held-of and made stay, two at length complotted and imparted one unto the other their designment, yea and performed it; not without the privitie of the mightiest freed-men about him, and the Capitaines of his Guard. The reason was, for that they also, beeing nominated (although untruly) as accessarie to a certaine conspiracie, percei∣ved themselves suspected and odious unto him therefore. For, even immedi∣atly, by sequestring them a part into a secret place he brought upon them great hatred, protesting with his sword drawne, That die he would upon his owne hand, if they also thought him worthy of death. Neither ceased hee from that time for∣ward to accuse one unto the other, and to set them all together by the eares. Now when these Conspiratours were resolved and agreed to assaile him du∣ring the Palatine (a) games, as he departed thence out of the Theater at noone∣tide, CASSIUS CHEREA Tribune of the Pretorian Cohort tooke upon him to play the first part in this Action: even hee, whom being now farre stept in yeeres , CAIUS was wont to frump and flout in most opprobrious termes as a wanton and effeminate person: and one while, when he came unto him for a watch-word, to give him PRIAPUS or VENUS; another while, if upon any occasion he rendred thanks, to reach out unto him his hand, not onely fashio∣ned but wagging also after an obscoene and filthy manner. Many prodigious signes were seene, presaging his future death and murder.57 The image of IUPITER at Olympia, which his pleasure was to bee disiointed and translated to Rome, did set up all on a suddaine such a mighty laughter that
the workmen about it, let their Engines and Vices slip and so ranne all away. And straight-waies came there one in place whose name also was CASSIUS, that avouched, he had warning and commaundement in a dreame to sacrifice a Bull unto IUPITER. The (a) Capitol in Capua upon the Ides of March was smitten with lightning. Likewise at Rome the Porters lodge belonging to the Princes Palace. And there wanted not some who gave their coniecture, that by the one Prodigie was portended danger to the Master of the house from his Guard and the Squires of his person; by the other some notable murder againe, such as in times past had beene committed upon (b) the same day. Also, SULLA the Astrologer, when CAIUS asked his counsell and opinion, as touching the Ho∣roscope of his Nativitie, told him plaine, That most certaine and inevitable death approached neere at hand. Semblably the Oracle at Antium, gave him a caveat, to beware of CASSIUS. For which very cause, hee had taken order and given expresse commaundement, That CASSIUS LONGINUS Proconsull then in Asia, should bee killed: not remembring that the fore-saide CHAEREA had to name CASSIUS. The day before he lost his life, he dreamt that he stoode in heaven close unto the throne of IUPITER: and that IUPITER spurned him with the great toe of his right foote, and therewith threw him downe head∣long to the earth. There went also for currant prodigies and fore tokens of his fall; even those occurrents that hapned unto him that very day, a little be∣fore he was murdred.

(for that his stomacke was yet rawe and weake upon a surfait of meate taken the day before), at last by the perswasion of his friends hee went forth. Now, when as in the very Or . cloisture through which hee was to passe certaine boyes of noble birth sent for out of Asia (to sing Himnes, and to skirmish mar∣tially upon the Stage) were preparing themselves, he stood still and staied there to view and encourage them. And but that the leader and chiefetaine of that crew, said, He was very cold, hee would have returned and presently exhibited that shew. But what befell after this, is reported two manner of waies. Some say, that as he spake unto the said boies, CHAERA came behind his back, and with a drawing blow grievously wounded his neck with the edge of his sword, giving him these words before, Hoc age. i. Mind this: Wherupon, CORNELIUS SABINUS, another of the Conspiratours, encountred him a-front, and ranne him through in the brest. Others write, that SABINUS, after the multitude a∣bout him was voided by the Centurions (who were privie to the Conspiracie)
called for a watch-word, as the maner is of souldiers, and when CAIUS gave him the word, IUPITER, CHAEREA cryed out alowde, Accipe ratum. i. Here take it sure: and with that, as he looked behind him, with one slash cut his chaw quite thorough: Also as he lay on the ground and drawing up his limmes to∣gether cryed still, That he was yet alive, the rest of their complices with thirtie wounds dispatched and made an end of him. For, this mot, Repete. i. Strike a∣gaine, was the signal of them all. Some of them also thrust their swords through his privie members. At the very first noise and outcrie, his licter-bearers came running to helpe, with their litter staves: Soone after, the Germans that were the squires of his bodie came in: & as they slew some of the murderers, so they killed certaine Senatours also that were meere innocent. He lived 29. yeares, and ruled the Empire three yeares 10. moneths and 8.59 dayes. His dead corps was conueyed secretly into the Lamian hortyards, where being scorched onely, or halfe burnt in a tumultuary and hasty funerall fire, covered it was with a few turfs of earth lightly cast over it; but afterwards, by his sisters now returned out of exile, taken up, burnt to ashes and enterred. It is for certain knowen and reputed; that before this Complement was performed, the keepers of those hortyards were troubled with the walking of spirits and ghosts: and in that uery Which hee called a  cloyster, ∣fore. house wherin he was murdred there passed not a night without some terror or fearefull object, until the uery house it selfe was consu∣med with fire. There dyed together with him, both his Wife CAESONIA, stabbed with a sword by a Centurion, and also a daughter of his, whose braines were dashed out against a wall.60 What the condition and state was of those dayes, any man may gather, even by these particulars. For neither, when this massacre was divulged and made knowen abroad, men gave credite by and by thereto; but there went a suspici∣on, that CAIUS himselfe had feigned and given out a rumour of this murder, by that meanes to sound mens minds, and find, how they stood affected unto him:  yet had those conspiratours destined the Empire to anie one.

After his pretureship, he entred immediatly upon the Con∣sulate: and having enterprised a second expedition thither, fell sicke and dyed in his summer campe, which therupon tooke the name of The wicked and mischie∣uous camp.

Furthermore he is thought to have caried a mind no lesse glorious than civil & popular.

Whereupon, I suppose, some presume to write, that AUGUSTUS had him in jelousie and suspicion: called him home out of his Province: and because he lingred and delayed his returne, made him awy by poyson. Which uerily put downe I have, because I would not seeme to pre∣termit such a matter, rather, than for that I thinke it either true or pro∣bable: considering that AUGUSTUS both loved him whiles hee was alive so entirely, as that he alwayes ordained him fellow-heire with his sonnes, (like as he openly professed upon a time in the Senate house) and also commended him after his death so highly, that in a solemne oration before the bodie of the people he prayed unto the gods. Tououchsafe his owne CAESARS to be like un∣to him: and to grant himselfe one day such an end as they had given him. And not contented with this that he had engraven upon his tombe an Epitaph in verse which he himselfe composed, he wrot also the historie of his life in prose. By ANTONIA the yonger, he became father uerily of many children, but three onely hee left behind him at his death, namely, GERMANICUS, LIVILLA, and CLAUDIUS. This CLAUDIUS was borne at Lyons, in the yeare when IULIUS2 A. V. C. 744▪ ANTONIUS and FABIUS AFRICANUS were Consuls, upon the Calends of August, that uery day on which the altar was first dedicated there unto AUGUSTUS: and named he was TIBERIUS CLAUDIUS DRUSUS: and a while after, when his elder brother was adopted into the family IULIA, hee assumed into his stile the surname of GERMANICUS. Being left an infant by his father, all the time in manner of his child-hood and Or growing age. youth, piteously
handled he was with sundrie diseases, and those tough and such as stucke long by him: in so much as being dulled and enfeebled thereby both in mind and bo∣die, he was not thought in the very progresse of riper age, sufficient and capa∣ble of any publike office or private charge: yea and many a day after that hee came to full yeares and had sued out his liveie, hee was at the dispose of a∣nother, even under a pedagogue and governour; whom in a certaine booke himself complaineth of, terming him a barbarous fellow, and no better some∣time than a Olim superiu∣mentarium, ra ther a maister of mulitiers. multier, set over him of purpose to chastice and punish him most cruelly for everie light cause & occasion whatsoever. By reason of this his sick∣nesse, both at the sword-play which he and his brother ioyntly exhibited in memoriall of their Father, he sat as president (not after the accustomed man∣ner) lapt in a cloake; and also upon his commensement day, when he was to put on his virile gowne, about midnight without anie honorable attendance and solemne traine, brought he was in a licter into the (a) Capitoll. 3 Howbeit, from his very child-hood, he employed no meane studie in the liberall sciences. And oftentimes gave good proofe even in publike place of his proceedings in them all: yet could he never for all that reach to any degree of dignity, or yeeld better hope of himselfe for the time to come. His mother ANTONIA, was wont to call him Portentum hominis. i.

Howbeit for the pre∣sent (concerning such things whereof youle aske mine aduise) I mislike it not, that he have the charge of the Priests dyning chamber, during these Martiall solemnities a∣foresayd,
so that he wil suffer himselfe to be admnished and schooled by SILANUS sonne, a man allyed unto him, that he do nothing, which may be  or    at. noted, or derided.

Your Nephew TIBEIUS my sweet LIVIA, If I doe not wonder, that when he declamed that he could please and content me, I pray God I be dead. For how he that in his dayly talke speaketh so Darkly and confusedly.  should be able when he declameth, to deliver his mind and what he hath to say Cleerely and plainely to be vnderstood.  I cannot see. Neither is there anie doubt to be made, but that after all this, AVGV∣STUS ordained and left him indued with no honorable office, save only the Sa∣cerdotall dignitie of Augurs: nay he nominated him not so much as his Heire, but in a third degree and descent, even among those that were well neere Strangers: and that in a sixth part onely of his substance: and by way of lega∣cie bequeathed unto him not above 800000. sesterces. 5TIBRRIUS his unkle conferred upon him when he sued for honorable dig∣nities the Ornaments of Consuls. But when he instantly demaunded still, not i∣maginary but true magistracies indeede, he wrote backe unto him in his wri∣ting tables thus much onely, That he had sent unto him Every one worth 15, . 7,  ob, or one ∣dred  fortie peeces of golde to spend at the feast Saturnalia, and to bestow in puppets and trifling gaudes, at the same time. Then, and not before, casting aside all hope of preferment and reall dig∣nities, hee betooke himselfe to rest and quietnesse of life, lying close, one while within hortyardes of pleasure and in a manner house without the Cittie: and lurking other whiles in a withdrawing place out of the way in Campania: And by his daily acquaintance and companie keeping with most base and ab∣ject persons besides the olde infamovs note of sluggardie and foolishnesse hee incurred an ill name for drunkennesse and dice-play: notwithstanding, that all the while he thus led his life, he never wanted the publike attendance and reve∣rent regard of men seeking unto him. 6 The order of Gentlemen elected him twice for their patrone, in an emba∣ssage that was to bee sent & delivered in their owne behalfe: once when the
Consuls required to have the cariage of AUGUSTUS his corps upō their own shoulders to Rome: 22. time when they were to cōgratulate with the same Con suls for the suppressing of Seianus, Moreover, they were wont in shewes, and in the Theatre, when he came in place, to arise up and lay off their mantels in re∣spective* As wee vse to veile bonet o do of our hats. honour of him. The Senate also ordained, that to the ordinarie num∣ber of the Priests or Guild brethren called AUGUSTALES, who were by lot chosen, he should be admitted extraordinarily: and soone after, That his house, which by misfortune of a skare-fire he had lost, should at the Cities charges be re∣dified; as also the priviledge to deliver his minde and opinion in the Senate, a∣mong those who had beene Consuls; which decree of theirs was reversed & annulled: whiles The Empe∣rour. TIBERIUS alleadged by way of excuse his imbecillity, and promised to repaire the foresaid losse out of his owne private purse and libe∣rality. Yet when hee laye upon his death-bed, he both named him among his heires in a third raunge, and in a third part of his estate, and also bequeathed him a legacie of two millions of Sesterces: yea recommended him besides by name unto the armies, to the Senate likewise & people of Rome in the ranke of other his especiall friends and kinsfolke. 7 At length under . CAIUS his brothers sonne, who at his first comming to the Empire sought by all manner of enticing allurements, to gaine the good opinion of a bountifull and gracious prince, he began first to beare office of state, and continued Consul together with him for the space of two moneths: and it fortuned at his first entrance into the Forum with his knitches of rods, that an Eagle soaring thereby, setled upon his right shoulder. He was pricked also and allotted unto a second Consulship, against the 4. th yeare following. Divers times he sat as president of the solemne shewes in CAIUS his turne: what time, the people with great applause All haile or . cryed Feliciter, partly to the Caligula Em∣perours Vncle, and in part to GERMANICUS his brother. 8 Yet lived hee neverthelesse subiect to the contumelious reproches of the World: For if at anie time, hee came somewhat with the latest and after the houre appointed to a supper, hardly & with much adoe, was there any roome made for to receive him, and not before hee had gone round about the tables where guests were set, for to finde a place: Likewise, whensoever he tooke a nap, and fel a sleepe after meate (which was an ordinarie thing with him) the A Copreis: See Tberius Nero Caesar, cap. 61. vel a  such as would play Bopeepe and bide them∣selves when they had done some unhappi∣nesse. buffons and jesters about him, made good sport, pelling him with olive and dae stones: other whiles also they would by way of merriment awaken him with the clappe of a ferula or lash of some whip. They were wont likewise to glove his hands (as he lay snorting a sleep) with * his shoes, that as he suddenly awaked hee might rub his face and eyes therewith. 9 Neither verily could he avoide divers dangerous troubles: First in his very Consulship: for, beeing behind hand and over slacke in taking order with the workmen for the making and erecting of NERO and DRUSUS Statues, who were For whiles they sat or lea∣ned upon pal∣lets at their meat they put off their shoes. CAESARS brethren, hee had like to have beene remooved and put out of that honorable office: afterwards, as eyther anie stranger, or one of his own*  Calig∣la. house informed ought against him, he was continually and sundry manner of
waies molested. But when as the Conspiracie of LEPIDUS & GTULICUS came to light, being sent among other Embassadours to congratulate CAIUS in the name of the City, hee was in ieopardy of his very life: whiles CAIUS chafed and fumed with great indignation, that his Vnkle chiefly of all others was sent unto him, as it were to governe a child: In so much, as some have no stuck to report on writing, that hee was turned also headlong into the river in his cloathes and all as he came apparailed. From which time forward, neve spake hee to any matter proposed in the Senate, but last of all those, that had beene Consuls, as being in reproachfull wise and to his disgrace asked his opi∣nion after them all. There was received likewise against him the examination of a forged will, wherein himselfe also had beene a witnesse and put-to his seale. Last of all, hee was forced to disburse eight millions of Sesterces for a fine or Income at his entrance into a new Priesthood: by occsion whereof, his estate being so much decaied, driuen he was to those streights, that for his disability to keepe credit and satisfie the debt due unto the Chamber of the City by an (a) Edict of the Citie Treasurers according to the law Praediatoria hee His lands and goods were forfeited and so were published in table as void and vacant, hung up to be sold in vacuum. 10 Having passed the greatest part of his time in running thorough these and such like troubles, at length in the fiftieth yeere of age, hee attained to the Em∣pire, and that by a strange and wonderfull hap. Being among others excluded by the Conspiratours that layed waite for CAIUS life, what time they voided all the Companie about his person, under a colour as if he desired to be a part himselfe alone in some by-place, this CLAUDIUS had stept a side and retired into a lodging or parlour called Hermeum: And not long after, being affrigh∣ted at the rumour of that murder slily crept forth and conveied himselfe up in∣to* A garret▪ a Solar next adioyning, and there hid himselfe betweene the hangings that hung before the dore. Whiles hee lurked close there, a common Souldiour chauncing to runne too and fro that way, espied his feete, and by earnest en∣quirie and asking who he was? hapned to take knowledge of him: who having drawne him forth of the place (when as for feare hee fell downe humbly at hisA, V, C. 794 feete and tooke hold of his knees) saluted him by the name of Emperour. From thence he brought him immediatly to his other fellow Souldiours, who as yet stoode wavering and wist not what to doe but fare and fume. By them was he bestowed in a Licter▪ and for that his owne servants were fled scattering heere and there they also by turnes one after another supported the said Licter upon their shoulders: and so was he brought into the (Praetorian) Camp, all sad and amazed for feare: pitied also by the multitude that met him on the way; as if some innocent had been haled to execution. Being received within the trench & rampire, lodged he was alnight among the souldiours-watch with lesse hope of his a good deale than confidence. For the Consuls together with the Senate and the cohorts of the citie-souldiers, seized the Forū & the Capitol, with a pur∣pose to claime & recover the cōmon libertie: and when himselfe was sent for, by a tribune of the commons into the Curia to sit in consultation & give his ad∣uise about those matters that were thought good to be propounded he made answere; That deteined he was perfrce and by constraint. But the next mor∣row, when as the Senate grewe more colde and slacke in following and
executing their foresaid proiects, (by reason of their tedious trouble and dis∣cord who dissented in opinion)▪ whiles the multitude also standing round a∣bout, demaunded by this time one Ruler & . him by name, he called the Soul∣diours in , or . . him∣selfe armed. armour to an assembly, and suffred them to take their oath of allea∣geance, and sweare to maintaine his imperiall dignity: therewith promised unto them Qu na dena Sesterta. See . 1500 Sesterces a peece: the first of all the CAESARS, that obliged unto him the Souldiours fealty by a fee and reward. Having once established his Empire, hee thought nothing more deere and11 behovefull than to abolish the remembrance of those two daies, wherein there was some doubtfull question about the change and alteration of the State. Of all deedes and words therefore, which had passed during that time he made an Act there should be a generall pardon and perpetuall oblivion: which also hee made good and performed accordingly. Onely, some few Colonels and Cen∣turions, out of that crew which conspired against CAIUS, he put to the sword: as well for example sake, as for that he had certaine intelligence, they required to have him also murdered. Then presently turning and bending his minde to the duties of pietie and kindnesse, hee tooke up no forme of oath, either with more devout religion or oftener, than by the name of AUGUSTUS. He gave order, that for his Grandmother LIVIA, there should by Decree be graunted Divine honours; as also in the stately pompe of the Cirque Solemnities, a Chariot drawne with Elephants, like unto that of AUGUSTUS: Semblably, for the soules of his owne parents departed, publick Dirges and Funerall feasts: and more than so, particularly in the honour of his father Cirque-Plaies and games every yeere upon his birth day: and in memoriall of his mother, a coach to be led and drawne along through the Cirque: and the surname of AUGU∣STA, which by his Grandmother was refused. In remembrance of his Germanicus. bro∣ther (to celebrate whose memoriall hee omitted no occasion) hee exhibited a Greeke Comaedie at the solemne Games held in Naples: Where by sentence of the Vmpiers and Iudges he received a coronet therefore. Hee suffered not so much as M. ANTONIUS to passe unhonoured, nor without a thankfull mention and remembrance: protesting one time, and that by an Edict, That so much the more earnest he was, to have men celebrate the Birth day of his father DRUSUS, because upon the same day, his Grandfather ANTONIUS also was borne. The Marble Arch, decreed verily in times past by the Senate to be erected for TIBERIUS His Vnkle neere unto the Theater of POMPEIUS, but for let, hee finished. And albeit hee abrogated and repealed all the Acts of CAIUS, yet the day of his death, although it were the beginning of his Empire, he forbad to be regi∣stred among feasts in the Kalendar. But in honouring himselfe he was sparie, and caried a civile modestie. The12 fore name of Emperour he forbare: excessive honours hee refused: the Or solemnity of nuptiall con∣tract. E∣spousals of his owne daughter, the birth-day also of his Nephew her sonne, he passed over in silence, onely celebrating it with some private ceremonie and religious complements within house. He restored no banished person, but by the authority and warrant of the Senate. That hee might bring with him in∣to the Curia, the Capitaine of the Guard and Colonels. Tribunes of the Souldiours: Item, that those Actes might bee raified and stand in force, which his Procuratours had set downe in iudging of causes, hee obtained by intreatie.
He made suite unto the Consuls for a licence, to hold Faires and Markets, for his owne private Manors and Lands. In Commissions and Examinations of causes held by the Magistrates, he would oftentimes be personally present and sit as one of the Commissioners. To the same Magistrates, when they exhibi∣ted any Plaies or Games, himselfe also with the rest of the multitude would a∣rise up, and both with By applase and acclama∣tion. hand and * voice doe them honour. When the Tri∣bunes of the Commons repaired unto him before the Front of his Tribunall, he excused himselfe unto them, for that by reason of straight roome hee could not give audience unto them otherwise than standing upon their feete. There∣fore, within a small time hee purchased so much love and favour, as that when newes came (to Rome) that forlaied and slaine hee was in his iourney to Ostia, the people in a great tumult and uprore, fell to banning and cursing both the Souldiours as Traitours, and the Senate also as Paricides: neither ceased they thus to force against them, untill first one messenger, and then another, yea and soone after many more were produced by the Magistrates to the publick RO∣STRA, who assured them that he was alive and approached homeward. 13 Yet continued hee not for all this secured every way from the danger of se∣cret practises and wait-laying▪ but assailed hee was as well by private persons,  ole factions and conspiracies, yea and fore troubled in the end with civill . For there was a man, one of the Commons, taken about midnight eere unto his bed-chamber with a dagger. Found there were likewise twaine of the Gentlemens degree, in the open streete with a staffe having Some cal thi a Iacobs staffe. a blade in it, and a Hunters wood-knife waiting for him: the one to assault his person when he was gone forth of the Theater: the other as hee sacrificed at the tem∣ple of Mrs. Now there had conspired to make an insurrection and to alter the State, GALLUS ASINIUS and STATILIUS CORVINUS, the Nephewes of POLLIO and MESSALLA the Oratours, taking unto them for their Com∣plices many of his owne freed-men and servants. As for civile warre, kindled it was and begun by FURIUS CAMILLUS SCRIBONIANUS, Lieutenant generall of Dalmatia: but within five daies quenched cleane and suppressed; by reason that the Legions, which had chaunged their oath of alleageance, in re∣morce of conscience and touch of religion repented; after that upon significa∣tion given of a iourney to their new Generall, neither the Ominous & unlucky signe. Aeagles could bee dight and trimmed, nor the militarie ensignes plucked up and removed. 14 To his first Consulship he bare foure more: of which, the two former ioint∣lieA: V: C: 794 795 800 804 and immediatly one after another: the rest ensuing, with some time be∣tweene, to wit, each one in the fourth yeere: and as for the third, hee had no precedent for it in any other Prince, as being substituted in the voide place of a Consull deceased. A precise Iusticer he was, ministring Iustice, both when hee was Consull, and also being out of that Office, most painfully; even upon the solemne daies instituted for him and his: yea, and otherwhiles upon the aunci∣ent festivall daies and such as were religious. He followed not alwaies the pre∣script rule of lawes, moderating either the rigour or the lenity of penalties, by equity & reason, according as he stood affected to a cause: for, both unto those he restored their actions & gave leave to cōmense thē a new, who in the Court
before private Of private matters, as  and . Iudges had once lost their suites, by claiming more than was due: and also, such as were convict of some greater deceite and cousenage, he condemned to be cast unto wilde beasts: exceeding therein the ordinarie pu∣nishment by law appointed. 15 Moreover, in the examination, triall, and deciding of controversies, he was wonderous variable: one while circumspect, wary, and of great insight: other∣whiles as rash and inconsiderate▪ now and then also foolish, vaine, and like to one without all reason. When hee reviewed upon a time the Decuries of Iud∣ges, and put whom hee thought good from their Iurisdiction: one of them, who had answered to his name, and concealed the immunity and priviledge that he had by the benefit of children, he discharged quite, as a man desirous And therfore, ambitious. to be a Iudge. Another of them being molested and called into question by his adversaries before him, as touching a matter betweene him and them, and pleading withall for himselfe, That it was a case to be tried not extraordinarily (by CAESAR) but by the common course of Law, and in an ordinary Court of deputed Iudges: he compelled immediatly to handle & decide his owne cause before him: as who in his proper businesse should give proofe how indifferent a Iudge he would be heereafter in the matter of another. There was a woman that would not acknowledge her owne sonne. Now, when by evidence unnd arguments alleadged proet contra on both sides; the question rested in eis, a ballance doubtfull; he awarded, that she should be wedded to the young The plaintife himselfe. man: any▪ so forced her to confesse the truth and to take him for her child. Most ready he was to give iudgement on their side, who made appearance in Court when their adversaries were absent: without any respect and consideration, whether a man slacked and staied by his owne default, or upon some necessitie? One cried out upon a forger of writings, and required, That both his hands might be cut off. Hee made no more a doe, but forthwith called instantly, to have the hangman sent for, with his chopping knife and butchers block, to do the deed. There hapned one to be called iudicially to the barre, For that being a forainer he bare himselfe as a Romaine Citizen: and when the advocates of both sides grew to some little variance about this circumstance, namely, Whether the party De∣fendant ought to make his answere and plead his owne cause in a gowne As a Citizen of Rome. or a As a  cloake? he then, as if hee would make exceeding shew of pure and uncorrupt equitie, commaunded him to shift and change his habite often in the place, according as he was either accused or defended. Moreover, sitting in iudgement to de∣cide a certaine controversie, When he had heard what could be said, hee pro∣nounced sentence out of a written table, as it is verily thought; to this effect, That hee iudged on their side, who had alleadged the truth. For which prankes hee became base and contemptible, in so much as every where, and openly he was despised. One, to excuse a Or deponent witnesse, whom CAESAR Claudius. had called for out of a Province, alleadged in his behalfe, and said, Hee could not possibly come in time and be present, dissimuling the cause thereof a great while: at length, after ma∣nie long demaunds, what the reason might be? Why, quoth hee, the man is dead at PVTEOLI. Another when hee gave him thankes, for suffering a per∣son accused to have the benefite of a triall and to bee defended, added more-over these wordes, And yet this is an usuall and ordinarie thing.
Furthermore, I my selfe have heard olde folke say, That these Lawyers and Barristers were wont to abuse his patience so much, that as hee was going downe from the Or iudge∣ment seat. Tribunall, they would not onely call upon him to come backe againe, but also take hold of his gowne lappet and skirt, yea and other∣while catch him fast by the foote, and so hold him still with them. And that no man need to mervaile , there was one of these Greeke Lawyers, who pleading before him hapned in earnest altercation to let fall these words, , i. Thou art both old, and a foole besides. And verily it is for certaine knowne, that a Gentleman of Rome, accused before him for his ob∣scene filthinesse and unnaturall abuse of women, (although untruly) as having an enditement framed against him by his enemies that were mighty: when he saw common strumpets cited and their depositions heard against him, flung his writing steele and the bookes which he had in his hand, with great ubraiding of him also for his foolishnesse and cruelty, even at his very face, so as he rip∣pled and hurt there with his cheeke not a little. He bare also the Censureship: an office that a long time had beene discon∣tinued,16A, V, C, 800 801. after PAULUS and PLANCUS the Censours: but even this very place he held with an uneven hand and as variable a minde, as the event and successe ensuing. In the review taken of Romaine Gentlemen, hee dismissed without shame and disgrace, a young man charged with many infamous villanies, how∣beit one whom his owne father testified upon his knowledge and triall to bee right honest: saying withall, That he had a Censor of his owne. To another youth, who was in a very bad name for spoiling of maidens, and adulteries commit∣ted with wives, he did no more but give warning, Either more sparily to spena him selfe in those young and tender yeeres of his, or else more warily at least-wise, to goe to worke▪ adding thus much beside. For why know I, quoth hee, what wench thou keepest? And when upon the intreaty of his familiar friends he had taken of the infamous note which was set upon the name of one, Well, quoth he, let the blot *   Some read exta, i, yet the blot re∣maineth: mea∣ning the filthi∣nes of the act. yet remaine still to be seene. An honourable man and a principall personage of the Province Greece, howbeit ignorant in the Latine tongue, he not onely ra∣sed out of the ranke & roll of Iudges, but also deprived of his freedom in Rome, and made him a meere alien. Neither suffred he any man to render an account of his life, otherwise than with his owne mouth, as well as every one was able, and without a patrone to speake for him. Hee noted many with disgrace, and some of them without their knowledge, as mistrusting no such thing▪ yea, and for a matter that had no precedent, namely, because without his privity and a pasport obtained they went forth of Italy: one also among the rest, for that in the Province he accompanied a King in his traine: alledging for example, That in his Auncestours daies RABIRIUS POSTUMUS for following of K. PTO∣LOMAEUS into Alexandria to save & recover the monie which he had lent him, was accused before the Iudges, of Treason to the State. Having assaied to put many more to rebuke with great imputation of the Inquisitours negligence, but with greater shame of his owne: looke whomsoever he charged with sin∣gle For these matters would beare, action life, with childlesse estate or poverty, those lightly he found guiltlesse; as who were able to prove themselves husbands, fathers, and wealthy. Certes, one there was, who being accused to have laied violent hands upon himselfe, and wounded his owne body with a sword, stript himselfe naked, and shewed
the same whole and sound, without any harme in the world. Many other Acts he did of speciall note whiles he was Censour as namely these; He commaun∣ded a silver Chariot sumptuously wrought and set out to sale in the streete Si∣gillaria, for to be bought and broken all to peeces openly. Item, in one day he published 20 Edicts or Proclamations▪ and ij among the rest: In the one whereof hee gave the people warning, That when their Vineyards bare Grapes plentifully, they should Or enhuile: pich their vessels very well within: in the other, he did them to understand, That there was nothing so good against the stinging of a Viper, as the iuice of the Vghtree. One expedition and no more hee undertooke, and that was very small. When the Senate had by Decree allowed him Triumphall ornaments, hee17 supposing that a bare title of honour was inferiour to the maiestie of a Prince and Emperour, willing also to enterprise some exploit, whereby he might win the due glorie of a complet triumph, made choise before all other Provinces of Britaine; attempted by none since IULIUS (CAESAR) of famous memorie, and at that time in a tumultuous uprore, for that certaine revolts and rebels fled from thence, were not rendred. As he sailed from Ostia thitherward, twice had he like to have beene cast away and drowned, by reason of the strong blu∣string Southerne winde Circius, neere unto Ligaria, hard by the Ilands (a) Stochades. Having therefore travailed by land, From Massiles as farre as to the Cape Where Calais standeth, or Bullo, as som thinke. Gessoriacum, he crossed the seas frō thence into Britaine: and in very 16. Accor∣ding to D. A: V: C: 797 few daies, without battaile or bloushed, part of the Iland yeelded to his devo∣tion. So, in the sixth moneth after his first setting forth hee returned to Rome, and triumphed with most sumpteous pompe therefore prepared. To the sight of which Solemnitie, hee suffred not onely the Presidents and Governours of Provinces to have recourse into the Citie, but also certaine banished persons. And among the enemies Spoiles, hee set up a navall Coronet, and fastened it to the Finial of his house Palatine, hard by another civick guirland, in token and memoriall of the Ocean by him sailed over and subdued. After his trium∣phant Chariot rode MESSALLINA his wife in a Coach: then followed those gallants also Mounted likewise., who in the same warre had attained to triumphall ornaments: the rest went on foote and in their rich robes garded with purple: onely CRASSUS FRUGI mounted upon a brave Courser trimly trapped, and arrai∣ed himselfe in a triumphant mantle of estate, for that now twice hee had at∣chieved that honour. 18 Hee was at all times most carefull and provident for the When so ever you read in Su∣etonius (City) absolutely, un∣derstād theby Rome: Kat' ex∣ocheen: as one would say, The City of all Ci∣ties: A ordi∣narie phrase in other Romain∣writers: accor∣dng as Virgil hath fitly ex∣pressed in this verse. Eclog. 1. Vrbem quam dicunt, Roma, &c.

Whereupon he devised all the means he possibly could to bring into the Citie provision of corne & victuals, even in the winter season. For, he not onely proposed certaine set gaines to all corne∣masters, that would venture for graine, undertaking himselfe to beare all the losse that should happen unto anie of them by tempest: but ordained also great fees and availes for those that would builde ships for such traffique and merchandise, according to the condition and quality of each one. Namely for everie Romane Citizen exemption from the lawe PAPIA POPPAEA: For enfranchised latines, the freedome of Romane Citizens▪ and for womē, the priviledge and benefit of those that had 4. children, which constitutions stand in force and be observed at this day. 20 Many works he finished, and those rather for greatnesse, huge; then for use, needfull. But the chiefe and principall were these: The conduit of water begun by CAIUS. Item a Or Got. scluse to let out and draine the lake Fucinus; and the Or Pere. ha∣ven at Ostia: although he knew well enough, that The drawing of the lake Fici nus the one (of the twaine) AU∣GUSTUS had denied unto the Marsians who cōtinvally entreated him about it: and the Alterum. i. the Pere at Ostia.

He went in hand with the mere Ficinus in hope of gaine as well as of glorie: when some there were, who would have bound themselues in covenant and promise, to draine the sayd marrish at their owne private charges, in case the grounds being once made drie might be graunted unto them in free-hold. Now, for the length of three miles, partly by digging through the hill, and partly by hewing out the rocke before him, hee finished the channell at last with much adoe and after eleven yeares labour: albeit thirty thousand men were at worke continually about it and neuer rested between. The Pere at O∣stia beforesayd he made, by drawing an arme of the sea about, on the left and right hand both: and with all, at the mouth and entrance thereof, where now the ground lay deepe, raising an huge dam or pile against it. For the surer foundation of which pile, he drowned before hand that ship, wherein the great Obelisk had beene transported out of Aegypt: and when hee had supported it with buttresses of many stones, hee planted a lot upon the same an exceeding high watch-towre to the patterne of that PHARUS at Alexandria, to the end that by the fires burning there, in the night season, vessels at sea might direct their course.* Or Cisternes 21 Hee dealt often among the people great doles and Congiaries. Manie shewes and games likewise hee exhibited, and those magnificent: not such onely as were usuall and in accustomed places: but those that
were, both newly devised and also brought into ure againe, whereas they had of auntient time beene discontinued: yea and where no man else before him had ever set forth anie. The games for the dedication of POMPEIUS The∣atre, which For, the stage therof was cō∣sumed wth fire being halfe burnt hee had reedified. he gave a signall to begin from out of his Or feate of state. Tribunall erected in the Orchestra: seeing that before time, when hee had sacrificed and done his devotions in the houses above and came downe from thence through the mids of the Theatre and assembly, not one would once arise and give applause, but sat still and kept silence. He set out al∣so the Which were solemnizd once in te re volutin of one hundrd yeeres or one hu∣dred and  one as some write, Secular games and playes, as if they had beene exhibited by AUGU∣STUS over soone, and not reserued unto their full and due time: and yet him∣selfe in his owne histories writeth;, That whereas the sayd solemnities had beene in∣termitted, AUGUSTUS long after by a most exact calculation of the yeeres reduced them into order againe. By occasion whereof, The voice of the cryer was then ridi∣culous and laughed at, when after the solemne manner he called the people, To behold those games and playes, which no man had once seene alreadie, or should everA, V, C, 800, see againe: Whereas there suruived yet many who had seene them before: yea and some of the actours, who in times past had beene produced, were then likewise brought forth upon the stage. Oftentimes also he represented the Circensian games in the vaticane, and otherwhiles after every 5. Of Chariot . courses hee brought in the baiting of wild beastes. But in the greatest Cirque of ad which was beautified with barr-gates of marble stone and goales all guilded (whereas before time they had beene made of soft sand-stone and wood,) hee appointed proper and peculiar places for the Senatours, who had wont before time to behold the same sports here and there. Beside the races for the prise of Chari∣ots drawen with foure steeds. He represented also the warlike Troie pastime, & the baiting of Leopards: which the troup of the Pretorian horse men slew, ha∣ving for their leaders the Tribunes and the Captaine himselfe. Moreouer, hee brought into the shewplace Thessalian men of armes, whose manner is to chase about the cirque, wild buls; until they be tyred: then to mount them, and by the hornes to force them downe to the ground. As for shewes of sword∣fensers, hee exhibited them in many places, and after divers and sundrie sorts. One, that was kept every yeare within the Praetorian camp, without anie b∣ting and sumptuons provision of furniture. As for that, which was ordin set out and formally with baiting and other preparations in mars field at Septa: in the same place likewise, another extraordinary one and of short con∣tinuance, which he began to call Sportula, because he proclaimed at first when he exhibited it, That he inuited the people there to, as it were to a sodaine supper and short pittance, such as men vse to bid themselues unto. And in no kind of sport or gaming represented unto them, was he more civile, familiar and better dispo∣sed to passe the time away: in so much as putting forth his left hand, he togither with the common sort, would both by word of mouth tell, and with his fin∣gers also number the peeces of gold as he tendred them unto the winners; and many a time by way of exhortation and entreaty provoke the people to mirth;* Or, my mai∣sters Dominos. ever and anon calling them Sirs: yea, and betweene whiles intermingling bald, and far fetcht jests. As for example, when the people called for one (a) The name of a fener. PA∣LUMBUS to play his prises, Hee promised to let them have him, if he were once caughs. This also was but a simple plaine jest although to good purpose and in
season delivered: when he had by a speciall indulgence, granted unto a Cham∣pion who fought out of a British chariot, (for whome his foure children made earnest suite and entreaty) That he should bee freed from that profession of sword∣fight; and that with the great favour and liking of all men, he sent presently an admonition in writing: wherein he aduertised the people, How much they should endeauour to get children, seeing, as they did, in what good sted they serued, and how they procured grace even unto a very sword-fenser. He represented also in Mars field a warlike shew of the winning and sacking of a towne: Likewise the yeel∣ding of the Princes of Britaine; where he sat himselfe as president in his rich Coat-armour. When he was about to let out the water of the Or Lake mere: Ficinus▪ he exhibited in it a navall fight before: And as they who were to fight this bat∣taile, cryed out unto him, Ave Imperator, &c. i. All haile O Emperour; They salute thee and wish thy life who are ready to dye: and he againe made answere▪ This Vebe (Avete) signi∣fieth here, fare∣well or adeu. But the souldi∣ours construed it in the better sense for theyr owne turns, (as they had used it before in sa∣luting him) All haile ye also Avete vos. After which word given, as if he had pardoned them this skirmish, there was not one of them would fight: he, sitting a good while in doubt and suspense with himselfe, whether he should destroy them al with fire and sword? at length leapt forth of his throne, and running to and fro about the circuit of the sayd lake (not without foule faltering of his legs under him) partly with threats, and in part by way of exhortation constrained them to skirmish. At this brave shew, the Sicilian and Rhodian fleetes encountred eyther of them consisting of Duodnarum. Some read un∣devicenats i, 19. and out of Dio, quinquagen , i, 50 twelue gallies ruled with three rankes of oares a peece. To give the signall of battaile, there was a Resembling Neptunes Trumpetter. Triton of Syluer arising out of the mids of the lake by a fabricke artificially deuised, to sound the trumpet and set them togither. 22 Certaine pointes about religious Ceremonies, touching the ste like∣wise of civill and militarie affaires, as also concerning all degrees of persons both at home and abroad▪ he eyther reformed, or after long disuse forgotten, brought into practise againe, or els instituted and ordained new. In the ele∣ction and admission of Priests throughout their severall Colledges, hee nomi∣nated not one but he tooke his oath first. He obserued also precisely that so often as there was an Earthquake in the Citie, the Pretour for the time beeing should call a publike assembly, of the people and proclaime certain holydaies: Semblably, that upon the prodigious sight of an unlucky Whether it were an Owle, or the birde named Incendi∣aria. See Plin, lib, 10, cap, 13, & 12. foule in the Capitol, there should be held a solemne procession and supplication: wherein himselfe personally in the right of High▪priest; after warning givē unto the people from the Rostra, did read & pronounce a forme of prayers & they say after him. But from this congregation hee sequestred & removed the base multitude of me∣chanicall labourers and slaves. 23 The handling of causes and iudiciall pleading in Courts, devided before time into certaine moneths for winter and summer, he conioyned altogether. The iurisdiction as touching feofments upon trust which was wont yeere by yeere, and onely within the Citie to bee committed unto the magistrates, hee ordained to hold by patent for ever: and betooke the charge thereof unto the rulers and governours also of state in every province. That That a Wo∣man under 50, yeares of age, should not bee wedded to a man that was threescore. branch annexed to the lawe PAPIA (a) POPPAEA, which emplyeth thus much, That men

He or∣deined that untoWards under age. Pupils, the Consuls should extraordinarily appoint Tutors and Guardians. That they also who by the head-Magistrates were forbidden to make abode within any provinces, should bee debarred likewise from the Citie of Rome and Italie. Himselfe confined some after a strange fashion and without any precedent, inhibiting them to depart above three miles from the City. When he was to treat of any great affaire in the Curia, his manner was to sit in the Tribunes pue just in the midst betweene the Consuls chaires. As forLicēces to be absent a time from Rome. pasports which the Consuls were wont to be sued unto for, he would have the Citizens to bee beholden unto himselfe onely therefore, and to crave the same at his hands. 24 The badges and ornaments belonging unto the Consuls he granted unto theWho received 200000 sester∣ces for salarie or might de∣spend so much by the place Ducenarie Procuratours and Seneschals of Provinces. From as manie as refused the honorable dignitie of Senatours; he tooke away also the worship of the gentlemens degree. The right to weare the, i, The Sena∣tours robe studded with purple. Laticlave, (although hee promised at first not to chuse anie one Senatour who could not reckon 4. line∣all descents from a Citizen of Rome,) he allowed also to a libertines sonne: but with this condition, If he were adopted before by a Gentleman of Rome. And fearing for all that, least he should be blamed, he proved and shewed, That evē APPIUS CAECUS the cheife auncitour and Auctor of his owne race, being Censor, elected and admitted into the Senate the sonnes of Libertines: ignorant as hee was, that in the dayes of the sayde APPIVS, and in the times long after ensu∣ing, those were called Libertines, not onely who themselues were manumised and enfranchised, but such also, as were free borne of their progeny. The Colledge of Questours, insteede of pauing the streets and high wayes he enioyned to ex∣hibite a game or shew of sword-fensers▪ and in the lieu of the Provinces, Ostia andCisalpina which therupō was called Pro∣uincia Quaesto ria▪ gaule which he tooke from them hee restored the charge of the publike Treasure in the temple of Saturne; which office in the meane spaceFrō Augustu dayes. betweene, the Pretours for the time being, or those verely who had been Pretours before had borne. Vnto SILANUS espoused and betrothed unto his daughter, be∣fore he was undergrowen and 14. yeeres of age hee granted triumphall orna∣ments: but of elder persons to so many, as there is an Epistle extant written in the common name of the Legions wherein they make petition, That unto the Consuls Lieuetenants there might be granted together with the conduct of the armie, the sayde triumphall honours: to the end that they should picke quarrels and seeke occa∣sions of warre, they cared not how nor what way? Moreover to A. PLANTIUS he gave by a decree the pety triumph Ovatio: and as he entred so into the Citie himselfe met him upon the waie: and both when he went into the Capitoll &* Latst exit. i. evus ei , he gave him the right hand, and went on his left fide,  Eutropium returned also from thence againe, gave him the better hand. Vnto GABINI∣US SECUNDUS, who had vanquished the Cauci a nation in Germanie, he per∣mitted and gave leave to assume the surname CAUCIUS in his style. 25 The horsemens seruice and their places he ordered so by degrees, as that af∣ter the charge of a cohort, he granted the leading of a wing: and after the cō∣maund thereof, the Tribuneship or regiment of a Legion: he ordained their stipends also: and a kind of imaginary warrefare called Supra-Numerum (which
they that were absent might execute) and in name or title onely. By vertue of a decree that passed even from the Nobles them selues, he prohibited all soul∣diours professed, to enter into any Senatours houses for to do their dutie and salute them. Those Libertines who bare them selues for Romane gentle∣men he caused to forfeit their goods and bodies to the state. Such of them as were unthankeful and of whom their patrons complained, he deprived of free∣dome and made them bound againe: Yea and denied unto their aduocates for to heare any plea and to sit in iudgment against their owne freed men. When some Masters there were, that put forth their sick & diseased slaves into the Isle of* Aesculapius, for to avoid the tedious trouble of their cures at home, he made an act and ordained, That all such slaves should be free and not returne againe intoOtherwise called Tberi∣na. the hands of their Masters, in case they ever recovered: and if anie Master chose to kill them outright, rather then thus to put them forth, they should be guilty of murder. He gave warning by an edict, that no waifaring men should travaile through anie towne in Italie, but either on foot or (a) borne in a chaire, or els carried in a licter. In Puteoli and in Oslia he placed severall cohorts, to put by all mischan∣ces of skare-fires. He forbad all persons by condition aliens and forrainers, to take upon them Romane names; those I meane onely that distinguished houses and families. As manie of them as usurped the freedome of Rome-Citie he beheaded in the Without the gae Esquilina. Esquiline fielde. The two provinces Achaia and Ma∣cedonia, which TIBERIUS (the Emperour) had appropriated to And his suc∣cessours. him selfe, hee yeelded up againe into the hands and dispose of the Senate. The Lycians hee deprived of their freedome, by occasion of the mortall discord and variance among them. To the Rhodians, who repented for their olde trespasses hee restored their libertie which they had lost. Hee forgave all tribvtes to the Ilienses for ever, as to the first founders and stocke-fathers of the Romane Nation: And to that purpose hee red an olde letter in Greeke written unto K. SELEUCUS by the Senate and people of ROME: where∣in they, promised to entertaine amitie and league with him upon this conditi∣on, that hee would graunt unto the Ilienses, their naturall kinsfolke, immu∣nitie from all taxes and tributes. This some thinke is to bee understood of Christians whō we find in the Ecclesiasticall writers to bee misnamed by the Ethnicke Infides, Chrsti an, like as Christ himselfe Christ, in korne. The (b) Iewes who by the instigation of one CHRESTUS were evermore tumultuous, he banished ROME. The Embassadours of the GERMANES hee permitted to sit in the (c) Orche∣stra (with the Senatours) beeing mooved so to doe at their simplicitie and confident boldenesse for that beeing brought into the (d) Popularia and perceiving PARTHIANS and ARMENIANS sitting among the Senatours, they of their owne accord had remooved and passed to that quarter: giving out these words withall, that their valour and condition of estate was nothing inferiour to the others, The religion of the Dridae a∣mong the French-men, practising horrible and detestable cruelty and which under AUGUSTUS, Romane Citizens onely were forbidden to professe and use, he quite put downe and abolished. Contrariwise, the sacred rites and holy Caeremonies (of CERES) called Eleusima, hee attempted to transferre out of the Territorie Attica to ROME. The Temple likewise of VENUS (e) Erycine in Sicilie, which in continuance of time was decayed and fallen downe, hee caused to bee repavred and built againe at the common charges of the people of ROME: Hee made Covenants and league with forraine
Kings, by the complements of killing a . sowe in the Forum, and using withall the sentence or preface that the Or Fciais. See Livie Lib. 1 Heraulds in old time pronounced: But both these affaires and others besides, the whole Empire also in a manner or a great part thereof he managed not so much after his owne minde, as by the direction and wil of his Wives and children: beeing verely affected and fra∣med for the most part so, as stood eyther with their profit or good plea∣sure. 26 When he was a very youth, he had espoused two maidens, namely AEMI∣LIA LEPIDA neice to AUGUSTUS once remooved, likewise LIVIA ME∣DULLINA, surnamed also CAMILLA, a Ladie descended srō the auntient house of Camillus the Dictatour. The former of these twaine, because her parents had offended AUGUSTUS he cast off remaining as yet a Virgin: the latter, hee lost by occasion of sicknesse, upon that very day which was appointed for the mariage. After this, he wedded these wives, to wit, PLAUTIA O Vrglanil∣la. HERCU∣LANILLA, whose father had triumphed; and not long after, AELIA PAETI∣NA, whose father had beene Consul. Both these he divorsed. PAETINA up∣on light offenses and small displeasures: mary, HERCULANILLA he put away for her filthy lust and whorish life; as also for suspicion of a murder. After these he tooke to wife VALERIA MESSALLINA, the daughter of BAREA∣TUSA, V, C, 801  MESSALLA his cousin german: whom when hee found once, over and beside the rest of her abominable vices & dishonesties, to have been Whies she was Empresse & wife to Cladius. wedded to C. SILIUS, and that with a dourie assured unto her and signed among the The hand∣fsters or ma∣kers of the mariage. Auspices, he put to death. And in a speech that he made openly before his Pretorian Souldiours, avowed that because his mariages proved so bad, he resolued to remaine unmarried and live a single life: and if he did not continue so for ever, hee would not refuse to be stabbed by their very hands. Neither could he endure, but forthwith treat upon conditions of mariage even with PAETINA, whom long before hee had put away: yea and with LOLLIA PAVLINA wife some time to C. CAESAR. But through the enticing allurements of AGRIPPINA, the* His owne cipce daughter of GERMANICUS his owne brother what by the meanes of kissing courtesies, what by the opportunities of other daliances, being drawen into love and fancie with her, at the next Session of Senate he subborned cer∣taine of purpose to opine and give aduise, To compell him for to make her his Wife; as being a matter of right great consequence, and which most of all concerned the State: That other men also might be dispensed with and licenced to contract the like With their brothers or si∣sters daughters maria∣ges which until that time were reputed incestuous. And so, himselfe staied hardly one day between, before hee dispatched the wedding: but none were found that followed the precedent, except one libertine & another who had been a principal Centurion in the formost Cohort, at whose mariage even himself in person together with AGRIPPINA was present to do him credite and honor. 27 Children he begat of 3. wives. By HERCVLANILLA he had DRUSUS and CLAUDIA: By PAETINA he was father of ANTONIA: and MESSALLINA bare unto him OCTAVIA and a son, whom first he named GERMANICUS and afterwards BRITANNICUS. As for DRUSUS, he lost him at Pompeijs im∣pubere amisit. Pompeij, before he was 14. yeares of age by occasion that he was choaked with a peare
which in play and pastime beeing tossed aloft into the aire, fell iust into his mouth as he gaped wide for it: unto whom also but few daies before, hee had affianced in mariage the daughter of SEIANUS: which maketh mee more to mervaile that some have written, hee was treacherously killed by SEIANUS, His (supposed) daughter CLAUDIA, who in deede was conceived by his freed man BOTER, although shee was borne before the fifth moneth after the di∣uorse,A▪ V▪ C: 773 and began to be nourced and reared, yet hee commaunded to be laid at her mothers dore and starke naked to be cast forth.

Of his sonnes in Law who mat∣chedA: V▪ C: 103 with his daughters, he adopted NERO: POMPEIUS and SILANUS he not onely cast off and reiected but murdred also. 28 Of all his freed men hee esteemed especially POSIDES the Or gelded man: Eunuch, unto whom also in his triumph over Britaine, among martiall men and valiant Soul∣diours, he gave a speare Hsta pura d navit▪ For his great valour forsooth: without an yron head: and no lesse account made he of Of this Faeli mention is made in the Acts of the A∣postles: FAELIX: whom first he ordained Capitaine over the Cohorts & Cornets of Horsemen, yea and ruler of the Province Iurie; the husband (a) of three Queenes. As also of HARPOCRAS, unto whom hee graunted a priviledge to be caried in a Litter through the Citie of Rome, and to set out (b) Games and Plaies in publick: And besides these, hee affected with much respect POLY∣IUS the guide and directour to him in his Studies, who oftentimes would walke cheeke by iole betweene the two Consuls. But above all these, he held in greatest esteeme, NARCISSUS his Secretarie or enditer of Epistles, and PALLAS the Keeper of his bookes of accounts▪ whom by vertue of a Decree also which went from the Senate, he suffred willingly to be not onely rewarded with rich Fees, but also to be adorned with the Honours of Questure and Pre∣tureship: likewise to get, to pill and poll by hooke and crooke so much, as that when himselfe complained upon a time how little treasure hee had in his Cof∣fers, one made answere unto him not absurdly, That hee might have store enough and plenty, in case his two Narcissus and Palias. freed men would admit him to share with them. 29 To these (freed men) and to his wives as I said before, being wholly addic∣ted and enthralled, hee bare himselfe not as an absolute Prince, but as their (a) Minister and Servitour. According as it was behoovefull and commo∣dious to any of these, or stoode with their affection and pleasure, hee graun∣ted honourable dignities, conferred the conducts of Armies, and awarded impunities and punishments: yea, and for the most part, I assure you when himselfe was altogether ignorant and wist not what hee did. And not to
reckon up particularly, every small thing, to wit, his liberalities and gifts revo∣ked, his iudgements reversed, his Patents & Writings concerning the graunts of Offices either foisted in or plainly altered and chaunged by them: hee slew his brother (a) APPIUS SILANUS: the ij IULIE, the one daughter of Consocerum: so called for that their chil∣dren maried to gether: & such with us, name one another brethren DRU∣SUS, and the other of The sonne of Tiberius. GERMANICUS upon bare imputation of a crime, with∣out any ground: not allowing them so much as lawfull triall and libertie to plead in their owne defence: likewise CN. POMPEIUS, husband to his elder daughter, and LUCIUS SILANUS espoused to the other, (and all through their suggestions and informations). Of which, POMPEIUS was stabbed even* who is called also Livilla. A, V, C 802. as he lay in bed with a beloved youth and Catamite of his: SILANUS was for∣ced to resigne up his Pretureship foure daies before the Kalends of Ianuarie, and to Tacitus wri∣teth, that hee killed himselfe upon that day. loose his life in the beginning of the yeere on the very wedding day of CLAUDIUS and AGRIPPINA. To the execution of 35 Senatours, and above an hundred Romaine Gentlemen so easily was hee induced, as that, when the Centurion brought word backe, as touching the death of one who had beene Consull, saying, That the deede was done which he had commaunded, he flatly deni∣ed, that he gave any such warrant. Neverthelesse the thing he allowed: whiles his freed men afore-said standing by, avouched, That the Souldiours had done their devoir, in that they ran willingly of their owne heads to revenge their Emperour. For, it would be thought incredible if I should relate, How even for the very mariage of MESSALLINA with the Adulterer SILIUS: his own self sealed the Writings for assurance of the Dowrie, being perswaded and brought there∣unto, as though the said wedding was but colourably, of purpose pretended to avert forsooth and translate the danger, that by certaine prodigies were por∣tended to hang over his owne head. 30 Right personable hee was, and caried a presence not without authorite and maiestie, whether he stoode or sate; but especially when he was laid and tooke his repose. For, of stature hee was tall, and nathlesse his body not lanke and slender. His countenance lively, his gray haires beautifull, which became him well, with a good fat and round neck under them. Howbeit, both as he went his hams being feeble failed him: and also whiles he was doing ought, were it re missely or in earnest, many thinges disgraced him: to wit, undecent laughter and unseemely anger, by reason, that hee would froth and slaver at the mouth, and had evermore his nose dropping: Besides, his tongue stutted and stamme∣red: his head likewise at all times, but especially if he did any thing were it ne∣ver so little used to shake and tremble very much. 31 Concerning his bodily health, as before time he used to be grievously sick, so being once Emperour exceeding healthfull he was and stoode cleere of all diseases save onely the paine of the (a) stomack▪ in a fit whereof hee saide, hee thought to have killed himselfe. 32 Hee made feasts, and those very great and ordinarily; yea, and in most open and large places, such as for the most part would receive sixe hundred guests at one sitting. Hee feasted also even upon the Sluce of the Lake Fucinus: what time hee had like to have beene drowned, when as the water let out with a forcible violence reflowed backe againe. At everie supper
his manner was to have also his owne children, who together with other no∣ble mens children as well boyes as girles, should after the olde manner sit and feede at the tables Or at a Settle at the tables end: feete. One of his guests, who was thought to have close∣lie stollen away a cup of gold the day before, he reinvited against the morrow: and then he let before him a stone Or earthen pot. pot to drinke in. It is reported moreover, that he meant to set forth an Edict, wherein he would give folke leave to breake winde downward and let it goe (a) even with a crack at the very bourd; having certaine intelligence, that there was one who for manners and modestie sake, by holding it in, endaungered his owne life. 33 For appetite to meate and drinke his stomacke served him passing well al∣waies, and in every place. Sitting upon a time iudicially in AUGUSTUS Hall of Iustice, to heare and determine causes, and senting there the steime of a din∣ner, that was a dressing and serving up for the Priests (a) Salij in the temple of Revenger, Si∣tuate neere to the Hall: for distinction of another Tem∣ple, bearing that name, in the Capitoll mount. Mars next adioyning, he forsooke the Tribunall, went up to the said Priests, and there sate downe with them to meate. Lightly you should never have him goe out of any dining roome. but with his belly strutting out, well whitled al∣so and drenched with wine: so, as straightwaies, whiles hee layd him downe along upon his backe and tooke a sleepe gaping, there was a feather put ordi∣narily into his mouth wide open for to discharge his stomack. Hee tooke very short sleepes: for commonly before midnight hee awaked: yet so, as other∣whiles he would catch a nap in the day time, as he sat to minister iustice: and scarcely could bee awakened by the Advocates at the barre, who of purpose raised their voices and pleaded the lowder. Hee was excessively given to the wanton love of women. As for the preposterous abuse of malekind, he was al∣together unacquainted therewith. Hee plaied at dice most earnestly (concer∣ning the Art and skill whereof, he published also a little booke) being wont to plie that game even whiles hee was caried up and downe, having his Carroch and Dice-bourd so fitted, as there might be no confusion nor shuffling at all in play. That cruell he was and given to bloudshed naturally, appeared in great and34 very small matters. As for tortures used in examinations, and the punishments that (a) PARICIDES suffred, hee exhibited and exacted the same to be done without delay, and openly in his owne presence. Being desirous upon a time to be hold an execution performed after the auncient manner at Tibur, when as, (the malefactours standing bound already to a stake), there wanted the but∣cherly executioner to doe the feat; he staied there still in the place, and waited untill evening, for one that was sent for out of Rome. At all Sword fights, whe∣ther they were set forth by himselfe, or by others, he commaunded as many of the Champions as chaunced onely but to stumble and fall therewith, to have their throats cut: especially the Fencers called The adverse faction to the  whom he favo∣red Retiarij; and why! because forsooth hee would see their faces as they lay gasping and yeelding up their breath. It fortuned, that a couple of these fighting at sharpe wounded and il∣led one another: Thereupon hee commaunded little knives to bee mad of both their blades, for his owne proper use. Hee tooke such pleasure in those that Which com∣bats were usu∣ally in the morning: fought (b) with wild beasts, as also in the sword fights ordinarily a∣bout noone, that he would by breake of day go downe to the Theater for to be∣hold
the one: and at noone disinisse the people to their dinners, and sit it out himselfe to see the other: yea, and besides those that were appointed to such combats, upon any slight and suddaine occasion set some to fight for their lives, even out of the number of Carpentars, Servitours, & such like emploied about these games: if happily any of those artificiall (c) motions that goe by vices, or a pageant Or Pegme in frame, or some such fabrick proved not well. Hee fetcht in also one of his owne Prompters of names. Nomenclatours even in his gowne as he went With wilde beasts or o∣therwise. to fight for his life. 35 But it passed, how timorous and diffident hee was. At his first comming to the Empire; (how ever as we said before, he bragged and stoode upon his ci∣vill and familiar behaviour) he durst not for certaine daies goe to any feast, din∣ner or supper, without Pensionars standing about him with their speares and Iavelins, and his Souldiours waiting at the table: neither visited hee any sicke person, unlesse the bed-chamber where the party lay, were first searched; the beds, bolsters, pillowes, Coverlets and other cloathes were groped, felt, and throughly shaken before hand. All the time after, hee appointed evermore certaine searchers for them all, that came to salute him, sparing not one; and such searchers as were most cruell. For, long it was first, and that with much a∣doe, ere hee graunted that women, young boyes in their embroidred coates, and maidens, should not bee handled and felt in this manner: that any mans Attendants likewise or Clerks might not have their Pensheathes and Penknife∣cases (a) taken from them. In a civile commotion, when CAMILLUS, (ma∣king no doubt but that without any warre at all hee might be terrified) willed him in a contumelious, menacing, and malapert letter, to resigne up the Em∣pire, and to leade a quiet life in private estate, hee called his Nobles and chiefe personages about him, to counsell, and put to question, whether it were best to hearken unto him or no? 36 At the headlesse report and flying newes of some treason that should bee practised against him, he was so affrighted, that hee went about to lay downe his Imperiall dignity. By occasion, that one (as I related before) was taken with a weapon upon him, about his person as hee sacrificed, in all hast he sent out the Bedels and called the Senate together; before whom, with teares and loude out-cries hee bewailed his owne piteous case, as who no where could make account of any safety: and thereupon for a long time forbare to come abroad. His affectionate love also to MESSALLINA, most servant though it were he renounced and cast cleane from her, not so much for any indignity of the dishonourable wrongs she offred unto him, as upon very feare of daunger; as fully perswaded that shee practised to bring the Empire into SILIUS the A∣dulterers hands. At which time in a great fright he fled in shamefull manner to the camp, asking and enquiring all the way nothing else, but whether the Em∣pire remained still safe to his behoofe? 37 There arose no suspition, there came forth no Author so light and vaine, but gave him a bone to gnaw upon, and put no small toyes in his head: wher∣by he was forced to beware and seeke revenge. One of those, that had a matter depending in Court before him, taking him a side, when hee came by way of
salutation to doe his duty, avowed unto him, that he dreamed, How hee was killed by one. Then within a while after, the same party, (as if he had now ta∣ken knowledge who that one was that should murder him) pointed unto his owne adversarie, even as hee tendered a supplication unto CLAUDIUS; and said, This is he. Whereupon immediatly apprehended he was, and haled to execution. After the semblable manner by report, came APPIUS SILANUS to his death. For, when MESSALLINA and NARCISSUS had conspired to worke his overthrow and finall destruction, they complotted thus, that NAR∣CISSUS betimes in a morning before day light rushed like a man amazed and astonied into the bedchamber of his Patrone (CLAUDIUS) relating unto him his dreame, namely that APPIUS had laid violent hands upon him: and MES∣SALLINA for her part, composing and framing her selfe as if shee wondered greatly thereat, reported, How shee likewise had seene already the same vision for certaine nights together. And not long after this, word came, (as it was before agreed betweene them) that APPIUS was comming to rush in among them:* Narcissas. who in deed had beene bidden the day before to be present at the same instant. Whereupon, as if the said dreame had now proved true and beene plainly re∣presented in effect, order was given for APPIUS, to be endited, arraigned, and to suffer death. Neither doubted CLAUDIUS the morrow after to report the whole storie and the order thereof unto the Senate: and withall to give thanks unto his  atque Iracundi. The mannes is of this Au∣thor through∣out his story o set those points downe first in a word, whereon he meaneth to stand, & then in order to parti∣cularize ∣ly upon thē. By which method of his, it ∣reth in this place, that hee meaneth by Ira, the mom∣tanie passion of anger, which we call heat & choler, soone up & as soone downe, quickly kindled and as quickly quēcht: by Iracundia, the habite of  wrath contiuing still untill revege be had: which we call malice and rancour. How soever our moderne Lexi∣ographers have in their Dicti∣onaries put downe the cō∣trary. freed man, for being so vigilant and watchfull in his very sleepe for his sake. 38 Being privie to himselfe of passionate (a) anger & bearing malice, he ex∣cused them both in an Edict, distinctly promising that the one of them verily should be but short and harmlesse, the other not uniust nor causelesse. Having sharply rebuked the men of Ostia, because they had not sent boats & barges to meet him as he came upon the river Tiberis: and that in such odious termes as these, That he was now become base and abiect in their eies: all on a suddaine, he par doned thē upon their submission & readinesse to make satisfaction. Some there were, whom in the very open street he thrust from him with his own hand, cō∣ming unto him somewhat out of season. Semblably he confined and banished the Court a Scribe who had been Questour: a Senatour likewise that had born the Pretureship both of them without their cause heard and altogether guilt∣lesse: for that the The Scribe one pleading in Court as an Advocate against him when he was a private person, had caried himselfe not so modestly as he should: & the Senatour in his Aedileship had amerced & fined certaine tenants of his dwelling upō his lands, for selling boiled meats contrary to the law expresly forbidding so to do: and withall whipped his Bailife comming To intercede for them. betweene (to intercede for them). For which cause also, he tooke from the Aediles their authority to punish the disorder of those that kept Tavernes and victualing houses. But as touching his owne foolishnes, he concealed it not, but gave it out & protested in certaine short orations, That he counterfaited himselfe a foole for the nonce during CAIUS daies: because otherwise he should not have escaped, nor attai∣ned to that (imperiall) place which hee aimed at and was now entred upon. Howbeit, he could not make the world beleeve so much, untill there was a book put forth within a short time after, entituled , . The resurrection (or Exatation) of fooles. The argument and matter whereof was, (b) That no man
. Among otherthinges, men wondered at him for his oblivion and unadui∣sednesse,39 or (that I may expresse the same in Greeke) his , . i. his grosse over-sight or forgetfulnes, and inconsiderate blindnes. When MESSALLINA was (by his owne commaundement) killed, within a while, af∣ter he was set in his dining parlour hee asked why hisOr Mistres of the house, Do∣mina, Grace, . Lady came not? Many of those whom he had condemned to death, the very morrow immediatly af∣ter, he commaunded to have warning both to sit in counsell with him, and also to beare him company at Dice-play: yea, and by a messenger chid & checked them as drowsie and slothfull for staying so long and making no better hast. Being minded to take AGRIPPINA to wife against all law of God and man, he ceased not in all his speech to call her, HisAnd in deede he was her Vnkle. daughter and nourceling: to give out also, That she was borne and brought up in his bosome. Having a purpose to ad∣mit NERO into the very name of his owne house & family, as if he had not in∣curred blame enough already for adopting (him) his wives son, having a natu∣rallBritaicus: sonne of his owne who was now of ripe yeeres, hee eft-soones divulged, That never any one had beene by adoption inserted or incorporate into the family of the CLAUDII. He shewed oftentimes so great negligence & carelesnes what he said or did,40 that he was thought not to know nor consider, either who made any speech, or among whom, or at what time, and in what place? When there was some que∣stion and debate about Butchers & Vintnars, he cried out in the Senate house, Ibeseech Rogo'vos, o I demaund of you: you, my Maisters who is able to live without a little piece or morsell of flesh? and withall described theOr excessive number: abundance of the olde Tavernes (a), from whence himselfe also in times past was wont to bee served with wine. As touching a certaine Questour, who was a Candidate of his and by him recommended: a∣mong other reasons why he favoured him, he alleadged this, Because his Father, quoth he, had quickly and in due time given him lying sick, cold water to drinke. Ha∣ving in the Senate brought in a woman to depose, This, quoth he, was my mothers freed woman, and she that kept her ornaments, and used to dek and dresse her: But she alwaies tooke me for her Patrone. This have I, quoth he, delivered of purpose, because there be some yet in mine house, who think me not to be her Patron. Moreover, sitting upon the Tribunall, when he was in a great chafe, & the men of Ostia requested at his hands (I wot not what) in the name of their towne; he cried out aloud, That he knew nothing wherefore he should oblige thē unto him: And if any man else, quoth he, I also am free and at mine owne liberty. As for these words of his which now I will relate, they were rife in his mouth daily, yea every houre & minute therof. What doest thou take (b) me for THEOGONIUS and ? beside many such foolish termes, not beseeming private persons, much lesse a Prince, otherwise not uneloquent nor unlearned: nay, rather one eagerly given to his booke, and a great Student in the liberall Sciences. In his youth, he attempted to write an Historie, exhorted thereto by TITUS41 LIVIUS; and having the help besides of SULPITIUS FLAVUS. And when he put the same first to the triall & iudgement of men in a frequent auditorie, hard∣lie & with much a▪do he read it through, being often in the while coldly heard, by an occasion that himselfe gave. For, when, (as hee began his reading) there was set up a laughter, by reason that many of the seates brake with the weight
of a certeine corpulent and fatswad, he was not able to hold, no not after the umult appeased, but eftsoones ever and anon call to minde that accident and fall afresh to unmeasurable laughing. During his Empire likewise, hee both wrote much and also rehearsed the same continually by his reader. The begin∣ning of his foresayd historie he tooke from the time presently ensuing the mur∣der of CAESARDICTATOR: but hee passed over to the latter dayes: and began againe at the civill pacification: perceiving that it was not left in his power and libertie to write of the occurrents in those former times, as who was often checked both by his Antonia the Triumvirs daughter. mother and also by his Octavia the wife of Antonia of Livia  sta her seife. grandame. Of the former argument he left behinde him two volumes, of the later, fortie-one. Hee compiled of his owne life eight bookes: a report not so wisely and dis∣creetly put downe, as otherwise elegantly penned: Item, an Apologie or de∣fense of CICERO against the bookes of ASINIUS GALLUS: a peece of worke full enough of learning. He devised moreover three (a) new characters or letters in the (Latine) Alphabet, and put them to the number of the olde as most necessarie. And having published whiles he was yet a private person, concerning the reason of those letters, one booke: soone after beeing Empe∣ror he easily effected that they should be brought into use also indifferētly with the rest. And verely such manner of writing with those characters is now ex∣tant to be seene in many bookes of records in Iournels, and titles or inscripti∣ons of works. 42 With no lesse diligence studied hee the Greeke disciplines, professing as any occasion was offered, his affectionate love to that tongue, and the excellency thereof. When a certaine Barbarian discoursed in Greeke and La∣tine, see you be skilfull, quoth he, in both our languages; And in recommen∣ding ACHAIA unto the LL. of the Senate, he sayde it was a province that he affected well and delighted in, for the commerce and society of studies com∣mon to him and them: and many a time he answered their embassadors in the Senate, with a long and continued oration (in Greeke). But upon the Tribu∣nall he used very much verses also out of HOMER. CERTES whensoever he had taken revenge of enemie or traytor, he lightly gave unto the Tribune over the Sentinels and guard of his person, calling unto him after the usuall manner for a watchword, none other but this Resist, revenge with maine and might. When one provokes thee first to fight. To conclude, in the end he wrote Greeke histories also, to wit twentie books entituled Of  affaires. Tyrrhenicoon, and 8. entituled Of Cartha∣ginian matter Called Claudi∣. Carchedoniacoon. In regard of which histories, unto the auntient schoole at Alexandria he adjoyned another bea∣ring his owne * name: and ordained it was, that every yeare in the on of them his books Tyrrhenicoon; and in the other his Carchedoniacoon upon certaine daies appointed therefore should (as it were in a frequent Auditorie) be read whole and through by severall single readers in their turnes. 43 Toward the end of his life, hee shewed certaine signes and those evident enough, that he repented both his mariage with AGRIPPINA, and the
adoption also of NERO. For by occasion that his freed-men made mention and gave their commendation of a judiciall proceeding of his, wherein he had condemned the day before, a Woman in the case of adulterie, hee avouched That the destinies likewise had so ordained, that all his Matrimoni. or Wives like as Cogia pre coningibus. mariages should bee unchaste how beit not unpunished: And soone after, meeting his sonne BRITANNI∣CUS and embracing him harder and more closely than his manner was, growe a∣pace quoth hee, and take accompt of me for all that I haue done. Vsing withall these Greeke words, , Or rather, Ho TROSAS, KAI IASETAI, i. He that woun∣ded will also heale. I that have done thee wróg wil make amends. i. Love enforced me. And when he had fully purposed to give him being as then very young & of tender yeeres his (a) Virile Robe, seeing that his stature and growth would beare and permit it, he uttered these words moreover, To the end that the people of Rome may yet at last, have a true and Naturall CAESAR. 44 And not long after this he wrote his wil and signed it with the seales of al the (a) head-magistrates: whereupon before that he could proceed anie further, prevented hee was and cut short by AGRIPPINA. Whom they also who were Conscij: Some read Conscien∣tia quoque even his owne con∣science. privie to her and of her councell, yet neverthelesse enformers, accu∣sed besides all this of many crimes. And verely it is agreed upon generally by all, that killed he was by poyson: but (a) where it should be, and who gave it, there is some difference. Some write, that as he sat at a feast in the (Capitoll) Castle with the priests, it was presented unto him by HALOTUS the Eu∣nuch his taster: others report that it was at a meale in his owne house by A∣GRIPPINA herselfe, who had offered unto him a mushrome empoisoned; knowing that he was most greedy of such meats. Of those accidēts also which ensued hereupon, the report is variable. Some say, that streight upon the re∣ceipt of the poyson he became speechlesse, & continuing all night in dolorous torments, dyed a little before day. Others affirme, that at first he fell a sleepe: and afterwards, as the meate flowed and floted aloft vomited all vp, and so was followed againe with a ranke Toxico, poyson. But whether the same were put into a messe of thicke gruell, (considering hee was of necessitie to be refreshed with food beeing emptied in his stomacke) or conueied up by a clistre, as if being o∣overcharged with fulnesse and surfeit, he might be eased also by this kind of e∣gestion and purgation, it is uncertaine. 45 His death was kept secret until all things were set in order about his succe∣ssour. And therefore, both vowes were made for him as if hee had lyen sicke stil and also comicall Actours were brought in place colourably to solace and delight him, as having a longing desire after such sports. He deceased three dayes before the Ides of October, when ASINIUS MARCELLUS and ACILIUS AVIOLA were Consuls: in the 64th yeere of his age, and 14th of his Empire. His funerals were performed with a solemne pompe and proces∣sion of the Magistrates: and canonized he was a Saint in Heaven: Which ho∣nor forlet and abolished by NERO hee recouered afterwards by the meanes of VESPASIAN. 46 Especial tokens there were presaging & prognosticating his death: to wit the rising of an The 13th. of October. hairy starre which they call a Comet: Also the * monumen of his father DEUSUS was blasted with lightning: and for that in the same
yeere most of the (a) Magistrates of all sorts were dead. But himselfe seemeth not either to have beene ignorant that his end drew neere, or to have diffimu∣led so much: which may bee gathered by some good arguments and demon∣strations. For both in the ordination of Consuls hee appointed none of them to continue longer then the moneth wherein he dyed: and also in the Senate, the very last time that ever he sat there, after a long and earnest exhortation of his children to concord, he humbly recommended the age of them both to the LL. of that honourable house: and in his last Iudiciall Session upon the Tribu∣nal once or twice he pronounced openly, That come he was now to the end of his mortalitie: notwithstanding they that heard him, greived to heare such an Osse, and praied the gods to avert the same.
THE HISTORIE OF Nero Claudius Caesar, vvritten by Caius Suetonius Tranquillus. OVT of the Domitian stocke and name, there sprung two famous families, to wit, the Caluini and the Aenobarbi: These Aenobarbi have for the first Author of their originall,A, V, C, 536. and surname likewise, L. DOMITIUS: whome, as he retur∣ned Castor and Pollux resem∣bling two yong men. in times past homeward out of the countrey, two yong men twinnes, carying with them a venerable presence and countenance more then ordinary, encountred, by report, and commanded to relate unto the Senate and People of Rome, newes, of that victorie whereof as yet they stood in doubt: and for the better assurance of their divine maiestie stroke his cheekes so, as that therewith they made the

Neither were they knowen by any other forenames than CNEUS & LUCIUS: & the same in variety worth the noting and obser∣uation: onewhile continuing either of the saydnames in three persons toge∣ther: otherwhiles changing alternatively one after another in every descent. For, we have heard say, that the first, second and third of these Aenebarbi were forenamed LUCII: and againe, the three next following them in order were CNEI. All the rest no otherwise then by turnes one after another had their forenames, first LUCII and then CNEI. That many persons of this house descended should be knowen, I suppose it very pertinent and materiall: whereby it may the better appeare, that NERO degenerated from the Ver∣tues of his Auncestors so, as yet he caried away & resembled the vices of them all, as infused into him and inbred by nature. 2* Atavus eius, his Grādfather 4, degrees of. To fetch the beginning therefore, of this or discourse somewhat farther of his great Grandfathers Grandfather CN. DOMITIUS, beeing in his Tribu∣nate much offended at the High Priests.

His sonne being Pre∣tourA, V, C. 700 was the man, who as Iul, Caesar Di∣ctator CAESAR went out of his Consulship (which he was thought to have borne against the Approbation of the gods Auspicia and the lawes) conuented him be∣fore the Senate to be by them examined, tried and censured. Afterwards when he was Consull he attempted to fetch him backe, Lord Generall as he was of an armie, from his forces in Gaule: and being by the aduerse The Pompei∣ans. faction nomina∣ted his successour in that province, was in the beginning of the civil warre ta∣ken prisoner before Corfininum: From whence being dismissed and set at liber∣tie, after he had by his comming to the Massiltans streightly beleagured, much strengthened them, sodainely he forsooke them: and in the end, at the battaile of, Pharsalia lost his life; A man not very constant and resolute, but with all of a fell and savage nature. Being driven to utter despaire, he was so much afraid of death, which for feare he had desired, that after a drawght of poyson hee repented the taking there of and cast it up againe; yea and enfranchised his Phisitian, who wittingly and of purpose had so tempered it that it might do him no great harme. And what time as CN. POMPEIUS put to question what should be done to those Neuters that stood indifferent and sticked to no part? He a∣lone opined, That they were to be reckoned enemies & proceeded against accordingly 3 Hee left behind him a sonne, worthy without question, to be preferred be∣fore

ANTONIUS before his owne side was every where quite overthrowen: which he then did of his owne accord; and so, as that ANTONIUS took himselfe highly beholden unto him therfore. He on∣ly also of all those who by vertue of the like law stood condemned, being resto∣red into his native countrey, went through the most honorable offices of state: Soone after likewise, when civil dissension was kindled againe and renewed, being in quality of Lieutenant to the said ANTONIE, what time the soveraigne Empire was offered unto him by those who were ashamed of The present state governed according to his wil and pleasure. CLEOPATRA, not daring to accept thereof nor yet to refuse it resolutely, by occasion of sodaine sicknesse wherewith he was surprised, went and sided with AUGUS∣TUS, and within few dayes after departed this life: being himselfe also noted with some infamie: For, ANTONIE gave it commonly forth, That for the loveA, V, C, 723. of one SERUILIA Nais whom he kept, he fled to AUGUSTUS side. 4 From him came that DOMITIUS, who soone after had the name abroade to have beene the Dicis causa. i. by an imagina∣rie bargaine of sale to have bought them to the behoofe & use of the heyre chapman of AUGUSTUS goods and substance left by his wil and testament: a man no lesse renowmed in his youth for good skill in ru∣ling of Chariots & running with them a race, as afterwards for the triumphant ornaments achieved by the Germaine warre; but arrogant of spirit, wastefull in expence, and therewith cruel. When he was Aedile he forced L. PLAN∣CUS that had beene Censorium, not Censorem. Censor, to give him the way. Bearing the honorable of∣fices of Preture and Consulate, hee produced upon the stage to acte a Comi∣call and wanton Enterlude, the gentlemen and dames of Rome. He exhibited baiting of wilde beastes both in the cirque and also in every quarter of the City, yea and a shew of sword-fight: but with so great cruelty, that AUGUSTUS was compelled of necessitie to restraine him by an edict, since that no secret war∣ning nor admonition at his hands would prevaile. 5 Of ANTONIA the elder, hee begat the father of NERO: an impe in all the parts of his life ungracious and detestable. For accompanying Sonne of M. Agrippa and Iulia, adopted by . CAIUS CAE∣SAR in his youth into the East-parts, where he killed a freed-man of his owne, becavse he refused to quaffe as much as he was commanded, being discharged therfore out of the cohort of his friends, he led his life never a whit more mode stly: but both within a village standing upon the street Appia, sodainely put his horses to gallop, and not unwittingly rode over a little child and trode him to death: and also at Rome in the midst of the Forum plucked a Romane gentle∣mans eye out of his head, for chiding him somewhat over boldly. So false and perfidious beside, that he defrauded not onely the bankers and money chan∣gers of the prices of such commodities as they had bought up, but also when he was Pretour put the runners with Chariots besides the prises of their victo∣ries. For which prankes, reproved he was merily even by his owne sister (LE∣PIDA) and upon complaint made by the Masters of the foure (a) factions hee
enacted, That from thence-forth ever after, the said prises should be presently payed. Being accused likewise for Morbo aqu inter cut is: that kind of dropy where in water runneth be∣tween the fell and the flesh all the bodie over,  legmtias in Greeke. treason to the State and many adulteries, as also for incest committed with his sister LEPIDA a little before the decrease of TI∣BERIUS, yet escaped he the danger of Law by the alteration of the times, and died at Pyrgae of (b) the * Dropsie, when AGRIPPINA daughter o GERMA∣NICUS had brought him a sonne named NERO. 6 This NERO was borne at Antium, nine moneths after that TIBERIUS de∣parted this world, eighteene daies before the Kalends of Ianuarie, iust as the Sunne was newly risen, so as his beames Or shone light well neere upon him before they could Dio say , hee was compassed with the funne beames: and yet no sunne appeared aboue the Horizon. touch the earth. As touching his Or . Horoscope, many men straight∣waies gave many guesses and coniectures of fearefull events. And even a very word that his father DOMITIUS spake, was taken to be a presaging osse. For when his friends by way of gratulation wished him ioy of his sonne new born: he said, That of himselfe and AGRIPPINA there could nothing come into the world but accursed, detestable and to the hurt of the weale publick. Of the same future in∣fortunity there appeared an evident signe upon his (a) naming day: For CAIUS CAESAR (CALIGULA) when his sister (AGRIPPINA) requested him to give the Infant what Forename. name he would, looking wistly upon CLAUDIUS his Vnkle, (by whom afterwards being Emperour (the child) was adopted), said he gave him his name. Neither spake hee this in earnest, but merily in boord: and A∣GRIPPINA scorned and reiected it, for that as then, CLAUDIUS went for a foole, and one of the laughing stocks of the Court. At three yeeres of age he became fatherlesse: and being his fathers heire but of one third part, yet could not he touch so much as that, full and whole, by reason of CAIUS his coheire who had seized upon and caught up before-hand all the goods▪ and for that his mother also was soone after confined and packt away, he being in manner de∣stitute of all helpe and very needy, was fostered in his Aunt LEPIDAES hous under two Paedagogues, a dauncer and a Barber. But when CLAUDIUS was come once to the Empire, hee not onely recovered his Fathers goods patrimonie, but also was enriched by the inheritance of CRISPUS PASSIENUS his mothers hus∣band, that fell unto him. And verily through the grace and power of his mo∣ther now called home againe and restored to her estate, hee flourisned & grew so great, that commonly it was bruted abroad, That MESSALLINA the wife of CLAUDIUS sent some of purpose to take the opportunity of his noones sleep and so to* Her Sonne smuddre and strangle him, as the onely Concurrent of BRITANNICUS, and one that eclipsed the light of his glorie. Now in the tale it went, besides▪ that the said parties tooke a fright at a Dragon issuing out of his pillow, whereupon they fled backe and forsooke the enterprise. Which fable arose upon this, That there was in deede found the Or skinne slough of a serpent in his bed about the bosters. And yet, this slough he enclosed within a bracelet of gold (as his mother wil∣led him) and wore it a good while after, upon his right arme: and at length, wearie of any memoriall and monument of his mothers flung it away: but in his extreamity and despaire of his estate sought for the same againe, in vaine. 7 In his tender yeeres, and whiles hee was yet a boy of no full growth, hee
acted at the Circeian Games the warlike Troy fight most resolutely, with great favour and applause of the people. In the Vndecmo: some reade rather tertio et decimo, in the thirteenth: eleventh yeere of his age adopted he was by CLAUDIUS & put to schoole unto ANNAEUS SENECA, even then a Senatour, for to be trained up in good literature. The report goes, that SE∣NECA, the next night following, dreamed as hee lay in bed, That hee was tea∣ching Caligula. C. CAESAR: and shortly after NERO proved his dreame true, be∣wraying the fell stomacke and shrewd nature of the said Prince, by the first ex∣periments that he could give thereof. For when his brother BRITANNICUS saluted him after he was once adopted, (as his wonted manner was before) by the name of AENOBARBUS, hee went about to lay this imputation upon him before his Father, that he was some Changeling and no sonne of his as he was reputed. His Aunt LEPIDA likewise being in trouble, hee deposed against, in the open face of the Court, thereby to gratifie his mother her heavie friend, and who followed the suite hotly against her. Being honourably brought into the Or Hall of Iustice Forum, the day of his first plea and Commencement, hee promised pub∣liquely for the people a Congiarie, and Donative for the Souldiours. Having proclaimed also a solemne Or running at tilt. Iusting, himselfe rode before the Pretorian Soul∣diours bearing a shield in his owne hand. After this, hee solemnly gave thanks to his Father in the Senate. Before whom being then Consull, hee made a La∣tine Oration in the behalfe of the Bononians, and for the Rhodians and Inhabi∣tants of Ilium, another in Greeke. His first Iurisdiction hee began as (a) Pro∣vost of the Citie, during the celebration of the Latine holidaies: What time the most famous Advocates and Patrones in those daies strove a vie, who could bring before him most Or declarati∣ons. accusations and Drawne in large bookes: longest; not (as the manner was) such as were ordinarie and briefe: the expresse commaundement of CLAU∣DIUS forbidding the same, notwithstanding. Not long after, hee tooke to wife OCTAVIA: and for the good health of CLAUDIUS, exhibited the Cirque Games and baiting of wild beasts. 8 Being seventeene yeeres olde, so soone as it was knowne abroad that CLAU∣DIUSA. V, C▪ 07 was dead, hee came forth to those (of the Pretorian Cohort) that kept watch and ward, betweene the sixth & the seventh Betweene noone and one of the clock. houre of the day: For by reason that the whole day beside was ominous and dismall, there was no time thereof thought more auspicate and convenient than it, to enter upon the Em∣pire: and so before the Pallace staires being proclaimed and saluted Emperour, he was in a Licter brought to the Pretorian. Camp: and hastily from thence, after a short speech made unto the Souldiours, conveied into the Curia. From whence he departed home in the evening▪ and of those exceeding and infinite honours which were heaped upon him, hee refused onely the Title in his stile of Pater Father of his Countrey. Patriae, in regard of his young yeeres. Beginning then with a glorious shew of Piety and Kindnes, at the Funerals9 of The Empe∣rour▪ CLAUDIUS, which were most sumptuously performed, he praised him in an Oration and consecrated him a God. In the memoriall of his owne Father DOMITIUS, he did him right great honour. His mother he permitted to have the whole regiment of all matters as well publick as private. The very first day also of his Empire, when the Tribune of the Or corps de guard. Sentinels, asked of him a watch∣word, he gave unto him this Mot, Optima mater (my best mother) and afterwards
many a time she accompanied him through the Streetes, in his owne Licter. He planted a Colonie at Antium, enrolling therein the old Souldiours out of the Praetorian cohort, & ioyning with them (by translating their habitations) the richest Centurions who had beene Leaders of the formost bands: where also he made a Or haven▪ Pere, or most sumptuous peece of worke. 10 And to shew a surer proofe still of his towardnesse, after profession made to governe the Empire according to the prescript rule of AUGUSTUS, he omit∣ted no occasion to shew either bountifulnesse or clemencie, no nor so much as to testifie his gentlenesse and courtesie. Those tributes and taxes which were any thing heavie he either abolished quite or abated. The rewards due unto Informers as touching the Law Papia, hee reduced to the fourth part onely of the penalty. Having dealt among the people Poppaea. 400 Sesterces for every poll: to as many Senatours as were most nobly descended (howbeit decaied and weak∣ned in their estates) he allowed yeerely 3 l.  S▪ 6 d. starling, a Romaine pound. Salaries, & to some of them Annuities 500000 Sesterces. Likewise for the Pretorian Cohorts hee ordained an allowance of Corne monethly More by a fourth part, thā the State or worth of a Gentleman of Rome. gratis. And whensoever he was put in minde to subscribe & set his hand to a warrant (as the maner is) for the execution of any person con∣demned to die, hee would say, Oh, that I knew not one letter of the booke. Manie times he saluted all the Degrees of the Citie one after another, by rote & with∣out* Without pay∣ing mony. booke. When the Senate upon a time gave him thanks, hee aunswered, (Doe so) when I shall deserve. To his exercises in Mars field he admitted the Cō∣mons also, yea and declaimed often publiquely before them. He rehearsed his owne verses likewise, not onely within house at home, but also in the Theater: and that with so general a ioy of as many as heard him; that for the said rehear∣sall, there was a solemne procession decreed: and some of his said verses writ∣ten in golden letters were dedicated to IUPITER CAPITOLINUS. 11 Many and sundry kindes of shewes he set forth: to wit, the Iuvenall (a) sports, the Circeian Games, and the Stage-playes: also a Sword fight. In the Iuvenall pastimes, he admitted old men even those of Consuls degree: aged women al∣so and matrones to disport themselves. At the Circenses, he appointed places for the Gentlemen of Rome a part by themselves▪ where hee put also to runne a race for the prise chariots drawne with foure Camels. In the Stage plaies, (which beeing instituted for the eternizing and perpetuitie of his Empire hee would have to be called Maximi), very many of both Gentlemen and Senatours▪ degrees and sexes plaied their parts upon the Stage. A Romaine Gentleman of very good note & espe∣ciall marke, mounted upon an Elephant ranne downe a Per Catadr mum, for there were Elephanti , vide Galb ca. 6▪ ct Xiphilinum. rope.

These Games hee beheld from the top of the The fore stage. Proscenium. At the Sword∣fight12 which hee exhibited in the Amphitheatre built of Timber in one yeeres space within the ward of Mars field hee suffred not one man to be killed, no not so much as a guilty malefactour. Moreover, hee brought into the Lists for to fight at sharpe even Quadringenoi, rather quadra∣genoi. i. 40 S∣cenios{que}, rather Segenos. i: 60 according to  Lipsis. 400 Senatours and Or great fishes. 600 Gentlemen of Rome. Some of good wealth and reputation, out of the same degrees, he caused to come forthA. V, C, 10 into the Shew-place, for to kill wild beasts, and performe sundry services ther∣to belonging. He represented also a Naval fight upon salt water from the Sea, with a devise to have sea Warlike. beasts swimming therein. Semblably, certaine Pyr∣rhick daunces in armour, sorted out of the number of young Springals: And after their devoir done, he gave freely unto every one of them patents & graunts to be enfranchized Citizens of Rome.

Betweene the arguments of these Pyr∣rhick daunces, devised it was, that a Bull should leape (a) Pasiphae hidden within a frame of wood To the like∣nesse of that which was de∣vised by Daeda∣lus. resembling an Heiffer, which was acted so lively, that many of the beholders beleeved verily it was so in deede. As for ICARUS, at the first attempt to flie, hee fell presently downe hard by Of Nero. his owne (b) Or pavilion. Bed-chamber so that he bespreint him with bloud. For very seldome had he used to sit as Pre∣sident at these Games: but his manner was, to behold them as he lay upon his Or a pallet▪ bed. First through little loope holes: but afterwards setting the whole galle∣rie open from whence he looked. Hee was the first moreover that instituted at Rome, according to the Greeke fashion, Quinquennall games of three kinds, toA▪ V, C, 813 wit, of Musick and Poetrie, of Gymnick maisteries and of Or Horse running. Horsemanship: which Games he called Neronia. After he had dedicated the Baines, & a place therein for (c) Gymnick exercises, he allowed the oyle that went thereto both for the Senate and also for the Gentlemen. He ordained Maisters and Warden of all this Solemnity, especiall persons of Consular degree, chosen by lot to sit as over-seers in the Where they were wont to fit as Presidēts at other games and playes. place of Pretours, and then came downe himselfe into the In Orchestram, Sentum{que} ali∣ter, p Orche∣stra ni scenam, by the Orche∣stra to the very stage. Orchestra and the Senatours quarter. And verily the victorious coronet for the Latine tongue, both in prose and verse, about which the best and most worshipfull persons had contended, when it was graunted unto him with their owne consents he received: and the harp presented unto him by the Iudges he adored, and commaunded that it should bee caried to the Statue of AUGU∣STUS. At the Gymnick Games which he exhibited in the Septa, during the so∣lemne preparation of the great Sacrifice (d) Buthysia, hee cut off the first beard that he had, which he bestowed within a golden box, adorned it with most pre∣tious pearles and then consecrated it in To Iupiter Capitolinus: the Capitol. To the shew of wrest∣lers and other Champions he called also the vestall (e) virgins, because at Olym∣pia the priestresses likewise of Ceres, are allowed to see the Games there. 13 I may by good reason, among other Shewes by him exhibited, reckon alsoA, V, C. 819 the entrance into Rome City, of TIRIDATES: whom being King of Arme∣nia hee had sollicited by large promises. Now, when hee meant to shew him unto the people upon a set day appointed by an Edict, and was driven to put it off, (the weather was so clowdy) he brought him forth before them to be seene Or Market place. upon the best and most opportune day that hee could finde; having bestowed about the temples situate in the Forum, cohorts of Souldiours armed, and sit∣ting himselfe upon his yvorie curule chaire of Estate before the Rostra in tri∣umphall

The middle twaine he continued without any inter∣mission: the rest he varied with a yeeres space betweene.A▪ V, C▪ 808 810 811 813 15 In his ordinarie Iurisdiction, he lightly gave no answer to the Proctours before the day following, & that was by writing. In extraordinary Commissi∣ons and trials this course he held, namely to decide every cause by it selfe one after another upon certaine daies of the Session; and to surcease quite the hud∣ling up and debatements of matters one in the neck of another: So often as he went aside to consult, he did deliberate and aske advise of nothing either in cō∣mon or openly: but reading secretly to himselfe the opinions written by every counsellour; what liked his owne selfe, that pronounced hee, as if many more thought well of the same. For a long time hee admitted not the sonnes of Li∣bertines into the Curia: and to those that were admitted by the Emperours his predecessours hee denied all honorable Offices. If there sued for Magistracies more then could speed, or were places void; to comfort their harts againe for delaying & making them to stay longer, he gave unto them the conduct of Le∣gions. He graunted for the most part all Consulships for sixe moneths terme. And if one of the two Consuls hapned to die Somewhat before. about the Kalends of Ianuarie, hee substituted none in his steede: as misliking altogether the old precedent of CANNIUS REBILUS, who was Consul but Or rather, one peece of a day: See Iulius Caesar cap. 76 one day.

was set out to sale. The Christians, a kinde of men given to a new, wicked and mischievous Superstition, were put to death with grievous torments. The sports of Chariotiers, wherein by an old and licentious custome they had been allowed to range up and downe, to beguile folke, to pilfer and steale in merri∣ment, were prohibited. The (b) factions of the Cuning Ac∣tours, playing all parts, and resembling all gestures. Pantomimi together with the Actours themselves were banished and sent away. 17 Against forgers of writings, then first came up this invention that no books or instruments should be signed unlesse they were boared and had a thred three times drawne through the holes.

Onely the realme of Pontus with the leave of POLEMON (a), as also the Kingdome of the Alpes, by the death of King COTTIUS hee reduced into the forme of a Pro∣vince. 19 Two voyages and no more he undertooke, the one to Alexandria, the other into Achaia. But his iourney to Alexandria hee gave over the very day of his setting forth▪ by occasion that he was disquieted at once, both with a religious scruple and also with some perill. For when hee had gone in procession about all the temples, & sitten downe within the Chappel of Vesta, as he was rising up, first the Iag▪ welt or fringes. hem or edge of his Gowne stuck to the seate: and after this, arose so darke a mist before his eyes, that uneth he could see & looke about him. In A∣chaia hee attempted to digge through (a) Isthmus, and in a frequent assembly made a speech unto the Pretorian Souldiours; exhorting them to begin the worke: and having given the signall by sound of trumpet, himselfe first brake up the ground with a ▪ li∣gane, the same that Della in Greeke with a doen bit. This by some Writers, was of gold. little spade: and when hee had cast up the earth, ca∣ried it forth upon his owne shoulders in a scuttle: Hee prepared also an ex∣pedition to the Caspian-gates: for which hee enrolled a newe Legion of Italian young Souldiours Senum pedū, some read seni millim :  of 6 thou∣sand footmen. sixe foote high. This Legion hee called the Phalanx or Squadron of ALEXANDER the Great: These particulars premised, partly deserving no blame, and in part worthy even of no meane praise, haue I collected together, that I might sever and distinguish them from his villanies
and wicked acts, whereof from hence forward I wil make report. 20 Among other arts & sciences, beeing in his childhood trained up in the skill also of musick: no sooner attained he to the Empire, but he sent for TERPNUS the harper, renowmed in those dayes for his cunning above all other. Sitting by him as he played & sung, day by day after supper until it was far in the night, himselfe likewise by little and little began to practise and exercise the same: yea and not to let passe anie meanes, that expert professours in that kind were wont to do, eyther for preseruing or the bettering and fortifying of their voices: e∣ven to weare before him upon his brest a thin plate or sheet of lead: to purge by clystre & vomit: to absteine from apples and fruite, with all such meates as were hurtfull to the voice: so long, untill his proceedings stil drawing him on, (a smal and Or hoarse. rusty voice though he had) he desired to come forth and shew him∣selfe upon the open stage, having among his familiar companions this greeke proverbe evermore in his mouth, (a) That hidden musicke was nought worth. The first time that he mounted the stage was at Naples, where he gave not over sin∣ging, (albeit the Theatre was shaken & ready to fall by a suddaine earthquake) before he had finished the song begun. In the same place he chaunted often & many dayes together. Moreover, after some short time betweene taken to re∣paire his voice (as one impatient of keeping within house) from the baines At Naples. there he passed directly to the Theatre: and having in the midst of the Orche∣stra before a frequent multitude of people feasted and banquetted, made pro∣mise in the Greeke tongue, that if he had stippled a little and wet his whistle, he would ring out some note more fully and with a stronger brest. Now, beeing much delighted with the i. Ditties.

And never the later he chose from all parts youths of Gentlemens degree, and not so few as 5000 of the lustiest and strongest young men out of the commons, who beeing sorted into Or crewes. factions should learne cer∣taine kinde of shouts and applauses, which they tearmed (c) Bombos (a) Imbri∣ces (e) and Testas: also that deft and trim boyes, such as had the Pinguissi co.

The cheiftaines & leaders of these had for their stipend Necsine  laevis or, cleane∣contrarie, a  anlo leves, i. wearing no wang at all. 400000. sesterces. 21 Esteeming so highly as he did of singing, he solemnized at Rome also againe the foresaid games called Neroneum before the day and A Knights living. time by order appoin∣ted. And when all the people called upon him for his (a) celestial voice, he made answere. That he verily would do them that pleasure (being so willing and desirous as* Every fifth yeares. they were to heare him): but it should be in his Hortyards. How beit, when the corps deguarde of the (Pretorian) Souldiers which at that time kept watch and ward seconded the praiers of the commmon people, willingly he promised to fulfill their minds out of hand in the very place; and without any farther delay caused his owne name to be written in the roll of other professed minstrels and fingers to the harpe. Thus having put his lot into the pitcher with the rest, hee entred the stage when his turne came: and withall the Capitaines of the Guard supporting his harpe after them the Or Colonels. tribunes militarie, and close unto them his
most inwarde friendes and Minions. Now when hee had taken up his stan∣ding, and ended his Proaeme, he gave publike notice and pronounced by the voice of CLUVIVS RUFUS, (no meaner man than of Consuls degree) that he would sing and act the storie of Wife of Am∣phon King of Thebes who priding her self in her faire i∣ssewe sonnes and as manie daughters durst compare with Latona, the mother of Apollo & Diana but she with her arrowes killed them al, & turned her into a stone. NIOBE: and so continued hee well neere unto the tenth Foure of the clocke after noone. houre of the day: which done he differred the Musicke Coro∣net due for the present victorie, together with the residue of that gaming unto the next yeare following; and all because he might have occasion oftener to chaunt. But bethinking himselfe that the time was long, hee ceased not to come ever and anon abroade to shew his skill in open place. Hee stucke not also in Of other ma∣gistrates, who in respect of the Prince are accounted private. private shewes and games to doe his devoire, even among common Actors and Stage players: and namely, when one of the Larcius, Lydus Xiphilin. Pretours made offer of a milian of Sesterces. Hee sung moreover, disguised, Tragaedies of the worthies and gods: of noble Ladies likewise in olde time and of goddesses, having their visards framed & made to the likenesse of his own face & of some woman whom hee loved. Among the rest he chanced the tale of CANACE (b) travailing in chila-birth: of (c) Orestes who killed his owne Mother: (d) of OEDIPUS that plucked out his owne eyes, and of HERCULES (e) enraged. In the acting of which Tragaedie, the report goes, that a Or Masques. novice placed to keepe & guard the entrie of the stage, seeing him dressed and bound with chaines (as the argument* Or young untrained soul diers. of the sayd Tragaedie required) ran in a good to helpe him. 22 Exceedingly given hee was of a boy to delight in horsemanship, and with the love of charioting mightily inflamed: and very much would he be talking (forbidden though he were) of the Circeian games. And one time as hee was making mone, and bewailing among his skoole-fellowes, the hard fortune of a chariot driver one of the greene-coate faction, Or sore woū∣ded & bruised wt the wheeles running over him. See, Pin, at, Hist, lib, 28 cap, 17 drawen and dragged by his steedes, being chidden therefore by his schoole-master, he had a lye ready, and said that he spake of Who was likewise, Rapta∣rus Bgis as Vir∣gl writeth. HECTOR. But, as about his first entrance to the Empire, his custome was daily to play upon a chess-bourd with ivory Or Chariots, to expresse those games Circeses horses drawing in chariots, so he used to resort also Secrss, or by way of rety∣ring and re∣creation. from his retiring place of pleasure, to all the Circeian games even the very least and meanest of them. First by stealth and priuily: afterwards in open sight; so as no man made doubt, but at such a day he would be sure alwaies there to be. Neither dissimuled he that hee was wil∣ling to augment the number of the prises. And therefore the shew of Chariot running was drawen out in length and helde untill late in the evening, by occasion of manie more courses than ordinarie: so as now the Masters of every faction deigned not to bring forth their Greges either agiatorum i. of chariot dri∣vers: or equ∣rum quadrigari∣oris, i. of steeds both to one effecte. crues and companies unlesse they might run the Which was their greater gaine. whole day through. Soone after himselfe also would needs make one and be seene oftentimes to play the Chariotier. And when he had tryed what hee could doe, and performed, as it were, his first Actes in (private) hortyardes among verie slaves and the base commons, he proceeded to shew himselfe in the greatest Cirque in all Mens eyes, appointing one of his freed∣men to put out a (white) towell for a signall, from the place where Magi∣strates are wont to doe it. But not content with this, that he had given good proofe of his progresse in these feats at ROME, hee goes, as I sayde before, into ACHAIA, moved especially upon this occasion. Those Cities and states where solemne gamings of musicke are usually held, had brought up a
custome to sende all the Coronets of harpe-players unto him. This he accep∣ted so kindly, that he not onely admitted at the very first to his presence the Em∣bassadors who brought the same, but also placed them among his familiar guestes at the table. And being requested by some of them to sing at supper time; and highly praised with excessive applause, he came out with this speech That Gracians were the onely skilfull Hearers, and the men alone worthie of his stu∣dies. Neither made he anie longer stay, but tooke his voyage: and no soo∣ner was hee passed over the sea to A towne in Corcyra. Cassiope, but presently he began to sing at the altar there, of IVPITER CASIVS. 23 After this, he went to all the games of prise, one after another▪ For even those that usually are celebrated at most remote and distant times he comman∣ded to be reduced all into Wherein he thither came one yeare, and some of them also to be Solemnized twice in the same yeare. iterated. At Olympia likewise hee caused, (contrarie to the manner and custome of that place) a game of musick to be held. And least whiles he was busied about these matters, anie thing might either call him away or detaine him: when he was aduertised by his freed-man HELIVS, that the Citie affaires required his pre∣sence, hee wrot backe unto him in these words. Albeit your councell to mee at this present and your willing desire is, that I should returne with all speede, yet ought you to aduise me and wish rather, that I may returne worthy my selfe, that is to say, NERO. All the while hee was singing, Lawefull it was not for anye per∣son to depart out of the Theatre, were the cause never so necessarie. Where∣vpon reported it is, that some great bellied women falling into travaile were delivered upon the very skaffolds: yea and many men besides, wearie of tedi∣ous hearing and praysing him, when the towne gates were shut, eyther by stealth leapt downe from the walles, or counterfeiting themselues dead were caried forth as corses to bee buried. But how timorously, with what thought and anguish of minde, with what aemulation of his concurrents and feare of the Vmpiers, hee strove for the Mastery; it is almost incredible. His manner was to deale with his aduersaries, as if they had been but his aequals and of the same condition with him, in this sort: namely, to obserue, watch and mark their behaviours; to ly in the wind for to catch aduantage: to defame them vnder hand, other whiles to raile at them & given them hard tearms as they came in his way: yea and to corrupt with Thereby to make them telent and not to do their best. bribes and giftes such as excelled in skill and cunning. As for the IVDGES and VMPIERS aforesayde, hee woulde speake unto them in all reverence before he begun to sing, using these tearmes. That hee had one whatsoever was to be done: Howbeit, the issue and event was in the hand of Forune: They therefore, as they were wisemen and learned ought to except and barre all chaunces and mishaps. Now upon their exhortati∣ons unto him for to be hold and venturous, he would indeed goe awaye from them better appaied, but yet for all that, not without pensive care and trouble of minde, finding fault also with the silence and bashfull modestie of some as if the same argued their discontended heavinesse and malitious repining, saying withall. That he had them in suspicion. 24 During the time that hee strove for to winne anie prise, so strictely
obeyed hee the lawes of the game, that hee never durst once spit and reach up fleame: and the very swet of his forehead hee wiped away with hisOr slecue & not with anie handkercheife arme onely. Moreover in theChating. acting of a Tragaedie, when he had quickly taken up his staffe (a) againe, which he happened to let fall, being much dismaied and in great feare, least for that delinquencie hee should be put from the stage: by no meanes tooke he heart againe, until an under actor or prompter standing by sware an oth that it was not espied and marked for the shoutes and acclamati∣ons of the people beneath. Now, whensoever he wan the victorie, he vsed to pronounce himselfe victour. For which cause, he contended also in every place for theDue to him that had the lowdest voice. Criers coronet. And to the end, there should remaine extant no memoriall or token of anie other victours (c) in these sacred games beside himselfe, hee commanded all their statues, and images to be overthrowen, drawen with a drag and so slung into sinkes and privies. Furthermore, he ran with chariots for the best game in many places, and at the Olympicke so∣lemnities with one that had a teeme of tenne steedes, notwithstanding he re∣proved the very same in K. MITHRIDATES as appeared by certaine verses of his owne making. But being once shaken and hoisted out of his Chariot and set therein againe, how be it not able to hold out, he desisted and gave over, be∣fore he had runne the race through. Yet was he crowned neverthelesse. After this, at his departure frō thence, he enfranchised the whole Province through∣out: and withall, the Iudges of these Games he endowed with the freedome of Rome, and rewarded with great summes of money. Which benefits of his him∣selfe published with his owne voice from the middle of the race, upon a day of the Isthmian games. 25 Beeing returned out of Greece hee entred Naples; mounted upon a Cha∣riot drawne with white horses: For that, in the said Citie he had made profes∣sion first of his skill, in (musicke) and a part of the wall was cast downe a∣gainst his comming, (as the manner is of all victours in those sacred games). Semblably rode he into ANTIVM, and from thence into ALBANVM and so forward into ROME. But he entred ROME in the very same Chariot, wherein sometime AUGUSTUS had rode in triumph, clad in aOr Mantell. purple cloke, and the same garnished with starres embrodered in golde: wearing upon his head theMade of the wilde Olive branches. Olympicke Coronet, and bearing in his right hand theOf Lawrell. Py∣thisk: with a pompe and gallant shewe of theIsthmian, of Pine & Neme an of smallach or persley. rest before him, together with their titles and inscriptions testifying, where? and whom? in what kinde of songe or fabulous argment, hee had wonne: not without a traine also of (a) Applauders following his Chariot, after the manner of those that ride ovant in petie Triumph setting up a note, and crying with a lowde voice, That they were AUGUSTIANS, and the souldiers of his triumph: From thence he rode forward, and having throwen downe the Arch of the greatest Cirque, he passed on through the Velabrum & market place, up to the Palatium and so to the temple of APOLLO. To do him honor all the way as he went, were beasts killed for sacrifice, and saffron estsoones strewed along the streets. Birdes were let flie, ribbands also and tabels yea and sweete banketting jun∣kets cast among. As for the sacred Coronets and guirlands aforesayde. He bestowed them in his owne bed-chamber round about his beds: likewise
his owne statues pourtraied in the habit of anOr Minstre harper, and with that marke stamped he his money. And after all this, (so farre was he from letting slacke and remitting one joce his ardent study of his musicke profession) that for the presentation of his voice he would never make speech unto his souldiours,. Per Nun by messengers sent betweenet but absent: or havingwhen himself was present, another to pronounce his words for him; nor yet do ought in earnest or mirth without hisA moder∣tour of his voice. Phonascus by, to put him in mind for to spare his pipes and hold his handkerchiefe to his mouth: and to many a man hee ey∣ther offered friendship, or denounced enmitie, according as every one praised him more or lesse. 26 His unruly wildnesse, unbridled lust, wastfull riotousnesse, avarice and cru∣elty, he practised verely at first, by leasure closely, as the trickes of youthfull folly: yet so, as even then no man might doubt, that they were the inbred vices of nature, and not the errors of young age. No sooner was it twi-light & the evening shut in but presently he would catch vp a cap (a) on his head, and so dis∣guised,* Or hood. goe into tavernes and victualling houses: walke the streetes playing and sporting all the way, but yet not without shrewd turnes and dooing mis∣chiefe. For he vsed to fall upon those that came late from supper and knocke them soundly: yea and (if they strugled with him and made resistance,) to wound and drowne them in the sinkes and towne ditches to breake into petie shops also, and rifle them: For he had set up in his house at home aOr market. (b) faire, there to receive the price of the bootie which hee had gotten, and was to bee solde to who would give most and bid best therefore. But many a time at such brawles and skufflings aforesaied, he endangered his eyes, yea and his life too; being once beaten well neere to death by a certaine young (c) gentleman of Se∣natours degree, whose wife he had misused with uncleane handling. Where∣upon, never after durst he goe abroad into the streets at that houre of the night, without his militarie Tribunes following after him aloofe and secretly.

His moales (a) hee drewe out at length: eating and drinking from noone to midnight, dowssed and fomented oftentimes in cesternes of hote waters, and in som∣mer season within bathes altered and made colde with snowe.

So often as hee went downe the River Tiberis to OSTIA, or sayled a long the BaianOr Bay. Creeke, there were provided in divers places of the strond and bankes, boothes to baite in,
conspicuous brothell houses and taverns; where stood maried dames after the manner of (e) hostesses and victualling wives calling unto him; some here, some there on both sides of the bankes, intreating him to land and turne in to them. His manner was also to give warning unto his familiar friends, and bid him selfe to supper: and one of them it cost in sweet meats. 4.Quadrgies, HS.

ACTE a freed woman he went very neere to haveWhich had beene a great disparagement wedded as his lawefull wife: suborning certaine men who had beene Consuls, to avouch and forsweare. That she was of Roiall bloud descended. A boy there was named (a) SPORUS, whose Genitories he cut out, & assayed therby to transforme him into the nature of a woman. Him he caused to be brought unto him as a bride, with a dowry, in a fine (yellow) vele, after the solemne maner of mariage: not without a frequent and goodly traine attending upon him: Whom he main∣tained as his wife. Hereupon there goes abroad a pretie conceited jest of a pleasant fellow. That it might have beene wel and happie with the World, if his fa∣ther DOMITIUS had wedded such a Wife. This SPORUS trimly set out with the jewels, decked with the ornaments of the Empresses, and caried in a licter, hee accompanied all about the shire-townes of great resort and market bur∣roughes of Greece: yea and afterwards at Rome, up and downe the street Si∣gillaria, manie a time sweetly kissing him by the way. For, that he had a lust to ly with his owne mother, and was frighted from it by some depraving backe∣friendes of hers; for feare, least the proude and insolent dame might by this kind of favour grow too mightie, no man ever made doubt: especially after that he entertained among his Concubines an harlot, most like in all points (by re∣report) unto AGRIPPINA. It is affirmed moreover, that in times past, so of∣ten as hee rode in a licter together with his mother, hee played the filthy wanton, and was bewrayed by the markes and spottes appearing upon her vesture. 29 As for his owne body, CERTES, he forfeited the honour thereof, prosti∣tuting it to bee abused so farreforth, as having defiled in manner all the parts of it, at the last, he devised a kind (as it were) of sport and game: that being covered all over in a wilde beastes skin, hee should be let loose forth of aOr grate. cage and then give the assault upon the privities of men and women both as they stood tyed fast to a stake: and when he had shewed his rage to the full, be killed, forsooth by (a) DORIPHORUS his freed man, unto whom him selfe also was weddedI wish that both Stonius and Do had in this place and such like been alto∣gether silent. like as SPORUS unto him: insomuch as hee counterfeited the noise and cries of maidens, when they bee forced and suffer devirgination. I have heard of di∣vers, that he was fully perswaded, No man nor woman was honest, or in any part of their bodies pure and cleane, but most of them dissimled their vncleannesse and craftily hid it. As many therefore, asConfessed of themselues and their owne ac∣cord. professed unto him their obsoene filthi∣nesse, he forgave all other faults and trespasses whatsoever.
30 The fruite of richesse and use of money, he tooke to be nothing else but la∣vish expense: thinking them to be very base niggards and mechanicall pinch∣pennies, that kept any account or reckoning what they spent and layde out: but such only passing rich and right Magnificoes, who mispent and wasted all. He praised and admired his uncleQuadri▪ eis . Take Sestertium here in the newter gender: other∣wise, it were but a meane venture or such an one as Nero: as a∣mounting not above 3 l, 2 S. 6 d.

L CAIUS in no respect more, than for that hee had lashed out and consumed in a short space an huge masse of wealth, left unto him by TIBERIUS: Hee kept therefore no meane, nor made anye end of prodigall giving and making away all. Hee allowed unto (a) TIRI∣DATES a (thing almost incredible) 800000. Sesterces, day by day, for his expenses, and at his departure bestowed upon him not so little as one hun∣dred millians. MENECRATES the harper, and SPICILLUS the sword∣senset hee enfeoffed in the livings, patrimonies and houses of right noble per∣sonages, who had triumphed. CERCOPITHECUS, whom hee had enri∣ched with the lands and houses, (as well within the Citie as Countrey) of PA∣NEROS the Vsurer, hee honoured like a Prince at his funerals; and enterred with the charges well neere of a royall sepulture. No garments did hee on his backe twice: At hazard when he played, he ventured no lesse than 400000 sesterces at a cast, upon every point or pricke of the chaunce. Hee fished with a goldenAuratorete. Orosius saith more expresly, retibus aureis net (drawen and knit) with cords twisted of purple and crimsen silke in graine. He neuer by report when he made anie journey, had under a thousand carroches in his traine; His mules were shod with siluer. His muli∣tiers arraied in fine (red) Canusme cloth: and attended he was with a multitude ofHorse men of Africke and Cappadocia. Mazaces and Curreurs gaily set out with their bracelets and riche Pha∣lers. 31 In no one thing was hee more wastefull and prodigall then in building. Hee made an house, that reached from the Palatium to the Esquiliae: which at the first he called hisAs one would say, the passage from one hill to another. Transitorie: but when it had been consumed with fire and was reedefied hee named his golden aedifice. As touching the large compasse and receit, the rich furniture and setting out whereof, it may suffice Or fore-gate▪ to relate thus much. The porch was of such an heigth as therein might stand upright the geantlike image representing his owne person, an hundred and twentie foote high.

But of al these parlours & banqueting roomes, the principall and fairest was made rounde, to turne about conti∣nually both day and night, in manner of theOr heaven World. The banes within this house slowed with salte water derived from the sea, and with fresh from

Furthermore, hee began a Piscnam. poole reaching from MISENVM to the (Or lake) Meere AVERNVS, covered all above head, en∣closed and enuironed with Or Walking places. Cloistures: into which all the hote waters that were in the Bathes of Baiae might bee conueied. Likewise he cast a Or ditch. fosse from the sayde AVERNVS, as farre as to OSTIA, and the same navigable: that men forsooth might saile in ships, and yet not be upon the sea. This ca∣ried in length 160. miles, and bare that breadth, as gallies with 5. ranks of oares might passe to and fro thereupon. For the performing of these workes, he had given commandement, that all prisoners wheresoever should be transported into Italie: and that no person attaint and conuict of anie wicked act, should be condemned otherwise, but to worke thereat. To these outragious expenses, beside the trust and confidence he had in the32 revenewes of the Empire, put forward hee was upon a certaine unexpected hope also that he cōceived, of finding a world of wealth: & that through intelli∣gence given unto him by a gētleman of Rome, who assured him upon his know∣ledge,A, V, C, 818. that the rich treasure & old store of siluer and gold both, which Queene DIDO flying out of Tyros caried away with her, lay buried in Affricke within most huge and vaste caves under the ground, and might be gotten forth with some small labour of those that would goe about it. But when this hope fai∣led him and came to nothing, being now altogether destitute, & so far exhaust and bare of money, that of necessity even souldiours pay, and the fees due unto olde seruitours in the wars for their seruice must run on stil and be differred; he bent his mind to promoting of false imputations, to pilling also & polling. First and formost hee brought up this order, that out of the goods of freedmen de∣ceased in steed of the one half, three 4 th parts should be exacted & gathered for him, of as many, I say as without publike cause bare that name, which anie of those families did, whereunto himselfe was allied. Afterwards, that their wils should be forfaite & confiscate, who were Remembred him not in their wils and made him not an heyre. unthankeful to the Prince. Item, that Lawiers should not escape free & go cleere awaie, who had drawen & written such wils: As also, that all deeds and words should bee brought within the cō∣passe of treason: If there could be found but anie promoter to give informati∣on. He called more over after a long time passed, for the rewards and Coronets due to victours, which ever at any times the Cities & States had presented or decreed unto him at the games of prise. And whereas hee had prohibited the vse of the Or violet in graine. Amethist & purple colours, he suborned one of purpose under hand to sell upon Or faire. a market day some few ounces therof, and thereupon made stay of all Who had bought the saide colours. occupiers & chapmen whatsoever, & laid them fast. Furthermore, having e∣spied once (as he was singing) a dame of Rome frō the skaffolds in the Theatre, arraied in purple forbidden by the Iulia: which Csar Dictator me, See in Iul.

(of ROME): which soone after GALA restored & erected againe in their places. 33 As touching his Parricides and murders hee began them first with CLAV∣DIUS: of whose death although he were not principall author, yet he was pri∣vie and accessarie thereto. Neither dissimuled he so much, as who afterwards was wont by a greek Or Prouerbe by-word, to praise mushromes, (in which kinde of meat CLAUDIUS had taken his bane), as the  alluding to the deification af∣ter his death. foode of the gods. CERTES, he a∣bused him after hee was dead in most spitefull and contumelious manner, both in word and deede, every way: taunting and twitting him, one while with his folly, another while with his crueltie. For, in scoffing wife he would say of him that hee had left now (a) morari) anie longer among mortall men, using the first sillable of the sayd word long. And many of his decrees and constitutions he annulled as the acts of a doltish and doting man. Finally, he neglected the Bustu place (b) of his funerall fire: suffering it to be As the man∣ner was for certaine daies before the ashes and re∣liques were gathered up empaled, but with sleight stuffe and low railes of timber. As for BRITANNICUS, not so much for enuie that he had a sweeter and pleasanter voice than himselfe, as for feare least another day he should bee more gracious then he among men, in remembrance of his Father, he attempted to make him away by poison▪ This poison, NERO had received at the hands of one LOCUSTA, a woman who appeached & brought to light divers confectioners of poysons: and seeing it wrought later than he looked it should doe, and prooved not to his mind, by reason that it mooved BRITANNICUS to the stoole onely and caused a laske; he sent for the said wo∣man, and beate her with his owne hands: laying hardly to her charge that in steede of a poyson she had given him a remedie and holsome medecine.

IVLIA. And so hee forced her before his face in his owne bed-chamber to compound and seeth a poison that should be most quicke and of present operation. And then having made triall thereof in a kid, after he saw once that the beast continued five houres before it dyed, he caused the same to be boyled againe and manie times more, and so he set it before a pig. And when the pig dyed presently up∣on the taking thereof, hee commanded it should be brought into his refection chamber, and given unto BRITANNICUS as he sat at supper with him. No sooner had he tasted it but hee fell downe dead. NERO readily made a lye and gaue it out among the rest of his guests, that BRITANNICUS was surprised by a fit of the falling sicknesse, as his manner was to be. But the next morrow, in all hast hee tooke order for his corps to bee caried forth to buriall, with no better funerals than ordinarie; and that, in an exceeding great storme of raine. Vnto the sayd LOCUSTA, for her seruice done, he granted For her for∣mer practise of poisoning, by which she stoode condē∣ned. impunitie: he endved her also with faire lands: yea and allowed her to have schollers for to be trai∣ned up under her in that feat. 34 His owne mother, for looking narrowly into him, & examining his words and deedes somewhat streightly; for seeming also to correct and reforme
the same, thus farre forth onely at the first he was grieved and offended with, as that eft-soones he made her odious to the world, pretending that he was a∣bout to resigne up the Empire As if she were the cause ther∣of and depart to Rhodes. Soone after, he deprived her of all honour, dignity, and authority: and removing from about her the guard Militum, e Germanrum, Hen dia duo. of Germaine Souldiours that attended upon her person, hee banished her out of the same house with him, and so forth out of the precincts of the Pa∣lace: Neither cared he what he did, so he might molest and trouble her: sub∣orning some of purpose, both to disquiet her whiles shee abode in Rome with suites and actions; and also when shee was desirous of repose and ease in a reti∣ring place out of the way, to course her with reproachfull taunts and flouting scoffes as they passed that way either by land or sea. But beeing terrified with her threats and violent shrewdnesse, hee determined to kill and dispatch her at once. Having attempted it with poison thrice, and perceiving that shee was defended with Antidotes & preservatives; he provided a bed-chamber for her, with so ticklish an arched roufe over her head, as beeing easily unioincted, the frame there of might fall in peeces in the night, and light upon her as she lay a sleepe. When this dessigne could not be kept close, but was revealed by some of the complices privie thereto; hee devised a ship, so made, as that quickly it should cleave a sunder: that either by the wrack, or fall of the fore-deck aloft, she might come to a mischiefe and perish. And so, making a semblance of a Love-day and reconciliation, hee sent for her by most sweet and kinde Letters, training her unto Baiae, there to celebrate with him the solemnity of the A feast in the honour of Mi∣nerra, begin∣ning five daies before the Ides of March▪ i. the 11 of March.

Now when she was to returne back againe unto Bauli; in lieu of that vessell thus sha ken and crackt, he put unto her the other above said made with ioints and vices, easie to fall in pieces: and so, with a cheerefull countenance accompanied her (to Or to the staires. the water side) and at the parting also kissed her paps. All the time after, he lay awake in great trouble & feare, waiting for the issue of these enterprises. But when he understood that all went crosse, & that she was escaped to land by swimming; being altogether to seeke what course to take; as L.

Worse matter yet than all this & more hor∣rible, is reported beside, and that by Authors of good credit and who will stand to it: Namely, That he ran in all hast to view the dead body of his mother when she was killed: that he handled every part & member of it: found fault with some, commended others: and being thirsty in the meane About mid∣night it was. time, tooke a draught of drink.

Moreover, with a sacrifice made by direction of magicians, he assaied to raise' up her soule and spirite, and to intreate the same to forgive him.

But when the pe∣ople misliked this divorse, and forbare not to raile upon him for it, he procee∣ded, even to confine & banish her quite. In the end he murdred her, under a co∣lourable imputation of divers adulteries, charged upon her so impudently and falsely; That al generally who were by torture examined upon the point, stood stoutly to the very last in deniall, he suborned and brought in ANICETUS his own Paedagogue against her; who should slander himselfe with her & confesse that by a wile he had abused her bodie. The twelfth day after the saide divorce∣ment of OCTAVIA, he espoused and maried the aforesaid dame POPPAEA whō he loved intirely; and yet even her also he killed with a Who had brought him vp in his child∣hood, kicke of his heele, for that, being big with child and sickly withall, she had reviled him & given him shrewd words, for comming home so late one night, after his rūning with cha∣riots.

With no lesse cruelty raged hee abroad even against strangers and meere36 forainers. A blazing hairy starre, commonly thought to portend death and destruction to the highest poures, began to arise, and had appeared many nights together. Beeing troubled therewith, and enformed by BABILUS the Astrologer, that Kings were wont to expiate such prodigious signes with some notable massacre, and so divert the same from themselues, & turne all upon the heads of their Peeres & Nobles, he thereupon projected the death of all the Noblest personages in the Citie. And verily, so much the rather, and, as it were, upon just cause, by reason of two conspiracies by him published & divulged a∣broad: of which, the former & the greater, bearing the name of And his friēd Pisoniana. PISO, was plotted and detected at Rome: the latter going under the name of And his adhe∣rents, Viniciana VINICIUS at Beneventū. The conspiratours had their triall, and pleaded bound with three∣fold chaines: and as some of them confessed the action of their owne accord, so And, by name Sulpitius Asper. others said moreover, That he was beholden vnto them for it, because they could not possibly doe a cure upon him by any other meanes, (disteined as he was and disho∣nored with all kinde of wicked actes) but onely by death. The children of the condē∣ned were expelled the Citie, and then, dispatched with poison or hunger∣starued. It is for certaine knowen, that some of them with their paedagogues & booke-keepers tooke their bane all at one dinner togither, others were re∣strained for seeking and earning their daily food. 37 After this without all choise and respect, without all measure in his hand, he spared none: he put to death whomsoever it pleased him, and for what cause it skilled not. But not to make long relation of many, It was laid to SALUIDI∣ENUS ORCITUS charge, that he had set and let three shops out of his house a∣bout the Forū, unto the Cities & States abroad for (their Embassadours) for to make their abode & conuerse in. To CASSIUS LONGINUS the lawier (a man bereft of both his eyes) objected it was, that in the antient pedigree of his own house and linage, he had set up againe the images of C. CASSIUS, one of thē that murdred CAESAR. TO PAETAS THRASEAS, for having a sterne & severe countenance like a Paedagogue, When these with other were appointed once to dy, he allowed them no more then one houres respite to live after & because
no further delay might come between, he put unto thē Chyrurgians (in case they lingred and made no hast) to cure them out of hand, (for that was the term he used) meaning thereby, to cut their veines & let them bleed to death. It is ve∣rily thought also, that to a certain great (a) eater Polyphao cui∣dam. or glutton (an Aegyptian borne) that u∣sed to feed on raw flesh and whatsoever was given him, he had a great desire to cast men alive, for to bee quartered cut in peeces & devoured by him. Being lifted and puffed up, with these as it were, so great Or prosperity successes, he saide that no Or none of the Emperors knew. prince ever knew what he might do: and oftentimes he cast out many words betokening very significantly, that he would not spare the Senators remaining behind, but one day utterly rase that Order & degree out of the cōmon-wealth, and permit the gentlemen of Rome & his freed-men (only to rule provinces & have the conduct of armies. CERTES, neither at his comming home nor go∣ing* In Achaia, nere Corinth. forth any whether, vouchsafed he to kisse any one of them, no nor so much as once to resalute them: and when with formall complements he entred upon* Comprising therein the gentlemens degree: not Senatui, populo{que} Rom. as the manner had beene. his worke of digging through Isthmus, he wished and praied alowd before a fre∣quent audience, That the enterprise might speed well and turne to the weale of him selfe and the people of Rome, concealing and suppressing al mention of the Senate. 38 But yet for al that, he spared not the people nor forbare the very wals and buildings of his country the Citie. When one in common talke upon a time chaunced to say. (a) When vitall breath is fled from me, Let earth with fire imingled be. Nay rather quoth he Whiles vital breath remains in me &c. And even so he did indeede: for being offended, as it were with the yl favoured fashion of the olde houses; as also with the narrow, crooked & winding streets; he set the citie of Rome on fire so apparantly, that many Citizens of Consuls de∣gree, taking his Cubiculares i. the grooms of his chamber. chamberlaines in the maner with matches, touchwood and hurds in their messuages (within the Citie) would not once lay hand on them but let them alone: yea & certein garners and store houses about his golden Aedifice (for that the plot of ground on which they were situate, his mind stood most unto), were by war-engins forcibly shakē, throwē down & fired, by reason they were built with stone wals. For 6. dayes & 7. nights together raged he in this wise making havocke of all, and driving the common-people to take up their Or lodgings, Innes & shrowd themselues the while about the toumbs & moniments of the dead. During this time, beside an infinit number of (b) houses standing apart frō others, the goodly aedifices & buildings of noble capitains in old time, ador∣ned stil & beautified with the spoiles of enemies, the stately temples also of the gods, vowed & dedicated by the auntient kings first, & afterwards in the With the Carthaginians. punick & french wars; burned all, on a light fire: & in one word, whatsoever remained from old time worth the seeing & memorable was consumed. This fire, beheld he daily out of Maecenas (c) high toure: and taking ioy (as he sayd himselfe) at the beautiful flame that it made, chaunted the winning and destruction of Troie, in that Musitians habit wherein he was wont to sing upon the stage. And because he would not misse, but lay fast holde upon all the bootie and pillage which possibly hee, could come by, even from thence also, having promised free
leave to cast forth dead karkasses, and rid away the rammell of the ruines; looke what reliques remained of all their goods and substance unburnt, he permitted not one to goe unto it. Finally, not onely by receiving, but also by exacting Contributions from all parts, he beggered well neere the provinces and con∣sumed the wealth of private persons. To amend the matter well, vnto these harmes and reprochefull dishonors39 (of the State) so great as they were arising from the Prince, there happened al∣so some other calamities by chance and fortune: to wit, a pestilence continu∣ing one autumne, whereby thirtie (a) thousand burials were reckoned in the As we say in the Church booke. re∣cord of In whose tem ple were to be bought or hi∣red, whatsoe∣ver pertained to funerals & burials.

But a wonder it was to see, and a thing especially to be noted, that amid all these in∣fortunities hee tooke nothing lesse to the heart, than the shrewd checks and reviling taunts of Men: and was to none more milde, than to such as had pro∣voked him, either with hard speeches, or opprobrious verses. Many infamous libels & defamatorie words, both in Greek and Latine, were publikely written, or otherwise cast and spred abroad against him, As for example these. .

Yet some there were who promised unto him so forsakē, the govermēt of the East parts: and others by speciall name the kingdome of Hierusalem: but most of them warranted him assuredly the restitution of his former estate. And being incli∣ned rather to rest upon this hope, when he had lost Britaine and Armenia, & re∣covered them both againe: he thought himselfe discharged then and quit from the fatall calamities destined unto him. But sending one time to the Oracle of APOLLO at Delphi, and hearing this answere from thence (a) That hee must beware of the yeare 73, as who would say, He was to dye in that yeare (of his owne age) and not before; and divining no whit of GALBAHS yeeres; with so assu∣red confidence hee conceived in his heart not onely long life but also a per∣petuall and singular felicity, that when he had lost by ship wracke things of ex∣ceeding price, he stucke not to say among his familiars.

At Naples aduertised he was of the rebellion in Gaule. Which fell out to be the very same day of the yeare, on which he had killed his mother. But hee tooke this newes so patiently and carelesly, that hee gave suspicion even of joy and contentment: as if occasion had beene of∣fered and presented thereby to make spoyle (by the lawe of armes) of those most rich & wealthy Provinces: and streight waies going forth into the Publike place of exercise.

As if he had said, a mis∣chiefe take these Rebels: or, mischiefe will come to them. mischiefe to them who Descissent, al. dedissent, as if mischief wold fall upon the authors heads had revolted. To conclude, for eight dayes together he never went a∣bout to write backe unto any man nor to give any charge or direction at all, but buried the matter quite in silence. At the last, throughly mooved and netled with the contumelious e∣dicts41 of vindex comming so thicke one in the necke of another, he exhorted the Senate, in a letter written unto them, to revenge him and the common∣wealth: alleadging for an excuse the An inflām a∣tion or swel ling in the throate. Squinsie whereof hee was sicke: and therefore could not himselfe be present in person. But nothing vexed him so much as this, That hee was by him blamed for an unskilfull* musician, and because in
steed of NERO, he called himWhich was the name of his family, and so had he been called before his adoption. AENOBARBUS. And verely as touching this name appropriate to his house and family; wherewith he was thus in con∣tumelious manner twitted, he professed to resume the same, and to lay away the other thatNero Claudius Drusus came by adoption. All other reviling taunts and slaunders hee confuted as meere false, by no other, argument than this. That unskilfulnesse, forsooth, was obiected unto him in that very art, which he had so plainly studied and brought to so good perfection: and therewith asked them eftsones one by one, whe∣ther they had ever knowen a more excellent Musician than himselfe. But when mes∣sengers came still one after another, in great feare he returned to Rome. And having his hart lightned but a little in the way, with a vaine and foolish prsage by occasion that hee espied and obserued engraven upon a monument, a cer∣taine french souldiour with a Romane knight overmatched in fight and trailed along by the haire (of the head): he at this sight leapt for ioy and worshipped the heavens. Neither then verely, did hee so much as consult in publike with the Senate, or assemble the people: but onely call forth home to his house some of the chiefe and principall persons among them. And having dispat∣ched in great haste this consultation, the rest of that day he led them all abovt to his musicall water instruments of a strange devise and fashion, not before knowen: and shewing every one by it selfe unto them, discoursing also of the reason and difficult workemanship of each one, he promised even anone to bring them all forth into the open Theatre,Which it seems he spake ironically, if simply, he mea neth, in case Vindex interupted not his sports and the publike felici∣tie. If VINDEX would give him leave, 42 After that he understood besides, how GALBA likewise & the provinces of Spaine were revolted, he fell downe at once: his heart was then daunted & cleane done: and so he lay a good while speechlesse in a traunce, and ready, as one would say, to goe out of the world. And so soone as he came againe to himselfe, he rent his clothes, beat and knockt his head, saying plainely That he was utterly undone: yea and when his nource came about him to comfort his poore heart, telling him, that the like accidents had befallen to other prin∣ces also before him, hee answered againe, That hee above all the rest suffred mi∣series never heard of nor knowen before: Thus in his life time to forgoe and loose his Empire. Neither yet for all this strucke he saile one whit in laying away or lea∣ving out one jot of his ordinary riot and supine slouthfulnesse. Nay when some little inckling was given of good newes out of the provinces as he sat at a most sumptuous and plentifull supper; hee pronounced even with expresse gesture like a player, certaine ridiculous rimes, and those set to lascivious and wanton measures, against the chiefetaines of rebellion: and what were those? even stale stuffe and commonly knowen already. Being also secretly conueied into the Theatre he sent word unto a certaine Player acting his part with great cō∣tentment of them that sawe and heard him, That he did but abuse hisIn that hee plaied without a concurrent whereas him∣self but for his Businesses would haue put him down, occupations. 43 Immediatly upon the beginning of this fearefulc Ocasioned by the Com∣motions & re volts abroad tumult, it is credibly thought that he intended manie designes and those very cruell and horrible: yet such as agreed well enough with his naturall humour: namely, to sende under hand successours and murderers of all those that were Commanders of armies & re∣gents of Provinces; as if they all had conspired and drawen in one and the selfe same line. Item, to massacre all banished persons where soever; and the french∣men
every one that were to be foūd in Rome: those because they should not band & combine with them that revolted: these, as complices with their owne con∣trie men, and their abbetters.

Which songs quoth hee ought with all speede even now to be composed for me. 44 In the preparation of this warlike voiage, his speciall care was, to choose forth meete wagons for the cariage of his musicall instruments; to cut & poll the concubines which hee caried out with him like men: and to furnish them with battaile axes and little bucklers after the Amazonian fashion. This done, he cited the Citie-tribes to take the militarie oth: and when no seruiceable mē would answere to their names, he enjoyned all Masters to set forth a certaine number of bond-seruants, neither admitted he out of the whole family & hovs∣hold of every mā, but such only as were most approved, excepting not so much as their stewards or clarkes and secretaries.

(a) HOMERE engraven and wrought upon them, he dashed against the paved floure. Then, after he had received a poison of LOCUSTA & put it up in a golden boxe, he went directly into the hortyards of the Seruitij:
where, having sent before his most trusty freed-servants unto OTIA for to rig and prepare a fleet to sea, He sounded the Tribunes and Centurious of the guard, whether they ould be are him company and flie with him, or no? But when some of them made it coy and kept some hasting: others in plaine termes refused; and one also cried out aloud, Vsque  (b)  est? What! is it such a miserie To leave this life and so to die? He cast about, and thought of many and sundry shifts? Whether hee should goe as an humble suppliant unto the Parthians, or to GALBA? or whether it were best for him, arraied all in blacke to come abroad into the Citie, and there in open place before the ROSTRA, with all the rusull and piteous moane that hee could possibly make, crave pardon for all that was past? and unlesse hee could turne the peoples harts untoAnd to suffer him for to in∣ioy the Empire mercy, make suite to have if it were but the (c) Deputy-ship of Aegypt graunted unto him.

But men thinke hee was scared from this enterprise, as fearing least before he thitherTo the . could come, he should be pulled in peeces. Thus, putting off all farther cogitation of this matter unto the next day, andOr starting out of his sleep▪ awakened about midnight; when he understood that the guard of his Souldiours was retired and gone, hee leapt forth of his bed, and sent all about to his friends. But because no word was brought back from any of them, himselfe accompanied with a fewe about him went to every one of their lodgings: Where finding all dores shut, and no body to make him answere, he returned to his bed chamber. By which time, his Keepers also and Warders were slipt from thence: but they had stollen away first the hangings and furniture of his chamber, yea and set out of the way the box aforesaid with the poison. Then straight-waies he sought for SPICILLUS theMirmillnems Sword fencer, or any other common hackster he cared not who, by whose hand he might receive his deaths wound. But find∣ing none. Well, quoth he, And have I neither a friend, nor a foe? And so he runnes forth, as if he would have throwne himselfe headlong into Tiberis. 48 But having reclaimed once againe that violent moode, hee desired some more secret retyring place, wherein he might lurke a while and recall his wits together. And when PHAON his freed man made offer unto him of a Farme house of his, that he had by the Citie side, about foure miles off, betweene the high-waies Sa∣lari and umentana, bare footed as hee was and in hisSingle wast∣coate. shirt hee cast over it a cloake all sullied and which had lost the colour. And so covering his head, and holding an hand kercheife before his face, to horseback hee went; having not a∣bove foure persons in his companie; of which* SPORUS made one.

In such cases as these hee had neede to bee wise and sober: Goe to man, plucke up thy heart and rouse thy selfe. Nowe by this time approached the Horsemen neere at hand, who had a warrant and precpt to bring him alive. Which when hee perceived, after hee had with trembling and

In which very word he yeelded up his breath, with his eyes staring out and set in his head, to the great feare and horrour of all that were present. He had requested of the companie which attended upon him, no one thing more earnestly than this. That no man might have his head seve∣red from the body but that in any wise he might be burnt whole.

His reliques, ECLOGE and ALEXANDRA his two Nources, together14 with ACTE his Concubine bestowed within the monument belonging to the house of the DOMITII his Auncestors: Which is to be seene out of Mars field, situate upon the Knap of an hill within their Hortyards.

His body full of specks and freckles, and foule of skinne besides. The haire of his head somewhat yellow: His countenance and visage rather faire, than lovely and well favoured. His eyes gray and somewhat with the dimmest. His neck full and fat. His belly & paunch bearing out: with a paire of passing slender spindle shanks: but withall, he was very healthfull. For, being as he was so untemperate and most royotously given, in 14 yeeres space, he never fell sicke but thrice: yet so, as hee neither so: bare drinking of wine, nor any thing else that hee used to doe. About the trimming of his body and wearing of his cloathes so nice, as it was shamefull: in so much as hee would alwaies have the bush of his head laide and plaited by curles in degrees: but what time as he travailed in Achaia, hee drew it backward also from the crowne of his head As you may see in ye coines pictures of Otho the Empe∣rour i.

But from the Studie of Philosophie his mother turned his minde; telling him, It was repugnant to one who another day was to bee a Soveraigne: and from the knowledge of auncient Oratours, his Maister SENECA withdrew him, because hee would hold him the longer in admiration of himselfe. And therefore, being of his owne accord readily enclined to Poetry, he made verses voluntarily and with∣out paine. Neither did he (as some think) set forth other mens Poems as his owne.
There haue come into mine hands writing tables and bookes containing verses very famous and well knowne abroade, written with his owne hand: so as a man may easily see they were not copied out of other bookes, nor yet taken from the mouth of any other that indited them, but plainely penned as a man would say, by one that studied for them, and as they came in his head, so put them downe: so many blots and skrapings out, so many dashes and interlinings were in them. No small delight he had beside in painting; and most of all in forging and mool∣ding53 counterfaites. But aboue all, he was rauished and lifted up with popularity & praise of men: desirous therfore to imitate & equal them, who by any meanes plea sed the humours & contented the minds of the cōmon people. There went an opi∣niō and speech of him, that after he had gained the Coronets for his musicall fears performed upon the stage, hee would at the next fiue yeares revolution, go unto the Olympicke games, and contend for the prise among the Champions there. For, he practised wrestling continually. Neither beheld he the Gymnicke games throughout all Greece otherwise, than sitting below within the Or the lifts Stadium, as the manner of the Iudges and Vmpires of such masteries: and if any Or couples matched. paires of them drew to farre backe out of the appointed place, to plucke them with his own hands into the middle againe. He had intended moreouer (since he was reputed to have equalled APOLLO in singing and matched the Sun in charioting) to imitate al∣so the worthie acts of HERCVLES. And men say, there was a Lion prepared, which he, all naked should either with his club braine, or els with streight clasping beetweene his armes throttle and crush to death within the Amphitheatre, in the sight of all the people. 54 Certainely, a little before his ende he had openly made a vowe, That in case he continued stil in good and happie estate, represent he would likewise at the games, in his owne person after victory obtained, an Organist and player upon water instru∣ments, upon the flute also and hauthors, yea and a bagpiper, and on the last day (of the said games) an actor of Enterludes: what time he would aaunce and gesture Turnus in Virgill. And some write, that PARIS the actor was by him killed, as a concurrent that stood in his way and eclipsed his light. 55 A desire he had, (foolish and inconsiderate though it were) of aeternity and perpetuall fame. And therefore, abolishing the old names of many things & pla∣ces, hee did upon them new, after his owne. The moneth Aprill also hee called Neroneus. He ment moreover to have named Rome, Neroes Citty. Neropolis. All Religions whersoever he had in contempt, unlesse it were that onely of the56 Atergate or Astarte the ame som think that Iuno Syrian goddesse.

Some few moneths before he lost his life, he tooke regard also of the Skill in pry∣ing into beasts entrailes. Which he observed in deede, but never sped well there∣with, nor gained thereby the favour of the Gods.

Moreover, VOLOGESUS King of the Parthians, when he senthis Embas∣sadours unto the Senate for to treat about the renuing of league and Alliance with them, requested this also very earnestly, That the Memoriall of NERO might be still solemnized.

THE HISTORIE OF Servius Sulpitius Galba, vvrit∣ten by Caius Suetonius Tran∣quillus. THE Or line: Progenie of the CAESARS ended in NERO. Which,Chap 1 that it would so come to passe, appeared verily by many signes, but by two of all other most evident. As LIVIA in times past immediatly after her mariage with AUCUS∣TUS, went to see a Mannour house and land of her owne in the veientane Territorie, it fortuned that an Eagle soaring over her head let fall into her lap a white hen, holding in her bill a Lawrell branch even as she had caught it up. And thinking it good to have both the foule kept, and the said branch set in the ground: behold there came of the one such a goodly broode of Which pro∣ved white, as also the whole breed of them. Di: chickens, that even at this day the very house aforesaid is called Aa Gallinas: and sprung of the other so faire a row of Bay trees, that all the CAESARS when they were to ride in triumph gathered from thence

And as the manner was, that when any of them try∣umphed, they should pricke downe straight waies others in the same place: so it was obserued likewise, that a little before the death of every one the tree by him planted, did mislike and die. In the last yeere therefore of NERO, not onely the* , saith the very same. whole grove of bay trees withered to the very roote, but all the hens there died euery one. And anone after the Temple of the CAESARS being struckē with light∣ning, the heads with all of their Statues fell downe all at once, and the Scepter of AVGVSTVS was shaken out of his hands. After NERO succeeded GALBA, in no degree allied unto the house of the CAE∣SARS:2 but without all question a right noble gentleman of a great and auncientA VC. 821 Or pengree race: as who in the titles and Inscriptions over his owne Statues wrote himselfe al∣waies the Pronepotm Nephew once remooved of Q.

To prosecute the Images and Laudatorie testimonials belonging to the3 whole stocke & linage in generall were a long peece of worke: those onely of his own family wil I briefly touch. The first of all the SVLPITII, why? and whervpon he bare the surname of GALBA? there is some doubfull question. Some thinke it came by occasion of a Towne in Spaine, which after it had beene a long time in vaine assaulted, hee at length set on fire with burning brands besmeered all o∣ver with Galbanum: others, for that in a long sickenesse which hee had, hee vsed continually Galbeum, that is to say, a cure with remedies A gumme or  iuice yssuiug out of te oote (when it is wounded) of a plart cal∣led Ferula. enwrapped within wooll: some againe because hee seemed to be very fat, and such a one, the French doth name GALBA: or contrariwise, in regard that he was as slender, as are those creaturesLike vnto those round rls which womē in sead of fa thingales vse nder their clothes beneath the wast called in Latine Gal∣baei.

FrōA V C. 610 this man descended immediately the Grandsire and father of this GALBA the Emperour. His Grandfather for his booke and learning was more famous, then for any dignity in common weale that ever he attained unto. For, he arose no high er, than to the degree of a Praetour: but many histories he wrote, and those not sligh ly nor negligently composed. His father bare the honourable office of Consul: a man very low of stature and withall crowchbacked: and having but a meane gift in Oratory yet used he to plead causes industriously.

Being adopted by his stepmother, he assumed the name of LIVIVS, and the surname Livia Oceliina OCELLA, changing his fore name with all. For, afterwards even unto the time of his Em∣pire; he was forenamed LVCIVS in steed of SERVIVS. It is for certain knowne,• Or Ocellaris. that AVGVSTVS (what time as little GALBA among other boyes like himselfe saluted him,) tooke him by his pretie As the maner was in kissing young children cheeke and said, , i.

Afterwards when this GALBA began to rebell and aspire unto the Empire, nothing hartened him in this dessigne of his so much, as the foling of a mule. For when all men besides, abhorred this foule and monstrous prodigie, he alone tooke it to be most fortu∣nate: calling to remembrance the fore said sacrifice and the speech of his grandfa∣ther. When hee had newly put on his virile gowne, he dreamt that fortune spake these words unto him, namely, how she stood before his doore all weary, and vnlesse she were let in the sooner she should become a pray unto whom soeuer shee met.

Being by Calgnla CAIVS CAESAR substituted Lord generall for GETVLICVS, the very next day after he was come to the Le∣gions, when as the soldiers at a solemne shew which happened then to be exhibi∣ted, clapped their hands, he restrained them with this (a) Praecept, That they should keepe their hands O vnder. within their Or Mandiiās.

When tidings came that Caligula CAIVS was murde∣red,A, V, C, 794 and many pricked him forward to take the opportunitie then offered, hee pre∣ferred quietnesse and rest. For which cause hee stood in especiall fauour with CLAVDIVS, and was admitted into the ranke of his inward friends; a man of that worth and reputation as that when hee fell so dainely sicke (although not verie grieuously) the day appointed for to set forth in the Brittish expedition was differ∣red. He gouerned Africk as Proconsul two yeeres: being elected without lots drawing, for to settle and bring into order that Prouince farre out of frame and
disquieted as wel with the civil mutinies, among the soldiers, as tumultuous cōmo∣tions of the barbarous inhabitants. Which commission he discharged with great regard of severe discipline & execution of Iustice even in very small matters, A sol∣dier of his there was, who during the expedition above said, in a great dearth and scarcity of Corne, was accused to have sold a residue remaining of his owne allow∣ance, to wit, a Much about our peck. Modious of wheat, 3 l. 2. S. 6. d sterl: for one hundred deniers▪ whereuppon hee gave straight commandement, that when the said souldier began once to want food, no man should be so hardy as to relieve him. And so for hunger he pined to death. As for his civill Iurisdiction and ministring iustice: when there grew some question and debate about the proprietarie and right owner of a labouring beast, and sight evidences and presumptions on both sides were alledged: as simple wit∣nesses also produced and therefore hard to devine and guesse of the truth, he made* Couerrd all ouer the head. this decree, That the beast should be led As some horse or mule hoodwinked unto the poole where it was wont to be watered: and when it was unhooded againe, he awarded and pro∣nounced the said beast to be his, unto whom of the own accord he returned directly after the had drunke. For his brave exploits atchieued both in Africke then, and also in Germanie8 afore time he received the honour of tryumphall Ornaments and a triple Sacerdo∣tall dignitie; being admitted among the Sacris facin du, or Sybillinis libris ispiciundis i▪ to ouersee sa∣crifices and di∣vine seruice or to peruse the propheticall books of Sibyl∣la. They were in number 15. Quindecimvirs; into the guild and confraternitie of the (a) Tity: and the Colledge or societie of the Priests (b) Au∣gustaes. And from that time unto the midst well neere of NEROES Empire, he li∣ved for the most part private in some retiring place out of the way: yet so as he ne∣ver went forth any iourney, (were it but for exercise by way of Carying in a light litter or chaire. Gestation) but he tooke forth with him in a wagon going hard by, to the valew of a millian of Se∣sterces in gold untill such time, as making his abode in a towne called Fundi, the Regencie of a province in Spaine named Tarraconensis, was offered unto him. And it fortuned, that when he was newly arriued and entred into that province, as hee sacrificed within a publike temple, a boy among other Ministers holding the Incence Panne Cen ser, sodainely had all the haire of his head turned gray. Now there wanted not some who made this interpretation, That thereby was signified a change in the states; and that an old man should succeede a younge, even himselfe in NEROES steed. And not long after, there fell a Or dint of lightening. Thuntherbolt into a L. cum. al. Locum i, a groue. lake of Cantabria: and found there were immediatly twelue axes: a doubtlesse tooken presaging Soveraine Rule. 9 For 8 yeares space he governed that prouince variably and with an vneven hand. At the first, sharpe he was, severe, violent, and in chasticing verily of tres∣passes beyond all measure extreame. For he caused a Banker, for unfaithfull hand ling and exchang of mony to leese both his hands, and to have them nailed fast unto his owne shop bourd: A Guardian also he crucified, for poysoning his ward, whose heire he was in remainder. Now, as the partie DELINQVENT called for the benefit of law, and avouched in his plea. That he And therfore not to be cruci∣ed. was a Romaine Citizen; GALBA, as if he would alay his punishment with some Solatio & ho. nore, or com∣fortable honor. Hen dia duo, comfort and honour: commanded the crosse already made to be changed, and another to be reared far higher then the ordinarie: and the same laid ouer with a white colour. By little and little he grew to be slouthfull, carelesse and Idle because he would minister no matter unto NERO for to worke uppon: and for that (as himselfe was wont to
say) No man was compelled to render an accompt of his owne Idlenesse. As hee held the Iudiciall Assises at new Carthage, he had intelligence that France Gaule was in a tu∣mult.* For, they bee string spirits, that are looked into in a State. And whiles the Or Lieutent Embassadour of Aquitaine besought him earnestly to send aide, the letters of VINDEX came in the very nicke: exhorting him to frame and carie himselfe as the deliverer and protectour of Mankinde, even to take uponA, V, C.  him to be their generall Captaine. He, making no longer stay upon the point, ac∣cepted the offer, partly for feare and in part upon hope. For he had both found out the warrants of NERO sent privily unto his Agents and procuratours there, as touching his death▪ and also much confirmed and strengthened he was, as well by most luckie Auspices and Osses, as by the prophesie of an honest Virgin: so much the rather, because the very same verses containing the prophesie, the priest of IVPITER at Clunia, had two hundred yeares past (by warning and direction given him in a dreame) fetched out of an inward and secret vault of the Temple, de∣livered them likewise by a maiden which had the spirit of prophesie. The meaning and effect of which verses was, That one day there should arise out of Spaine the so∣veraigne Prince, and Lord of the whole world.10 Therefore, when he had mounted the Tribunall, as if hee intended then the Enfraunckes sing. manumising of slaues, and set before him in open sight very many pourtraicts and Images of such as had beene condemned and killed by NERO: whiles their stood also in his presence a Some noble mans sonne of Rome boy of noble bloud, whom he had sent for of pur∣pose out of one of the Baleare Ilands hard by, where he was By Nero. exiled: he bewailed the state of those times. Wherupon being with one accord saluted or L. General Emperour, yet he professed himselfe to be the Lieutenant onely of the Senate & people of Rome. After this, having proclaimed a Cessation of Iudicial pleas for the time; out of the Commons verily of that Province, he enrolled both Legions and Auxiliaries, over and above the old armie, which contained on Legion, two cornets of horsemen, & three cohorts: but out of the better sort, to wit, the Nobility and Gentrie; such I meane as for wisdom & age wēt before the rest, he ordained a body of a Senat: un to whom men shold have recourse touching matters of greater importāce, as need required He chose forth also young gentlemen, for the knights degree, who conti nuing stil the wearing of (gold) Rings shold be calledAs if they had serued their full time, and were now called forth a gaie by way o bor our Evocati, & kept watch and ward insteede of (sworne) Wh vsally were rings of yron. Soldiers about his lodging and bedchamber. Hee sent out his Edicts also in every Province, counselling and perswading all and some to ioyne with him in these designements: and (proportionally to the meanes that every one had) to helpe and promote the common cause. Much about the same time, in the fortification of a towne which he had chosen to be the Capitall seate of the warre, a Ring was found of Antique worke, in the Gemm or stone whereof was engrauen the expresse resemblance of (a) victorie together with a (b) Trophee: And soone after, a ship of ALEXANDREA fraight with armour, arrived Dertosam appu lit: al. Decursa appul , i hulled down the tide: cras the wind did driue it before Dertosa, without pilot, without mariner or passenger: that noe man might make any doubt, but that this warre was just, lawfull, and undertaken with the favour and approbation of the Gods. But lo, sodainely and unlooked for, all in manner was dasnt and put out of frame. One of the two Cornets of horse∣men above mentioned; as bethinking themselues and repenting that they had changed their military oth was at the point to fall away and forsake him as hee approched the Campe, yea and hardly kept in their alleageance to him: Certaine slaues also, whom (being prepared a forehand to doe him a mischiefe) hee had
received as a present at the hands of a freed man of NERORS, missed but little of killing him, as he passed through a crosse lane to the Baines for to bath. And surely done the deed they had, but that as they exhorted and incouraged one another not to Omitterent or,  i to loose. overslip the opportunitie presented they were over hearde: who beeing examined and asked, upon what occasion they spake such words? were by torture forced to confesse the truth. 11 Besides these daungers so great, there fel out (to helpe the matter well) the death of VINDEX. wherewith being most of all amased, and like to a man utterly for∣lorne, he went within a little of renouncing this world and forgoing his owne life. But by occasion of messengers comming with newes from the Citty in the verie instant, no sooner understood he that NERO was slaine, and all men in general had swome alleageance unto him, but he laide away the name of Lieutenant and tooke upon him the stile of CAESAR. So, he put himselfe on his Iourney clad in his Coatearmour, with his dagger hanging downe from about his necke iust before his breast▪ neither tooke he to the use of a gown and long robe againe, before they were surprised and suppressed, who made insurrections and rose up in armes against Notwithstād∣ing that vpon the death of Nero, he was declared Em∣perour at Rome. him: namely, at Rome NYMPHIDIVS SABINVS Capitaine of the Praetorian guard: in Germanie FONTEIVS CAPITO & in Africke CLODIVS MACER, ij: Lieutenants. 12 There had a rumour beene raised before of his crueltie and covetousnesse both: for punishing the Citties of Spaine which were somewhat slacke in comming to side with him, by saying very heavy tributes and taxes upon them: some of them also by dismanteling and rasing their wals: likewise for putting to death certaine Presidents and Procuratours together with there wives and children: as also for melting a Coronet of gold weighing 15. pound: which the men of Tarracon from out of the old Temple of IVPITER had presented unto him: and commaun∣ding that the three ounces which wanted of the full weight should be exacted and made good. This report was both confirmed and also increased uppon his first en∣trance into Rome. For when he would haue compelled the servitours at Sea (whom* Either by wast in melting or by the craf∣ty conueiance of the gold founder. NERO had made of mariners and oaremen, full and lawfull souldiers) to returne againe to their former state and condition: when they made refusall, and besides called malapertly for their Aegle and other militarie ensignes: hee not onely sent in, among them a troupe of horsemen and so trode them under foote; but also ex∣ecuted with death euery tenth man of them. Semblably, the Cohort of Germaines which in times past had beene by the CAESARS ordained for the guard of their persons, and by many good proofes were found most trustie, hee dissolved: and without any availes and recompence for their service sent them home againe into their Country: pretending that they stood better affected unto CN. DOLAEEL∣LA (nee unto whose Horthyards and gardens they quartered) than to him. Moreover, these reports also (whether truely or falsely I wote not) went commonly of him by way of mockerie. That when there was a more plentifull supper than usual served up before him, he gaue a great grone thereat. His Steward verily in Ordinaris Dipensatori or this one Ordi∣naris his ste∣ward. ordinary cast up his bookes and rendred unto him a breviary of all reckonings, and accoumpts. For his great care and serviceable diligence, hee reached unto him a dish of As of peasen or beanes &c. pulse. But when CAIVS the minstrill played upon the Hautbois
the Hautbois and pleased him wonderous well, hee bestowed liberally upon him* Or pence, 3 S. id, ob, Eng∣lish. for his labour five good Deniers, and those he drew with his owne hand out of his privie purse. At his first comming therefore, he was not so welcome. And that appeared at13 the next solemnitie of publick Shewes. For when as in the Atellane Comaedies, some had begun a most vulgar Canticle with this verse, St: Venit Io Simus a villa, &c.* Husht or whist, an In∣teriection of silence. See Turh Advers: 5, cap,  St: See; Our SIMUS that Country clowne Is from his Ferme now come to towne. The Spectatours all at once with one accord and voice, sung out the rest in man∣ner of a respond: and repeating withall the said verse oft, as the fore-burden of the Song, acted (and with gesture) noted him. 14 Thus verily with farre greater favour and aucthoritie obtained hee the Empire than menaged it when he was therein; notwithstanding, hee gave many proofes of an excellent Prince: But nothing so acceptable were his good Acts, as those were odious and displeasant wherein he faulted and did amisse. Ruled he was ac∣cording to the will and pleasure of three persons: whom dwelling as they did to∣gether and that within the Palatium, (readie evermore at his elbow and in his eare) men commonly called his Paedagogues. These were, TITUS Or Vini. IUNIUS, his Lieu∣tenant in Spaine; a man infinitely covetous: CORNELIUS LACO, who being of his Counsell and assistance was advanced by him to be Capitaine of the guard; one for his arrogancie and Scordia, or sottishnes. luskishnesse Intollerable: and a freed man of his, ICELUS; who but a little before, being honoured with the Knighthood. golden ring, and endowed with the surname MARTIANUS, looked now for to bee the Provost and Captaine of the Pretorian Gentlemen and Knights Degree. Vnto these men, I say, playing their parts and committing outrages correspondent to their vices in* Summa aeq stris gradus, or summi equest ordinis. divers kinds, hee yeelded and wholly gave himselfe to be abused so much, as that scarcely he was like himselfe, but alwaies variable: one while precise and neere, o∣therwhiles as remisse and carelesse; more, ywis, than became a Prince elected, and a man of those 73 yeeres. Some honourable persons of Gentlemen and Senatours. both degrees he condem∣ned upon the least suspition, before their cause was heard. The Freedome of Rome Citie he seldome graunted to any. The priviledge and Immunitie due to those who had three children, hee gave to one or two at most with much a-doe: nor to them verily, but for a certaine time limitted and set downe. The Iudges making suite for to have a sixth Decurie adioyned unto them, he not onely denied flatly, but also this benefite of vacation graunted unto them by CLAUDIUS. That they should not be called forth to sit in the Winter (a) season, and at the beginning of the yeere, he tooke from them. 15 It was thought also, that hee purposed to determine and limit the Offices be∣longing to Senatours and Gentlemen, within the compasse of two yeeres: and not to bestow the same but upon such as were unwilling and refused to take them. The Liberalities and bountifull Which a∣mounted ac∣cording to Tacitus into bis & vicies millies 2200 millians. Donations of NERO, hee tooke order by a Commission directed unto Tacitus saith 30. fiftie Gentlemen of Rome, for to bee revo∣ked: yea, and the same to bee exacted for his behoofe, allowing out
thereof not above the tenth part: with this straight condition moreover, That if Actours upon the Stage, o Wrestlers and Champions otherwise, had sold any such do∣nation given unto them aforetime, the same should be taken from the Buiers, since that the parties who had sold the same had spent the money, and were not sufficient to re∣pay it. Contrariwise, there was not any thing, but by the meanes of his follo∣wers, Favorites and freed men, hee suffred either to bee purchased for money, or graunted freely for favour: as for example, Customes, posts, Immunities, Punish∣ments of the Innocent, and Impunitie of Malefactours. Moreover, when as the people of Rome called upon him for Iustice, & namely to have HALOTUS and TIGEL∣LINUS executed, the onely men of all the bloud-hounds and instruments of N∣RO that wrought most mischiefe, he saved them from daunger: and besides, ad∣vaunced HALOTUS to a most honourable Procuratorship: and in the behalfe of TIGELLINUS rebuked the people by an Edict for their crueltie unto him. 16 Having heereby given offence andPropé uni∣versis ordibus nsis. discontentment, to the States and Degrees in manner all, yet he incurred the displeasure and ill will most of the Souldiours. For, when his Provosts had promised and pronounced unto them, (what time they sware alleageance unto him), a greater Donative than usually had beene gi∣ven, hee would not make good and ratifie the same; but eft-soones gave it out, That his manner had ever beene to choose and not buy his Souldiours. And as, upon that occasion verily hee angered all his Souldiours wheresoever: so, the Pretori∣ans and those of his guard he provoked moreover with feare, and netled with of∣fring them indignities; namely, by removing and displacing most of them one after another, as suspected persons, and the adhaerents of NYMPHIDIUS. But the forces of higher Germanie grumbled and fumed most of all, for being defrau∣ded of their rewards for service performed against the French and Vindex. They were the first therefore that durst breake out into open disobedience: and upon the Newyeeres day refused to take an oath and binde themselves in alleageance unto any other than the Senate of Rome. They intended also to dispatch forthwith an Embassie unto the Pretorian guard, with these advertisements and messages from them, Namely, That they were displeased with an Emperour made in Spaine: and therefore themselves should elect one, whom all the Armies in Generall might allow and approve. 17 No sooner heard he this newes, but supposing that hee was become contemp∣tible, not so much for his olde age, as his childlesse estate; hee presently out of the thick throng and middle multitude that came to salute him, caught hold of PISO FRUGI LICINIANUS, a noble young Gentleman and of excellent parts; one whom in times past he had made right great account of, and Semper, or super, besides. alwaies in his will remembred as Inheritour to succeede in his goods and name: Him he now called Sonne, him he presented unto the Pretorian Campe; and there before a publick assembly, adopted. But of the fore-saide Donative not a word all this while, no not at that very time. Whereby he ministred unto M. SALVIUS OTO better occasion and readier meanes to accomplish his enterprises within sixe daies after this Adoption.
18 Manie prodigious sights and those presented continuallie even from the verie first beginning, had portended unto him such an end as ensued. When all the way as hee iourneyed, beasts were sacrificed to doe him honour in eve∣rie towne on both sides, it chaunced that a Bull astonied with the stroke of the Butchers axe, brake the bond wherewith hee stoode tied and ran full upon his Chariot; and rising up with his (fore) feete, all to be sprinct and denched it with bloud. As he alight out of it, one of the guard and Pensioners about him, with the thrusting of the throng had like with his speare to have wounded him. As he entred also the Citie of Rome and so passed forward up to the Platium; hee was welcomed with an Earthquake, and a certaine noise resembling the lowing of a beast. But there followed after these, greater Prodigies still and more fearefull. He had selected and layed by it selfe out of all his Treasure, a iewell set thick with pearle and pretious stones, for to beautifie and adorne his Goddesse Fortune at Tusculum. This Iewell (as if it had beene worthy of a more stately and sacred place), all of a suddaine hee dedicated to VENUS in the Capitoll, and the next night following he dreamt, that he saw Fortune making her moane and complai∣ning, how shee was defrauded of the gift intended and meant unto her: threat∣ning withall, that shee her selfe also would take away what shee had given him. Now, being affighted with this vision, when in great hast hee was gone apace to Tusculum, and had by breake of day sent certaine before of purpose to provide an expiatorie To avert the harme prog nosticated thereby. sacrifice for this dreame, he found nothing there but warme embers upon the altar herth, and an olde man all in Like a mo∣ner. blacke sitting hard by, * holding in a dish of Ominous to∣kens presagig haply his b∣tle state. glasse, Frankincense, and in an earthen cup, wine. Observed also it was, that upon the Kalends of Ianuarie while hee sacrificed, his coonet sell from his head: As he tooke his Auspices, the pullets flew away. And upon the Solemne day of the fore-said Adoption, when hee should make a Speech unto the Souldi∣ours, the Or chaire of Estate. Camp-Throne stoode not, (as the manner was) before his Tribunall; (such was the forgetfulnesse of his Ministers) and in the Senate, his Curule chaire was placed wrong, with the back toward him. 19 But before he was slaine, as he sacrificed that morning, the Southsayer often∣times warned him to beware of daunger: For murderers were not farre off. And not long after hee tooke knowledge that OTHO was possessed of the Praeterian. Campe. And when most of those about his person perswaded him still to make what speed hee could and goe forward thither (for why? by his authority and presence hee might beare sway and prevaile) hee resolved to doe no more but keepe close with∣in house: to stand upon his guard, and to fortifie himselfe with the strength of his legionarie Souldiours, in many and divers places quartered. Howbeit, hee put* . on a good linnen (a) Iack: although hee seemed to acknowledge, that in small steed it would stand him, against so many sword-points. But being borne in hand & seduced with rumours which the Conspiratours had of purpose spread abroad to traine him out into the open street: whiles some few rashly affirmed, That all was dispatched; The rebels & seditious persons defaited: and the rest cōming in great fre∣quencie with ioy & gratulation, ready to do him all the obsequions service they could:
Hee to meete them went forth; and that with so great confidence as that unto a Souldiour who made his boast, He had slaine OTHO, hee answered, And by whose warrant? This advaunced he as farre as into the Market-place. There, the Horse∣men having commission and commaundement to kill him: When they had voi∣ded the common people out of the way, and put their horses forward through the Streetes, and espied him aarre off, staied a while: but afterwards, setting spurtes to againe, fell upon him and slew him outright, forsaken as he was of all his traine and followers. 20 There be that report, How at the first uprore, hee cried aloud: What meane yee my fellow Souldiours? I am yours, and yee are mine: and withall promised (to pay) the Donative: But, many moe have left in writing, that of himselfe he offred them his throat, and willed them (since they thought so good) to mind that onely which they came for, even to strike and spare not. A strange and wonderfull thing it was, that of those who were there present not one went about to helpe their Emperour: and all that were sent for, reiected the messenger, saving onely a guidon of Ger∣mane Horsemen. These in regard of his fresh demerite (in that hee had tenderly cherished and made much of them being sicke and feeble) hastned to the rescue: Howbeit they came too late, by occasion, that beeing ignorant of the streetes and places they tooke a wrong way and were hindered. Killed hee was at the The place. wheresomtime that lake was. Lake Curtius, and there left lying even as hee was; untill such time as a common Soul∣diour as he returned from foraging and providing of corne, threw downe his load and cut his headoff. Now, because hee could not catch hold of the haire of his head (so bald hee was) hee hid it in his lap: and anone thrust his thumbe into his mouth and so brought it to OTHO: who gave it to the Or water▪ bearers and wood purveiers for the Souldi∣ours.

At their hands, a freed man of PATROBIUS NERONIANUS, bought the same for one hundred (a) peeces of gold and flung it into that very (b) place, where, be∣fore time his Patrobius. Patron by the commaundement of GALBA, had beene executed. At length (late though it was) his Steward ARGIUS buried both it and the trunk of his body within his owne private Hortyards in the way Aurelia. 21 Of full stature he was: his head bald: his eyes gray, and his nose hooked: his hands and feete by reason of the gout growne exceeding crooked; in so much as uneth he was able either to abide shooes on the one, or to turne over, or so much as hold his bookes with the other. There was an Or bunch. excrescence also of flesh in the right side of his body; and the same hung downward so much, as hardly it could be tied up with a Or swathing band. trusse. 22 A great feeder and meate-man by report, he was. For in Winter time hee used to eate before day light: and at supper to bee served so plentifully, that the re∣liques and reversion of the bourd being gathered together into heapes, hee com∣manded
to be caried round about and distributed among those that stoode wai∣ting at his feete.

It was reported that in Spaine when ICELUS one of his olde Catamites brought him word of NEROES end, he not onely received him in open sight with most kinde kisses, but intreated him without delay to be Made smooth plucked, and so led him at one side out of the way. 23 He died in the 73 yeere of his age, and seventh moneth of his Empire. The Senate as soone as lawfully they might, had decreed for him a Statue standing up∣on a Columne adorned Rostr with the Stemmes and beake-heads of ships, in that part of the Mercate-steed of Rome where hee lost his life: But VESPASIAN repealed that Decree: as being thus conceited of him, That he had suborned and sent under hand out of Spaine into Iurie, certaine of purpose to murder him.
THE HISTORIE OF Marcus Salvius Otho, vvrit∣ten by Caius Suetonius Tran∣quillus. THE Auncestors of OTHO had their beginning in a townChap. 1 called Ferentinum; extract out of an auncient and honou∣rable family, even from the Princes of Hetruria. His grand∣father M. SALVIUS OTHO having for his Father a Gen∣tleman of Rome, and for his mother a woman of base con∣dition (and whether shee was free-borne or no? it is uncer∣taine) through the favour of LIVIA AUGUSTA, in whose house he had his rising and growth, was made a Senatour, and exceeded not the degree of a Pretour. His Father, L. OTHO by his mothers side of right noble bloud descended, and thereby allied to many great kinreds, was so deere and in face so like unto TIBERIUS the Emperour, that most men beleeved verily, hee was his owne sonne. The Honourable Offices within the Citie: the Pro∣consulship of Asia, and other extraordinarie places of Conduct and Com∣maund,
hee managed most severely. Hee adventured also in Illyricum to pro ceed so far, as to put certaine soldiers to death, for that in the commotion of CA∣MILLVS upon a touch of conscience they had killed theirOr his. i. Ca∣, Captaines and pro∣vosts, as authors of the revolt and rebellion against CLAVDIVS, and verily this execution himselfe in person saw performed in the Campe (a) even before the Prin cipia: notwithstanding that he knew they were for that service advanced to higher places by CLAVDIVS. By which act of his as he grew in glory so hee decreased in favour. And yet the same he soone recovered againe, by detecting the perfidious plot of a Romaine Knight, whom by the appeachment of his own servants he found to have attempted the death of CLAVDIVS. For, both the Senate endowed him with an honour most rare and seldome seene, to wit his owne statue erected in the Palatium; and also CLAVDIVS when he ranged him among the Patritians, and in most honourable tearmes praised him added these words withall, Hee is a man, than whom I would not wish I assure you to haue better Children of mine owne. Of ALBIA TERENTIA a right noble and gallant Lady he begat two sonnes, LV∣CIVS TITIANVS, and a younger forenamed MARCVS, and carying the sur∣name. i. Otho. of his father: a daughter also hee had by her, whom as yet not mariageable, he affianced unto DRVSVS the sonne of GERMANICVS. 2 This OTHO the Emperour, was borne the 4 day before the Kalends of May,* 28 Aprill. when CAMILLVS ARRVNTIVS and DOMITIVS AENOBAREVS were Con∣suls.A, V, C, 785 From the very prime of his youth, hee was roiotous, wild and wanton: in so much as his father swindged him well and soundly for it: reported also to use night walking; and as he met any one either feeble or cupshorten or overcome with drinke to catch hold of him, lay him upon a soldiers gaberdine, and so (b) to tosse and hoist him up into the aire. Afterwardes, uppon his fathers death, a cer∣taine Libertine woman of the Court, a dame very gratious (because hee would make the more benefit by following and courting her as his mistrisse) he pretended love unto: albeit an old trot shee was in manner doting for age. By her meanes winding himselfe into the favour of NERO, he easily obtained the cheife place a∣mong his minions and favorites (such was the congruence of their humours and dispositions) and as some write by mutuall abusing also of one anothers bodie against kind. But so mightie hee waxed and bare such a side, as that in considera∣tion of a great peece of money agreed upon, he presumed to bring into the Senate house for to giveFor pardon thankes, a man of Consular degree, who stood condemned for extortion, even before hee had fully obtained hisRestoring to hs former state. restitution. 3 Being now, as he was, privie and partie to all the counsels and secret dessignes of NERO: he to auert all manner of suspicion, that very day which NERO had appointed for the murdering of his mother, entertained them both at supper with∣most exquisite, and the kindest welcome that might be. Semblably, Dame POP∣PAEA SABINA, being as yet but the paramour of NERO, whom he had newly ta∣ken from herRufus Crispus husband, and committed in the meanevntill he could put awaie Octa∣uia while unto himselfe upon trust for to keepe, under aSo writeth Putarch But Tacitus diffe∣reth from this Narration. colour of mariage hee received: And not content herewith that he alienated her hart from NERO and used her body, hee loved her so entirely, that he could not endure NERO himselfe to be hisPartner with him in loue of that Mistris Corrivall. Certes, it is thought of a truth, that not onely the messengers who were sent to fetch her,
came againe without her: but also that one time he kept NERO himselfe without dores standing there and cooling his heeles, with threates also and prayers inter∣mingled, demanding hispledge or gage, to wit Poppaea. pawne which hee had left with him, but all in vaine. Whereupon after the said mariage broken and dissolved, sent out of the way hee was under a pretence of an Embassage into Portugal: Which course was thought sufficient for feare least his proceeding to any sharper punishment might have toldHow Nero had beene ex∣cluded & shut out of doores &c. tales abroad and marred all the play: howbeit as secretly conueied as it was, out it came and was made knowne by this Distichon. Cur Otho mentito sit quaeritis exul honore? Vxoris Moechus coeper at esse suae. Exil'd in shew of Embassage was OTHO. Aske yee, why? With his owne wife begon he had to act (a) adulterie. Having beene afore time in no higher place then Questour, yet governed hee a province for the space of x yeeres with singularij. Verses. moderation andWithout rigour abstinence. 4 As occasion at lenght and opportunitie ofWithout pil∣ling, pollmg & extorton. revenge was offred, he was the first that combined with GALBA in his attempts. At which very instāt himself also conceived hope of the Empite & great the same was, no doubt; considering theA. V, C. 821 condition and state of those times, but greater somewhat by reason of SELEVCVS* Of Nero. the Astrologers words: who having long before warranted him that he should sur: vive NERO, was then of his owne accord come unlooked for & promised againe that shortly also he should be Emperour. Omitting therfore no kind of obsequious office & ambitious popularity even to the very meanest: looke how often he invited theGalba. Emperour to supper, he wold deale throughout the Cohort that thē warded, to every man a peece of15, S. 7. D, ob, English, gold: & no lesse carefull was he to oblige unto him one way or other, the rest of the soldiers. And when one of them went to law with his neigh bour abovt a parcell of ground in the skirts and confines of both their lands, he be∣ing chosen Arbitratour, bought the whole land for the said souldier and enfeoffed him in it. So as now by this time there was scarce one, but both thought and said that he alone was worthy to succeede in the Empire. 5 Moreover he had fed himselfe with hopes to have been adopted by GALBA & that looked hee for daily: But after that PISO was preserred and himselfe dis∣appointed of his hope, he turned to plaine violence: pricked therto, over and besides the discontentment of his mind, by occasion that he was so deepely indebted. For he stucke not to professe. He was not able to stand, unlesse he were Emperour: And it skilled not whether he were over throwne by his enemie in the field, or fell under his creditours hands at the Barre. Some few daies before, he had fetcht over one of CAESARS servants in a millene of Sesterces for the obtaining of a Stewardship: & with the helpe of this sum of mony, enterprised he so great a proiect. At the first he cō∣mitted the matter to 5.Speculat oribus souldiers emploied in Espiall: then to x. others whom they had brought forth with them, to wit every man twaine. To ech one of these he payd in hand. x thousand100, Aurei: e∣very Aureus being 15, S. 7, D, ob▪ sesterces, & promised 50000 more. By these were the rest solici ted, & those not very many: as making no doubt but presuming confidently of this that a number besides would be ready in the very action to second it. 6 He had minded once, presently after the adoption (of PISO) to seize their campe into his owne hands, and so to set uppon GALBA as hee sat at supper in the Pallace: but the respective regarde hee had of the Cohort, which then kept watch and warde, hee checked this intent of his: for feare least the same
should incurre the into lerable hatred of the world: considering, by the guard of that very Cohort, CAIVS had beene slaine before, and NERO perfidiouslie betrayed afterwards. Moreouer, exception was taken against the middle time betweene, partly vpon, aScrupulosity. superstition that hee had, and in part by direction from SELEVCVS. Well then, vpon a15 lanurij day appointed, after warning giuen a∣forehand unto those that were privie to the conspiracie, for to attend him in the market place at the golden (a) Milliarium under the Temple of Saturne, hee faluted GALBA in the morning, and (as the manner was) beeing received with a kisse, was present also as hee sacrificed and heard the Soothsayers predcti∣ons. Which done, a freed man of his brought him word that the Architects were come (this was the watchword agreed upō between thē) wherupō as if forsooth he were to look upon an house that was to be sold, he departed, gat him quickly away through the backe side of the Palace, and hied a pace toward the place appointed. Others say, that he seigned himselfe to have an ague, and willed those that stood next to him to make that excuse in case he were asked for. Then lying hidden with∣in a womansCrecse chaire, wherein women vse to be carried. Licter, he hastened to the Campe: and for that the Licter bearers were tired and faint, hee allighted on the ground and be ganne to runne a foote: but by occasion that his shooes latchet was slacke, he stayed behinde, untill such time as without any further delay, he was taken up on mens shoulders, and by the raine and Company there ptesent saluted Emperour; and so with lucky acclamaA, V, C. 822. tions among drawen swords, came as farre as to theA principall place within the Camp. Principia whiles every one all the way hee went adhaered unto him, as if they had beene all privie and party in the conspiracy. There, after he had dispatched certaine away to kill both GALBA and PISO, he to win the soldiers hearts by faire promises, protested be∣fore them all assembled together, That himselfe would haue and hold no more, then iust that which they would leaue for him. 7 This done, as the day drewe toward euening he entred into the Senate: and briefely laying before them a reason of his proceeding, as if he had been caried away perforce out of the market place and compelled to take the Empire upon him (which he would administer according to the generall will and pleasure of thē al), to the pallace he goeth. Now when as beside other sweet & plausible words deliuered by such as did congratulate and flatter him, he was by the base cōmon people called NERO, he gaue no token at al that he refused it▪ nay rather as some haue reported, euer in his patents, graunts and missives which he first wrote unto certaine presidents & gouernours of Prouinces, he added unto his stile the surname of NERO. This is certen, he both suffered hisWhich either were of wax, or peincted images andCommonly of brasse stone or such solid matter. Statues to be erected againe in their own places: & also restored his Procura∣tours & freed men to the same offices that they had enioyed before. Neither, by his imperiall prerogatiue and absolute power subscribed he any, thing, before a warrant for fiftiequingenties Hs or Sesterti∣um millians of Sesterces to the finishing of (NEROES) golden house. It is said that the same night being affrighted in his sleepe hee groned very sore, and was by his seruitours that ran thick into the chamber found lying on the bare floore before his bed: also that he assaied by all kind of propitiato∣rie sacrifices and peace offrings to appease theOr Ghost. spirit of GALBA, whome hee had seene in his sleepe, to thrust and drive him foorth: Semblably, the morrow after as he was taking hisby observing the sacred Birds: Auspices, there arose a sodaine tempest wherevpon

For, how can (a) I (whose blast is short) With these long hautboies fitly sort? 8 And verily about the same time, the forces and Armies in (a) Germanie had sworne fealtie and alleageance unto VITELLIVS, which when he understood, hee pro∣pounded unto the Senate, That an Embassage might be sent thither, to  thē that there was an Emperour chosen alreadie, and advise them with all to peace and con cord: yet, by enter course of messengers and letters between, he made offer unto VITEL LIVS to pertake equally with him in the Empire, and accept of a marriage with his daughter: But when there was no way but one and that by open warre: seeing that now alreadie the Capitaines and forces which VITELLIVS had sent before, ap∣proched hee had good proofe what loyall and faithfull harts, the pretorian souldi∣ers caried towards him, even to the utter ruine and destruction well neere of the most honourable degree of Senatours.

For not onely in the beast killed for sacrifice unto FatherOr Mars. DIS, he found the Inwards propitious (whereas in such a sacrifice as that the contrarie* Gall. * The infernall God o named guasi dires ∣rich as Pluto, of Ploutoe riches because all things arise out of the earth and fall into it againe. had beene more acceptable) but also as his first setting out, staied he was by the inundation, and swelling of the riuer Tiberis. At the twentie miles ende likewise, he found the high way choaked and stopped up against him with the ruines of certaine houses fallen downe. 9 With like inconsiderate rashnes, albeit no man doubted but that in good pollicy, the warre ought to have been protracted, because the enimie was distressed as wel with famine, as the streight wherein he was pent, yet resolved hee with all speed, to hazard the fortune of the field and to trie it out by fight; as one, either impatiēt of longer thought and pensivenesse hoping that before the comming of VITEL∣LIVS most part of the businesse, might be dispatched, or else because hee could not rule his souldiers calling so hotely upon him to give battaile. Yet was not he present in that conflict but staied behind at Bryxellum. And verily in three several,

(a place so called) he wan the victorie: but in the last battaile of all, (which was the greatest) he lost the day, and was by a treacherous practise van∣quished. namely, when upon hope of a parly pretended, as if the soldiers had been brought out of the Campe to treat of conditions of peace: sodainely and unloo∣ked for, even as theyBy the rame of Commilito∣nes: inpsa con∣.

And straight wayes in a melancholy, he conceived a resolution to make him selfe away (as many are of opinion and not without cause) rather for shame, that he would not be thought to persevere in the maintenance of his soveraine domini∣on with so great jeopardie of the State and losse of men, than upon any dispaire or distrust of his forces. For still there remained a puissant armie whole and entier, which he had detained with him for tryall of better fortune: and another poure was comming out of Dalmatia, Pannonia and Maesia. Neither verily were they dis∣comfited so much daunted and deiected, but that, for to be revenged of this dis∣grace and shamefull foile, ready they were of themselues, and alone without helpe of others, to undergoe, any hard adventure whatsoever. 10 In this warre served mine own father SVETONIVS LENIS, in qualitie of a Tri∣bune of the thirteenth Legion, and by degree a SenatourOr Colonel, of the seconde rancke. He was wont afterwards very often to report that OTHO even when hee lived a* Angusticla∣vius. private person, detested all civile warres so farre foorth, that as one related at the table the ende of CASSIVS and BRVTVS, he fell a quaking and trembliing ther at. Also, that he never would have beene GALBAES concurrent, but that he con∣fidently thought, the quarrell might have ended without warre. Well then, upon a new accident incited he was to the contempt of this present life, even by the ex∣ample of a common and ordinary souldier: who reporting this overthrowe of the armie, when he could of no man have credite, but was charged one while with the lie, another while for his feare and cowardise (as who was run away out of the bat taile) fell upon his owne sword at OTHOES feete. At which sight, hee cryed out a∣lowd and said, That he would no more cast so braue men and of so good desert into danger. Having exhorted therefore his owne brother, his brothers sonne & every one of his freinds severally, to make what shift they could for themselues, after hee had embraced & kissed them ech one, he sent them all away: And retyring himselfe into a secret rowm, two letters he wrot ful of consolation nto his sister, as also to MESSALLINA,  widow, whom he had purposed to wed, recōmending the reliques of his bodie and his memoriall. And looke what Epistles soever hee had in his custody, he burnt them al, because they should breed no man any danger losse, or displeasure with the conquerour. And out of that store of teasure which hee had about him, he dealt monie to his domestical sewitours. 11 Being now thus prepared and fully bent to die, perceiving by occasion of some hurliburly, which while he made delay, arose, thati. The Sena∣tours. those who began to slip away & depart, were (by his ) ebuked as traytors & perforce detained. Let vs quoth he, prolong our life yet this one night: Vpon which words and no more, hee char∣ged that no violence should be offred to any; but suffering his bed chamber (doore) to stand wide opē until it was late in the , he permitted al that wold to have accesse unto him. After this, having allayed his thirst with a draught of cold water he caught up twoOr rapier daggers, & when he had tryed how sharpe the points of them both were, and layed one of them vnder hisOr beds head pillow; & so the dores being fast shut
he tooke his rest and slept most soundly. Wakening then at last about day light and not before, with one onely thrust under his left pap he stabbed himselfe. And whē at the first grone that he gave, his seruants brake in, hee one while concealing and another while discovering the wound, yeelded up his vitall breath, andFor feare his head should be severed from hs bo ie &c. quicklye (according as he had given charge before) was brought to his funerall fire: in the yeere of his age 38. and the 95 day of his Empire. 12 Vnto so great a mind & generous courage of OTHO, neither was his perfōA, V, C, 822. nor habite answerable: For he was by report of a meane and low stature: feeble feet he had besides, and as crooked shanks. As for his manner of attire, as fine and nice he was well neere as any woman: his bodie plucked and made smooth: wearing by reason of thin haire aOr counter∣feit cap of false haire. perrucke, so fitted and fastened to his head, that no man there was, but would haue taken it for his owne. Nay his very face he was wont euery day to shave and besineere all ouer with (a) soked bread. Which devise he tooke to at first, when the downe began to bud forth, because he would neuer haue a beard. It is said moreouer, that many a time hee open lie celebrated the divine seruice and sacred rites of ISIS, in a religious vestiment of linnen. VVhereby, I would thinke it came to passe, that his death nothing at all consonant to his life was the more wondered at. Manie of his souldiers who were present about him, when with plentifull teares they had kissed his hands and feete dead as he lay; and cōmended him with all for a most valiant man, and the onely Emperour that ever was, presently in the place, and not farre from his funerall fire, killed themselues. Many of them also, who were absent, hearing of the newes of his end, for very greife of heart ran with their weapons one at another to death. Finally most men who in his life time cursed and detested him, now when he was dead highly praised him: so as it came to be a common and rise speech abroad. That GALBA was by him slaine; not so much for that e affected to be Soueraine Ruler as because he desared orestore the Sate of the Republike, and recouer the freedome that was lost.
THE HISTORIE OF Aulus Vitellius, vvritten by Caius Suetonius Tranquillus. AS touching the Originall and beginning of the VITELLII,Chap. 1 some write this, others that; and all as contrary as may be: reporting it partly to be auncient and noble; and in part now start up and obscure, yea and very base and beggerly. Which I would suppose to have hapned by meanes of the flatterers and backbiters both, of VITELLIUS the Emperour: but that I see there is sometime variance and diversity about the very condition of that family. A little booke there is extant of one (a) Q. EULO∣GIUS* Extat Q. E∣logij, &c. his making, written unto Q. VITELLIUS, Questor to AUGUSTUS C∣SAR of sacred memorie: wherein is contained thus much, That the Vitellij descen∣ded from FAUNUS K. of th Aborigines and Lady VITELLIA (who in many places
was worshipped for a Goddesse) raigned over all Latium: That the of-spring remaining of them, remooved out of the Sabines Country to Rome, and were taken into the ranke of the Patritij: That many monuments giving testimonte of this race, continued a long time, to wit, the highOr causey. way VITELLIA reaching fromAn hill on the other side of Tiberis, ad. oy∣ning to Rome by a bridge.

Contrariwise, more Authors there be, who have left upon record, that their2 Stock-father was a Libertine. CASSIUS SEVERUS, and others as well as hee, doe write That the same man was also a verySutorem vete∣ramentarium.

This dissonance of opinions I leave indifferent for men to beleeve which they will. But, to the purpose; PUELIUS VITELLI∣US borne in Nuceria, (whether he were of that auncient linage, or descended from base parents and Grandfathers) a Romaine Gentleman doubtlesse, and a Procura∣tour under AUGUSTUS of his affaires, left behind him foure sonnes, men of qua∣litie all and right honourable persons; bearing also their FathersWhich as O∣nuphrius sat. was . surname: and distinguished onely by their forenames, AULUS, QUINTUS, PUBLIUS and LUCIUS.

His childhood & flower of youth hee spent at Capreae among the Strumpets and Catamites that TIBERIUS kept there: Himselfe noted alwaies with the surname ofA deuiser of new fashions & formes of fil∣thy vncleannes SPINTRIA, was thought also by suffring the abuse of his owne body to have beene the cause of his fathers ri∣sing and advauncement. 4 All the time also of his age ensuing stained as he was with all manner of re∣proachable villanies, so hee caried a principall sway above others in the Court, growen into familiar acquaintance with CAIUS for his love to chariot running, and with CLAUDIUS for his affection to dice-play: but in greater favour he was a good deale with NERO, both in the selfe same regards afore-said, as also for this especiall demerite, in that being president at the solemnity called Neroneum, when NERO was desirous to strive for the prise among the Harpers & Musicians, but yet durst not promise so to do, (notwithstanding all the people called instantly up∣on him) and thereupon went out of the Theater: hee pretending that hee was sent Embassadour unto him from the people persisting still in their earnest request, had called him back and so brought him in the end to be entreated. 5 Through the favourable indulgence therefore of three Emperours, being ad∣vaunced not onely to right honourable offices of State, but also to as high Sacer∣dotall dignities, he managed after all these the Proconsulate of Africk, & executed the charge of surveying and supravising the publick works: but with mind and re∣putation both, far unlike. For in his Province he demeaned himselfe for two yeeres
together with singular innocencie and integrity; as who after his brother succeeded in his stead, staied there still in quality of his Lieutenant. But in his office within the Citie, he was reported to have secretly stollen away, the oblations, gifts and ornaments of the Temples; to have embecilled and chaunged some of them; yea, and in lieu of gold and silver to have foisted in Tinn and Copper. 6 Hee tooke to wife PETRONIA the daughter of one that had beene Consull, by whom hee had a sonne with one eye named PETRONIANUS, Him being by hisDeceased: mother ordained her heire upon condition that he were freed once out of his fathers power, he manumised in deede: but soone after (as it was thought) killed: having charged him besides with parricidie, and pretending withall, that the poi∣son which was provided to worke that mischiefe; hee upon remorse of conscience had drunke himselfe. After this, bewedded GALERIA FUNDANA, whose father had beene Pretour: and of her body also begat children of both sexes: but the male child had such an impediment of stutting and stammering, that little better he was than dumbe and tonguelesse. By GALBA, sent he was contrary to all expectation into the Low-Countries7 of Germanie: furthered as it is thought by the voice and favour of T. VINIUS a man in those daies most mighty; and unto whom long before, he had been wonne by favourizing theVenetae, which Galba likewise with them fa∣voured. faction (a) unto which they both were equally affected: but that GALBA professed plainly, that none were lesse to be feared than those who thouht of nothing but their victuals onely, and that his greedy appetite and hun∣gry belly might bee satisfied and filled with the plenteous store that the ProvinceA, V, C. 821 did yeeld. So that evident it was to every man, that he chose him in contempt ra∣ther, than upon any speciall grace. This is for certaine knowne, that when he was to goe forth, he wanted provision for his iourney by the way; and for the main∣tenance of his family was driven to those hard shifts and extremities, that muing up his wife and children (whom he left at Rome) in a little upperFor in such, tenants dwelt, whereas the Lord himselfe kept beneath. lodging that heTooke for rear. rented: and let out his owne dwelling house for the rest of the yeere: yea, and tooke from his mothers eare a pearle, which he laid to gage: and all for to defray the charges of that voiage. As for a number verily of his Creditours, who waited for him as ready to stay his passage: and among them, the Sinuessanes and For∣mains, whose publick imposts, tollage, and revenewes he had intercepted and con∣verted to his owne use, he could not be rid of; but by terrifying them with an acti∣on of the case: seruing one of them, and namely a Libertine (who very eagerly de∣maunded a debt) with processe upon an action of batterie, as if he had stricken him with his heele; and would not withdraw the suit before he had extorted from him fiftie thousand Sesterces. In his comming toward the Campe, the armie malici∣ously bent against the Emperour, and ready to intertaine any revolt and chaunge of State, willingly and with open armes received him, as a gift of the Gods pre∣sented unto them from heaven above; the sonne of one thrice Consull; a man in the vigour and strength of his yeeres; of a gentle disposition besides, and of a frank and prodigall heart. Which opinion and perswasion, being of old conceived and settled in mens heads, VITELLIUS had augmented by some fresh proofes lately given of himselfe: kissing all the way as hee went along every meane common Souldiour that hee met: so courteous and affable above all measure, to the very mulitiers and wayfaring passengers, in every Inn and baiting place, that he would
in a morning betimes aske them one by one, whether they had yet broken their fast? and shew unto them even by his belching, that hee had beene at his breakfast already. 8 Now when hee was entred once into the Camp, no suit denied he to any man: nay, of his owne accord hee tooke off their marks of ignominie who stoode in dis∣grace; dispensed with those that were obnoxious to the Lawes for wearing poore and sullied garments; and forgave condemned persons their punishments. Whereupon, before one moneth was fully come and gone, without all respect either of day or time, when the very evening was now shooting in, suddainly by the Souldiours called forth he was out of his bed-chamber: and clad as he was inA, V, C. 822 his domesticall and home apparrell, saluted by the name of Imperator, and caried round about through the most frequented and populousVics, or  of Colo∣nia Agrippina where all this was done, as some write. townes, holding in his hand the naked sword of IULIUS (Dictator) of famous memorie: which beeing taken out of the temple of Mars, was at the first gratulation presented by one unto him. Neither returned he into theThe L. Ge∣nerals lodging. Pretorium, before the dining roome was on a light fire, by occasion of the chimney there, where it first caught. And then ve∣rily, when all besides were amazed and in great perplexity upon this adverse and ominous accident; Be of good cheere, quoth hee, it hath shined faire upon us: and no other speech at all made hee unto his Souldiours: After this, when the ar∣mie also of the higher Province, consented now by this time with the other, (that armiel meane which had revolted before from GALBA & sided with the Senate): the surname of GERMANICUS generallie offred unto him hee gladly accepted; the addition of AUGUSTUS he put off; and the stile of CAESAR hee utterly for ever refused. 9 And soone after, when newes came unto him that GALBA was slaine; having settled the State of Germanie, he divided his forces thus; sending one part thereof Vnder the conduct of Fa∣bius Valens by the Alpes and of Caecina, over the Apennine. before, against OTHO; and minding o leade the rest himselfe. Vnto the ar∣mie which was sent before, there hapned a fortunate and luckie signe: For on the right hand, all on a suddaine flew an Eagle toward them: and when shee had fet∣ched a compasse round about the Standerds and Ensignes, hovered softly before them as they marched on the way. Contrariwise, as himselfe removed and set forward, the Statues on horseback, erected in many places for him, all at once suddainly brake their legges and tumbled downe: and the guirland of Lawrell, which most devoutly he had done about (his head) fell from it into a running ri∣ver. Within a while after, as he sate iudicially upon the Tribunall to minister Iu∣stice atIn Fraunce within the pro∣vince Narbo∣. Vienna, a Cock first settled upon his shoulder, and anone perched upon his very head. Vpon which prodigious sights, ensued an event correspondent thereto. For the Empire which by his Lieutenants was confirmed and establi∣shed unto him, he by himselfe was not able to hold. 10 Of the victorie before BEBRIACUM and the death of OTHG, he heard whiles hee was yet in Gaule: and without delay, whosoever belonged to the Pretorian Cohorts, hee by vertue of one edict cassed and discharged all, for the most daun∣gerous precedent and example that they hadIn betraying Galba thir Soveraigne. given, commaunding them to yeeld up their armour into theOr Tribunes. Marshals hands. As for those hundred & twenty, whose
Supplications exhibited unto OTHO hee had found, such I meane as claimed re∣wards for their good service in killing GALBA, hee gave commaundement they should be sought out and executed every one. A worthy beginning I assure you, and a magnificent: such as might give good hope of an excellent Prince, had hee not menaged all matters else, according to his owne naturall disposition and the course of his former life, rather than respecting the maiestie of an Emperour. For no sooner put he himselfe in his iourney, but he rode through the midst of Ci∣ties in Triumphant wise: and passed along the great rivers in most delicate bar∣ges, garnished and adorned with Coronets of sundry sorts: Fating at his table most sumptuously and served with all manner of dainty Viands: observing no discipline either of houshold servitour or of Souldiour: but turning the outrages, villanies and licentious prankes of them all to aiest: who, not content with their ordinary diet allowed and provided for them in every place where they came at the common charges of the State; looke what slaves or Aliens it pleased them, they manumised and made free: but paied as many as withstoode them with whip∣ping cheere, blowes, knocks, bloudie wounds oftentimes yea, and otherwhiles with present death. When hee came into the fields where the Before Bebri∣, or Bretir∣acum. battaile was fought: and some of his traine loathed and abhorred the putrified corruption of the dead bodies, he stuck not to harten and encourage them with this cursed speech: That an Enemie slaine had a very good smell, but a Citizen farre better. Howbeit to qua∣lifie and allay the strong savour and sent that they cast, hee poured downe his throat before them all, exceeding great store of strong wine, and dealt the same plentifully about, Some con∣clude ye former p iode heare, and begin a new sentence thus Pars vani∣tate &c, with like vanitie &c. with as much vanity as insolent pride. When he beheld the Stone, under which OTHO lay interred, with an Inscription M Othonis, Pluarch. in his memoriall: Worthy was he of such a monument, quoth hee. And the very same dagger where∣with he had killed himselfe, he sent to COLEIN for to be dedicated unto MARS. Certes, upon the top of the Apennine Hill, hee celebrated a sacrifice, with a Or Mausolem Vigil all night long. 11 At length hee entred the Citie with warlike sound of trumpet, in his coate▪ ar∣mour, and with a sword girt unto him, among Or wake. Ensignes, Banners and Flags: his followers and dependants clad in militarie cassocks, and the armour of all his fel∣low Souldiours discovered in open view. Thus neglecting more and more from time to time, all Law of God and man, upon the very disasterous day (a) Alliensis, he was enstalled in the Sacerdotall dignity of High Priest. Hee ordained, that the solemne assembly Or among the Standards and other En∣signes inter sig∣a et Bexilla, for Election of Magistrates should be held every tenth yeere; and himselfe bee perpetuall dictatour. And to the end that no man might doubt what patterne hee chose to follow for government of Common-weale, calling a freqvent number of the publick Priests about him in the middle of Mars field, hee sacrificed to the Spirit and ghost of NERO: and at a solemne feast openly put the Harper in minde singing as he did to his great contentment, for to say somewhat also of Or Folk mote. DOMITIUS (b): And as he began to chaunt NEROES Canticles, he was the first that leapt for ioy and clapped his hands withall.i.

After which a second time being offended with his contumacy & malapert Ferocitatem or furacitatem. the euerie. stubbornnesse▪ hee sold him to one of these common fencers that went from mar ket to market, and by occasion that he was vpon a time put of to the last place in a sword fight for to play his prises: at unwares he privily stole him away: and no* In manner of mount bankes. sooner was hee gone into his province but he manumised him. The first day of his Empire, as he sat at supper, hee dubbed him knight of Rome: and gave him the golden Ring: notwithstanding that the very morning before, when all the souldi∣ers intreated in his hehalfe, he detested so foule a blot to disteine and discredite the worshipfull degree of knighthood. 13 But being given most of all to excessiue bellie cheere and crueltie; he devided repast into three meales every day at the least, and sometime into foure, to wit, Breakefast, Dinner, Supper and After supper▪ rere-bankets; able to beare them all very well, hee used to (a) vomit so ordinarily. Now his manner was to send word that hee would breake his fast with one (freind) dine with another, &c. and all in one day. And everie one of these refections, when it stood them in least, cost 3125. ∣ling. 40000 Se∣sterces. But the most notorious and memorable supper above all other was that, which his brother mace for a welcome at his first comming (to Rome) at which by report were, served up to the Table before him two thousand severall dishes of fish the most daintie & choisest that could be had, & seven thousand of foule. And yet, even this (as sumptuous as it was) himselfe surpassed at the dedication of that Or charger. platter, which for the huge capacitie therof he vsed to call the targuet of Minerva. and . i. the sheild of the CitiesMineru protectresse. In this he hudled and blended together the livers of (b) Scaroru, Giltheads: the delicate braines of Phesants & Peacockes: the tongues of the Birds Phoenicopterie: the tender small guts of Sea∣lampries fet as farre as from the Carpathian sea and the straights of Spaine, by his* Per  actrir  Hen di d. Captaines over Gallies. And, as a man that had not onely a wide throat of his owne to devour much, but also as greedie a stomach to feede both unseasonably and also grossly of what ever came next hand, he could not so much as at anie sa∣crifice whensoever, or in any iourny wheresoever forbeare but amonge the altars snatch up by and by the flesh, the parched corne also and meale even from the ve∣ry hearth, and eate the same: yea and at every victualling house by the way side, fall to viands piping hote, yet reaking and not cooled one iote; and not spare so much as meats dressed the day before and halfe eaten alreadie. 14 Being forward enough to put to death and punish any man, what cause soever was pretended; Noble men, his schoole fellowes, and play-feeres in times past, (whom by al faire meanes & flattering allurements he had enticed & drawn to the societie as it were of the Empire with him) by sundrie sorts of fraud & trechery, he killed & one above the rest he made away with poyson, which he raught unto him with his owne hand in a draught of cold water, that he called for lying in a fit of an

As Vsurers, As our Scri∣uenars and At∣turneyes do, for other men. takers of bonds and obligations, and publicanes, who ever at any time had demanded of him either at Rome debt, or by the way as he travailed toll and custome, hee hardly spared one. And one of them, whom even as he came to salute him and doe his dutie, he had delivered over to the executioner for to suf∣fer death, hee called straightwaies backe againe: and when all that were by praised him for his clemencie, he commanded the said partie to bee killed before his face, saying with all, That he would feede his eyes. At the execution of another, he cau∣sed two of his sonnes to beare him companie; for nothing in the world, but because they presumed to intreat for their fathers life. Ther was besides a gentlemā of Rome who being haled away to take his death, cryed alowd unto him▪ sir I have made you my heire.

And others report, how his mother her selfe wery of the present state, and fearing what evill dayes were toward, obtained at her sonnes hand poison, and that without any great intreatie. 15 In the eight moneth of his Empire, the armies of MAESIA Moesiarum be∣cause there was the high & the low. both the one and the other, as also at Pannonia revolted from him: likewise, of the forces beyond sea, those of Iurie and of Syria, and some of them sware alleageance unto VESPA∣SIAN who was present among them. To retaine therefore the love & favour of all other men he cared not what largesses he made both in publike & private, beyond all measure. Hee mustred also and levied souldiers within the City, with this co∣venant and faire Or offer. condition, That all voluntaries should by vertue of his pro∣mise, have not onelie their discharge from service after victorie, but also the availes & fees due unto olde souldiers for serving out their full time, But af∣terwardes, as the enemie came hotely uppon him both by land and sea, on the one side he opposed his brother with the fleete and younge untrained soul∣diers, together with a crewe of sworde fencers; on the other, what forces hee

And foorthwith upon the verie staires of the Palace professing openly before a frequent assemblie of his souldiers; how willing he was to resigne up that emperiall dignity which hee had received against his will, when they all gaine said it, hee put of the matter for that instant; and but one night bee∣tweene, even the next morning by breake of day, hee came downe in poore and simple array to the Rostra; where, with many a teare, he recited the same words out of a little written skrow. Now, as the souldiers & people both, interrupted him a se∣cond time and exhorted him not to cast downe his heart, promising also with their utmost endeavour, and striving a vie who should do best to assist him▪ hee tooke courage againe and pluckt up his spirits: So that now Nihil iam metuen, some read metuentes, to this sense, that he chased then fearing no such thing. fearing nothing at all hee came with a sodaine power and violently chased SABINVS and the rest of the FLAVIANS into the Capitoll: & there having set on fire the Temple of IVPITER OPTIMVS MAXIMVS vanquished & slew them: whiles himself beheld both the fight & the fire out of TIBERIVS his house, The faction of Flavius Ves∣patianus. sitting ther at meat & making good cheere.

That himselfe was Concord, hee came backe againe, and protested, that hee not onely retained still the blade with him, but also accepted the surname of Concord. 16 Hereupon hee mooved and advised the Senate, to send Embassadours together with the vestall virgins to craue peace, or else some longer time to Consult vppon the point. The next morrow, as he stood expecting an answere, word was brought unto him by his espall, that the enemie approched.

Soone after, uppon a flying and headlesse rumour That peace was obtained, he suffred him selfe to be brought backe to the Palace. Where, finding all places solitary and a∣bandoned: seeing those also to slinke from him and slip away who were with him, he did abovt him a Or bandelier girdle full of golden peeces of coine, and fled into the Por∣ters lodge, having first tied a ban▪dog (a) at the doore & set against it the bedsteed* 15 Sbilling peecs and better. and bedding thereto.• Or the vaward 17 By this time had the Avantcurriers of the (FLAVIANS) maine armie broken into the Palace: and meeting noe bodie searched as the manner is, everie blind corner.

THE HISTORIE OF Flavius Vespatianus Augustus, written by Caius Suetonius Tran∣quillus. THe Empire standing thus a long time in doubtfull termes, unsetled & wandering (as it were) by occasion of the rebel∣lious* Galb, Otho, Vitellius. broils & bloudy slaughter of three princes; the Fla∣uij at length tooke into their hands & established: a house I must needs say, of obscure descent and not able to shew a∣ny pedigree and images of auncestours to commend their race; howbeit, such as the common weale had no cause to dislike and bee ashamed of; although it be well knowne that Domitian abidd condigne punishment for his avarice and crueltie. TITUS FLAVIUS PE∣TRONIANUS, a burgesse of the free borrough Reate, and a Centurion, siding in time of the ciuill warre, with POMPEIUS (but whether he serued voluntarie or was called foorth and prest, it is uncertaine) fledde Or, after the battaile, fled from him. out of the battaile in PHARSALIA and went home to his house. Where afterwardes, having obteined his pardon and discharge from warre∣fare,
he became a bailife under the Bankers and mony changers to gather up their monies. This mans sonne surnamed SABINVS, nothing martiall nor skilfull in feates of armes (although some write, that he had beene a principall leader of the formost Cohorts: and others that whilest he led certaine companies, hee was ac∣quit from his militarie oth by Such be called Causarij. occasion of sicklinesse) came to be a Publicnum, or Publicum both to the same effect. Publicane in Asia, and gathered the custome or impost (a) Quadragesima for the state. And there remained certaine Images which the Cities in that province erected for him with this title and superscription, . i. For him that was a good and faithfull Or customer Publicane. After this he put foorth mony to vsurie among the Helve∣tians, where he ended his life, leaving behinde him his wife POLLA VSPASIA, and two children which he had by her. The elder of which, named SAINVS, was advanced to the provostship of the Cittie: the younger called VESPASIANVS, at∣tained to the dignitie Imperiall: This dame POLLA, borne at Nursia and descen∣ded of worshipfull parentage, was the daughter of VESPASIVS POLLIO, one that had beene a Or Colonel. militarie Tribune thrice, andOr camp maister, provost Marshal of the Campe be∣sides: and sister to a man of Senatours degree, and promoted to the dignitie of Praetour. There is a place moreover even at this day sixe miles from Rome, (as men goe to Spoletum from Nursia) upon the hill top, bearing the name of Vespasiae: where many monuments of the VESPASII are to be seene: a great evidence to prove the Noblenesse and antiquitie of that family. I cannot deny, that some have given out, how the father of that PTROIANVS came out of the Beyond the riuer l'o in res∣pect of Rome. Transpadane region, and was an undertaker by the great, to hire those labourers and hines which were wont yeerely to repaire out of Vmbria into the Sabines Countrie for to till their grounds: how hee planted himselfe and stayed in the Towne Reate afore∣said, and there maried a wife. But my selfe could never finde (make what search I could) any signe or trace to lead me thereto. 2 The Empe rour. VESPASIAN was borne in the Sabines territorie beyond Reate within a smal village named Phalacrine, the fifteenth day before the 17, th Of Nouember, Calends of December, in the evening, when Q.

Whereupon, when hee was Emperour hee both frequented continually the place of his birth and breeding, the Capitall hovse and manour remaining still as it had beene in former times, nothing altered (because forsooth, his eyes should have no losse nor misse of that which they were wont to see there) and loved also the memoriall of his grandmother so deerely, that on all solemne and festivall, and high daies, hee continued ever drinking out of a silver pot that was hers and out of none other. After he had put on his In 17 th yeere of his age, virile gowne, he refused a long time the (a) Senatours robe, although his brother had attained ther∣to: neither could he be forced to seeke for it at last but by his owne mother. Shee in the end wrought perforce so much from him, by way of reprochful taunts more than by faire intreatie or reverent authoritie: whiles, ever and anone, shee called him in taunting wise, his brothers huisher. He served as Tribune military in Thra cia: and in quality of Questor had the government of Crete and Cyrene, provinces by lot fallen unto him.

place: but presently at his first suit and with the formost being chosen Pretour, and upon displeasure taken, maliciously affected against the Senate; because he would by all maner of demerite win the favour of CAIUS the Emperor, he ear∣nestly demanded extraordinary playes & games in honor of him for his victory in Germanie. and gave opinion in the Senate house, that to augment the pu∣nishment of certeine conspiratours (against him), their dead bodies should bee cast forth and left unburied. Hee gave him also solemne thankes before that right honorable degree, for vouchsafing him the honor to be a guest of his at a supper. Amid these occurrents, he espoused FLAVIA DOMITILLA, the freed wo∣man3 of STATILIUS CAPLLA, a Romane gentleman of Sabraca, and an A∣fricane borne, committed unto him sometime upon trust, and enfranchised in the freedom of Latium: but afterwards pronounced a gentlewoman born & na∣turalized a Citizen of Rome, in the Court of Iudges delegate, upon claime made by her father FLAVIUS LIBERALIS borne at Ferentinum, (a man that never rose higher than to be a Of nota, Scribe to a Questour) who vouched her freedome. By her he had issew, TITUS DAMITIANUS, and DOMITILLA. His wife & daughter he overlived, and buried them whiles he was yet in State of a private person. After his foresaid wives decease, he called home againe to cohabite with him in his house CAENIS a freed-woman of ANTONIA, and her Or Keeper of her books and accompts. Secre∣tarie, whom he had fansied in former time: and her he kept when he was Em∣perour, insteede of his true and lawfull wife. Vnder the Emperour CLAUDIUS, by especiall favour of NARCISSUS,4 sent he was into Germanie as Lieutenant of a legion: from thence being remo∣ved into Britaine, he fought thirtie battailes with the enemie: Two most migh∣tie nations, and above twentie towns, togither with the Isle of Wight lying next to the said Britaine, he subdued, under the conduct partly of A. PLAUTIUS Lieutenant to the consul, and in part of CLAUDIUS himselfe, for which wor∣thyA, V. C. 804. acts he received trivmphall ornaments, and in short space two sacerdotall dignities with a consulship besides which he bare the two last moneths of the yeere. For the middle time between, even until he was Proconsul, he led a pri∣vate life in a retyring place out of the way, for feare of AGRIPPINA, who as yet bare a great stroke with her NERO▪ sonne, and hated to the heart all the friends of NARCISSUS, although deceased. After this, hauing the province of Africk allotted unto him, hee governed the same with singular integritie, & not with∣out much honor & reputation: but that in a seditious commotion at Adrume∣tum, there were Or Tueps. Rape- (a) rootes flung at his head. Certaine it is, that from thence he returned nothing richer than he was; as who not able to keepe cre∣dit, but growen almost bankrupt, was driven to mortgage all his houses and lands unto his brother: and of necessitie, for the maintenance of his estate and dignity, went so low as to make gaines by huckstersMangices qustus. Which ex∣tendeth also to slaves & old wares or thrip∣perie. trade pampering * beastes for better sale. Whereupon he was commonly named MULIO i. Mulitier. It is said also that conuicted he was for extorting from a young man 200 thou∣sand sesterces, in consideration that by his meanes hee had obteined a Sena∣tors dignitie even against his owne fathers will, For which hee had a sore re∣buke. Whiles he travailed through Achaia in the traine and inward compa∣nie of NERO, he incurred his heavie displeasure in the highest degree, for that
whiles he was chaunting, either he made many starts away out of the place, or else slept, if he staied there still. And being forbidden not only to conuerse in the same lodging with him, but also to salute him publikely with others, he with∣drew himselfe aside into a small cittie, and which stood out of the way: untill such time, as lying close there and fearing the worst, the government of a . pro∣vince with the commaund of an armie was offred unto him. There had been spred throughout all the East parts an opinion of olde, and the same setled in mens heades and constantly beleeved, That by the appointment of the destinies a∣bout such a time there should come out of IVRY those, who were to be Lords of the whole World: which being a prophesie (as afterwards the event shewed) foretel∣ling of the Romane Emperour, the Who then looked for their Messias & doe so still. Iewes drawing to themselues, rebelled: and having slaine the Or gover∣nour, Sabinus. President there, put to flight also the Gallus. Lieutenant ge∣nerall of Syria (a man of consular degree) comming in to ayde; and tooke from him the i. The maine standerd. Aegle. To represse this insurrection, because there was neede of a greater armie and a ualiant Captaine, yet such an one, as to whom a matter of so great consequence might safely be committed; himselfe was chosen a∣bove all others, as a man of approved valour and industrie; howbeit no way to be feared for the meannesse of his birth, linage and name. Having there∣fore under his hand an addition to the former poure, of two Romaine. legions, eight these cornets and cohorts seeme to bee Auxiliaries cornets of horse and tenne cohorts (of foote): taking also unto him among other Lieutenants, his elder Titus. son, no sooner arrived he in that province, but the other Or Provin∣ces rather in the East part states likewise next adjoyning, he brought into admiration of him, for re forming immediatly at his first comming the discipline of the campe, and gi∣ving the charge in one or two battailes with such resolution, as that in the as∣sault of a castle, he caught a rap with a stone upon his knee, and received in his targuete some shot of arrowes. 5 After NERO and GALEA, whiles OTHO and VITELLIUS strove for Soveraintie, hee had good hope of the Empire, conceived long before, by these presaging tokens (which I wil now relate) within a countrey ferme by the Citie side, belonging to the Flavij, there stood an olde Oke consecrated unto MARS, which at 3. childbirths of VESPASIA sodainly did put forth every time a several bough from the stock: undoubted signes fore-shewing the destinie & fortune of each one. The first was small and slender, which quickly withered (and therefore the girle at that time borne lived not one yeere to an end): the second grewe very stiffe and long withall, which pretended great felicitie: but the third, came to the bignesse of a tree. Whereupon SABINUS the father (of VESPASIAN) beeing confirmed beside by the answere of a One of these that prie into beastes bowels Southsayer, brought word backe (by report) unto his owne  the Grandmother of Vespasian. Mother, that she had a Nephew borne who should be Emperour. CAESAR: Whereat, shee did nothing else but set up a laughter, meruailing that her sonne should have a cracked braine and fall a doting now, since that his Mother had her wittes still whole and sound: Soone after, when CAIUS CAESAR, offended and angrie with him, for that beeing Aedile hee had not beene carefull about sweeping and clensing the streetes, had commanded hee should bee all bedawbed with mire that the Souldiours gathered up and threw into the lap of his embro∣dred
robe, some were ready to make this interpretation thereof, that the com∣mon weale trodden one day under foote and forlorne by some civill troubles, should fall into his protection and as it were into his bosoe. As hee was at his dinner upon a time, a strange dog brought into his dining roome a mans hand and layed it under the boarde. Againe, as hee sate another time at supper, an Oxe ha∣ving beene at plough and shaken of his yoke, rushed into the parlour where hee was at meate: and when hee had driven the waiters and seruitours out, as if all on a sodaine hee had beene wearie, layed him downe along at his feete where hee sate, and gently put his necke under him. A Cypresse tree like∣wise in his Grand-fathers land without anie force of tempest plucked up by the roote and layed along, the very next day following rose up againe gree∣ner and stronger than before. But in ACHAIA hee dreamed, That hee and his, should beginne to prosper so soone as NERO had a tooth drawen out of his head. Now it fortuned, that the morrow following, a Chirurgion that came forth into the court-yeard shewed unto him a tooth of NEROES newly drawen. In Iurie, when hee consulted with the Oracle of the good (a) CAR∣MELUS, the answere which was given, assured him in these tearmes, That whatsoever he thought upon and cast in his minde (were it never so great) it should so come to passe: And one of the Noble men of that Countrey taken captive, named Who wrote the Iewish historie. IOSEPHUS, when hee was cast into prison, avouched and sayde unto him most constantly, that hee should shortly be set at liberty even by him, but hee should be Emperour first. There were moreover significant tokens presaging no lesse reported unto him out of the very Citie of Rome: and namely, that NERO in his latter dayes, a little before his death, was warned in a dreame to take the sacred Chariot of IUPITER Optimus Maximus forth of the Chappel where it stoode, into VESPASIANS house, and so from Inde in Circum thence into the Cirque. Also, not long after, as GALBA held the solemne election for Vespasians. his second Consulship, the statue of IULIUS, late CAESAR of famous memo∣rie, turned of it selfe into the (b) East. And at the field fought before Bebriacum, ere the battailes joyned, two Aegles had a conflict and bickered together in all their sights: and when the one of them was foyled and overcome, a third came at the very instant from the sunne rising and chased the Victresse away. 6 Yet for all this attempted he no enterprise (notwithstanding his friends & souldiours were most prest and forward yea and urgent upon him) before that hee was sollicited by the unexpected favour, of some, who as it fell out were both unknowen to him and also absent. Two thousand drawen out of the three legions of the Maesian armie and sent to ayde OTHO, when they were upon the way marching (albeit newes came unto them that hee was vanqui∣shed and had layed violent hands upon himselfe,) held on their journey ne∣verthelesse as farre as to Aquileia; as giving small credit to that rumour: where after they had by vantage of opportunities offred, and vncontrolled li∣bertie, committed all manner of robberies and outrageous villanies, fearing least if they returned backe againe, they should answere for their misdemea∣nours, and abide condigne punishment therefore; layed their heades to∣gither, and consulted about the chusing and creating of an EMPEROVR. For, worse they tooke not themselues nor inferiour, eyther to the
armie in SPAINE that had set up GALBA: or to the Pretorian bands, which had made OTHO: or to the Germanician forces who had elected VITELLIUS, Emperours. Having purposed therefore and nominated of the Consular Lieutenants as manie, as they coulde in anie place thinke upon: when they misliked all the rest, taking exceptions against one for this cause and another for that: Whiles some againe of that third Legion, which a lit∣tle before the death of NERO had been translated out of SYRIA into MESIA, highly praysed and extolled VESPASIAN; they all accor∣ded thereto, and without delay, wrote his name upon their flagges and ban∣ners. And verily, for that time this project was smuddred, the companies for a while reclaimed, and all brought into good order. But when the sayde fact was once divulged: TIBERIUS ALEXANDER Or Gover∣nour. Provost of AEGYPT was the first that forced the Legions to sweare allegeance unto VEPASIAN, upon the The first day. kalends of IVLY, which ever after was celebrated for the first day and beginning of his Empire. After them, the armie in Iurie tooke the same oath before VESPASIAN himselfe, the The 11 of Iuly fifth day before the Ides of Iulie. These enterprises were very much farthered, by the copie of a letter that went commonly through mens hands (true or false I wote not) of OTHO now deceased, to VESPASIAN, charging and willing him now at the last cast, of all love to revenge his death, and wishing him withall, to relieve the distres∣sed state of the Common-wealth: by a rumour also spred abroad, That VI∣TELLIUS upon his victorie ment fully to make an exchange of the legions winter harbours: namely, to remove those that wintered in Germanie into the No maruaile then, if the ar∣mies there in∣clined to Ves∣pasin. East Provinces, as to a more secure seruice and easier warfare. Moreo∣ver, among the Governours of Provinces, LUCINIUS MUCIANUS, and of the Kings, Vologesus of Parthia, had promised; the Mucianus. one (laying downe all grudge and enmitie which unto that time he openly Vnto Vespasiā professed upon a hu∣mour of aemulation) the Syrian armie: and the K. Vologesus. other fortie thousand archers. 7 VESPASIAN therefore having undertaken a civill warre, and sent be∣fore him his Capitaines and forces into Italie, pased over in the meane time to ALEXANDRIA, for to be possessed of the frontier streights and AV∣NUES of Aegypt. Heere when he had voided all companie from him and was entred alone into the Temple of Serapis, after he had, upon much propitious favour of that god obtained, devoutly at length turned him selfe about; him thought hee sawe (a) BASILIDES one who was knowen to have had accesse unto no man, and long since for the infirmitie of his sinewes, skarce able to set one foote before another, and withall to bee absent a The Palsey. great way of, to present unto him Veruaine & sacred herbes guirlands also and loaves of bread,* 80 Miles, hap pily, the same whom Tacitus reporteth to have been the Priest of Cane lu. (as the manner is in that place. And heereupon immediately letters came un∣to him, emporting thus much, that the forces of VITELLIUS were dis∣comfited before CREMONA: reporting besides, that himselfe was killed at ROME. The onely thing that hee wanted; (being as one would say, a Prince unlooked for, and as yet new come to the Empire) was Countenance, authoritie, and a kinde as it were of royall majestie. But even that also came on a pace (by this occasion) It fortuned that a certaine meane commoner starke
blind; another likewise with a feeble and lame leg, came both togither unto him as hee sat upon the tribunall, craving that helpe and remedie for their in∣firmities which had beene sewed unto them by SERAPIS in their dreames: namely, Tha Vespasian. hee should restore the one to his sight, if he did but spit into his eyes: and strengthen the others legge, if hee vouchsafed onely to touch it with his heele. Now when as hee could hardly beleeve, that the thing anie way would finde successe and speede accordingly, and therefore durst not so much as put it to the venture: at the last through the perswasion of friends, openly before the whole assembly, hee assayed both meanes, neither missed hee of the effect. About the same time, at Tegea in Arcadia, by the Instinct and motion of Prophets, there were digged out of the ground in a consecrated place, manu∣factures and vessels of antique worke: and among the same an Image, resembling for all the World VESPASIAN. 8 Thus qualified as hee was and graced with so great fame, hee returned toA, V, C, 823 824 825 827 828 829 830 832 ROME: and after his triumph over the Iewes, hee added eight Consul∣ships more to that which of olde hee had borne. He tooke upon him also the Censureship: and all the time of his Empire esteemed nothing more deare, than first to establish and afterwards to adorne the Common weale, brought almost to utter decay, and at the point to fall downe. The souldiours, some presuming boldly of their victories, others in griefe for their shamefull In taking part against him. dis∣grace were growen to all manner of licentiousnesse and audacitie. The Pro∣vinces likewise and free states, yea and some kingdomes, fell to discord & se∣ditious tumults among them selues. And therefore of the Vitellians he both cassed and also chasticed very many. As for the partners with him in victorie: so farre was hee from allowing them any extraordinary indulgence, that their very due and lawfull rewardes hee payed not but slackely. And because hee would not let slip anie occasion of reforming militarie discipline, when a cer∣tain gallant youth smelling hote of sweet balmes and perfumes came unto him, to give thanks for an Or charge. Office obtained at his hands; after a strange countenance shewing his dislike of him, hee gave him also in words, a most bitter and grie∣uous checke, saying, I would rather thou haddest stunke of garlicke, and so re∣voked his letters patents for the graunt. As touching the mariners and sea seruitours, such of them as are wont to passe to and fro on foote, by Per vices, some reade per vicos  the townes nd villages turnes from Ostia and Puteoli to ROME; who were petitioners unto him that some certaine allowance might bee set downe for to finde them shoes: hee thought it not sufficient to sende them awaye without answere, but commanded that for ever after they should runne up and downe betweene Barefoote. unshod. And so, from that time they use to doe. ACHAIA, LYCIA, RHODES; BIZANTIVM and SAMOS, Whereas they had been free State, first diffranchised: likewise, THRACIA CILICIA and COMAGENE, subiect untill that time to Kings hee reduced all into the forme of a province. Into Cappadocia, for the continuall rodes and incursions that the Barbarians made, he brought a poure besides, of Legions, and in liev of a Romane knight, he placed there for Ruler, a man who had beene Consul. The Citie of ROME by reason of olde skare∣fires
and ruines was much blemished and disfigured. Hee permitted therefore any man to seize as his owne all vacant plots of ground, and to builde there∣upon, in case the owners and Land-lords were slacke in that behalfe. Him selfe tooke upon him the reedefying of the Capitoll, and was the first man that did set his hand to the ridding of the rubbish and rammell, yea and upon his owne necke caried some of it awaye: three thousand tables of brasse al∣so which were burnt with the sayd Temple, hee undertooke to make and set up againe, having searched and sought ought from all places the pattrons and For in them were engraven the publike evidences and words▪ &c copies thereof. A most bewtifull instrument and right auncient record of the whole Empire hee compiled and finished; wherein were contained from the first beginning well neere of the Citie, all actes of Senate, all deedes passed by the Communalty as concerning Leagues Alliances and priviledges gran∣ted to any whatsoever. 9 Hee built also newe workes: the temple of peace, situate next unto the Forum: That likewise of CLAVDIVS late Emperour of sacred me∣morie, seated upon the mount Caelius which verily had beene begun by Claudius his wife. A∣GRIPPINA, but almost from the very foundation destroyed by NERO. Item a most stately Amphitheatre in the heart of the Citie, Vt destinasse compererat Augu stum, amplissimi according as hee understood, that AVGVSTVS intended such an one. The two Of Senatours ad gentlemen degrees wasted by sundry massacres and disteined through the negligence of former times, he cleansed and supplyed, by a review and visitation of Senate and gen∣try both: wherein he remooved the unworthiest persons and tooke in the most honest that were to bee found, either of Italians or provinciall inhabitants. And to the ende it might be knowne, that both the said degrees differed one from another not so much in libertie as in dignitie; hee pronounced in the case of a certaine braule betweene a Senatour and a knight of Rome. That Senatours might not be provoked first with foule language: mary to aunswere them with evill words againe, was but Civilitie and a matter allowed. 10 Suites in law depending one uppon another were growen in everie Court exceeding much: whiles the old Actions by the Intervall of The vacation during the Ci vil troubles: Iurisdiction, hung still undecided and new quarrels arose to encrease them, occasioned by the tu∣multuous troubles of those times. Hee chose therefore certaine commi∣ssioners by lot, some by whome the Gods taken and caried away perforce during the warres might be restored; and others, who extraordinarily should determine and iudge betweene partie and partie in (a) Which per∣tai  to the Centumvirs Court▪ to wit, Cvile causes between private persons, as pro bates of Testa∣ments &c, Vide Cicer. 1, de Oratore. Centumvirall cases; (which were so many, as that the Plantifes & defendants. parties themselues, as it was thought, could hardly by course of nature live to see an end of them) and reduce them all to as small a number as possiblie might be. 11 Wanton lust and wastfull expense, without restraint of any man had gotten a mightie head. Hee mooved the Senate therefore to make a decree: That, what woman soever ioyned her selfe in Si iunxiet, as Sabellicus ex∣poundeth it: or, at large. carnally. wedlocke unto another mans bondseruant, should be reputed a bondwoman. Item that it might not bee lawfull for V∣surers to demaund any debt of young men whiles they were under their fa∣thers
tuition for mony credited out unto them▪ I mean, not so much as after their decease. In all other matters, from the very first▪ beginning of his Empire unto the end, hee was curteous enough and full of Clemencie. 12 His former meane estate and condition, hee dissimuled not at anie time▪ nay hee would often of himselfe professe the same and make it knowen open∣ly: Yea and when some went about to fetch the originall of the Flavian Linage, from as farre as the founders of REATE, and the companion of HERCU∣LES whose monument is to bee seene in the way By which salt was brought out of the Sa∣bines countrey to Rome. Salaria, hee mocked and laughed them to skorne for their labours. And so farre was he from desiring anie Extrinsecu: outward ornaments in shewe of the World, that upon his triump day, being wearied with the slow march and taedious traine of the pompe, he could not hold but say plainely, that hee was well enough serued and iustly punished; who beeing an aged man had so foolishly longed for a triumph: as if forsooth it had of right beene due unto his who were but of meane cal∣ling. forefathers, or ever hoped for Being three∣score of age, & therefore past the ambitious desire of such glory. by him selfe. Neither accepted he so much, as the tribunes authority and addition, of Pa∣ter patriae in his stile, but it was long first. For hee had forlet altogether the custome of searching those that came in duty to salute him even whiles yet the Civill warre continued. 13 The Libertatem which the greekes call Parrhesian. franke-speech of his friendes: the figurative tearmes and quippes of Lawyers pleading at the barre, and the unmannerly rudenesse of Philosophers hee tooke most mildely.

What is that to Noting Vespasian, as it he had a longing eye after his wealth and therefore sought his con demnation.

The daughter of VITELLIUS his enemie he maried into a most noble house: he gave unto her a rich dowry withall, and furniture accordingly. Whē as, by reason that he was forbidden the Court under NERO hee stood in great feare, and was to seeke what to do or whether to goe? one of the gentlemen huishers, whose office it was to admit men into the presence, in thrusting him out, had bidden him abire Or Morboviā according to which phrase we say, the foule ill take thee. The Greekes: Eis Choracas. i▪ The Crowes eate thee. The Latines in malā crucem i go hang Morboniam, i. to be gone in a mischiefe▪ When this fellow afterwards came to aske forgivenesse, he proceeded no further in heat of anger but to wordes onely, and to quite him with just as many and almost the very same. For, so farre was hee from working the overthrowe and death of anye person, upon anye suspicion or feare conceived:
that when his friendes admonished him to beware of MAETIUS POM∣POSIANUS, because it was generally beleeved that the Astrologors had by the horoscope of his nativitie assured him to bee Emperour another day, hee aduanced the same METIVS to the Consulship, presuming and pro∣mising in the mans behalfe, that hee would be one day mindfull of this benefit and good turne of his. 15 There is not lightly found an innocent person to have beene punished, but when hee was absent and not ware thereof: or at leastwise unwilling thereto and deceived. With HELUIDIUS PRISCUS who onely had sa∣luted him after his returne out of SYRIA, by his private name, Not Caesar nor Augustus nor Imperator plaine VES∣PASIAN: and being pretour in all his Edicts and Proclamations passed him o∣ver without any honour at all, or once naming him, hee was not angry and displeased, before that he had, with his most insolent altercations made him in manner contemptible and little better than an ordinarie person. Him also, notwithstanding he was first confined to a place and afterwards commanded to bee killed, hee would have given a great deale to have saved by all meanes possible: as who sent certein of purpose to call backe the murderers: and saved his life hee had, but that false word came backe that he was dispatched alreadie. Otherwise he never rejoyced in the death of any but rather when malefactours were justly punished and executed, hee would weepe and groane againe. 16 The onely thing, for which hee might worthily bee blamed was cove∣tousnesse. For, not content with this, To have revived the taxes & pay∣ments omitted by GALBA: to have laied unto them other newe and heavie impositions: to have enhaunsed also the Tributes of the provinces, yea and of some dpled the same: he fell openly to negotiate and deale in certaine trades, which, even for a private person were a shame to use: buying up and engrossing some commodities for this purpose onely to put the same of, afterwardes at an higher price. Neither made hee it straung to sell either honourable places unto suiters for them ▪ or absolutions and pardons, to men in trouble, whether they were innocent or gultie it skilled not. Fur∣thermore, it is verily thought that of his Procuratours, if any were greedy and given to extortion more than other, his manner was to promote such for the nonce to higher offices: to the ende, that when they were more enriched, hee might soone after condemne them. And commonly it was sayd, that those hee vsed as spunges, for that hee did wet them well when they were drie, and presse them hard when they were wette. Some write that hee was by nature most covetous; & that an old Neat heard upbraided him once therwith who being at his handes denied freedome without paying for it (which hee hūblie craved of him now invested in the Empire) cryed out with a lowd voice and said, The Wolfe might change his haire, but not his qualities. Contrariwise there bee againe who are of opinion, that hee was driven to spoyle, to pill and poll of necessitie, even for extreame want both in the common treasurie and
also in his owne exchequer: whereof he gave some testimonie in the begin∣ning immediately of his Empire; professing that there was neede of fortie thousand Millenes to set the STATE upright againe. Which also see∣meth to sounde more neere unto the truth. Because the monie by him ill got∣ten: Hee used and bestowed passing well. To all sorts of men hee was most liberall. The (a) Estate and wealth of Senatours he made up to the full. To de∣caied men that had beene Consuls, hee allowed for their maintenance 500 thousand Sesterces by the yeere. Very many Cities throughout the World by Earth-quake or fire ruinate, hee reedified better then they were before. 17 Fine wits and cunning Artisanes hee set much store by, and cherished them above all others, Hee was the first, that out of his owne coffers ap∣pointed for professed RHETORICIANS, as well in Latine as in Greeke, an yeerely Salarie of an hundred thousand Sesterces a peece. Excellent POETS, as also Artifices, for so Livie ter∣meth Ludos et histriones i. stage players. Actours he Or hyred. bought up. Semblably, upon the workeman who had repaired and set up againe, the Geantlike Image called COLOS∣SVS, hee bestowed a notable Or reward congiarie, and endewed him with a great stipend beside: to an Enginer also, who promised to bring into the Capitoll huge Columnes with small charges, hee gave for his devise onely no meane re∣ward; and released him his labour in performing that worke, saying withall by way of preface, That he should suffer him to To allow thē wages for their paineful labor in such works rather then to have the same done without them: and as we say, to keep poore people at worke. feed the poore commons▪ 18 At those playes during which the stage of MARCELLUS Theatre newly reedified, was dedicated: he had brovght into request and vse againe even the olde Eare delights as Players Mu sicians, &c. (a) Acroames. To APOLLINARIS the Tragoedian hee gave foure hundred thousand sesterces. TO TERPNUS and DIODORUS two harpers, two hundred thousand a peece: to some one hundred: and to whom hee gave least fortie thousand, over and above a great number of golden Coronets. Hee feasted continually: and for the most part by making Rectá: in op∣position to▪ sportul full suppers and those very plentifull: for why? His meaning was to helpe the Butchers and such as solde victuals. As hee delivered foorth giftes unto men at the Saturnalia, so hee did to Women upon the (b) Kalends of MARCH. Yet verely for all this, coulde hee not avoide the infamous name of his former avarice. The men of ALEXANDRIA termed him still CYBIOSASTES after the surname of one of their Kings, given to most base and beggerly gayne. And even at his very funerals, FAVOR the Arch-counterfaict representing his person, and imitating (as the manner is) his deeds and wordes whiles hee li∣ved, when hee asked the Procuratours openly, what the charges might bee of his funerall and the pompe thereto belonging? No sooner hearde that it would arise to tenne Millenes of Sesterces, but hee cried, Give mee one hun∣dred thousand, and make no more adoe but throw mee into TIBER. 19 Of a middle stature hee was: well set: his limmes compact and strongly made: with a countenance as if he streined hard for a stoole.

Then, having red through all missives, and the Breviaries of everie office: hee admitted his friends: and whiles hee wat saluted, he both put on his own shooes, and also apparailled and made himselfe ready. After dispatch of all occurrent businesses, hee tooke himselfe to (a) gestation, and so to rest: having one of his Concu∣bines, lying by his side: of whom hee had appointed a great number in steede of CAENIS deceassed. From his A Secrete, or re tiring place privie closet, hee passed into his Baine and so to his refection roume. Neyther was he, by report, at any time fuller of humanitie, or redier to doe a pleasure.

Howbeit, most of all hee affected a kinde of dicacitie in his unseemely gayne and filthy lucre: to the end, that by some skoffing cavill, hee might put by and doe awaie the enuie of the thing, turning all to merrie jests. A Minister and seruitour about him, whom hee loved deerely; made suite in the behalfe of one as his brother, for a Stewardship.

THE HISTORIE OF Titus Flavius Vespasianus Au∣gustus, written by Caius Suetonius Tranquillus. TITUS, surnamed as his Father was, VESPASIANUS, the1 lovely dearling and delightfull ioy of Mankinde (so fully was he, either endued with good nature and disposition, or enri∣ched with skilfull cunning, or else graced with fortunes fa∣vour; and that (which is hardest of all) in his Imperiall State; considering that whiles hee lived as a private person under the Emperour his Father, he could not avoid the very hatred and much lesse the reproofe of the world.) This TITUS, I say, was borne the 30 of De∣cember. third day before the Calends of Ianuarie: in that yeere which was remarke∣able for the death of CAIUS the Emperour, neere unto the (a) Septizonium,A, V, C. 794 within a poore ill favoured house, in a very little Chamber and darke with∣all: For it remaineth yet to bee seene. His Education hee had in the Court to∣gether with BRITANNICUS, trained up in the like Arts and Disciplines, under

Hee, but TITUS who then stoode hard by, should surely bee Emperour. Now were these two so familiar, that (as it is verily thought) of the same cup of poison whereof BRITAN∣NICUS drank and died, TITUS also sitting neere unto him, tasted: whereupon he fell into a grievous disease, that held him long and put him to great paine. In me∣moriall of all which premisses, he erected afterwards for Britannicus. him one Statue of gold in the Palatium; as also another of Ivorie on horsebacke (which at the Circeian Games is even at this day caried before in the Solemne pomp) he dedicated, and accompanied accordingly. At the very first, even in his child-hood, there shone forth in him, the gifts both2 of body and minde: and the same more and more still by degrees as hee grew in yeeres: A goodly presence and countenance, wherein was seated no lesse Aucthoratis, which Tactus caleth maie∣siatm. maie∣stie than favour and beauty: A speciall cleane strength, albeit his stature was not tall: but his belly bare out somewhat with the most. A singular memorie: and aptnesse to learne all the Arts, in manner, as well of warre as of peace. Most skil∣full he was in handling his weapon, and withall a passing good horsman: For his Latine and Greeke tongue, whether it were in making Orations or composing Poemes, prompt and ready even to the performance thereof ex tempore. Neither was he uneene in Musick as who could both sing and also play upon instruments sweetly and with knowledge▪ I have heard also many men say, That he was wont to write with Cyphers and Characters most swiftly, striving by way of sport and mirth with his owne Clerks, whether he or they could write fastest? to expresse likewise and imitate what hand so ever hee had seene: yea, and to professe many a time, that he would have made a notable forger and counterfaiter of writings. In quality of Tribune Militare, he served in the warres both in Germanie and al∣so3 in Britaine, with exceeding commendation for his industrie and no lesse report of Temperate behaviour▪ modestie, as appeareth by a number of his images and (a) titles to them an∣nexed, throughout both Provinces. After this warfare of his, hee pleaded causes in Court, which he did rather to winne credite and In underta∣king causes of greatest m∣portance reputation, than to make it an ordinarie In entertai∣ning al matters whatoever. practise. At which very time, he wedded ARRICIDIA, the daugh∣ter of TERTULLUS a Gentleman of Rome, but Capitaine sometime of the Pae∣torian Bands: and in the roome of her deceased, he tooke to wife MARTIA FLA∣VIA: and from her when she had borne unto him a daughter, he divorsed himselfe. After this, upon his Questureship, being Colonell and Commaunder of a wholeA V. C. 820 Legion, he brought under his subiection Neere to te Lake Geneza∣rth. TARICHEA and GAMALA two most puissant Cities of Iurie: Where, in a certaine battaile having lost his horse under him (by a deadly wound) within his flankes, hee mounted another whose rider in fight against him had beene flaine and was fallen. Afterwards, when GALBA was possessed of the State, being sent to congratu∣late4 his advauncement: What way so ever he went, he turned all mens eyes uponA, V, C. 821▪ him, as if he had beene singled forth to be adopted. But so soone as he perceived all to be full of troubles againe, hee returned back out of his very iourney, and vi∣sited the Oracle of VENUS In Pap a citie ithin the Isle Cyprus. PAPHIA: Where, whilst he asked counsell, about his passage at sea, hee was confirmed withall in his hope of the Empire. Having attained thereto within short time, & being left behind to subdue Iurie throughly
in the last assault of Hierusalem, hee slew twelue enemies that defended te wall, with iust so many arrowes shot: and wonne the Citie upon the very birth-day 12  natores. of his daughter, with so great ioy and favourable applause of all his Souldiours: that in their gratulation they saluted him Emperour: and soone after, when he was to depart out of that Province, deteined him: in humble manner, yea and ft-soones in threatning wise instantly calling upon him, To stay, or else to take them all a∣way together with him. Whereupon arose the first suspition, That he revolted from his father, and had attempted to chalenge the kingdome of the East parts for him selfe. Which surmise himselfe made the more, after that in his way to Alexandrea, as he consecrated at Memphis the Ox Apis, he wore a (a) Diademe: Which he did in deed according to the custome & rites of the auncient religion there. But there wanted not some, who construed it otherwise. Making hast therefore into Italie; after hee was arrived first at Rhegium and from thence at Puteoli, embarqued in a Merchants ship of burden; to Rome he goes directly with all speed & most lightly appointed: and unto his father looking for nothing lesse, I am cme quoth he, father, I am come: checking thereby the rash and inconsiderate rumors raised of him. 5 From that time forward hee ceased not to carie himselfe as partner with his Fa∣ther, yea and Protectour also of the Empire: With him hee triumphed: with himA, V, C, 824 825, 824 hee iointly administred the Censureship: His Colleague hee was in the Tribunes authority: his Companion likewise in seven Consulships. And having taken toA, V, C, 823 825. 827, 828 829, 830, 832 himselfe the charge well-neere of all Offices, whiles hee both endited letters and penned Edicts in his Fathers name: yea, and read Missives Orations in Senate, and that in the Questours turne, he assumed also the Captainship of the Guard, an Office never to that time executed but by a Gentleman of Rome. In this place hee de∣meaned himselfe nothing civilly, but proceeded with much violence: For ever as he had any in most ielousie and suspition, he, by sending secretly and under-hand certaine of purpose, who in the Theaters and Campe should require for to have them punished (as it were with his Fathers consent) made no more a doe but brought them all to their end. As for example, among these, hee commaunded AULUS CAECINA, a man of Consular Degree, and a guest by him invited to supper, when hee was scarce gone out of the Banquetting parlor to bee stabbed. I must needes say, that driven he was to this violent proceeding upon an extremity of daunger: considering that he had found out his hand-writing bearing evidence of a conspiracie that he plotted with the Souldiours. By which courses, as he pro∣vided well and sufficiently for his owne security another day: so, for the present time he incurred very much displeasure and hatred of the world: In so much, as no man lightly, when so adverse a rumor was on foote, and that which more is, against the wills of all men, would have stepped to the Imperiall throne. 6 Beside his cruelty, suspected he was also for roiotous life: in that he continued banquetting untill midnight with the most profuse and wastfull spend-thrifts of his familiar minions: For wantō lust likewise, by reason of a sort of stale Catamites & guelded Eunuchs that he kept about him: and the affectionate love that hee was noted to beare to The sister as some thinke of Agrippa, & wise for a whe of Polemon King of Lyci, others ay▪ she was the wife first of A∣ristoulus after wards of Ai∣pater. Queene BERENICE, unto whō also, as it was said he promised mariage. Suspition there was moreover of his pilling & polling. For certain it was, that in the , cōmissiōs & hearing of causes which his father held, he was wont to sel
the decision of matters, and to make a gaine thereby. After this, men both reputed and also reported him to be even another NERO. But this name that went of him proved good for him and turned to his greatest commendation: considering that no grosse vice could bee found in him, but contrariwise many excellent vertues. The feasts that he made were pleasant meriments, rather than lavish and sumpte∣ous. He chose for his friends such, as in whom the Emperours also his successours reposed themselves, and whom they used especially as necessarie members both for them and also for the Common-wealth. As for Queene BERENICE, he sent her quickly away from the Citie of Rome; but full loath they were both of them to part a sunder. Certaine of his minions and dearlings whom hee favoured and fansied most, albeit they were such artificiall Dauncers, that within a while after they caried the greatest praise and prise upon the stage, he forbare quite not onely to huggle and embrace long together, but to behold so much as once in any pub∣lick meeting and assembly. From no Citizen tooke he ought: and from aliens goods he abstained, if ever any did. Nay, he received not the very contributions graunted and usually paied. And yet, being inferiour to none of his predecessours in munificence, as having dedicated an At which so∣lemnity 5000 wilde beasts were killed. A Eusebius Chronographs and Eutropis write Amphitheatre, and built the Baines hard-by, with (a) great Cliriter. expedition, he exhibited a Spectacle of Sword-fencers, with all kindes of furniture thereto belonging in most plentifull manner. Hee re∣presented also a navall fight in the old Naumachia; In which very place he brought forth likewise his sword-fencers to play their prises: and in that one day he put out to be baited 5000 wilde beasts of all sorts. 7 Furthermore, being of his owne nature most kinde and gracious; whereas by a constitution and order that TIBERIUS began, all the CAESARS his Succes∣sours held not the Benefits graunted by former Princes good and in force, unlesse they also themselves made new graunts of the same againe: hee was the first, that by vertue of one sole edict, ratified and confirmed all that had passed before: nei∣ther suffred he any petition to be made unto him for them. In all other Suits and Requests, hee ever more held most constantly mens mindes at this passe, that hee would send none away without hope. And when his Domesticall Ministers about his person, would seeme to tell him, That he promised more than he was able to per∣forme: What! quoth he, there ought no man to depart from the speech of a Prince, sad and discontented. Calling to minde one time as he sat at supper, That he had done nothing for any man that day, hee uttered this memorable and praise-worthy Apophthegme, My friends, I have lost a day. The people especially in generall he intreated in all occasions, with so great courtesie, that having proposed a solemne Sword-fight, he made open profession, that he would set it forth, not to please him selfe but to content the beholders. And verily, even so hee did: for, neither de∣nied he ought to them that would call for it: and of his owne accord, willed them to aske what their mindes stoode to. Moreover, shewing plainly, that hee stoode well affected to the manner of the Thracian- Who were opposite to the Mirmillones, y• were armed after the french fashion. swordfencers fight and their Arma∣ture, hee would many times even with the rest of the people both in word and gesture (as a favourer of that kinde) iest and make sport: yet so, as hee kept still the maiestie of an Emperour: and withall iudged with equitie indifferently. And be∣cause hee would pretermit no point of popularity, sometime as hee bathed in his
owne baines hee admitted the Commons thither unto him. There fell out in his daies certaine mischaunces and heavie accidents: as, the burning of the moun∣taine Vesaevs in Campania: A Skar-fire at Rome, which lasted three daies and three nights; as also a Wherin there died ten thou∣sand a day, Eses. pestilence, the like whereof had not lightly beene knowne else where at any other time. In these calamities so many and so grievous, he shewed not onely a Princely care, but also a singular fatherly affection: sometime com∣forting (his people) by his Edicts; otherwhiles helping them so farre forth as his power would extend. For repairing the losses in By the bur∣ning of Ves which consu∣med many towns & much people. Campania, he chose by lot cer∣taine Commissioners to looke thereto▪ even out of the ranke of those that had beene Consuls. The goods of such as perished in the said mount, whose heires could not be found, hee awarded to the reedification of the ruinate Cities adioy∣ning. And having made publick protestation, that in the said skare-fire of the Ci∣tie, there was no losse at all but to himselfe: Looke what ornaments were in any of his owne In the Coun∣try, as Co∣lumnes, statues painted tables▪ &c. Palaces and royall houses, the same he appointed to the Citie buil∣dings and the Temples: For which purpose hee made divers of Knights degree Supravisors, to the end that every thing might be dispatched with greater expedi∣tion. To cure the sicknesse and mitigate the furie of those contagious Diseases, hee used all helpe of god and man; having sought out what soever kindes of Sa∣crifices and remedies might bee found: Among the adversities of those times, may bee reckoned these Promoters and Informers, with such as under hand set them a worke, occasioned all by old licentiousnesse and impunitie. And those he commaunded to be whipped and beaten with cudgels ordinarily in the open Mar∣ket place: and last of all, when they had beene brought in a Shew through the Amphitheatre, partly to be solde in port-sale for slaves: and in part to be caried away into the roughest and bleakest Ilands that were. And because hee would for ever restraine such, as at any time should dare to doe the like: hee made an Acte among many others, prohibiting▪ One and the same matter to bee sued by vertue of many Statutes and Lawes enacted in that behalfe; or to make inquisition as touching the estate of any man deceased, after the terme of certaine yeeres limi∣ted. 8 Having professed, that he tooke upon him the High-Priesthood in this regard, because hee would keepe his hands pure and innocent, hee made good his word. For, after that time, never was hee the principall Author of any mans death, nor priuie and accessarie thereto; (albeit hee wanted not sometimes iust cause of re∣venge) but sware devoutly, That hee would rather die himselfe, than do others to death. Two noble men of the Patritian ranke, convicted for affecting and aspi∣ring to the Empire he proceeded against▪ no farther than to admonish them to de∣sist and give over, saying, That Soveraigne power was the gift of Destinie and Divine providence. If they were Petitioners for any thing else, he promised to give it unto them. And verily; out of hand, to the mother of the one▪ who was then farre of (wofull and pensive woman as shee was) he dispatched his owne coursitours and foote-men to carie word that her sonne was safe: As for themselves hee not onely invited them to a familiar and friendly supper that night: but also the next day following, at the sight of Sworde-fencers placing them of purpose neere a∣bout his owne person, the As their ar∣mour, weapon &c. Ornaments of the Champions that were to fight, presented unto him, hee reached unto them for to (a) view and peruse.

After he had finished the solemne Shewes and Games exhibited to the people, in the end and upshot whereof, hee had shed teares abundantly: he went toward the Sabines territorie somwhat more sad than usually he had beene: by occasion, that as hee sacrificed, the beast brake loose and gat away: as also because in faire and cleere weather (a) it had thunde∣red. Hereupon, having gotten an ague at his first lodging and baiting place, when he was removing from thence in his Licter, it is said that putting by the Curtaines of the windowe, hee looked up to heaven, and complained very piteously, that his life should be taken from him who had not deserved to die: For there was no fact of his extant, of which hee was to repent, save onely one. Now what that one should be, neither uttered he himselfe at that instant, neither is any man able rea∣dily to guesse thereat. Some thinke, he called to minde the over-familiar acquain∣tance that he had with his brothersDomitia wife. But DOMITIA devoutly sware, That he never had such dealing with her: who no doubt would not have denied it, if there had beene any folly at all betweene them: nay, shee would rather have made her vaunt thereof: so ordinary a thing it was with her to glory in all naughtinesse and shamefull deedes. 10 He departed (a) this world, in the very same Country-house wherein his father died before him: upon the13 of Sep∣tember. Ides of September, two yeeres, two moneths & twenty dayes after that he succeeded his father, and in the two & fortieth yeere of his age. Which being once notified and knowen abroade, when all men throughout theA, V, C. 834 Citie mourned no lesse than in some domesticall occasion of Sorow and Lamen∣tation: The Senate before they were summoned and called together by any Edict, ranne to the Curia, finding as yet the dores fast locked: but when they were set open, they rendred unto him now dead so much thanks, and heaped upon him so great a measure of praises, as they never did before, at any time, whiles he was living and present among them.

In the Vitellian troubles he fled into the Capitol with his Vnle SABINVS, & part of the forces which were then present. But when the adverse faction brake in: and while the Temple was on fire; hee lay close all night in the Sextaines lodging and early in the morning disguised in the habit of a priest of Isis, and among the sacrifi∣cers belonging to that vaine superstition, after hee had passed over Tiberis ac∣companied with one onely person, to the mother of a schoole fellow of his, hee lurked there so secretly, that a beit the serehers traced him by his sooting yet could hee not be found. At last after victory obtained hee went foorth and shewed him∣selfe; & being generally saluted by the nameThe Empe▪ rours sonne & heire apparant of the Empire. of CAESAR; the honourable dignitie of the Citi Praetour in the consular authoritie, hee tooke uppon him in name and title onely: the iurisdiction whereof hee made over to his next Colleague. But in all power ofAs being a young Prince and a Caesar. Lordly rule, he caried himself so licentiously & without controlment that hee shewed even then betimes, what a one hee would prove hereafter. And not to handle every particular. having with uncleane hands offred dishonour to many mens wives, hee fled a way and maried also DOMITIA LONGINA the wedded wife of AELIUS LONGINVS: and in one day gave and dealt above twentie offices, within the Citie and abroad in foraine provinces: in so much as VESPASIAN commonly said, That hee marvailed, why  sent not one also to succeed in his place. 2 Hee enterprised moreover a voiage into Gaule and Germanie, Notwithstan∣ding the same was needlesse, and his fathers freinds diswaded him from it; onely, because hee would equallize his brother both in Operibus. i. deeds and ex∣ploits. workes and reputation. For these prankes of his rebuked he was: and to the end he might the rather be put in mind of his young yeeres and private condition, hee dwelt together with his father: in a licter hee attended the (Curule) chaire of father and brother, whensoever they went foorth of doores: and being mounted upon a white Courser accompanied them both, in their tryumph over Iurie. Of 6 Consulships hee bare but one Which began the first of Ia nuary, in his owne right. & not in ye vcant roome of others. ordi∣nary; and the same by occasion that his brother TITVS yeelded unto him his own place and furthered him in his suite. Himselfe likewise made wonderfull semblāce of modestie. But above all, hee seemed outwardly to affect Poetrie, (a studie which he was not so much unacquainted with before time, but he despised and reiected it as much afterwards) & recited his owne verses even in publike place. Yet never the lesse, when VOLOGESVS King of the Parthians required aide against the Alanes, and one of VESPASIANS two sonnes to be the Generall of those forces, he labou red with might and maine, that himselfe before all others should be sent: and bee∣cause the quarrel wasPeace con cluded between the a, nations dispatched alreadie to his hand, hee assaied by gifts and large promises to sollicite other Kings of the East, to make the same request. When his father was dead, standing in doubtfull tearmes with himselfe a longe time, whe∣ther hee should offer unto the souldiers a donative duple to that of his brother TITVS, hee never stucke to give out and make his boast, That left hee was to bee partner with him in the Empire, but that his fathers will was verie much abused. Neither would hee give over from that time forwarde
both to-lay wait secretly for his brother, and also to practise openly against him, untill such time as he gave commandement when hee was stricken with greivous sickenesse, that he should be left for dead before the breath was out of his bodie: and after he was departed indeed, vouchsafing him no other honour but his Canonization for a God. consecra∣tion, he carped also at him many a time as well in glauncing figurative speeches as in open Edicts. 3 In the beginning of his Empire his manner was, to retire himselfe daily into a secret place forHorarium or for a certaine time of the day: some say three houres. one houre, and there to do nothing else but to catch flies, and with the sharp point of a bodkin or writing steele pricke thē through: In so much, as whē one enquired, whether any bodie were with CAESAR within? VIEIVS CRIS∣PVS made answer not impertinently, no, not so much as a flie. After this, DOMI∣TIA his owne wife, who in his second Consulship had borne him a sonne, and whome two yeeres after he had saluted as Empresse, by the name of AVGVS∣TA, her I say, falling in fansie with PARIS the stage player and ready to die for his love, hee put away: but within a smal while after (as impatient of this breach and divorse) tooke her home, and maried her againe, as if the people had instantly called uppon him so to do. In the administration of the Empire hee behaved him selfe for a good while variablie, as one made of an equall mixture and temper of vices and vertues, untill at length hee turned his vertues also into vices: being, (so far as we may coniecture) over & above his naturall inclination, for want coverous and greedie; for feare bloudy and cruell. 4 Hee exhibited ordinarily magnificent and sumpteous shewes not onely in the Amphitheatre, but in the Cirque also. In which, beside the usuall running of Chariots, drawen as well with two steedes as foure. Hee represented likewise two battailes of horsemen and foote men both: and in the Amphitheatre a Navall fight. For, baitings of wild beasts, and sword fencers, he shewed in the very night by cresset and torch lights; and hee brought into the place not men onely to fight, but women also to encounter wild beasts. Furthermore, at the games of swordfight set out by the Questours (which having in times past been discontinued and forlet, hee brought into vse againe) hee was alwaies present in person, so as he gave the people leave to choose two paire of swordfencers out of his owne schoole, and those hee brought in, royally, & courthe appointed in the last place. And at all sights of sword players, there stood ever at his feet a little dwarfe arraied in skarlet with a small head that it was wonderfull: with whome hee vsed to talke and conferre otherwhiles of serious matters. Certes, over heard he was, when hee demāded him of what he knew? & what he thoght, of the last dispose of the Provin∣ces? and namely of ordaining METIUS RVFUS Lieutenant generall of Aegypt? Hee exhibited navall battailes performed in manner, by full fleetes and compleat navies: having digged out a great pit for a lake, and built a stone wall round about it, neere vnto Tiberis: and those he would be hold in the greatest stormes & showers* Circumstruct that were. Hee set forth also the Secular plaies and games making his computatiō from the yeere, not where in CLAVDIVS, but AVGVSTVS longe before had made them. During these, uppon the daie of the Circentiā solemnities, to the end there might be an hundred Missus. every of which ordi∣narily confists of 7 races. courses the sooner runne, hee abridged the races of every one, to wit, from 7. to 4. He ordained moreover, in the honour of IVPITER
CAPITOLINVS, Quinquennall Games of three fold Maisteries, musicke, horse∣riding, & Gymnicke exercises: & in the same, rewarding victours with Coroners, more by a good many then now they be. Herein the concurrents strove also for the prise in Prose, both Greeke & Latin: and besides single harpers, there were Setts of those also that played uppon the harpe, yea and consorts of such as sung therto, in a quire. In the running place, Virgins also ran for the best games. At all these masteries and solemnities, he sat as president in his Pantofles, clad in a robe (a)* Or lippers. of purple after the Greekish fashion, wearing on his head a golden Coronet; with the Image of IUPITER IVNO and MINERVA: having the priest of IUPI∣TER and the Colledge of the religious, called FLAVIALES, sitting by him in like habit; saving that in their Coronets there was his Image also. Semblably, hee celebrated everie yeere uppon the Albane mount, the Quin quatria of MI∣NERVA. In whose honor he had instituted a Societie, out of which there should be chosen by lot, Maisters and Wardens of that solemnitie who were to exhi∣bite peculier and especiall Beastbaitings and stage playes, yea and contentions for the prise, of Oratours and Poets besides. He gave a Congiarium largesse to the people thrice: to wit, three hundred sesterces a peece: & at the Xiphilin shew of the swordfight a most plenteous dinner. At the solemne So, Called of the seen hils, whereupon the Citie stood. Septimontiall sacrifice, hee made a dole of Viands, allowing to the Senatours and gentlemen faire large paniars: to the commons, finalOr Baskets. maunds with Cates in them: and was the first himselfe that fell to his meat. The next day after, heOr Sent. skattered among thē,Gifts o fa∣uours. Missils of al sorts: and because the greater part thereof, fell to the rankes of the common people, he pronounced by word of mouth for every skaffold of Senatours and gentlemen, 50. tickets or tallies. 5 Manie buildings, and those most stately, which had beene consumed with fire, hee reedified: and among them the Capitoll which had been In Vespatians dayes. fired again: but all under the title of his owne name, without any memoriall of the for∣mer founders. Mary, he founded a new Temple in the Capitoll to the honour of IUPITER CVSTOS: also the Forum, which is now called Neruae Forum: like wise the Temple of the FLAUIAN familie: a shew place for running and wrest ling: another for Poets and Musicians to contend in, and a Naumachie for ships to encounter. Of the stone that was about which, the greatest Cirque of al was afterwards built, by occasion that both sides thereof had been burnt downe. 6 Expeditions hee made, some voluntarie; some uppon necessitie. Of his owne accord that against the Catti: uppon constreint one, against the Sarma∣tians; By occasion that one whole Legion together with their Lieutenant fell upon the sword: two against the Daci, the former, because OPPIUS SABINVS a man of Consuls degree was defaited and slaine; and the second, for that COR∣NELIUS FVSCVS, Capitaine of the Praetorian bands (unto whom he had com mitted the whole conduct of that war) lost his life. Over the Catti & Daci (after sundry feilds fought with varietie of fortune) he triumphed twice. For his victo ry of the Sarmatians, hee presented only IVPITER CAPITOLINVS with his Lawrel guirland. The civill warre stirred up by LVCIVS ANTONIVS go∣verner of the higher Germanie, hee dispatched and ended By Nrbanus Appius who lew the said . in his absence:
and that by a wonderfull good hap: when, as at the very houre of conflict, the Rhene swelling and overflowing sodainly staied the Barbarians forces as they wold have passed over to ANTONIVS. Of which victorie hee had intelligence by pre∣ages, before the newes by messengers came. For uppon that very day when the battaile was fought, an Eagle after a straung manner having overspred his statue at Rome and clasped it about with her wings, made a great flapping noise in token of much ioy; and within a little after, the bruit was blowen abroade so rife and common, of ANTONIES death, that many avouched confidently, they had seene his head also brought home (to Rome,) 7 Many new orders besides in matters of common use, hee brought uppe. The dole of Viands given and distributed in little baskets in lieu of a publike supper, he abolished: and reduced the auncient custome of* compleat and formall suppers: Vnto the * 4 factions in former time, of severall crewes running with Chariots atWhereas con∣trariwise vnder Nero, tublu can ad portu▪ tas reducta Circean games, hee added twaine; to wit the golden and purple livey. Players & Actours of enterludes hee forbad the open stage: but within house verily, he gran∣ted free and lawfull exercise of their Art. Hee gave commandement that no males should be guelded: And of such Eunuchs as remained in the hands of White Blew Red Greene Hucksters, hee abated the price and brought it downe to a meaner. By reason one time of an exceeding plentiful vintage, and as uch scarcity of Corne, supposing that by the* Who uelded pan peed and set them ut to sale. immoderate care imployed upon Vineyards, tillage was neglected hee made an Edict, That no man in all Italie should plant any newe young Vineyardes: and that in (a) foraine Provinces they should cut them all downe reserving at the most but the one halfe. Howbeit, hee continued not in the full execution of this Act: Some of the greatest offices he communicated indifferētly between Libertines & souldiers. He prohibited, that there should be twoGeminari cira the grea∣ter and the lesse as we read in Livie &c. Camps of the (b) legions. Item that any man should lay up more than a thousand Sesterces about the (c) Camp-ensignes. For that L. ANTONIUS intending rebellion in the wintering harbour of two Le∣gions, was thought to have taken heart and presumed more confidently upon the great summes of monie there bestowed in stocke. Hee added a fourth stipend also for souldiers, to wit, 3.Euery one about 15, s. 7 d. ob, sterling. peeces of gold by the poll. 8 In ministring iustice precise he was & industrious. Many a time, even in the cōmon place, sitting extraordinarily upon the Tribunal he reversed the definitiue sentēces of the Centumuirs, given for favour and obtained by flattery. He warned eftoones the commissioners and Iudges delegate, not to accommodate thēselues & give eare unto perswasive and Rhetoricall Of such bond men, as against their Lorde & Masters Right claimed free∣dome & vsed therein the plea of Ora∣tours. Assertions. The iudges that were bribed and cor rupted with monie hee noted and disgraced every one, together with their Asses∣sours uppon the bench. Hee mooved also and perswaded the Tribunes of the Commons to accuse Iudicially for extortion, and to force vnto restitution, a base and corrupt who by taking oney exerci∣sed his office otherwise th be ought. Aedile: yea and to call unto the Senate, for to have a Iurie mpan∣nelled upon him. Moreover, so carefull was hee to chastise as well the magistrates within Rome as the Rulers of Provinces abroad of their misdemeanours that never at any time they were either more temperate or iust in their places. The most part of whome after his dayes, we our selues have seene culpable, yea and brought into question for all manner of crimes. Having taken uppon him the censuring and re∣formation of manners, he inhibited that licentious libertie taken up in Theatres,
of beholding the playes and games pell-mell one with another in the quarter and rankes appointed for gentlemen. Diffamatorie libels written & divulged, wherin men and women of good marke were touched and taxed, hee abolished not with out shame and ignominie of the Authors. A man of Questours degree; because he tooke pleasure in Pupet-like gesturing and dauncing, hee remooved out of the Senate. From women of dishonest cariage, he tooke away the priviledge and use of their Licters: hee made them uncapable also of Legacies and inheritances. A gentleman of Rome hee rased out of the Roll and Tables of Iudges, for receiving his wife againe into Wedlocke, whome hee had before put away and sued in an action of adulterie. Some of both degrees, as well Senatours as Gentlemen, hee condemned, by vertue of the lawAgainst the filthy sin of Pae∣derastie or Sodomie. Scarinia. The Incestuous whoredomes commit∣ted by vestall votaries; negligently passed over, by his father and brother both, hee punished after sundrie sorts: The former delinquents in that kinde, with simple As to loose their head death: the later sort according to the auncient manner: (d) For, having given libertie unto the sisters Surnamed so of a familie in Rome. OCELLATAE as also to VAROMILLA, for the chuse their owne deaths, and banished those who had defloured them, hee afterwardes commanded, that CORNELIA Or Maxima Sc. Vestali, i. the chiefe of those Nunns, as Lady Priresse or Abbatesse. MAXIMILLA, who in times past had beene acquit, and a long time after was called into question againe and convicted, shold be buried quicke: and the parties who had committed incest with her, beaten with rods to death in the Comitium: except on alone a man of Praetours degree; unto whom whiles the matter remained yet doubtful, and because he had confessed and bewraied himselfe (upon his examination by torture which was uncertaine) he granted the favour of Exile. And that no religious service of the Gods should bee contaminated and polluted without condigne punishment, the monument or Tombe, which his freedman had built for a sonne of his with the stones appointed for the Temple of IUPITER CAPITOLINVS, hee caused his souldiers to demo∣lish: and the bones and reliques therein hee drowned in the Sea. 9 At the first hee abhorred all bloudshed and slaughter, so farre foorth, as that (while his father was yet absent) callinge to rememoraunce this Verse of Virgil. Impia quam coesisens est epulata iuvencis,2. Gecrgicorum, This hath rela∣tion to the last word (Ante,) in the verse prce∣dent. Ere godlesse people made their feasts With Oxen slaine, (poore harmelesse beasts.) Hee purposed fully to publish an Edict, Forbiddiuge to kill and sacrifice any Oxe. Of Cupiditatis quoque atque a∣varit By cove tousnesse hee meaneth the greedy dere of other mens goods: by ava∣rice, in this place the pinch ing expense of his owne. Covetousnesse also and avarice, hee gave scarcely the least suspition; either at any time when hee led a private life, or a good while after hee was Empe∣rour: but contrariwise rather, he shewed great proufes oftentimes, not of abstinēce onely but also of liberalitie. And whensoever he had bestowed gifts most bounti∣fully upon those that were about him, hee laied uppon them no charge before this nor with more earnestnesse, than to do nothing basely and beggerly. Moreover, one Legacie put downe in the last Will of RVSCIUS CAEPIO who had provided therin. That his eire should giue yeerely unto euery one of the Senatours, as they went into the Caria, a certaine summe of money, he made voide. Al those likewise, whose suits had hung and depended in the Chamber of the Citie, from before five yeeres last past, hee discharged and delivered from trouble. Neither suffered hee them to be sued and molested againe, but within the compasse of one yeare and with this condition, that the accuser (unlesse hee overthrew his Plaintife. adversarie by that time) should be banished for his labour. The Scribes and Notaries beelonging to the* Defendant.
Questours, who by an olde custome, (but yet against the Law Clodia) used to negotiate and trade, he pardoned onely for the time past. The  ends and can∣tels of grounds, which after the division of lands by the Old souldiers who had served out their full time. Veteran Souldiours, remained heere and there cut out, as it were, from the rest, hee graunted unto the olde owner and Landlords as in the right of Prescription. The false information of matters whereof the penaltie came to the Exchequer he repressed: and sharp∣lie punished such Informers. And this (by mens saying) was a speech of his, The Prince that chastneth not Promoters, setteth them on to promote. 10 But long continued he not in this aine, either of clemencie or of abstinence. And yet fell hee somewhat sooner to crueltie than to coveousnesse. A Schollar of the cunning player and counterfeit Paris, being as yet of tender yeeres, and at that time very sicke, hee murdered: for that, both in skill and also in countenance and feature of body he seemed to resemble his Maister. Semblably dealt he with HERMOGENES of Tarsus, for certaine figuresAs Ironia and Anti. hrasis. &c. whereby he seemed to glaunce at him. of Rhetorick interlaced in his Historie: and withall, crucified the Scrivenars and Writers that had copied it out. An (a) Housholder, for saying but these words, That the Phracian Who was ar∣med with a buckeler Fencer was (b) equall to the mirmillon; but inferiour to the setter forth of the of sword fight. Game, he caused to bee plucked downe from the scaffold in the Theater, into the plaine be∣neath; and there to be cast before the greedy Mastives, with this title, Ipie locu. ts Parmlarius. i. The The favourer of the armed fenser Thrax. above saide. Parmularius (c) hath blasphemed. Many Senatours, and some of them which had beene Conuls, hee killed. Among whom CIVICUS CEREALIS, in the very time when he was Proconsull in Asia; SALVIDIENUS ORFITUS and ACILIUS GLABRIO during their exile, he put to death; pre∣tendingDomitia longia that they practised Innovation in the State: all the rest every one formost slight causes. As for example, AELIUS LAMIA, for certaine suspitious iests (I must needs say) but such as were stale and harmlesse: namely, because unto DO∣MITIAN when (after he had taken from him Vocemsuam, or Laia, his voice as some ex∣poundi, his wife) he fell a praising of her As if he had uttered these words: This is meere iniury but I must say nothing. voice. he said, I (d) hold my* peace, HELAS. As also, for that unto TITUS, moving him to a second mariage, he made answer, Me kasu Gamsai Theleis? What! (and if I should wed another) would not you also marie her? Vnderstand here, and in the other follow∣ing (he slew or put to death) SALVIUS COCCEIA∣NUS, because he had celebrated the Birth-dayes minde, of OTHO the Emperour, his * Vnle. * METIUS POMPCSIANUS, for that it was commonly said, He had the Horoscope in his Nativity of an Emperour; and caried about him the Map or Ge∣ographical description of the For his father L.

SALLUSTIUS LUCULLUS Lieutenant generall of Britaine, for suffring cer∣taine speares of a new fashion to be called Or earth. Luculleae. IUNIUS RUSTICUS, for publishing the praises of * PAETUS THRASEA and * HELVIDIUS PRISCUS; and calling them most holy and upright persons. By occasion of which crimi∣nous imputation (charged upon RUSTICUS) hee packed away all Philosophers out of the Citie of Rome and Italie. Hee slewe also HELVIDIUS the Two most re∣nowmed warri ours of the Cahaginians, and mortall enimies of the Romaines. sonne, for that in an Enterlude (as it were), and by way of an Exoium upon the Stage, hee had under the persons of Paris and Onone O his owne name: acted the Divorse betweene* Who beeing persecuted by Nero cut his owne maister veines. * The sonne in lawe of Thrasea, even another Cato or Brutus and a man of most free speech in the behalfe of the Common wealth. * For the father, Vespafian had slaine before, Tractasset, i. * handled, al, taxasset, i., taxed or reproved.
, him and his wife. FLAVIUS SARINUS, one of his cousin germaines, because upon the Election day of the Consuls, the Crier chaunced to mistake a little, and before the people to pronounce him (being Consul Elect) not Consull, but Emperour. And yet, after his victorie in the Of the Fl vians and Vi∣tellians. Civill warre, ee became much more cruell: For, many of the adverse part, even such as  latetes, per censs in∣vesgatos lying id a good while were found out by those that were privie unto them, hee by devising a new kinde of torture made to confesse: namely by thrusting fire into the passage of their se∣cret parts: Some also hee dismembred by cutting off their hands. And this is for certaine knowne: That two onely and no more, of the most notorious among them, to wit, a Tribune of Senatours degree, and a Centurion, were pardoned: Who the sooner to shew that they were unguiltie, had proved themselves to have beene effeminate Catamites, and therefore could not possibly be of any reckoning, either with Capitaine or Souldiours. 11 Now, in this Crueltie of his hee was not onely excessive, but also subtill and craftie; comming upon men when they looked least for it. A Actorm sum∣ms. Controller of his owne, the very day before he crucified him, hee called into his bed-chamber, and made him to sit downe by him upon a pallet or beds side: he dismissed him light∣harted and merie: he deigned him also a favour and A dish of meate, &c: remembrance from his own supper. Vnto ARETINUS CLEMENS, a man of Consuls degree, one of his fa∣miliar minions and bloodhounds to fetch in Booties, when he purposed to con∣demne to death, he shewed the same countenance, as before time, yea and more grace than ordinary: untill at last, as hee Simul gestanti went with him in the same Licter, by occasion that hee espied the Informer against him, How sayest thou, quoth hee, CLEMENS, shall wee to morrow heare this most errant knave and varlt, what hee can say? And because hee would with greater contempt and disdaine abuse mens patience, hee never pronounced any heavie and bloudie sentence, without some preamble and preface of Clemencie: So that, there was not now, a surer signe of some horrible end and Conclusion, than a milde beginning and gentle exordium. Some that stoode accused of Treason he had inducted into the Senate house. Curia; and when he had premised a Speech, That hee would make triall that day, how deere hee was unto the Senate, hee soone effected thus much thereby, That the parties should have their iudgement, to suffer To have their necks fast loc∣ked in pillory, and so to be beaten with rodo death. More maiorum: And then, himselfe, affrighted as it were with the rigorous cruelty of that punishment, would intercede, in these words (for, it shall not bee impertinent to knowe the very same as hee delivered them) Permit my good LL. this to be obtained of your gracious Piety (which I know I shall hardly obtaine) that yee would doe so much favour unto these persons condem∣ned; as that they may choose, what death they will die: for, by this yee shall spare your owne eyes, and all the world shall know, that I was present in the Senate. 12 Having emptied his coffers with expences of buildings and Games exhibited to the people, as also with that . i. of 3. aurei. Stipend paied unto the Souldiours, over and a∣bove the former; hee assaied verily for easement of the charges belonging to the Camp, for to diminish the numbers and companies of Souldiours. But percei∣ving that heereby he was both in daunger of the Barbarians, and also never the lesse to seeke which way to be relieved from burdens: hee made no reckoning at all, but to raise booties, to rob and spoile he cared not how? The goods of quick
and dead both, were every where seized upon: who the Accusers were? or what the matter was? it skilled not. Sufficient it was, if any deede or word whatsoever, were obiected against one, to make it high treason against the Prince. Inheri∣tances, were they never so farre off and belonging to the greatest straungers, were held confiscate and adiudged to the Emperours Coffers, in case but one would come forth and depose. That hee heard the party deceased say whiles hee lived, That CAESAR (a) was his heire. But, above all others the (b) Iewes were most grievously plagued in the Exchequer. Vnto which were presented as many of them as ei∣ther professed in Rome to live as Iewes, or else dissimuling their Nation, had not payed the Tributes imposed upon them. I remember, that my selfe being a very youth was in place when an aged Iew, fourescore and tenne yeeres olde, was by the Or Master of the Exch. quer. Procuratour in a most frequent Assembly searched, whether he were circum∣cised or no? From his very youth nothing civill But proud & scornfull. and sociable hee was: bolde of hart, audacious withall, and as well in words as deede beyond all measure exces∣sive. Vnto CAENIS his fathers Concubine newly returned out of Istria, and of∣fring to kisse his lips (as her manner was) hee put forth his hand. Taking it hai∣nously that his Who married Titus his daugh ter Iulia. brothers sonne in Law had attending about him his, Servitours also, clad in faire white, he cried out, * An Hemisti∣chum out of Homer Iliad 2. Visses words: as if he should say I like not o may Casar There is no good Plurality In Lordship and in Sov'raigntie? 13 But when hee was mounted once to the Imperiall Seate, hee stucke not in the very Senate to make his boast, That he it was who had given unto his father and bro∣ther both, The Empire, and they had but delivered it up to him againe. Also when after Divorsement he brought home and remarried his wife, hee bashed not to give it out, that she was called to his Pulvinar  as if he had beene a God▪ for, their Gods and Goddesses they bestowed in certaine bed lofts called Pul viaria. sacred bed. Moreover, upon the day when hee made a great Du∣ring y• solemne Games exhibi∣ted vnto them. Dinner unto the people, hee was well content and pleased to heare their acclamation throughout the Theater in these words, Domino et Dominae, faeliciter. All happines, to our Lord and Lady. Likewise at the Solemnity of Trying Maisteries in the Palatium, when all the people besought him with great consent and one accord, to To his Sena∣tours place: restore PALFURI∣US SURA (one in times past degraded and thrust out of the Senate, but at that time crowned among the Oratours for his Eloquence) hee vouchsafed them no answere, but onely by voice of the publike crier Cōmaunded them Silence. With semblable arrogancie, when as in the Or behalfe. name of his Procuratours he endited any formall Letters, thus hee began, Our Lord and God thus cōmaundeth. Whereupon afterwards this order was taken up, that neither in the writing or speech of Cōmon talke any man he should be otherwise called. No Statues suffred he to be erected for him in* Ponderis certi. Sabellius rea∣deth centen, i, of an hundred pounds accor∣ding to Stati Popnius of Do∣mitian statue Sylv 5, Da Ca∣pitoli aetern sedibus rum. the Capitoll, but of gold and silver; and the same of a certaine weight, iust. As for two-fronted IANI and ARCHES with their foure Steedes, together with the Ensignes and Badges of Triumph, hee built them stately and so many in every quarter and Region of the Cittie, as that in one of the saide Arches there was this Mot in Greeke written,  (a). i. It is enough. Hee tooke upon him seventeene Consulships, more than ever any man before him. Of which, those * Quo niteant sacri cente pondere vultus Caesari
seven in the middle, hee bare continually one after another; and in manner all, in name and title onely: but none of them beyond the Not above 4 moneths. Kalends of May; and most, to the Not a fort∣night full. Ides onely of Ianuarie. Now, after his two Over the Cat∣ti and Dci. triumphs, having assumed into his stile the Addition of GERMANICUS, hee chaunged the Denomination of the moneths September & October; calling them after his owne names GER∣MANICUS and DOMITIANUS: for that in the September. one hee entred upon his Em∣pire, and was borne in the Octber. other. In these courses that hee tooke, beeing both terrible and odious also unto all14 men, surprised he was in the end, and murdred by his Minions. friends and freed men that were most inward with him; who together with his wife conspired his death. The last yeere and day of his life, the very houre also and what kinde of death he should die, he had long time before suspected. For when he was but a youth, the Chal∣daean Astrologers had fore-tolde him all. His Father also one time at supper, when hee saw him forbeare to eate Mushromes, laughed him to scorne as igno∣rant of his owne destinie, for that hee did not feare the sword rather. And there∣fore beeing alwaies timorous and strucken into his pensive dumps upon the least suspitions presented, hee was beyond all measure troubled and disquieted: In so much as it is credibly reported, that no other cause moved him more, to dispense with that Edict which hee had proclaimed for the cutting downe and destroying of Vineyards, than certaine Pamphlets and Libels scattered abroade with these verses. Alluding to the like verses of the Poet Even: which Ovide eemeth to expresse. 1. Fastoum in Lacinthus. Rode caper vitem, ta∣men hc cū fibis ad aras. In tu quod spargi corna possit, erit , . Eate me to roote, yet fruit will I beare still and never misse, Enough to poure on CAESARS head whiles sacrific'd he is. In the same fearefulnesse hee refused a new honour and that which never was devised before, offred by the Senate unto him, (though otherwise most eager and greedie of all such things) whereby they decreed, That so often as hee was Consull, the Gentlemen of Rome, as it fell by lot to their turnes, should in their rich and gay coates and with militare Launces march before him among the Lictours and other Sergeants and Apparitours. When the time also of that daunger drew neere which he suspected, he became perplexed every day more than other: and there∣fore he garnished the walls of those galleries wherein hee was wont to rome him∣selfe and walke, with the stone Phengites; by the images rebounding from the brightnesse whereof he might see before his face whatsoever was done behind his back. The most part of prisoners and persons in duresse, hee would not heare but being alone and in a secret place, taking holde first of their chaines in his owne hand. And because he would perswade his houshold servitours, that no man should be so hardy as to lay violent hand upon his owne Patrone to kill him, no though much good might ensue thereof; hee condemned EPAPHRODITUS the Secre∣tarie of NERO, for that it was thought, his Lord & Maister (after he was forlorne and forsaken of all) had his helping hand to dispatch him out of the world. To conclude, his Vnkles sonne (a) FLAVIUS CLEMENS (a man for his lither∣nesse15 and negligence most contemptible) whose sonnes being yet very little ones, hee had openly ordained to bee his Successours: and abolishing their former names, commanded the one to be called VESPATIAN and the other DOMITI∣AN, he killed sodainely, upon a slender & small suspition, even when he was scarce out of his Consulship. By which deede of his most of all, he hastened his own end
and destruction, For 8 moneths space together, so many lightnings were seene & reported unto him, that he cryed out, Now let Iupiter or God. him strike whom he will The Capitol was smitten and blasted therewith the Temple also of the FAVIAN Linage: like∣wise his owne house in the Palatium, and verie bedchamber.

He dreamed, that (b) MINERVA, whom he worshipped super∣stitiously, departed out of her Chappell, and said, She could not protect him any lon∣ger, for that shee was by IVPITER disarmed. But with no one thing was hee so much disquieted, as with the answere of ASCLETARIO the Astrologer; & the ac∣cident that chanced unto him thereupon. This ASCLETARIO beeing enformed against, and not denying that he had delivered what by his art and learning he fore∣saw, he questioned with and asked, what his owne end should be? & when he made answer & affirmed, That his destinie was to be trne in peeces with dogs, & that short∣ly after; he caused him presently to be killed but to reprove the rashnes and uncer∣taintie of his skill and profession, he commanded with all, that he should be buried with as great care as possibly might be. In the doing whereof accordingly, it fortu∣ned that by a sodaine tempest, the corps being cast downe out of the funerall fire, the dogs tare and rent peecemeale, when it was but halfe burnt and the same hap∣ned to be reported unto him among other Fabulus narra∣tions to make Princes merry tales and newes, of that day, as hee sat at supper, by LATINVS the player and counterfeite iester, who as hee passed by, chaunced to see and marke so much. 16 The day before his death, when he had given commandement that certaine Mushromes set before him shold be kept against the morrow, he added moreouer, if I may have vse of them & turning to those that were next him he said; The day fol∣lowing it would come to passe, that the Moone should embrue her selfe with bloud in the signe Aquarius, and some act be seene, whereof men should speake all the world over. But abovt midnight, so He dreame haply that Iun us Ruticus whom hee had killed came vp∣on him with a naked sword. Xphilin. skared he was, that he started out of his bed. Hereuppon in the morning betimes he gave hearing unto the Soothsayer sent out of Germanie, who being asked his opinion about the lightning, had foretold a chang in the state: and him he condemned. And whiles he scratched verie harde at a wert in his forehead which was festered and growne to be sore, seeing bloud run out of it, would God quoth he, this were all. Then asked he what was a clocke and insteede of the 11 Ofy• clock 5th. houre which he feared, word was brought for the nonce that it was the 6th. Being ioious hereupon that the danger was nowe past, and hastening to cherish his body and make much of himselfe, PARTHENIUS his principall Chamberlaine turned him an other way; sayinge there was one come who brought tidinges (I wot not what) of great cōsequēce & of a matter in no wise to be deferred. Voiding therfore all persons from him, he retired into his bedchamber, and there was he murdered. 17 As touching the manner how he was forlaide and of his death, thus much (in manner) hath beene divulged. Whiles the conspiratours were in question with themselues and doubtfull, when, and how, they should set upon him? that is to say, whether he bathed or sat at supper? STEPHEN the procuratour of Whom Eus∣bius reporteth to haue beene nipce by the sister of Flavi∣us Clement and a Christian, therefore con∣fined to the Iland Ponti. Domitilla, & at the same time in trouble for intercepting certaine monies, offered his advise and
helping hand, who having for certaine dayes before bound up aud enwrapped his left arme (as if it had beene amisse) with wool and swadling bandes, thereby to a∣vert from himselfe all suspition, at the very houre interposed fraud and made a lie. For, professing that hee would discover the conspiracy, and in that regarde being admitted into the chamber, as DOMITIAN was reading of a bill which hee pre∣ferred unto him, and therewith stood amazed, hee stabbed him beneth in the very share neere unto his privie parts. When hee was thus wounded and beganne to struggle and resist; CLODIANVS aCertaine soul diers were so tearmed, Coicularius, and MAXIMVS afreed man of Parthenius, and SATVRIVS the Deane or Decurion of the Cham∣berlaines with one out of his owne swordfencers schoole, came in uppon him, gave him seven wounds, and killed him out right. A youth and page of his, who stood by (as his wonted manner was) because he had the charge of his bedchamber (a) LA∣RES, and was present at this murder committed, made this report moreover, that DOMITIAN, at the very first wound given, immediatly bad him reach theOr rapier dagger, that lay under his pillow, and to call in his ministers and servitours: but at the beds head hee found nothing at al thereof save the haft onely: and as for the doores besides, they were all fast shut: Also, that DOMITIAN in this meane space, tooke hold of STEPHEN, bare him to the ground and wrestled with him a longe time: That he one while assaied to wrest his sword out of his hands, another while (albeit* 17▪ th. of Sep∣tember, his fingers were hurt and mangled) to plucke out his eyes. Well, killed he was, the 14th day before the Kalends of October, in the 45th yeere of his age, and the 15th of his Empire. His dead bodie was caried foorth upon the common bierre by the ordinary bearers: and PHYLLIS his nource burned it in a funerall fire, within a country manour of his owne neere unto the Citie, situate upon the high way Lati∣na. But the reliques thereof shee bestowed in the Temple of the FLAVIAN family, and blended the same with the ashes of IULIA the daughter of TITVS, whom she had reared and brought up. Of Stature he was tall, his countenance modest, and given much to (a) rednes: his eyes full and great, but his sight very dimme. Besides, faire he was and of come ly presence especially in his youth: well shaped all his body throughout, excepting his feet: the toes wherof were of theRestrictiores drawen inward shortest. In processe of time, he became dis∣figured and blemished with baldnesse, with a fat grand-panch and sclender shanks: & yet they grew to be so leane upon occasion of a long sickenes. For his modesty & shame facednesse he so well perceiued himselfe to be commended, that one time before the Senate he gave out these words, Hitherto certainly ye haue liked wel of my minde and of my countenance. With his bald head he was so much yrked, that hee tooke it as a reproach unto himself, if any man els were either in bord or good ear∣nest twitted therewith: albeit in a certaine little booke, which he wrot unto a freind of his, concerning the nourishment & preseruation of the haire of the head, he by way of consolation both to that friend and also to himselfe, inserted thus much. .

Many men have seene him oftentimes▪ during his retiring abode at Alba, to kill with shot an hun∣dred wild beasts of sundrie sorts at a time▪ & of very purpose to sticke some of them in the head; so, as that with two shoots hee would set his shafts in their fronts like a paire of hoes. Sometimes he would drive his arrows point blanke so iust against the palme of a childs right hand, standing farre of and holding it foorth stretched open for a marke, as they should all directly passe through the voide spaces bee∣tweene the fingers, and do him no harme at all. 20 All liberall studies in the beginning of his Empire he neglected: albeit hee tooke order to repaire the Libraries consumed with fire, to his exceeding great charges: making search from all parts for the copies of bookes lost, and sendinge as farre as toIn Aegypt. ALEXANDRIA, (a) to write them out and correct them. But never gave he his minde to know histories; or to have any skill in verse, or to write ought, though necessitie so required. Except it were the commentaries and acts of TI RIUS CAESAR hee never used to read any thing. For his Epistles, Orations and Edicts, hee employed the wits of other men to drawe and rame them. Howbeit, his ordinary speech was not unelegant: and other whiles you shold have him come foorth even with mirable sentences and Apophthegmes. As for example; Would God quoth he, I were as faire and well fauoured, as METIVS thinkes himselfe to be: And seeing ones headOf two co∣lours party coloured, with yellowish and white silver haires inter∣mingled: Hee said it wasA kind of delicate drinke among the Romains, snow and mede mixed together. His saying it was, that the condition of Princes was most miserable, who could not bee credited as touching a conspiracie plainely detected unlesse they were slaine first. 21 Whensoever his leasure served, he solaced himselfe with dice play, even uppon the very worke daye, and in morning houres.

He feasted often, & that very plentifully, but his feasts were short and after a snatching manner: Certes, hee never sat past sunne setting, nor admitted any reare bankets after supper. For, towards bedtime, hee did nothing, but in a secret chamber walke by himselfe alone. 22 To fleshly lust he was over much given. The ordinary use of VENVS, as it were a kind of exercise, hee named Clinopale, as one would say, bed-wrestling.

And such a Tribune militarie was CAE∣SAR in this place. (b) Rogatione Plotia. A bill preferred, and the same as a Lawe not yet enacted, was called Rogatio, (as one would say) Interrogatio: for that the people were demaunded and asked their opinions in this forme of words. Velitssné, jubeatisné Quirites &c Is it your will and pleasure, yee citizens of Rome, that such a thing should passe, or no? And of him who proposed

(a) COMMITIVM, was one part of the Forum Ro∣man,9 wherein stood the Rostr, and the people used to assemble for election of Magistrates, for making of Lawes, and hearing of publike Orations. (a) SVLLA, in the time of his proscription and11 otlawing of the aduerse faction of C. MARIUS, ordained two talents for every one that killed any of the proscribed and brought him his head, not spa∣ring Master or Father: but that the servant might kill his master and the sonne his Father; nay hee made it death if they saved any such. (b) Of Cornelius Sulla. (a) T. LABIENVS. CICERO and HOR∣TENSIVS pleaded for him. (b) For, to kill a Tribune of the Commons, who21 were Sacrosancti and , would heare the Action Perduellionis. And that was laide to Rabirius a Senatour his charge, although indeede hee slewe him not, but one Sc: mary, when he was killed, hee caused his head, in most ludibrious manner to be caried about. Now was the crime Perduellionis, all one with treason against the Common wealth, or a principall person of State: or else Felonie in some high degree. (c) The liberty of appealing unto the people, was graunted by Tullus Hostilius the third king of the Ro∣maines, As appeareth by LIVIVS, in the case of Ho∣ratins, for killing his owne sister▪ (a) Q.

(b) A Lawe is said to be promulged, after it is once proposed for to bee considered upon, untill it be ful∣ly enacted: during which time, reason were alledged for the convenience thereof, or otherwise; and free it was for any man who had a voice to impugn or allowe it. (c)  and Populares, were in the citie of Rome opposite either against other, and are lively described by Cicer in his Oration,  Sextio, in the  wordes. Do gener in hc civitate fmper suerunt corū, qui versari in rep. atque in ase excellentius gerere studu∣runt. Quibus ex generibus, alteri Populares, alter, Opti∣mates & haberi & esse voluerūt. Qui ea quae faciebant, quaeque dicebant, multitudini cunda esse volebant, Popu∣lares: qui autem ita se gerebant, ut sua censilia optimo cui∣ probentur; Optimates habebantur▪ Item. Qui ergo est Optimas? qui De numero si quaeris , nequ enim ater stare posses. Sunt principes consilij publici. Sunt qui corū sectim sequuntur. ▪Sunt  Ordinum omines quibus patet Curia, Sunt municipes Rusticiq▪ Rom▪ Sunt negotia gerentes▪ sunt etiā Libertii Opt. mates Wher∣by it appeareth, that those were counted Optimates, not simply of noble birth, and of great wealth &c. But were they Patriij, Equites, or . If they stoode for good thinges, or favoured those that so did; Nay, whether they were Burgesses of Free Bur∣roughes, yeomen of the Country following husban∣dry, Merchants and Tradesmen, or very Libertines, so they affected good causes, they were reckoned in the number of Optimates. On the other side, as many as aymed onely at this, to please and content the multitude, were they neuer so well borne or otherwise qualified, they went in the rancke of Po∣pulares; so that it seemeth, that Populares were the Forensis factio, that LIVIE writeth of, and whome Q. FABIVS reduced all in to the foure Tribus urbans; and Optimates, the Tribus rustic, wherein was  poulus, fauto & cultor bonorum. Thus much of the strickt signification of this worde Optimates. But for as much as commonly fewe of the Nobilitie and Gentry of Rome were Popular, and as fewe of the Communaltie favourers of the best things usually; by these Optimates, or the better sort, are ment the Patritij and Gentlemen. (d) Vpon the Kalends of Ianuary . the first day of the yeare, the Consuls entred their office, on which day attended they were obsequiously by those better sort of the citizens and their friends, waiting upon them, when they went vp into the Capitoll for to Sacrific, and home againe. On this day likewise it appeareth, that CAESAR began his Pretor∣shipp. (e) This purple Robe bordered, called Pr∣texta, was a Garment not proper to the Pretors one∣ly, but to other Magistrates also. Embrodered it was or garded about with purple. For PLNI writeth, that ētulus pinter Aedil , wore in his Robe, purple of a duble die, called thereupon, Di∣baph. And thereupon it was called in Greeke . And not onely citie-Magistrates, but Priestes and children of  birth used the same. Setting a side the border of purple, it was otherwise while. (f) By Curia simply without any adiunction, is mēt Curia Hostili, as witnesseth Alex. ab Alexādr . A statly place built by . TVLLIVS HOSTILIVS in the Forum Romanum, neere unto the Rostra: where, as in the Parliament house assembled the Senators ordina∣rily to consult upon the affaires of State. For, other places there were, under the name of CVRIA, wherein likewise the Senat met together, as CVRIA POMPEII, in which CAESAR was murdered, Dr Augusti &c. but then they had their addition. I am not ignorant, that other CVRIEA there were for the Pontifies and Priestes. To say nothing how the people was divided into CVRISA. id est, Parishes, and in every of them was a CVRIA, and a superin∣tendent or Curate called Curio. (g) Superiour Magistrates, bee the Consuls
Pretours and Censors, the rest as Aediles, Questors, were accounted inferiour. &c. (a) CRASSVS is named for one, who entred in∣to18 a bond for him of 830. talents, what time CAE∣SAR deeply indebted, said, his millies & qingenties centena millia nullū sibi adsse oportere, ut nilid haberet, id est, that 250. millions of sesterces would but set him cleare with the world. (b) By the Lawes, none might make suit for a try∣umph, but whiles they remained absent without the citie, nor for a Consulship cept they were present as priuate persons within the citie. In these streights, CAESAR made choyce to be Consull, and gave ouer his right to a triumph, for the victorie obteyned in Spaine over the Calleci and Lusitanes.19 (a) THE manner was at Rome, that they who sved for Magistracies should for the obteining of the peoples voices and suffrages make promise of cer∣taine summes of money to be distributed amonge them and such as were appointed to deale the saide Largesse, they called Divisores. Now, for that the Election of Consuls passed by Comitia centuriata that is, by the assembly of the people, by their centuries or Hundreds according as Ser. Tullus first or∣deyned them, therefore was this money to bee devided amongst them, as they gave their voices. (b) Provinces signifie three things, the countries conquered or yeilded, and the same governed by Roman Deputies: and this is the proper and primative signification thereof. also the Region wherein any Roman Generall by commission from the state maketh warr: and last of all, what publick function or affaires soeuer is to be administred. In which sence it is heere taken. (c) Either for the cutting downe of trees for the best cōmodities: or els for a guard to be kept neare vnto them, to suppresse the outrage committed by theeues, haunting the same and robbing and spoyling pas∣sengers. (d) To amend the waies and beaten pathes, where, either wayfairing men or beastes shoulde passe with more ase. And verily these were base mattes and requiring no great forces to bee performed: and so by consequence, the Consuls employd therein could compasse no greate pro∣jects and therefore lesse to be feared. (e) This societie bred the Ciuill warre that after ensued, betweene CEASAR and POMPEIVS vnto which the Poet Lucan alluded writing thus. T causa malorum Facta tribus dominis communis Roma.20 (a) As well to avoide tedious canuassings and consultations as to prouide for the historie and memoriall of euery matter. (b) One of the Consuls onely had the twelue Lictors going before him, with the rods and axes: to witt, each of them their moneths, by turnes one after the other, Ne si ambo fascs baberent duplicatus terror videretur. As LIVIE wri∣teth: An ordinance as auncient well neere, as the first institution of Consuls. (c) ACCENSVS, an officer attendant vpon Ma∣gistrate, so named ab acciend, id est, of giuing∣summons to any for appearance, or of calling any to the Magistrate. (d) Great indulgences, immunities and priuiled∣ges were graunted by the Ranes vnto those that had j trium liberorum: but as APPIAN writeth more particularly to the explication of this place, there assembled 20000 together, craving maintenāce and foode euery man, for three children and more that they had. (e) Publicanes were they that either for a cer∣taine rent tooke to ferme the publicke revenewes of the City, whether it were corne, pasturage, cu∣stomes, impostes, &c. or vndertooke by the grosse to make provision for the state, or to build and re∣paire any citie-workes. &c.2 (a) THIS was not more maiorum, for then his sentence should haue bene demaunded first, that by the Censors was elected Princeps Senatus. id est, President of the Counsell: but extraordinarily, as appeareth by Aul. Gel. Noct. Attic. lib. 4. cap. 10. & lib. 14. cap. 7.2 (a) FOR as LIVIE testifieth lib. 38. The Romanes triumphed oftener over the Gaules, than euer all the world beside. (b) Which VATINIVS a Tribune of the Commons proposed in the behalfe of IVLIVS CEA SAR, that for five yeares together, hee should (without casting lots, and the Senates decree), go∣verne CISALPINE Gaule, together with Illyri∣cum: contrarie to the Lawe Sempronia, which pro∣vided that such Provinciall Gouernours, or LL.

(c) CISALPINA GALLIA, is that, which lay betweene Italy and the Alpes, divided into CISPADANA and TRANSPADANA, according to the site thereof, either on this side, or beyond the river PO: it caried the name likewise of TO∣GATA, either because it was much inhabited by the Romanes, or for that vnto this Province the Romane Robe TOGA was graunted, or el in regard that the saide Province was more civill and peaceable, than the other called TRANSAL∣PINA. (d) COMATA GALLIA, a part of GAL∣LIA TRAHSALPINA, lying beyond the Alpe, from Italy toward Spaine: so called for the long haite that they wore: and  put for the whole TRANSALPINE Province, like as BRA∣CHATA, one part of the said Province, so called of a certaine kinde of apparell, is taken for the whole and confounded with Comata. (e) This terme, which they commonly use, who threaten such as they contemne, may be drawen to an obsceene and filthy sense, not heere to bee named: and albeit CEASAR
hereby was galled to the quick, as privie to himselfe, of the passive abuse of his body with K. NICO∣NEDES, yet in his answere thereto, he turned it to another signification. (f) Warlike women, so called (as some write) of their paps which they did cut off and fear, therby to bee more expedite and nimble in fight, and to shoot at greater case. See Strabo, Iustin. Q.

(a) WHO stoode in Election for the Consul∣shippe:24 so called of the whited robe, which they put on▪ who sued for such Magistracies and places of Honour. For whereas the ordinarie gowne that Ro∣maine citizens daily ore, was white of it selfe, a∣gainst such a time they made it whiter with chalke: so that a difference there was betweene Toga aba, and candida, whereupon they were called Candidat, as appeareth by Macrobius, and T. Liuius, lib. 4 ab ur. condita (b) Supplication, was a solemne Honour done un∣to the Lord Generall of a Prouince upon some no∣table victorie For the manner was, that LL. Go∣uernours, after they were by their Souldiers salute by the name of Emperour. 1 Soueraigne commanders, should send them Letters dight with Lawrell unto the Senate, wherin they required both to be stiled by the saide name, and also to have solemne processi∣ons made by the people in the Temples, and thanks∣giuing unto the Gods for their good successe, which solemnity, at the first continued but one day, as T. LIVIVS reporteth in the 304. yeare after the foundation of Rome: but processe of time, it grewe to 4▪ and 12. And at length, CEASAR obtained it for 15. yea and 20. daies together, as PLV∣TARCH testifieth in his life, and himselfe in his owne Comentaries, of the Gauls warre. (a) Super HS. millies. This character HS. standeth6 for a Siluer coyne in Rome, which is the three halfe pence, farthing, cue, the 4. part of Denarius: & is called Sextertius quasi sesquitertius: as one would say, valu∣ing two brasen Asses and the halfe of a third: so common a peece of money there, that Numus put ab∣solutely alone, standeth for it and no other coine: so that Millies sestertium and millies nummum, are both one. Now if the Romaine Denier bee valued at vij d. ob. with vs, and 100. Deniers arise to one pound star∣ling: this summe here set downe, that is to say, a Sesterne multiplyed by the Aduerbe Millies, amoun∣teth by just account unto 25000. li. starling▪ And thereto for the overdeale or surplufage ducenties sester∣tium, which is one 5. part of the former summe, it maketh up 70000. li. sterling. A thing that may be thought incredible, but that we reade that CEASAR himselfe saide, hee was 250. millions in debt when he went into Spaine, and P. CLODIVS, whom MI∣LO slewe, dwelt in a house, the purchase whereof cost him almost 15. millions. No marvell there∣fore, if so many houses, which CAESAR must needs buy for the plot of ground aforesaid and in so po∣pulous a city, cost not so little as a hundred mil∣lions▪ (a) THE dole given by a Prince or great man27 unto the people, was properly called a Congiarie, which word tooke name of the measure Congi a∣mong the Romaines, consisting of 6. Sextarij, and is answerable to our gallon: by which Oyle or wirie was giuen. Howbeit , any such publicke munificence, in mony or otherwise is so called: and in this place, by it are ment other gifts bestowed u∣pon private persons. (a) IN some copies, wee reade, Quando nec28 plebisicito POMPEIVS postea abrogasset. To this sence. That CAESAR beeing absent, was not eligible by vertue of an Act made by POMPEIVS to that effect, considering he had not abrogated the same by any ordinance of the people, but onely of his owne authority corrected it after it stood upon record in the city chamber.30 (a) THIS hath reference unto his violent dea∣ling with his fellowe Consull Bibulis.

Rome, as PLINIE39 witnesseth, was divided into 14. regions, and eve∣ry one of these had their severall Stage Playes by themselues. (b) The Games Circenses, I take to be so cal∣led of the Greet Cirque or Shewplace, wherein they were performed: and not of swordes, wherewith they were environed, as one would say, Circa en∣ses. Indeede these games resembled the Olympick in Greece by ELIS, where the runners with cha∣riots were hemed in of the one side with the run∣ning river, and of the other with swordes pitched pointwise, that they should hold on the race direct∣ly, and not swerve aside without danger. Herein were performed running with horses and chariots, Iusting, ult, and Turnement: baiting and chasing of wild beasts, &c. (c) Pyrrhica: Of some, thought to bee the same that ENOPLIA, was a kinde of Moriske daunce, after a warlike manner in harnois, deuised in Creta first by Pyrrhus. Plin. lib. 7. Nat. Hist. cap. 56. In which young gentlemen were trained to exer∣cise all parts of the body by sundry gestures as well to avoide all venues and defende themselues, as to annoy and  the enimie. (d) This DECIMVS LABERIVS was a Po∣et also, that kind which wrote wanton Poems or Iasciviovs Comoedies called Mimi. For, howsoever in all Stage Playes, there is represented a lively i∣mitation in gesture and voice of others, yet in these Mimi, these same are done after a more licentious manner and without all modestreverence, even in unseemely and filthy arguments: as OVID testifi∣eth in these words, imitante, turpia Mimi. It see∣meth therefore, that as well the Poemes as the Au∣thours and Actour be called Mimi (e) Orchestra, is here taken for the most commo∣dious place in the Theatre, wherein the Senators and Nobles of Rome were allowed to sit and be∣hold the Stage Playes, apart from the people. For so the Poet IVVENAL understandeth it in these words, Similem que videbis Orchestram & populum. As torching this Orchestra and the Poet LABE∣RIVS above named, SENECA in his second booke of Controversies, and third controversie re∣porteth thus. IVLIVS CAESAR at the solemnitie of his Playes, brought LABERIVS forth to act u∣pon the Stage: and when he had made him a gen∣tleman, or Knight of Rome, willed him to take his place among them of that degree, but as he came toward them, they all sat so close and neere oe a∣nother, that there was no row e for him. Now by the way, you must understand that CICERO then in place,   himselfe an ill name, for that hee was no fat and faithfull friend, either to POMPEIVS, or to CEASAR, but a flatterer of them both. Againe, CAESAR at that time had chosen many unto the range of Senatours, partly to supply and make up their number, which during the late civill warres was much diminished, and in part to gratifie those who had well deserved of him and the side CICERO therefore alluding to the extraordinary number of newe Senatours, sent un∣to LABERIVS as hee passed by, this word meri∣ly, Recepissem te nisi angustè sederent▪ i. I would have taken you to mee and give you a place, but that I▪ sit my selfe very streight. Then LABERIVS re∣turned this pleasant answere backe unto him, Atqui solebas duabus sellis sedere. i. And yet you were wont to sit upon two stooles, skoffing at him for his double dealing with POMPEIVS and CEASAR. (f) The Troy fight, was in warlike manner on horsbacke, brought by Aeneas into Italy. The manner whereof is described by Virgil Aeneid. 5. (g) These Goales called in Latine Mets, abovt which the horses and chariots ranne, were in fashi∣on broad beneath and sharpe above, in manner of Pyramides, Steeples or cocks of hey, and for their mater, of wood first, or of oft gritstone, but after∣wards of marble and laid over with gold. Concer∣ning this Cirque why CAESAR enlarged it and brought water round about it, Reade PLINIE 8. lib. cap. 7. and 36. lib cap. 15. Naturall Hist. (h) To try maisteries in footemanshippe, lea∣ping, flinging the coit or hammer,, darting & wre∣stling: which Game was called Pentathlon, of those five kindes of exercises.

(b) Patritios allegit: For those that were Plebei generis, might bee Senatours: or els, as so ne ex∣pound it, he advanced divers to the degree & ranck of the Patritij. (c) All but Consuls, Praetors and Censors, were counted inferiour Magistrates. (d) For the Censours with the publicke Nota∣ries ordinarily tooke this reviewe, and that in Cam∣pus Martius, and Villa publica. (e) By reason of so great a number recei∣ving corne from the State, the purveyance hereof stoode the citiy yearely as Plutarch wri∣teth in a thousand two hundred and fiftie ta∣lents. (f) For they might discontinue out of Italy e∣leven yeares. Plutarch. (g) Such were called Conites, or quasi ex cohort Praetoria, as it were gentlemen of the privie cham∣ber. (h) Nova talarum. To wt, when the old bonds being cancelled, and therby former debts r∣mitted, new obligations were made. (i) Parricid i. Parenticid, such as kill father, mother, brother, sisters and such like, nere in bloud▪
as also, any other man or woman wilfully, according to the Lawe of K. NVME, Si quis hominem liberum scs onti duit parricida est. (a)  convictos. Such governours as by way of extortion pilled and polled the Provinces which they ruled: who after their time expired, were many times called judicially to their an∣sweres. (b) Many Lawes there were called Sumptuaria nd Ciariae, to restraine the excesse at the table, as namely nia, Licinia, , Iulia &c. Read. Aul. Gell. Noct. Att. lib. 2. cp. 24. Macro. Saturnal. lib. 3.

(c) Which CRASSVS before him had not done; and therefore was overthrowne.45 (a) COMITIALI MOREO, so called, for that the assemblies of the people called Cemitia, were dissolved and broke up by occasion thereof, in case any one among them fell downe of that dis∣ease, according as Q. SERENVS SEMOICVS hath testified in these verses. cap. 57. Est morbi species subiti, cui  ab illo est, Quod fieri nobis suffragia justa recusant. Spe etenim membris aci  caduci, Concilium populi laes horrend . As also for that, they who were subject thereto, fell into a fit thereof ordinarily at such assemblyes, if they were crossed in their suites and businesses there, CORNELIVS CELSVS calleth it Morum marem, i. a great sicknesse. It is named likewise  i. the sacred disease, either because it affe∣cteth the heade, which is the most honorable place of the body and the eate of the Soule, or in re∣gard of the greatnesse thereof, which the Gracians expect by the word . Also pilepsia, for the so∣daine invasion of it. HERCVLEVS MORVS, either for the strength of the malady, whereby a man is forced to fall, or because HERCVLES was troubled therewith. PLINIE nameth it, S. u∣ticum, for the hurt that it doth vnto the bodie: O∣thers , or that upon it, men fall to the groūd: it is called Moreover Lunati, of the Moone: because it keepeth time with the course of the Moone, or apprehendeth them that are borne in the change thereof, as the same SERENS re∣porteth in these verses. Huc quoque  dubiae pertempora ▪ Conceptum talem, quem saepe ruina profit. Lastly HIPPOCRATES nameth i . i. puerilem morbum, for that children bee subject thereto: whereupon some tearme it, Maier pu∣erorum. (b) This manner of going so loosely girt, might signifie a dissolute and  wanton. Here∣upon CICERO made cl oyce in the civill warre to take part with POMPEIVS against CEA∣SAR: And when one asked him how it came to passe, that in siding with POMPEIVS hee was so much overseene, for that hee had the worse, this answere hee made Praecictura me decepit: i. de∣ceived I was by that loose guiding of his. (a) CAESAR derived his pedegree from IŪ∣LVS49 the sonne of AENEAS whose mer was VENVS. (b) The grace which is in the Latine cannot be expressed well in English, because the word, Sube∣git carieth a double sence, the one signifieth the conquering of a nation, and so it is taken in the former place, as it is applyed to Gaule: the other, the wanton abuse of the bodie: in which accep∣tion it is to bee understood in reference to CEA∣SAR, abused by K. Nichedes.50 (a) In the two fold sense likewise of these two words, Tertia and Deducta lyeth the pleasant grace of this conceipted speech. By the one, may be understoode, that a third part of the price was deducted: by the other Cicero ment, That her daughter TERTIA was brought by her to his bed.51 (a) THIS Distichon, or j verses, which his souldiers after their licentious manner in the Try∣umph chaunted may thus be Englished. Looke to your wives, yee cytizens, a lcher bald wee bring. In Gaule Adultery cost thee gold, heere'tis  borrowing. For, as hee borrowed of other men, so hee lent or paide as much againe, in that his owne wife POMPEIA, as is thought, was kept by P.52 CLODIVS. (a) SVCH a vessell as this named here Thela∣megs, and by Seneca 7. lib. e Peneficijs ∣lata,  , as witnesseth ATHENE∣VS had, which caried in length  dū. halfe a furlong, in bredth. 30. cubites, and in heigth little lesse then 40. (b) Impudicitiae, I observe, that both in this Authour and also in other approved writers, Impudicitia, is properly and peculiarly taken for that abhominable uncleannesse onely,
which is named Sodoe: Like as Pudicitiae, for the integritie of the bodie, and cleare nesse from that detestable filthinesse. And so, Pudics and Impudicus are to bee vnder∣stoode. (a) WHICH commeth to 23. pound, 8. shil∣lings,54 9. pence, and is not much more than halfe the worth. According to Budes it was 7. pound dim of Siluer for one of Gold. (b) For it was esteemed a great honour to be called Allies and Associates, or stiled Kings, by the people of Rome. (c) ANTICATONES. Whereas CICERO56 had written in the prayse of CATO [VTI∣CENSIS] he wrote two bookes against the said CATO, which he called Anticatones. (a) VENVS surnamed Genitrix i. Mother, CAESAR honoured, as the goddesse from60 the which he was descended, by IŪLVS or A∣CANIVS her nephew. (b) The principall ensigne or standerd of the Romane Legion was an Aegle of Siluer, reared upon a Speare toppe, the poynt whereof be∣neath was sharpe, and fastened into the ground: and the same stood within a little shrine, not to bee remooved, but when the Armie was on foote. (a) DION, lib. 42. and APPIAN. Civil. 2. report this otherwise: namely, that he forsoke the said Coat armour (it clogged him so much) and so the Aegyptians got it. (a) EVIATICO suo. Albeit riaticum proper∣ly6 signifyeth the store and provision set by for a journey, yet heere it is put for the wealth and substance of a souldier: like as in Horat. lib. 2. epist. 2. Luculli miles collecta vatica multis Aerumis, &c. In which sense,  likewise in Greeke is taken. (b) PLINIE calleth it Lapsana. lib. 19 cap. 8. Natural. Histor. A kinde of wilde worte or cole. (c) To be tithed, i. euerie tenth man to suffer death. Appian. (d) Which ordinarily consisted of 550. foote∣men, and 66. horse, whereof ten went to a Le∣gion. Some, I wot well had more, some fewer. But for this place it may suffice, that it was the tenth part of a Legion. (a) QVIRITES. i. Romane Citizens. As70 freed now from their alleageance, which by their military oath they were bound vnto. (a) WHICH was a great abuse offered, a∣mong71 the Barbarians, who set great store by their beards, and suffered them to grow very long. (a) THENSA or Tensa & ferculum a Chariot76 of Silver or Yvorie with a frame in it sustaining the Images of the gods, which was drawen in most solemne and stately manner unto the Pul∣vinar. (b) Pulvinar. A bed lost, or place where certaine rich beds were made for the said Images to be laid upon. (c) FLAMIN. A certaine priest, bearing the name of that god, for whose service he was insti∣tuted. As Dialis of IVPITER, Martialis of MARS, Quirinlis of ROMVLVS, &c. Cic. 2. Phil. saith that M. ANTONIVS, was Flamen to Iulius Caesar. (d) Luperci, were certaine young mn, who at the Licentions feast, Lupercalia instituted to the ho∣nour of PAN LYCAVS, otherwise called IV∣NVS, by ROMVLVS and REMVS, ran up and downe naked in the Citie of Rome. A new kind of these Luperci ordained CAESAR, of his owne name called IVLIANI. At this feast Lupercalia, M. ANTONIVS played the part of a Lupercu, at which solemmue, when CAESAR sat in a Throne of Gold, arayed in a purple robe, the said M AN∣TONIVS attempted to doe upon his head the royall Band, called a Diademe▪ Cicero. (e) Whereas, before it was called , he named it Iulius. (f) This was Caninius Rebitus: of whose Con∣sulship, there go divers estes, as namely these, whereof CICERO was the Author, a vigilant Consull we have had of CANINIVS, who in all his Consulship never slept winke. Also, a con∣sell we have had so severe and Censar-like, as that during his Consulship, no man dined, no man sup∣ped, no man so much as once slept. Likewise PI∣HALVS said of him▪ Heretofore we had Fla∣mines Diales, and now wee have Consuls Diales, playing upon the aequivocation or double sense of the word Dialis, which being derived of  Iupiter signifieth his Flamin: but of Dies. i. a day, betokeneth a day Consul or Flamin. (a) ACCORDING to LVCANA. Omnia77 Casar era. Caesar was all in all. (b) Well knowne it is that SVLLA was pas∣sing well learned both in Greeke and Latine. But in that he resigned up the absolute power of his Dactatorship, which he tooke upon him, for an hundred and twentie yeares, that is to say, for ever. CAESAR said he was no Gramarian, quia nescivirit dictare, quod munus est Grammatici: allu∣ding to the word ambiguus dictare i. to endite, or give precepts as Grammarians doe to their schol∣lers, as also, to commaund absolutely, whereof it may seeme that Dictator tooke the name▪ (a) WHO were in number. 10. (b) Or, if I may for Pontius Aquila: spoken by78 way of a scornefull Ironia. (a) PLEBEIO, and not Plebi, for the com∣mens79 could not endure that name, as may appeare by CICEROES words in his second Philippica or invective against M. ANTONIVS. Thou shewest the Diademe. The people all over the common place gave a groane thereat. Thou wer about to set it upon his head, to the great griefe and sorrow of the people, hee rejected it, with as great joy and applause of theirs. (b) The name OPTIMVS, MAXIMVS, wherewith the auncients styled Iupiter, signifieth
most bountifull and most powerfull: wherein it is observed that Bountie goeth before Power: because as M. TVLLIVS writeth, it is better and more acceptable to doe good vo all, then to haue power ouer all. (c) In Aegypt: A renowmed Citie, built by King ALEXANDER the great: for the plea∣sant site much commended, and therefore might bee affected by CAESAR: at which, there is no day almost through the yeare, but the In∣habitants behold the Sunne shining cleare up∣on them▪ And which AMMIANVS calleth Verticem omnium civitatum, i. The chiefe of Cit∣ties. (d) Ilium, a Citie where Try stood: The Citizens whereof, as STRABO writeth, CAE∣SAR in memoriall of his progenitots from thence descended, and namely, from IVLVS or AS∣CANIVS the Sonne of AENEAS, had indow∣ed with many franchises and immunities, and therefore it caried some likelihood, that he ment there to make his abode. (e) These Quindeeim-viri, or fifteene men, were instituted in the daies of CORNELIVS SYLLA with this addition Sacrorum: unto whose charge it appertained to see that Sacrifices and Divine service, that supplications, and proces∣sions, expiations, & ceremoniall rites should bee duely performed, as also to pervse the bookes and prophesies of SIBYLLA: At first they were but two, called , afterwards x. under the name of Decemviri sacris faciendis. Alex ab Alex. lib. 3. Genial. dierum. cap. 16. (a) BONVM factum. A forme of preface80 which in olde time they use boni omnis causa, be∣fore their Edictes and decrees▪ &c. so commonly, as that these two Capitall letters B. F. did beto∣ken the same as ordinarily, as S. C. stand for Senatus consultum. It had the same use, as In no∣mine Dei with us. (b) Some take these Brachae, whereof Brachata Gallia, a par of Transalipine, Gaule tooke name, For frize rugges striped with sundrie colours, which may resemble Irish mantles; but I sup∣pose them to be a kinde of course breches, much like to the Irish trousses, but that they are more full. (c) By rising up unto him, and shouting or applauding as he passed along▪ (d Vinam viveres. (e) Brutus quia Reges ejecit consul primus factus est: Hic, quia consules ejecit, Rex postrem factus est. (f) Certaine bridges there were for the time made, upon which the Tribes passed when they gave their voyces in Lampus Martius, at their so∣lemne Leets and assemblies for Election of Ma∣gistrates. (a) Some take it to bee the same that RE∣GVLVS,81 or TROCHILVS. Thought to be the Wren, and is likewise named King of Birdes, in Greeke , OMINOVS therefore unto CAESAR, seeking to be king. (b) This is diversly reported by authors the occasion of which varietie ariseth upon the af∣finitie of these names CASSIVS and CASCA. For as there were two CASSII at this action, so likewise were there two SERVILII brethren, both surnamed CASCA. By, ALTER CAS∣SIVS or CASCA therefore, you may under∣stand one of the two brethren, or the second of them. For some write, that the one CAS∣CA gave him in the necke a wound, but not deadly, whereupon CAESAR caught hold of his dagger crying out, Scelerate CASCA quid agis? i. What meanest thou, O wicked CAS∣CA, and then CASCA called unto his brother for helpe, who came in, and gave him his deathes wound, in the breast under the chanell bone, PLUTARCH. (c) Albeit, Graphium doth signifie a writing punch, (or steele or wier), otherwise called Stylus, where∣with they wrote in hard matter, as wood, or barke, before the use of our parchment and pa∣per, as also our pen made of a quill or other substance, as brasse, &c. in which sense it is ta∣ken in that verse of OVID. . lib. 1. E∣leg. 11: Quid digitos opus est graphium lssare tenendo? And probable it is that CAESAR sitting in counsell was not without such a writing in∣strument: yet both DOMINICVS MARI∣VS upon the foresaid verse, and PEROT∣TVS also the author of CORNVCOPIA, ex∣pounding this place of SVETONIVS, takes Graphium, pro pugiunculo, i. A little poyniard, poi∣nado, or pocket dagger. And hapely therwith CAE∣SAR wounded CASSIVS or CASCA (whe∣ther you will) being more readie at hand, han∣ging at his girdle, than the style or steele afore∣said, which by all likelihood was yet in the case or sheath, called Graphiarium, considering CAE∣SAR was but new set. But I leaue the exposition of this place, in medio. (d) VALERIVS MAX. under the title of VERECVNDIA, commendeth this mayden∣like modestie of CAESAR, who notwithstanding that he was masakred with 23. wounds, for man∣hood sake forgot not to hide his nakednesse, and to die in decent manner: but as EURIPIDE writeth of the virgin Ladie Polixena. Where, by the way it may be noted, that the Romanes wore not trusses or breches, as wee doe, to cover those inferior and secret parts. (e) This may have reference to that which is reported before, how in his youth, he loved SERVILIA, the mother of this BRVTVS: For his age falleth out to agree fitly with that time: in so much as he was commonly thought to be a sonne of his. And yet this attribute Fili, may sort well with the familiaritie that was be∣tweene them. Some read . i. And art thou one of them?
(a) VIRGINI Vestali Maxime.

ANNOTATIONS VPON Octauius Augustus Caesar. (a) INTER divisores, o∣perasque Compestres. This was thought to bee but a base occupa∣tion, namely, to giue among the Tribes, such sums of money, as the Candidats, or those that stood in ele∣ctiō for offices promi∣sed & pronounced for the buying of voices. The name also grew to be odious, howsoever PLAVTVS in Alul. calleth them Magi∣stros Curiae. Likewise all such servitours as otherwise gave attendance in Campo Martio, and thereby gt a living, whom he termeth here opras campest res, were but of meane reckoning. (a) Regione Ptij. In old time Rome was divided into foure principall regions or quarters. Suburrana, quiline, Collina, & Palatina. (b) The manner in old time was, that the newe borne babe should be set up on the bare groūd to cry and call vpon the Goddesse Ops, who so gently had received it. And the Goddesse forsooth, that helped to lift it vp againe, was called Levana. i. a Levando. Au∣gustin. . (a) THE Virile robe was the ordinary Ro∣mane gowne, all white without purple, which they wore when they came to be past. 16. yeares of age. (b) To wit, bracelets, chaines and collars, Speare staes without iron heads, trappings, chaplets and guirlands, &c. (c) This was the Triumvirate, so much spoken of: during which, M. ANTONIVS, M. LEPIDVS & AVGVSTVS ruled ioyntly together. (a) MARCVS BRVTVS. (b) Hee meaneth CICERO, as appeareth by an E∣pistle of D. BRVTVS vnto CICERO in these words, Narravt mihi &c. ipsum Caesarem. (Augustum) nihil sa∣n de te qstum nisi  quod diret, te dixisse ∣dum adolescen, ornandum, tollendū: se non commissu rm ut tolli possit In which words, as also in this place of TRANQVILLVS, there is an aequivocatin or doubtfull sense in this Verbe Tollendum: which in one signification, is in manner aequval: t with lau∣dandum and ernandum; and betokeneth, to bee ad∣vanced, extolled, or lifted up: and so is to be taken in good part: but in another, it is all one with tol∣lendum de medio, or occidendum, id est, to be dispatch∣ed out of life: or killed. In which sense CICERO ment it, and AVGVSTVS tooke it, namely in ill part. Much like to this, you shall reade in Nero, sustu∣lit lc matrē, sustulit ille patrem. The grace lieth in the ambiguitie of the Latine word tollendum, which cānot in English be so well delivered. (a) The Egij, as APPIAN witnesseth. (a) Which by the Lawe IVLIA THEATRA∣LIS, and ROSCIA, were allowed for the knights or Gentlemen of Rome, whose estate was valued not under 400000. Sesterces. The lawes abovesaid, were promulged by AVGVSTVS CAESAR, & L. ROSCIVS OTHO a Tribune of the Commons. And these 14. Seates named Equestria, were the next unto the stage after the Orcestra arising by degrees and staires, as it were higher & higher, & so farther of. Above which in the upper and more remote scaffolds sat the com∣mon people, and thereupon they were called PO∣PVLARIA. Howbeit, for all the lawe Roscia, many Commoners of good wealth and credit, used to sit indifferently in the said 14. formost seats, untill the other Lawe IVLIA was enacted, which distinguish∣ed the orders more precisely. Carol. Sigon. De Antiq. Iur. Civ. Rom. lib. 2. cap. 19. (a) When in stately Pompe, the sacred chariot Thensa, with the images of the Gods in it, was de∣voutly drawen according to the solemne manner. (b) A coast-towne of Italy affronting Sicile, from whence it is a very short cut over sea so called by the Greekes, as if even there a breach was made by the sea, dividing
Italie from Sicilie which before time was a part of the continent or maine land: And no mervaile of that Name▪ since that Mitine Region, wherein Lo∣cri stood, was in times past called Magna Gra∣cia. (c) In that hee put downe in his will the chil∣dren which he had by CLEOPATRA a stranger and Barbarian horne, which also were begotten in bastardie, as well as if they had beene naturall Ro∣manes and legitimate, hee faulted in common civi∣litie, but much more, when hee proceeded to call the sonnes that he had by her, Reges Regum. i. the King of Kings. As absurd also and immodest hee shewed himselfe, when having by her at one birth two twinnes, the male infant he surnamed Sol. i. the Sunne, and the Femall, Lunà 1. the Moone. (d) In the custodie of the Vestall Nunnes, or Votaries, as IVLVS CSAR had done before him: of such integritie and so good conscience they were thought to be, as things of greatest weight were committed unto them in trust. (e) This forename, TITVS cannot truly be gi∣ven to any of the Domitij, if that bee true which is written of them afterward in Domitius Nero. cap. 1. (f) But in the behalfe of M. ANTONIVS, con∣sidering he was their Patrone and Protector. For o∣ther forain States and Cities usually were hrouded under the favour of Gentlemen at Rome. In which regard, he laid not to their charge that they had not sided with himselfe, but rather taken part with their Patron ANTONII: considering that nere bond wherewith such Protectors and Clients or Depen∣dents were linked together: which DIONSIVS supposeth to bee almost as ancient as Rome it selfe, and almost aequall to that of Allies, yea and kins∣folke in bloud. (g) A Promontorie or Cape in EPIRVS, shooting into the way Ambracium, in the view whereof the sumptuous Armada of  and Cleo∣patra was defaited. (a) THESE Psylli are people in Affricke supposed17 to haue bodies of a singular vertue to kill Serpents, as also a speciall skill in sucking foorth venome out of the wound made by their sting. Yet CORNE∣LIVS CELSVS. lib. 5. cap. 27. is of opinion, that they haue no principall gift or cunning in this feate aboue other men, but more boldnesse rather, con∣firmed by use and practise: For the venome of a ser∣pent, saith hee, hurteth not by being tasted, but as it is infused by a wound, which he proveth by those poysons that the French use especially in siting. And therefore a verie Snake or Adder it selfe, may bee eaten safely, how ever the sting is deadly: and if whiles it lyeth astonied or benummed (the cast wher∣of these Monte-bankes or juglers have by meanes of certaine medicines) one put his finger into the mouth thereof, and be not bitten or stung withall, there is no spettle or slimie humous there to doe harme. So that whosoeuer else, by example of these Psylli shall sucke a worem and inflicted by a Serpent, he shall doe it safely, and cure besides, the party that is stung. Provided alwaies, that hee have no sore r ulcer, in gummes, palate, or any part of his limmes. (b) Some thinke this kinde of Aspis which  used, was Pyas, ▪ others Hyple; for that the sting brought drowsinesse upon her: and Lu∣c called it Aspida . But  is unto all the soes to kill by sleepe and stupefaction without paine, some sooner, some later: but all within the space of 6. houres: So that Hyp∣nale may seeme to be a generall attribute to them all. (a) As if hee counted those Ptolees dead,18 who left no memorable actes behinde them. And Alexander, a King still, or worthie alone to be cal∣led King, whose memoriall was yet so fresh and lively. (a) FOR that one of his parentes was a Parthine,19 that is to say, a stranger of Illyircum, and the other a Romane. (a) WARRES take the name of those that bee20 vanquished. As, Gallicum bellum, Germanic, Dal∣matuum, &c. in which Gale, Germanie, and Dalmati be subdued. (b) Some take this bridge to be a kinde of Fabrick or skaffold reared for the assault of the towne Metu∣lium, and not an ordinarie bridge built ouer some river. (a) THIS temple, as appeareth afterwards, hee21 had vowed in the Philippian warre, which hee un∣dertooke in revenge of his Father IVLIVS CAE∣SARS death, and therefore dedicated it vnto MARS, Revenger. (a) THE Temple of IANVS QVVS, o22 QVIRINI, because it was first founded by Romulus, Na Popilius his successor ordained to be set open in time of warre, and shuite when there was peace. Whereupon IANVS was termed under a two-folde name, Patuci and Clausis. Once it was shu in the said Na his reigne; and a second time, afte the first Punick warre ended, when M. Atlius, and T. Mlius, or Mllius, were Consuls. At all time before and after it stood open, untill AVOVSTVS CAESARS daies. During whose Empire it was thrice shut. First, upon the defeature of ANTO∣NIVS and CLEOPATRA before ACTIV▪ Secondly, after his victorie in Spaine over the Can∣tabri: Last of all, when all Nations (in manner) of the earth by occasion of his victories, grew to an universall peace. About which time our Saviour IE∣SVS Christ, IMMANVL, that True Peace ma∣ker betweene God and e, was borne. Thus ORO∣SIVS reputeth, and readeth, ter, not tertio. How∣beit LIVIE seemeth to acknowledge, but once, namely, upon the Actiack victorie. (b) Ovation was a kinde of petie triumph: wher∣in the Captaines victors rode not in a Chariot, nor wore a Coronet of Laurell, but of the Myrtle. It tooke the name ab ovibus. i. Sheepe Sacrificed, or rather all the voyce, Ov, which the Soldiour in their acclamations resounded. (a) THE Romane Armie consisted of Legi∣ons,23 who were all Romanes, and of Auxilia. i. aids and those were of Allies and confederate no∣tions. (b) This day, was Ante diem quart . Sextil. 1. the second daye of August. Which was also that verie daye of the moneth,
wherein the Romans in times past suffered the desaste∣rous overthrow at Canna. (a) BY which the people of Rome wonne their im∣mortall24 fame, and conquered the whole world as Ci∣ro saith: Pro Murna. (b) December, Ianuarie, and Februarie. (c) Thereby disabling them for being serviceable souldiers. (d) These Publicanes, so called for that they fermed their Cities revenewes, as Customes, olles, mposts, &c. were likewise Knightes or Gentlemen of Rome, and by being so earnest to buy out one of their owne sort, were thought to fauour him, and minded pre∣sently to dismisse him at liberty: which was contrary to his intent. (a) FOR his Vncle and Predecessor IVLIVS25 CAESAR, had taken up that familiar terme of COM∣MILITONES, by occasion of so many troubles that followed him, and therefore was driven to speake his Souldiers fayre. (b) Libertines were those who having beene bond were made free or manumised: and these were not capable of Militia Romana, but in time of great ex∣tremitie and desperate cases. (c) It seemeth by this, that these vallare and Murell coronets were made of some other matter than Siluer and Gold. Yet Aul. Gell. lib. 5. cap. 6. wri∣teth that both these, as also the Nauale, were of gold. Now, the VALLARE or CASTRENSIS coronet, (for they were both one) resembled vall 1. the Ram∣pier a palaisade about a Camp, made ex vallis. 1. stakes or pales sharpened at the head, wherewith the banke or mure was the better fortified▪ and hee receiued it as an honorable reward, who first mounted the said palaisade, and entered the Camp of his enemies: The Murell, was fascioned like to the battlements of a wall, given likewise unto that souldier, who approa∣ched the enemies wall first, skaled, and climbed over it into the Citie. As for these Phaler, albeit they be commonly taken for the ornaments or trappings of horses, yet it appeareth that they be the ornaments of the men themselues: And as well they as TO∣QVES were, Tralatitia militum dona. 1. Ordinarie and common gifts bestowed upon good souldiers. See Iuvenal. Satyr. ult. Vt lti phaleris omnes, & tor∣quibus omnes. (d) Such as he called before MANIPVLARES and GREGARIOS: although in other authors, Ca∣ligati stand for all manner of souldiers. (e) In Latin Festina lente: much to this sense in our English tongue. No more hast then good speed: For, The soft fire makes sweet malt. This proverbe the same AV∣GVSTVS expressed also in his coines, wherein hee stamped together with lightning or a thūderbolt, the God TERMINVS, representing by the one, Celeri∣tie; and by the other, Strayednesse. Like as TITVS VESPASIANVS the Emperour joyned an Anchor and a Dolphin together in his coine, to the same purpose. (f) A verse of EURIPIDES, in the Tragedie Phoeniss. 1. A warie Captaine is better than a ven∣terous. (g) It was the Apophthegme of CATO▪ Soone e∣nough is that done, which is well done.26 (a) BY the law Aaria, that L. IVLIVS, or VILLIVS rather promulged, required it was, that a Consull should not be under the age of 43. Yet for their worthinesse and demerits, some attaine to that dignitie, under 30. (b) Like unto this was the speech of that Centu∣rion, who being lent by IVLIVS CAESAR Dictator, for to he the time of his government and conduct of an Armie in the prouince poroged, standing be∣fore the doore of the Senate house, and taking know∣ledge that it would not be granted, shooke his sword hilt with his hand and said, Hic prorogabit. 1. This then shall proroge it. (a) THREE such Halles there were in Rome,29 wherein Iudiciall courts were held, and causes plea∣ded. 1. Romanum, which was so much frequented with Lawyers and their Clients, that CATO CEN∣SORIVS delivered his opinion, that it should bee paved with Calthrops, to kepe-out that rabble which hated it. 2. Caesareum, That CESAR Dictator built, and adjoyned thereto the Temple of VENVS Ge∣nitrix. 3. AVGVSTI▪ whereto was annexed by him one Temple of MARS Reenger. For, another he e∣rected in the Capitoll, after he had regained from the Parthians, the Roman Standerds and militarie desoignes, which they wonne from CRASSVS. (b) An Aphitheater, and a Theater, differs as he full Moone from the halfe, or a compleat roūde from a semicircle. (a) PLINY writeth, that Rome was devided in∣to30 soureteene Regions, or wards, and into more than a thousand streets. (a) Augurs were certaine Priests employed about the obseruation of Birds, and from them out of their learning gave directions. In number at first they were but three belōging unto the three ancient tribes of Rome. In processe of time there was a Colledge or covent of them to the number of 24. namely, in the daies of SVLLA Dictator: So that I doubt not but among these were some appointed for this ministerie eyther about the Goddesse SALVS. 1. Health or safety, unto whom there was likewise a Temple built, or else in the name and behalfe of the people, Cap∣tare Augurium salutis, which as DIO maketh re∣port, was in this manner: That they should call unto God for safetie, if he would permit: as if it were not law∣full to crave it at the Gods hands, unlesse they first granted it. And one day euery yeare was chosen for this buisinesse, in which no Armie did set forth to warre: no man warre a∣gainst them, nor toke weapon in hand to fight. A thing that could not be, during the late troubles and ciuill warres. No erveile therefore, if this function being forelet, was now taken up againe by AVGVSTVS, when by ccasion of peace, he did shut the Temple of IANVS. And as this func∣tion was called Augurium, so I see no reason but the very Augurship or Sacerdotall dignity it selfe in this place might be named Augurium, in the same forme, that presently af∣ter, the Flamenship or Priesthood belonging to IVPITER, is named Flaminium: And this I take to be the mea∣ning of our Author. (b) Which were solemnized once in an hundred,31 or as some say, an hundred and ten yeares. (a) BY which addition, there were in the yeare32 230. Law-daies or pleadeable. (a) MORE majorum ordained it was, that a Pa∣ricide,33 should first be beaten with rods, and then▪
sowed within a lether male or budge togither with a dog, a coce, a viper, and an Ape, and so throwen into the sea or some running water. (b) Whereof CORNELIVS SYLLA was the Author intituled: de falsis, or Testamentaria. (a) MANY lawes went vnder the title Sumptu∣ariae,34 to represse the immoderate expense in apparell, and belly-cheere especially: as namely, Faia, Diia Oppia▪ Cornelia, Iulia, as well Caesaris as Augusti, But in the time of TIBERIVS CAESAR, notwithstan∣ding he did what he could to keepe them in force, yet they were all abrogated. (b) Lex Iulia, Caesaris & Augusti, de Adulteriis & Pu∣diciti. For albeit the law Scatiiia Scatinia, prouided a∣gainst the later, to wit Paederestie, yet the penaltie thereof by vertue of the said law was but Peciaria, i. a mony matter. Whereas by Iulia it was Capitalls, i. worthie of death. And, that AVGVSTVS esta∣blished and inforced this law against Incontinencie, it may appeare by this, That Sextus Aurelius reproo∣ued him: because being himselfe giuen to lascivious∣nesse, yet he was a most severe and sharpe chasticer of that vice: as also by that answere of a young man, whō he for cōmitting adultery with his daughter Iulia smote with his owne hands. Who thereupon cried out . i. Thou hast made a lawe O CAESAR. Now as touching the foresaid law Scati∣nia, it was so called (as VALERIVS MAXIMVS writeth by occasion of one Scantinius Scatinius a Tribune of the commons, who against kinde had abused a sonne of MARCELLVS, and was therefore condemned accordingly. (c) De abitu. Of which there were divets, name∣ly Acilia Calpurnia, Afidia, Baebia Aemilia, Cornelia Fulvia, Maria, Pompeia, Paetilia, Tullia and Iulia, Cae∣saris & Augusti. (d) Lex papia poppaea, de maritandis ordinibus, wher∣of, there were many branches and chapters, not on∣ly respecting this conjunction of the Gentrie and commons: but also concerning penalties to be laid upon those that neglected mariage, and rewards due to such as lived in wedlocke and begat chil∣dren, &c. (a) The badges that distinguished Senatours from35 others, were their Robes purfled or embrodred or with broad studs of purple like naile heads, called thereupon Laticlavi, and shoes with peakes resem∣bling the horned tips or pointed ends of the moone, named therefore Calcei lunati, in token of their aun∣cient Nobilitie, as some interpret it. (b) These solemne feastes at which Senators were allowed to be present, were Epulum ovic otherwise cal∣led Cana Dialis within the capitoll: Likewise Cana Tri∣vmphalis Pontificialis, and Auguralis. i. the sumptuous suppers to the honour of IVPITER, at triumphes, given by the Pontifies and Augurs. (c) The first day of everie moneth. The 13 of March, May, Iuly, and October, the 15 of the rest. (a) A judiciall court there was at Rome called37 Centvir alia Hasta, for that it consisted of certaine Commissioners or Iudges named Centviri, i. The Hundred-men. Before whom were debated ciuill matters and causes betweene citizen and citizen, of no great importance. Chosen these were out of eve∣le Tribe thr. And those were in all 35. which number doth arise to 105. but in round reckoning they went for an hundred. (a) What these or naments and badges were. T.38 LIVIVS reporteth in the 30 booke of his Romane historie: to wit, A crowne of Gold, and a faire golden Bll: A curule, I vorie chaire, with a staffe likewise or scepter of Ivory: A long Robe embrodered of sundrie co∣lours, and a rich coate of Needl work representing the Date tree. (b) This solemne shew or Riding of Roman Gen∣tlemen, was upon the Ides i. the 15 day of Quintilis alias Iuly yearely: Instituted first by FABIVS RV∣TILIANVS in the honour of CASTOR and POLLVX, who appeared unto the Romans, at the battell neere the Lake Regillus, what time they at∣chived a noble victorie. They rode from the Temple of Honour, as some write, or as others, of Ma without the walles, through the Forum, and by the Temple of Castor, up into the Capitall, dight with chaplets of Olive braunches, as PLINIE writeth lib. 15. Natur. Hist. (a) BY this it appeareth, that ordinarily he might4 not bee a Tribune of the commons, who was not a Senator: For albeit this be a Plebian Magistrate, yet might a commoner be a Senator. (b) Whereupon, SVIDAS thinketh, Annenas to take their name, quasi  i. be∣cause corne was wont to be dealt among the people, upon the Nones of everie moneth, namely, the se∣venth day of March, May, Iuly and October, and the fifth of the rest: Whereas indeed Annon is de∣rived ab ao, i. the yeare, quasi annalis alimonia. i. the yeares provision of food. (c) It seemeth that AVGVSTVS held of two Tribes: to wit, Scaptia, unto which the Octarij be∣longed, and wherein he was borne: and Fabia, by his adoption into the familie of the Iulij. (d) For, howsoever the Romane habit was the Gowne, yet permitted were they, upon necessitie, namely to save the said gowne in foule wether, or to defend themselves from cold, to cast over it a cloake in any frequented place of the Citie, as were the Fo∣rum, i. The common pleading court, ward, or Mar∣ket place, and the Circus, i. The Shevv place. (a) FOR the ordinarie Roman Gownes were44 white and faire kept. (b) Of these spectacles and games, some were Ma∣tutini, some Meridiani, and other Pomeridiani: ac∣cording as they were exhibited, In the morning, at Noone, and after-noone. (a) These were called likewise sacred Games, as45 Stage-playes, Gymnicke Exercises, and Masteries in Musicke, in NEROES time. (b) They tooke that name of a spatious Gallerie or walking place called Xystos, wherein they were woont to exercise in winter time. (a) COLONIES, were Towne-ships in Italy and other Provinces planted with Romane Inha∣bitants.46 In which, Decuriones as one would say Aldermen, had the same authoritie as Senators in Rome. (a) HEREUPON, some Provinces were called47 Caesari, or Praesidiariae: namely which were ruled by the Emperours sole appointment, and had strong Garrisons placed in them: others, Populi,
and they were named , Consulares, or Procon∣suls, governed by Pretors, Consuls, or their Vice geren.50 (a) There is a kinde of Munkey or Marmoset in Aethipia, going under the name of Sphinx, in PLI∣NIE The Poets also faine, that a certaine monste∣rous beast so called, sometimes did haunt the Citie of Thebes and the Tetorie about it: Which from a rocke proposed ridales unto the passengers. This monster by their report, caried the resemblance of three creatures, to wit, a Foule, A Lion, and a mayden, according to these verses of Ausoni. Terruit Aoniam volucri, Leo, virgo, triformis Sphinx: voluris penna, pedibus fera, fronte puella.Le. A three-shap'd Sphinx, Bird Lion-Maid, Aonian land did fright, In wing a foule, in feete a * beast,Lion In face a virgin [bright]. PLINIE writeth in the last booke of his Natu∣rall Historie. That AVGVSTVS used at the begin∣ning to signe with this Sphinx engraven upon his Sig∣net. And verily quoth he, in the casket of his mo∣thers lewels two of these he fouud, so like, that one could not be discerned from the other. And as hee was woont to weare the one wheresoever he went, so in his absence during the civill warres with Athonie, his friends that menaged his affaires at Rome, sealed with the other, those missives and edicts which passed in his name. And from hence it came, that those who received any such letters or edictes conteyning matter of difficultie, were wont merily to say, that the said Sphinx came ever with some hard riddle or o∣ther, which could not be aoiled Whereupon AV∣GVSTVS to avoid the obloquit that arose by his Sphinx gave over sealing therewith, and signed al∣waies after with the image of King ALEXANDER the Great, &c. (a) This humanitie and affable courtesie termed by SVETON. CIVILITAS, was reproved in51 ALEXANDER the Emperour by his mother and wife both, as not beseeming the Majestie of a Prince▪ For they told him many times, that thereby he cau∣sed his Imperiall power and digniue to be the more contemptible: Yea, but it is by that meanes quoth he both surer, and like also to last the longer Lam∣prid in Alexandro. (a) THIS name Dominus among the Romans,53 like as Sr with us, was duersly used. In the sense of imperious and Lordly commaund, as wee sometime take [Lord] it was odious: as having a relation to SERVVS a slave or villaine. To mollfie therfore the hashnesse of the word, they used to terme hous∣holders or masters of families, patrefamilias, in steed of Dominos, as also houshold servants familiare, and not servs. Otherwise they used it by way of flatte∣rie or faire speech▪ as appeareth in the chap. 21. of CLAVDIVS following. Hence it is, that lovers call their sweet hearts, Do i. Mistresses. Also if a man speaketh unto one, whom he eyther knoweth not, or hath forgotten he saith, Doine. i. Heere you Sir, according to that Epigram in Martiall. Cum te non nossem, Dominum Regemque , Al while that I you kenned not, I cald you L▪ & KingOr sir. Last of all, by way of scorne and derision. And so, the same Martial testifyeth in this Distichon. Cum voco te dominum litibi, Cinna, placere, Sepe etiam servum sic resalut meum. When I O Cinna call you ir joy not, I you addresse, For even my servant I salute oft times no otherwise. In which manner we speake unto our servant, or any other in contempt, by this terme firrha: to say nothing of sir knave. No mervaile therefore, if AV∣GVSTVS could not abide this word Domin so doubtfully taken, and seldome in good sense. (b) If you read, [adoperta] i. close and shut, it may have reference to this, That he tooke not state upon him, not sought the peoples applause: which accor∣deth to his other behaviour reported before. If, [ad aperta] ▪ open, it sheweth likewise his courteous ca∣riage and affabilitie: as who was readie to accept of petitions and requests: a thing right commendable in a Prince, as it is written of King ARTAXERXES surnamed MNEMON, how riding in a Carroch with his Queene, he commaunded her to draw o∣pen the curtaines thereof, That he might the better at∣tend upon his subiects. And this agreeth as well with that which followeth of AVGVSTVS. And here∣to I rather encline. (c) He looked not for their attendance at home in his owne house, neyther would he be thought to have conferred with any one privately, as touching the publike affaires. (d) It is generally a received opinion, that within seven naturall daies such voluntarie abstinence from food is not mortall, as PLINIE writeth in his eleventh booke, who reporteth also, that many have connued tasting more than eleven daies. Which I easily beeleeve. For, in mine owne knowledge I may be bold to report, that a Bitch lived so long, and yet died not, nor miscaried the whelps within her. Some meloncholicke persons therefore, may within the Latitude of Health endure so long, yea and those likewise who are fraught top-full with a ballase of crd and cold humours, which may engender a quartaine ague as well as melancholie doth. For, I doubt not, but in such chronicke diseases occasio∣ned and maintained by grosse matters, one may a∣bide above eleuen daies without all manner of food. Yet AVLVS GELLIVS saith, that beyond seven daies wilfull abstinence, a man is not able to live. (a) For, as Vlpian testifyeth. l. 18. de Testant.55 A law there was, that whosoever to the infamie of any person published a Libell eyther in his owne or another mans name, yea without name at all. If he be convict thereof, shall be Intestabilis. i. disabled both for making a will himselfe, and also for to be a witnesse unto ano∣ther mans. (a) By these Candidates, e meaneth eyther such56 as himselfe recommended unto the people for any office, as CAESAR his predecessor did before him, and those were called Caesaris Candidati, or else his especiall friends whom he laboured for. (b) PLINIE lib. 35. cap. 12. writeth, that Cassis his accuser charged him to have killed 130. guestes, with one platter of poisoned meat. (c) Certaine souldiers there were going under the name of Scutarii, as PAVLVS DIACONVS wit∣nesseth
in his supplement upon  writing that Valentinian of a Tribune or Colonell over these Scu∣tari, became Emperour. (a) GERMANICVS was the sonne of Drusus,64 and Antonia the younger. Now, had Drusus for his mother, Livia the wife of Augustus and Antonia for hers,  the sister of Augustus. (b) In all bargaines of sale, and alienations, the solemne and ceremoniall forme at Rome was this, that five witnesses at the least, Romane Citizens and of lawfull age, with one other beside, of the same con∣dition called Libripens, (because he held a payre of ba∣lances, &c.) the chapman or buyer should come with a peece of Brasse coyne in his hand, and say, (for example sake, if it were a bondslave to bee bought and sold) these words, This man or woman, Iavouch by the law of the Romans to be mine, and bought I have him or her, for this peece of brasse, and with this brasen ballance, and therewith, sttiking the said bal∣lance give the brasen peece unto the other partie that is the seller, By which imaginarie kind of chasse▪ ring, things were alienated, & their property chāged. (c) So ordinarie it was to traine up youth in swim∣ming,reading and writing. and in * Grammer, of which the one had relation to the exercise of the bodie, the other of the minde, that of such as had no bringing up at all, a∣rose this proverbe, . (a) CAIVS was sent by AVGVSTVS with an armie to suppresse the troubles and insurrections in the East-parts: where he was stabbed treacherously, with a knife or short skeene, by one who presented unto him a supplication, of which wound he died af∣terwards. A. LVCIVS likewise he sent into Armenia, recōmending him unto the Gods in these words, that they would vouchsafe him as welbeloved as Pompeius, as alorous as King Alexander, and as fortunate as himselfe. (a) These he adopted, because they were out of the tuition of their fathers deceased) in the com∣mon Hall or Forum, before the high priestes, and with consent of the people, by vertue of the law Cu∣riata, And this was properly called Adoption. Wher∣as, suffcient it was to adopt others above named with the assent of their fathers, by the formall bar∣gaine of saile called Mancipatro. (c) Certaine questours there were named also Can∣didati Principis: whose Office it was to read such missives or letters in the Senate. (d) Happily, this he did to know thereby, whe∣ther she had beene naught of her bodie with them or no? considering wee learne out of naturall Philo∣sophy, that commonly children resemble their pa∣rents in complexion, favour, and markes. Howbeit, this Iulia is reported to have brought forth children, all like unto M. Aegripa, her husband so long as he lived, notwithstanding she was knowen to be a com∣mon strumpet But beside her answere to that point, unto those who made a wonder at it, which ye may see in Marob. Saturnal. li. 2. cap. 5. read the pleasant and wittie Epigram of Sir Thomas Moore, upon the like example. (e) Alluding to a place of Homere, Iliad. 3. wherein Hector curseth his brother Caris, and after some ap∣probrious termes saith thus, . Would God, thou ha'st of women ne're bee borne: Or else had died thy wedding day before. Which verse, by inversion of words and using one of them in a contrarie sense, AVGVSTVS trans∣ferred unto his owne person. For it is to be noted, that  heere in Hoer hath a passive significa∣tion, & soundeth, as much, as , i. not borne, whereas AVGVSTVS taketh it in the active, for one that is childlesse, or * hath begotten no children.or is unable for (f) These Cancers be certain tumors or swellings, hard & unequal of their nature which he called Scir∣rhes, and of an ugly, aspect, as arising from un∣naturall melancholy, breeding, as CORNELIVS CELSVS writeth, for the most part in the superiour region of the bodie, about the face, nose, eares, lips, and womens breasts. Which our Author heere and the Greeke writers name Carcinomata, for the re∣semblance of the Crab-fish crooked cleies, which the blacke or swart veines all about them doe repre∣sent, or because they be hardly or uneth remooved, if they once take to a place, no more than the said fish when it setleth to a thing and claspeth it, Vnto∣ward to be healed, and commonly the worse for all the cure done unto them. These Cancers, if they be∣come ulcers once are termed Wolves. In regard of which properties, aptly compared AVGVSTVS those ungracious Impes of his breed, unto them, as being foule Eyesores, disteining his honour, and by no discipline of his corrigible. (a) According to that sage precept of Selon, .66 i. Be not hasty making any thy friends and the saying of Hecuba in Euripides, . No friend, I say, Who loves not eye. Which two rules Propertis elegantly comprehen∣deth in one verse, Amare. Noc cito desiso, nec temere icipio Late ere I love, as long ere I leave. (b) AESOPE gaue this lesson, . i. Commit no secrets to a woman. And as for this Mcenas, he was noted to be Vxorius, more than he should, and one, who (albeit his wife was a shrew and readie to goe from him every day soone admitted attonements and reconciliations. Wherupon Seneca in his morall Epistles said, That ha∣ving but one wife, yet he maried a thousand times. (a) EVERY word almost in this verse carieth a6 double construction without the understāding wher∣of, all the grac is lost. For, Cyndus in one sense, be∣tokeneth one of the Galli, Priests of the Gods Cybele named also, Ops Mater deum, and Tellus, even the ve∣ry Earth. Which priests were gelded or disabled for generation, and tooke that name of the river Gallus, the water wherof drunken, caused men to be evirate and effeminate. Now, the maner of these priestes in the divine service of the said goddesse, was to beat the Taber or tamper upon the Timbril, which is expres∣sed here in these words, Orbem digito temperat. For that the Timbrill is round & circular, to signifie the Globe of the earth symbolyze by Cybele. And in this sense, may the verse literally be interpreted: But, be∣side this significatiō, Cyndus betokneth a wantō Pathick or , who suffereth himself against nature to be abused Orbis also is put, for the habitable world, and digito temperat, is as much to say, as He hath the world
at a becke, or at his command, as if the same were ruled by AVGVSTVS CAESAR, who was noted for that abhominable filthinesse. And in this latter sense did the people of Rome expound the said verse, and apply it unto him.70 (a) OF twelve Gods and Goddesses together: Alluding to those sixe select Gods, & as many God∣desses whom antiquitie in heathenesse honoured a∣bove, the rest: whose names ENNIVS the Poet comprised in these two verses, Ino, vefia, Minerva, Ceres, Diana, Venus, Mars, Mercurius Iupiter. Iovis, Neptunus, Vnlcanus, Apollo. Answerable to which number hee intertained sixe yong women attired like Goddesses, & six boyes (la∣taemites) in habit of Gods, as his guests at this Supper. (b) I doubt, the first verse of this Hexasticon is not perfect, for, I doe not please my selfe in the transla∣tion of it. (c) Neyther is it certaine what this Mallia should bee? Some read Manlia, as if it were the name of a chamber within the Lastell or Citadyll of the Capi∣tall, which this banquting place of his did counter∣feit, and then we must admit the figure . Others take Mallia to be the name of some womā, im ploied in the furnishing & setting out of such a supper (d) For AVGVSTVS not onely sate heere a∣mong the rest in the person of Apollo, but also would sometimes be thought Phoebus, otherwhiles Phoebus his sonne. (e) For, it is not unknowne what adulteries the Poets talke of, betweene Iupiter and Armnia &c. betweene Mars also and Venus. (f) No marvaile, if Iupiter Capitolinus, with o∣ther Gods and Goddesses, being before possessed of the Capitall, abandoned their shrines and chappels, when they saw such in place. (g) Wherein Tormentors whips and scourges were to be fold: and there-upon he tooke that name of Tortour (like as before he is surnamed Sandalia∣rius, and Tragdus) which, AVGVSTVS seemed now to verifie in himselfe, whipping and plauging the people with hunger, as he did. (a) IN which moneth the feast Saturnalia was71 kept, and much libertie tolerated of gaming, fea∣sung and eveling. (b) In this game called in Latine Lusus talorum, or Talarius, there is some resemblance of our dies, but that the Tali have but foure faces or sides, and therefore yeeld foure chaunces and no more. Of which the first is named Canis or Cancula, answering as some thinke to our Ace, and is the worst of all. The opposite unto it, they termed Venus or Cous, and is accompted the best, as which may stand for our . The third bare the name of Chius, proportioned to Trey with us and the last Snio, and is as much as Quatre. For in these Tal or cockall bones threre is no chance of Deux or Cinque. (c) Quinquatrus or Quinquatria, were certaine fe∣stivall holidaies held for five daies together in the moneth March to the honour of Minerra. See Ovid d Fast. Var. Macro. Aul. Gell. (a) FOR pleasure therein he called it Syracus,72 comparing it to that beautifull Citie in Sicily, and because it served his turne for meditations and in∣vetions, he gave it the name . (a) Employed, as it should seeme in his civill74 warres. Certaine soldiers there were attending up∣on the Prince under the name of , whole service he used, in spying and listening, In Greeke such were named,  and . Also in doing executon upon condmned persons, and in sending of letters unto the Senate, as  Tor∣rentius hath observed verie well in his Annota∣tions vpon CAIVS CALIGVLA.66 (a) Sabbatis Ieiunium servat. If Sabbats be but for weeks, as the manner of the Iewes was to speake, according as the Publicane saith in the Gospell after Saint Luke, , and as it appeareth in other places of the Evangelists, true it is, that SVETONIVS or AVGVSTVS reporteth of the Iewes, as also if by Sabbaths are meant other of their festivall and solemne daies. But if you take i for the seventh or last day of the week, it is altogether untrue, and to be imputed unto the  and ignorance of SVETONIVS and the Romanes, in the Iewish rites and ceremonies. For seeing them religiously to keepe the said seventh day or Sabbat holy, where∣upon they were commonly called Sabbatarii, and ob∣serving withall their fasting, generally it was thought of straungers that they fasted upon the Sabbat. Also for their devout fasting against the feast of the Pas∣sover, called by themselves sometime the great Sab∣bat, as also by forainers, as it appeareth by Horat us lib. 1. serm. sat. 9. in this peece of verse Hode tricesma Sablata, &c. they imagined that the Iewes fasted e∣verie Sabbat. And in truth, reckon from September (at which moneth the Iewes in one computation be∣gin their yeare) 30 weeks forward, you come unto their Cascha: According to which  wee Chri∣stians also doe celebrate our feast of Easter. This onely is the difference betweene us and them, for that they observe the Neomenia or new mooe at the spring Aequinex, and solemnize their passover in the next full moone, and wee, the Lords day or Sonday after the said full. (a) It seemeth, he tooke but a light repast: not78 putting off his shoes, as the maner was, at full meals. (b) Some copies have, retectis pedibus, making (re) to be , as if he meant, verie well covered (contrarie to the use of that word retegere, which o∣therwise signifieth, to uncover) like as recndere, i. to lay up verie safe and sure. Others, retractis i. with his feete somewhat drawen or pulled up to him: in the same sense as CORNELIVS CELSVS useth paulum reductis, qui fere jacentibus babitus est, as hee saith, which is the ordinarie forme of lying, when as men be in health. Lastly, some read, reectis i. Let downe or stretched out to the full . (c) CASABONVS interpreteth,  Lecticulam lucubratoriam] a pallet or low bedde made for the nones, to rest and studie upon. (a) BY whose report, he wanted not much of the ful height of men, to wit, nere six foot, according to Vege∣tius.79 Above which Stature the grouth is somewhat giantlike.80 (a) AD Impetiginis formam. The second kinde whereof, as CORNELIVS CELSVS writeth, (for willingly do I often cite him as the Roman Galene, in explication of a Roman writer) Varias figuras habet i. resembleth many and sundre formes. lib. 5. cap. 28.
(b) This infirmitie of his was a kinde of gout, which the Greeke writers call Ischas, and is com∣monly named Sciatica. As for the  or pallia∣tiue cure rather (for easement o paine) with sand: It may be meant eyther of some omentations with linnen bagges wherein was sand. For, Cornelius Caesar writeth, That  seed, salt, and sand, or any of them put within a linnen cloath, and so applied to the affected place, cure the said disease: or of wal∣king in sand by the sea side, or elle of tumbling and wallowing therein: Which remedie Q. Serenus  in this verse: Nec non & tepidis conuoluere corpus arenis, &c. hath prescribed and experience verified. () CATO in his Husbandrie, and PLINIE lib. 17. cap. vltimo, maketh mention of cuing the Scia∣tica with a clift of agreen cane or reed, but there must be forsooth, a charme go with all, and so, it reposeth  or bones out of ioynt. Indeed, both Di∣, and also , attribute vnto the rinde or barke of Cane rootes, and to their ases  desicca∣tiue vertue: Whereby, they are found good for such dislocation, and o may cure the Articular disease likewise, called Sciatica, which differeth not much from a dislocation, of the huckle-bone. (d) PLINIE reporteth 3. cap. lib. 25. That the  of the bladder, and especially the Stran∣gurie, i.  drop-meale, occasioned by grauell, (which I take heere to be meant) is of all others most dolorous. (a) THIS accordeth to an observation of Cornelius81 Cels. Qui secundis aliquando frustra curatus est, contrariis aliquando restituitur. 1. The patient whose cure devised by art, and according to the rule of Physicke, some∣time speedeth not well, recouereth otherwhile by a course of meanes quite contrarie. (b) Which the Greekes call Periodicall: As the Quartane Ague and other  fevers be so termed because their fits returne vpon certaine daes. The falling sicknesse likewise, keeping time with the moone, whereupon some name it Lunat. cus. And gouts, which are most busie in the spring and the fall, &c. (c) Toward the end of September. An unequall season of the yeare, wherin commonly, the morings and evenings be cold, and the Noone  hotte, whereby many diseases are occasioned. But as touch∣ing the Birth-day heere mentioned, Valerius Max and Pinie report. That Antiater Sdonius the Poet every yeare vpon the day of his Nativitie onely felt the ac∣cesse of an Ague. Whereof he died in the end, after he had lived to a gret age. (a) No maruaile  in cacochymicall bodies, such as his was, the humors which lay still and quiet all Winter, began to spread and swell in the spring cau∣sing Distentions and Ventosities: especially in that place where they were gathered and laid up as it were in store, to doe a mischiefe when the time came. (a) FAEMINALIEVS & tibialibus. In steede82 of our Breeches and Stockings, the Greeks and , used n those daies certaine loose cloathes in manner of  hands to cover and lap their . And long it was, re they tooke to anie such,  it were upon occasion of some disease. Witnesse  PHILIP King of Macedonia who as PLVTACH, when he sae in Port sale of ertaine slaves or captives, was admonished by one of them to let downe his upmost garment for to hide his shame▪ IVLIVS CAESAR  himselfe, be∣ing deadly wounded, was carefull to let fall the lap of his which v∣sually was cast ouer the shoulder. gowne for to cover his privie parts when he should fall. In processe of time they tooke to wea∣ring the cloathes aforesaid in lieu of . 1. Bree∣ches, which the French and other barbarous Nati∣ons used: but they did so in Winter onely. For, o∣therwise they went ordinarily in those parts without tusses: covering all as mannerly as they could with their loose upper garment, which upon a small occa∣sion were readie to flie open. (b) Partly, to make a noise, and so to procure sleepe, and in part to refresh and coole the Ayre. (c) As well to coole him as to drive away gnats, for want of curtaines or a canopie, which thereof tooke the name in Greeke  or  Now the manner of this  or making wind was for the better and daintier sort, with plumes of pea∣cocks tailes, much like to the  of feather used in these daies as well as in old time, but for the mea∣ner, with beasts tailes. (d) From Rome to Praeneste or Tbur, is about one hundred Stadia if then, you reckon 125. pases to a Stadium, it commeth to 12. miles and an halfe. CA∣TO CENSORIVS was of another minde, who said he Repented when soever he went to any place by water if he might, by land. (e) The abstinence wherof in some measure is good for those that have feeble joynts, and be remembred otherwhiles with any gout, as AVGVSTVS was yet a thing that Physicians in old time could hardly bring their patients unto, so ordinarie it was in those daies to both. (f) Which, the wanton and delicate Ladies of Rome, as PLINIE writeth, used of silver.83 (a) AD pilam. Whereas there were divers kinds of bals to play with, it seemes, that he meaneth in this place that, which of all other was least and hardest, as being stuffed with haire, wherevpon it tooke the name: the same no doubt that our Tennis Ball is sent to and fro with the Racket. Named likewwise it was Trigonalis, of a Tennis court within the baines, three square walled: from which wals the ball did rebound. Of this ball, and the exercise thereof, GA∣LEN wrote a Treatise. (b) Folliculum. By Folliculus is meant a kinde of wind hand ball covered with lether: having within it a bladder puffed up with wind, the softest & lightest of all others, smitten, not with a racket as the other, not with the palme of the hand, as that which they called Pagaica, filled with woole, flocks or yarne, but driven with the dutched fist, whereupon it tooke the name PVGILLATORIA. (e) So TVRNEVS expoundeth it. But ISA∣ACVS CASAVEONVS understandeth thereby, Segestrie or Segesirium, in Greeke , a light blanquet or quilt. (d) By this, is meant a play, that children used, and not that game of hazard resembling dice, at which, hee saide before, they played .
() For ought that I can gather out of the sundry conjectures of expositours, these Ocellati made of sil∣ver or Iron, resemble the game of young Gentle wo∣men called of some Trol-Made: or else that pastime of boyes named nin holes. (a) BESIDES the pretie allusion unto the fa∣bulous85 historie of AIA, TORRENTIVS hath observed in the word Spongia, a double signification: to wit, a spunge called Deletilis, which writers had at hand, eyther to wipe and wash out what misliked them, or to blure and blot the same, according to these of the Poet AVSONIVS. Aut ctis paritr erfibus obliat Futram lacticolor spongia sepiam. Whereupon Martialis saith of it, Vtilis hc quoties scripta novare voles. and also a sword. Which addeth the better grace un∣to the conceit, considering that AIAX fell upon his owne sword. But in this latter sense, I have not yet found Spongia taken, in any approved author. (a) AVGVSTVS taxed MAECENAS for be∣ing86 Cacozelos, and found as much fault with TIRE∣RIVS, because he was Antigarius. (b) By these words  Cincinnos AV∣GVSTVS noreth the affectate forced phrases, and curious ynkehorne termes as it were, of MAECE∣NAS, Cuius oratio, as SENECA reporteth of him Epist. 94. aeque soluta est, c ipse discinctus. His manner of stile might be compared to those haires of his, curled with crisping pins & besmered with odorife∣rous oiles, which CICERO calleth caplles calamistra∣tes & delibutes. Neither do I thinke that AVGVSTVS rereprehendeth MARCENAS for using these words,  cincinnos, because it is his owne manner in writing to enterlace Greeke with Latin, & besides, Carozel is therein to be found. But his over curious termes and new devised phrases he so calleth, for that MAECENAS was wont in trimming and tricking up himselfe to be somewhat womannish. (c) AVGVSTVS in a certaine Epistle unto Ma∣cenas by expressing his owne nice and delicate phra∣ses, after a sort derideth them, and dehorteth him thereto, in these words. Vale el  Medulli ebur ex Hetruria, laser Aretinum, adames supernas, Ti∣berinum Margaritum, Cilniorum Smaragde, Iaspi figu∣lorum, Berylle Prcenne, carbunculum Italiae,  Maecharum. In which words, as in a mirror he might see himselfe. (d) As if he should say, Never a barrell better her∣ring. There was neyther of them better than other, as offending both waies. The Asiatick Orators were Cacogel, Ciber Atticus and Vranius, Antiquaris. So that, it was meere folly & vanitie to make any doubt, whether of them to imitate, being all starke naught. (a) This SPHAERVS was a deep Scholler & great89 Humanitian as we speake, and whom the Greekes call Philologo. Vnder him AVGVSTVS became  i. skilfull in historie, Antiquities &c. like as, under AEVS he learned Philosophy. (b) The principall Authors whereof HORATI∣VS comprised in this verse. Epolis atque Cratin Aristophanesque pota. In this manner of Comedie the vices of men and women were represented and taxed upon the stage over-boldly, and bravely to their discredit. For which it grew to be offensive, & was laid away a long time. (c) Who was Censor in his time, and perswaded in his orations that al men of what degree soever should be compelled to marie for procreation of children.90 () PLINIE lib. 2. cap. 55. Nat. Hist. writeth, that it never lighneth above five foot within the ground. Fearfull persons therfore thinke such deepe caves most safe.91 () BY this custome and gesture, as the Argu∣ment and circumstance of the place naturally im∣porteth, he thoght to intreat the goddesse Neisis for to spare him: Nesis I say, whom the Hea enn a∣gined to attend with an envicus eye, upon all exces∣sive prosporiie. To avoid therefore adverse after∣claps, which this sptefull goddesse might bring up∣on him, unlesse they were pacified, AVGVSTVS thus debased himselfe superstitiously, and in some sort, seemed to abridge his owne felicie. Much af∣ter the manner of POLYCRATES that rich tyrant who to be excused from this Nemesis, flng into the sea a lewel, with a pretious stone of inestimable price.92 (a) NVNDINAE among the Romans were those daies in every moneth. Whereon they kept fayres and markets. It should seeme therefore, that he held the day after them ominous and of unlucky presage, as we say in our proverbe, A day after the faire, or else because he had sometime not sped very well, when as he did set out in his journey upon such a day. (b) Nois, quasi, non is, which literaly osseth as much as, you go not. Much like to that in Plinie 15. lib. cap. 19. When M. Crassus was readie to embarke in that infortunate expedition into Parthia where he was slaine, a fellow cried certaine figs to be sold with this note Cauneas, Canneas (for of that kinde were those figs) which ossed thus much unto him, as if in short speech he had cried cave ne eas, cave ne eas,93 i. Take heede you go not this voyage. (a) AN Idoll resembling an Oxe, which the Ae∣gyptians worshipped as a God for Serapis. (b) He did this, as it should seeme in policy, be∣cause he would not be thought addicted to the Iew∣ish sect. For otherwise it appeareth as well by his∣gracious Indulgences granted unto them, as his own testimonie in Edicts & commissiōs, wherin he giveth unto their God [the true & onely God] the attribute of , and instituted for ever certaine Holocausts, or whole burnt offerings, to wit, two lambs and one bul, to be offered unto that soveraigne & most high Diety.94 (a) SOME have expounded this of our Savi∣our Chist, King, not of Rome onely, but also of all the world, who tooke our nature vpon him, and was borne in the daies of Augustus Caesar. (b) The like conception by a serpent is reported of Olympis the mother of king ALEXANDER the great, of POMPONIA likwise the mother of SCIPIO AFRICANVS. (c) This broad seale wherewith were signed let∣ters Patents and other publike Instruments, caried a stamp representing the Citie of Rome: and beingthus put into his bosom, prefigured that he one day should have the governement of the state & commonweale. (d) Symbolizing thereby, that the Citizens of Rome, who before time mightnot lawfully be scourged were in danger to loose their liberty in that behalfe.
(a) Or, when he stood the first time for to be95 Consull. For, the maner was of the Candidats or Competitours of the Consulship, the night before the Election day to lie without the Citie abroad in the open ayre: and afterwards earely in the mor∣ning to sit in a chaire made of one entier peece with∣in the precinct of a certaine place therefore appoin∣ted (which thereupon was called Templum) and there, to waite and expect untill some God presented unto them a good and fortunate signe. (a) CVM ageri bostias imperasset.] The manner96 was of the Pains if they could not speed of their Gods fauour at the first sacrifice, to kill more beasts still, untill they saw some tokens thereof: which in the Southsayers learning was called Lit. Thus did PAVLVS AENILIVS for 20 together, and obtained no warrant of happie successe before he had slaine the one and twentith. Yet some write, that Sacrifices are then said Augeri, whē together with the beasts, there is use of Salsa la, i. meat & salt. Which kind of Oftes be called Macta, quasi, magis auct. (b) Significant names both, and osses of victorie. EVTICHVS, importeth Luckie or Fortunate: Nicon Victour or Conquerour. (a) This solemnitie of purging the Armie everie five yeares was instituted by King SERVIVS TVL∣LVS,97 and celebrated with the Sacrifice of a Swine, a Sheepe and a Bull, named there upon Suotaurilia. Heereupon, the revolution of five yeares, they called Lustrum. This function or office belonged afterwards to Generals of the field: like as the Expiation and purging of the people unto the Censours. And this maner of Lustrum is here meant. Carol. Sig. Ascn. (b) Writings or Instruments signed, conteyning the said vowes: whereby they bound themselues, as it were, by obligation to pay and performe the same. Oftentimes also they fastened them with waxe unto the knees of those Gods or Idols unto whom they nuncupated those vowes, according to that verse of Irenal. Satyr. Propter qu fas est genu incerare Deorum. (c) Praeter consuetudine.] SVETONIV see∣meth heere to forget himselfe, writing that Augustus contrarie to his olde wont embarked by night, ha∣ving reported before, that it was his manner so to doe. Torrentius would salve all, expounding it thus, that his hastie and long journey (for it was a good stretch from Astura to Beneventum) was contrarie to his wonted manner. But to speake, what I thinke, his journey now by night, was occasioned by a gale of winde that serued well for Benevntum, and hath no reference at all to his accustomed travaile. Some would read, (pro consuetudin) i. after his usuall ma∣ner, but they respect not the scope of our Author, whose purpose in this place is to put downe certaine particulars that were ominous and presaging his death. Among which, this may be reckoned for one, That he did a thing now, repugnant to his ordi∣narie guise. A point, I wis, observed too much even now a daies by those that are superstitiously given. Although, I am not ignorant, that of this observa∣tion, in sicke foke, there may be a naturall reason tendered out of Phisicke. (a) DE naui Alexandrina. By Navis he meaneth98 as I suppose, assis (by the trope Synecdocie) i. the whole fleete, like as by the same figere, ciassis signi∣fieth a ship. For one vessell alone arrived nor into that haven of Puteli, fraught with marchandise, considering that the same is by other  named , and Coeatus. Yea, and by the figure , Martial calleth is Niliacus , which properly betokeneth the fleet when it is arrived. Neyther is it like that Mariners and Passengers out of one ship onely saluted AVGVSTVS in this wise. (b) Quadragenes . Euery such peece was worth fifteene shillings starling and better, aunswe∣rable to our Spurre Roials. (c) These commodities were thought to be Drugs and Spices of all sorts, webs or clothes in Say, Books, Paper, Glasses of sundrie fashions, teere of flaxe, hirds, or Tow, sindall or fine lnen, twisted yarne and threed of divers colours, Babylonian and Aegyptian cloath, well favoured bondslaves, and of good education, &c. (d) Vicinam capreis insiclam.] Yet some read other∣wise, Vicinam capreas insulam . The Iland Caprea neere adjoyning, as if AVGVSTVS had abode all this while in the skirt and coast of Campania, or in some other of the neighbour Ilands. But I incline rather to the former exposition. (e) The Citie of Ease and Idlenesse. (f) This MASGAAS, seemeth by his name to have beene an Africane, whom AVGVSTVS had made Constable as it were of that place, and ruler over a Companie, that he sent thither to dwell, after he had purchased it of the Neapolitanes. And for that AVGVSTVS had in mirth given him the name of Founder, he was so reputed, and his yeares minde after his death solemnized accordingly. (g) Morbo variate. I take it, he meaneth that which Clsus calleth Alvum variam, and other Physi∣tians Egestiones varias, namely when in a fluxe the excrements & humors be of diverscolours, an argu∣ment that nature is not able to concoct them being so irrigular, and therfore, somtimes a deadly figure. Or, it may be expounded thus, That other whiles he seemed to be better and on the mending hand, and thereupon more venerous. Then read, Mor be variante tamen, &c. (h) Celebrated everie five yeares after the Graecian manner, and called Gymnicke, because the mastenes therein, were performed by Champions for their better agilitie well neere naked. (a) This was a speciall honour and indulgence100 granted by a singular priviledge, for otherwise it was against the custome & lawes of the Romans to bring a dead bodie into a sacred place, or into the Citie, for feare of polluting and profaining it. (b) The Senatours and Gentlemen of Rome wore rings of Gold, the Commoners of Iron (c) The chiefe Colledges & Societies, at this time were compted foure, that is to say. The Pontifies or chiefe Priests, the Augures, the Septe-virs, or se∣ven wardens called Eplones, for that to thē belonged the charge of providing the sacred feasts, the sump∣tuous suppers of the Pontifies, named Coea adjiciales, as also the stately Tables, in the honour of Iupiter and other Gods, and fourthly, of the Quind ecivirs, sacris facidis. i. Fifteene overseers of the Sacrifices. Afterwards adjoyned there was to these a fifth, Au∣gustalium Sodalium, erected by order from AVGVS∣TVS, and others in processe of time by his precede.
(d) This Rostra was the publicke pulpit for Ora∣tions, standing in the common Market place, called Forum Romanu: so called for that it was beautified with the beake-heads of ships (named in Latine, Rostrae) which in a memorable fight at Sea, the Ro∣mans wonne from their enemies. Neere vnto which were certaine shops called Veteres Tabern: and ab∣solutely veteres, for distinction of others, knowen by the name of Nouae. i. the new shops. Yet some are of opinion, that in this place our Author meaneth Rostra veteres. i. the olde pulpit: to put a diffe∣rence betweene it and another named Novae i. the New. (e) You must thinke, That the dead bodie to be burnt in a funerall fire, was set therein so, as the ashes and bones thereof remained a part by them∣selves from the rest. Otherwise, the ashes of wood, the bones likewise of horses and other beasts some∣times burnt therewith, should have the honour due unto the said dead corps. Some are of opinion that it was lapped in a linnen sheete of the faxe called Asbeston, which would not bee consumed with fire. (f) The sumptuons Tombe that Queene Arte∣misa built for her husband MANSOLVS King of Caria, and reckoned one of the seven wonders of the world, was called Mansoleum, after his name. Where∣vpon, at such costly and stately monuments are so named; and more particularly, that of AVGVSTVS. Of which you may read more. 5. Gergrasti Stre∣bonis, for the better explanation of this place. (a) DEPOSITVM apud se.] Some read, apud101 se, se vgines vestiles, as if fixe of these Vestail vir∣gins had the custodie thereof, or at least wise brought the same forth, being committed to them all, and the seventh, named Maxima, the Proresse as it were, and governesse of the rest, were left be∣hinde. (b) This hath a reference unto the As, or pound waight Romaine consisteth of 12. ounces. which standeth for the base and rule of many other things: and namely heere for the entiere inheritance that AVGVSTVS disposed of by his last will and Testa∣ment. For, two third parts of 12. he gave unto TI∣BERIVS: and another third part unto LIVIA, which made vp the whole. (c) That against the law , which expresly provided, That no man should endow a woman in more thē the fourth part of his goods. So that if a man died seized of one hundred thousand pounds, his wife might not enjoy the thirds, but onely 25000 pounds and no more. Howbeit AVGVSTVS had a speciall Indulgence and dispensation for this Lawe. (d) Albeit TIBERIVS had beene long be∣fore adopted his sonne, and thereby may be thought to have assumed the names of his civil father, into his stile: yet this surname onely of AVGVSTVS, would not he communicate with him, but left it as here di∣tarie after his decease; as apeareth in Tiberius. As for Livia, after Augustus his death she was common∣ly called Iulia Augusta: how ever some writers re∣taine her olde name Livia, and others againe in Au∣gustus his life name her Iulta: by the figure Prolepsis because she caried that name after he was dead. (e) In most copies of SVETONIVS you find this reading, Legavit populo Romano quadringentis, tribubustricies quinquies. In which words there may be thought a Tautologie. For that the people of Rome and the Tribes (which were in number 135) be all one. Therefore, some learned men have thought good to leave out the later clause wholly, or at least∣wise, the word Tribulus. Others againe would have heere two legacies to be implied, the one of foure millens given generally in common to the whole bodie and people of Rome, the other of three mil∣lenes and one halfe, to be distributed among the Tribes in particular, or to the poorest persons in eve∣rie Tribe according to the discretion of their Vicina∣gistri. And these, put a distinction betweene populus and plebs, which plebs is heere understood vnder the name of Tribulus. But I leave it indifferent, al∣though I am not ignorant, that sometimes Populus and tribus be confounded and put the one for the o∣ther, as also that tribus stand of the vulgar and mea∣ner sort of the people onely, expresly distinct from populus, Equites and Senatores, which the Poet ter∣meth Sine nomine turbam: and T. LIVIVS not un∣aptly, Ignota captia. (f) Which amounteth by the computaion of BVDAEVS to three thousand and fiue hundred Myrigdes.
ANNOTATIONS VPON Tiberius Nero Caesar: IT seemeth that in1 his owne Native countrey, where the Inhabitantes, before time were descended from the Greeks, he had to name Atta Clausus: and being once incorporate a∣mong the Romans, changed it, into APPIVS CLAVDIVS. Now, Atta auoreth of the Greeke word , which is in going, not to set the sole of the foote firmely upon the ground, but rather lightly to tread as it were, on uptoe. Heereupon, as FESTVS noeth, they that have that imperfection in their fere, whereby they can go no better, be called Attae. Which was the oc∣casion, that one of the said house tooke that name first, and so his posterie after him. Like as among the Romanes, of another accident, arose the name Agryppa first. For that one was borne into the world with his feere forward. And these additions, whether they were forenames or surnames in the beginning, it skileth not For surnames in continuance of time came to be forenames, and contrariwise. (b) If you have recourse unto the Originall, NE∣RO is as much as , or  i. Nervatus or Nervosus: that is to say, well compact of nerves and sinewes: and such are strong. (a) SENECA reporteth in his booke Debrevitate2 , cap. 12. That this CLAVDIVS perswaded the Romanes first, to go to ea, and embarke: Where∣upon he was styled Caudex, which in our Latin is as much to say, as the framing, and joyning together of many plants or ribs of timber, which is the very Periphrases of a Bake. (b) One if his predecessours who had a Iurisdicti∣on there, gave it that name, as having built likewise a Forum or Hall of Iustice there. whereupon the In∣tonts of it and the territour thereabout, owing service to that court, as Clients & dependants to that  aforded this CLADIVS a meete place for him of Innovation and usurping unlawfull do∣mion. (c) Observing Ignes from Birds, by their fee∣ding, flying or otherwise, that might give him war∣rant to go forward with the favour of the Gods, in his Enterprise. (d) Adoptions by order of Law, should follow the course of Nature, whereby the sonne, cannot be elder than the Father. The cause why he sought thus extraordinar to bee adopted a commoner, as that he might be chosen Tribune of the law. (e) The usuall manner in Rome was, that those persons who were arrested for criminall causes, du∣ring all the time of their trouble and triall, should chaunge their apparell, and insteed of gownes which were faire and white, put on others sullied and foule, thereby to moove mertie and compassion of the people. Whereupon such, Rei were called Sordidati. (f) These Tribunes of the commons as may ap∣peare in T. LIVIVS were sacrosancti. i. Vnvio∣lable, and such as no violent hands might bee laid upon. (a) So called, of Salinae, the salt pits or salt hou∣ses.3 For being Censor e set an impost upon salt, and thereby augmented the revenewes of the State, little to the benefit or contemment of the people. (a) FOR the manner was, that Governours of4 provinces, who (as they were) so would be counted also, more courteous than others, should unrequested allow some of their lectors unto all Roman Senators that repayred unto them, for to doe them honour: Ci. ep. ad carnificium. (a) IN token of his nativitie there which as they gave out, was borne to the good vrbis & orbis. i. Of5 Rome and the whole world besides, for so, by way of flatterie they magnified their Princes. (a) Some read, Luctuosam. i. sorrowfull, in regard of many hurts and dangers.6 (b) When a chariot is drawne by a teeme of foure steeds all in one ranke or affront, as we may see them pourtraited vpon divers coines, it must needs bee that the two middle ae joyned or yoaked as it were to the spie pole running betweene them: and these be called . The other two then are without, the one on the left, and the other on the right side, called  in Greeke, and in this place by our Authour Funales, because they are guided and ruled by a cord or some reines or cheine in lieu thereof. And say, that these quadrigij or foure steeds drawe two by two in files, one pay re before the other: those which be next unto the hariot be aptly called Ia∣les, and those before them beyond the spire, Funaes, of which, TIBERIVS rode upon one and MAR∣CELLVS upon the other. (a) ACCORDING to the vulgar speach, 10 samiliarit as paerit contemptum. (a) THESE daies were called Tali, because at14 first they used with such cockall bones named Tali to play: but afterwards they were made of Ivory, gold, &c. Among many sorts of sorceries and divinations, one there was by these bones or dies, and the wisards that professed their cunning in it, were termed . (b) For the greater light to this place, and bet∣ter proofe of Thrasillus skill, Din reporteth, that when TARIVS intended verily to throw him downe
headlong, he perceived him by his counterance to be much troubled and disquieted in minde, where∣upon he demaunded the cause thereof, and then Thrasyllus answered, that by speculation of the Stars he foresaw some present daunger to himselfe, and so Tiberius durst not proceede to execute this intent of his. (a) SEPTA, was a place in Mars Field railed a∣bout at first like a sheepe Pen: whereupon it was cal∣led17 Ovilia. But afterwards mounted with Marble stone, beautified also with stately galleries and walks, within which cloysture and precinct, the people of∣tentimes assembled about Election of Magistrates and other publicke affayres: yea and with wares which were there set out to be sold. As Alex ab Alex∣andro witnesseth. (a) Some read Bructers, of which name there is19 a nation, as well as of the Rhutaine in Gaule. Others, Rutero, as if he meant one of those horsemen or ri∣ders in Germanie, which at this day be called Rtters.20 (a) A long robe embrodred and garde with pur∣ple, a cassocke branched with Date tres worke, a rich mantell of sundry colours. A chaplet of Lau∣rell, a staffe & chaire, both of Ivorie, Liv. lib. 30. (a) BY this aenigmaticall speech, AVGVSTVS compareth the State of the people of Rome, unto the21 miserable case of one, whom some savage and cruell beast hath gotten betweene his teeth, not devouring and dispatching him at once, but there holdeth and cheweth him along while in exceeding paine: allu∣ding to the secret malice, and dreaming nature withall of TIBERIVS. (b) It should seeme that in adopting him, he used these very words, Hoc Reipub▪ causa faci. i. This doe  for the common-wealthes sake. (c) Alluding to this verse of Eius in the commen∣dation of Qu. Fabius Max, Vnus homo nobis cctando restituit rem. One man alone by sage delay Restor'd our state fall'n to decay. (d) In the tenth booke of his Iliads, where Dio∣medes in making choise of Vlysses, to exploit a pecce of service with him, giveth him this praise. (a) The Tribunes of the commons had power to call a Senate, but not whensoever they would,23 without a speciall Decree graunted by the Nobles. (a) THE cohort or band of Souldiers which were of the Princes Guard, were called Praetoriani, taking25 that name of Praetorium which signifieth the Lord Generals Pavilion in the campe, his Royall Pallace in Rome and else where. As also the Lord Deputies house of. Estate in any Province. Now those Soul∣diers that gave attendance and served in this place about the Prince or Governour, were intertained in better condition than the rest, because their wages was greater, and the time of their service shorter. For AVGVSTVS had set downe their terme twelue yeares, whereas the rest, before they could be dis∣charged, were to serve sixteene: (b) It may be thought, that Germaniciani as well by the Grammaticall Analogie of the letter, as al∣so by some circumstance of this verie place, import a referēce unto Germanicus the son of Drusus disceased. Like as Vitellini, Flaviani. &c. But the learned observe, that as an Armie lying encamped or in Garrison, in Germanie, is properly in Latin called Germanicus, so the Soldiours of the said Armie be fitly named Germaniciani. (a) These solemnities were exhibited about the26 midst of November, whereas the other, named Ro∣mans, were held in the beginning of September. (b) It is to be noted, that the name of Imperator in the Roman Historie is taken three waies: First, for him, who by commission or warrant from the State, hath the conducting of an Armie, And in this sense, it hath relation to Souldiers. And is all one, with Lord Generall of the field, or a commaunder, &c. and the same that Praetor was in olde time. Se∣condly, for a Victor or Conquerer, namely when such a Generall or chiefetaine hath bv naturall pre∣cesse atchieved many valiant exploits, & put to sword such a number of enemies, as the law setteth downe. For then the souldiers were wont to salute him by the name of Imperatori. Conquerour. Lastly for a So veraigne Prince, King and Monarch. In the first acception, it is a meere Relative In the second a surname, In the third and last, the forename of all the Romane Emperours, to wit, from IVLIVS, CAESAR forward Who although they wore not the Crowne and Diademe, were neverthelesse, abso∣lute Princes, Soveraignes, Kings and Monarches. The want of this distinction may breed some troubl in the readers of the Romant Historie. (c) Made of Oke branches, or in default thereof, of some other tree bearing mast: which garland by the first institution, was given to that souldier, who in battell had rescued a Citizen of Rome and saved his life. And afterwards, it, together with the Lau∣rell, beautified the gates of the CAESARS Palaces, although some of them were bloodie Tyrants, & made no spare of their citizens and subiects lives. (a) THE manner was, if Prince or Senatour were caried in his Litter, usually supported by eight bond-servants, and thereupon called Octophorn, to have a companie of Citizens in their gownes going before, and accompanying him by his side, as also certaine servitours to carie his curule chairc o ivory behinde. (a) THIS free embassage, called Libera legatio,30 was granted many times to such, as being desirous eyther to travell and see fortaine countries, or to fly, for avoiding of daungerous troubles at home: therby to be better intertained abroad, and with the more honest colour, to conceale the occasion of their de∣parture, & absence as if they were sent from the state, about the affayres onely of Common-weale. (a) IT was not ordinarie with the Em∣perours to accompanie the corpes unto the fu31 nerall Fire: but onely to vouchsafe their presence at the Funerall Oration in the Forum or common place. This therefore may be attributed unto TI∣BERIVS his civill humanitie. (b) It appeareth by Dion, that they had omitted to subscribe the clause which went in this forme, Vota facimus pro te, Imperator i. We make our vowes (and pray) for thee O Emperour. (a) CAVSES were heard judicially, and Iustice32 ministred, eyther from a superiour place as the Tri∣bunall
or beneath upon the even and plaine ground, de plano, as the Lawyers speake, so that there were a Chaire or seat for the judge to fit upon. And the said place of Iustice wheresoever, eyther pro tribunali, or de plano posita sella, is properly called Ius: as Ca∣rolus Sigonus hath observed. lib. 1. cap. 7. de Iudiciis. Whereupon commeth the usuall phrase, In ius vocar. It seemeth therefore, that Tiberius would come into the Comitium or Hall of Iustice, and take his place, sometime within the Tribunall (for it was a spacious rowme) or else fit in his Curule chaire of Ivory be∣neath, as a moderator, which is expressed heere by the terme de plano. (a) As Marchpanes, Tarts, Gingerbreed, Cu∣stards,34 Sugred Bisket, and generally all manner of pastrie-conceits, wrought with honie or sugar. The worke man is called Dulciarius, and the things, Bal∣laria Mellita, or Pemmata. Toves not onely need∣lesse, but hurtfull also to the bodie, according to that in Aulus Gellius, lib. 13. cap 11. Noct-Attic. ex var. Bellaria ea maxime sunt millita quae mallita  sunt:  societas inside. i. such iunkers sortOr digestion. not well with * Concoction.35 (a) Diverse Statutes there were sharpely punish∣ing the adulterie of Matrones or maried wives. An Actt likewise passed in the Senate, that no Person of Knights degree or above, should play upon the stage, performe sword fight, or combat with wild beastes for hire - Providing all to preserve the honour of wedlocke entire, and to maintaine the reputation of Knighthood and Nobilitie. Those shamelesse dames therefore, of whom Suetonius writeth in this place, eyther because they would be thought vnworthie to be reckoned within the censure of Law, or as TACITVS writeth, deemed to have abidden pu∣nishment enough in making profession of so base a trade and life. These lewde persons likewise, and unreblameable unthrifts suffering themselves thus to appeare noted with infamie, and that upon record, made accompt, both the one and the other not to be obnoxious or liable unto the statutes & acts aforesaid (b) The manner was at Rome, for Tenaunts to remoove and flit out of one house into another, upon the first day of Iuly, like as with us, at the feastes of Saint Michaell and the Anunciation of the Virgin Marie: which are the ordinarie rent daies. (a) IOSEPHVS. lib. 18. Antiquit. Iudaic. writeth36 that Tiberius sent 000. of them into Sardinia, an I∣land in Summer time especially, verie intemperate and unwholsome, as may appeare by that pretie E∣pigram of Martialis, wherein he opposeth the heal∣thie Citie Tibur, to the pestilent Isle Sardinia. Nullo fata loco possi excludere, cum ors Venerit, in Medio tibure Sardinia est. No place exempt from fatall death, for when our time is come, Mid- Tibut, will Sardina be found of all and some. (a) THIS , who gave occasion of this By-word, was a famous Stage-player, or one of these38 Mimi, counterfaiting other mens gestures, as Bera∣aldus supposeth. See Plutarch in Apophtheg Laonic, (a) BIBERIVS, a bibendo i. of drinking. Cal∣ius, a Calda, or Calia. i. hote. Mero of Merum.39 1. strong wine. An elegant Agnonuniation: where∣by is shewed, that he loved to drinke wine hoe, which is right delicate, & goeth downe more merily (b) The Italicke Amphor conteyneth 48. , everie Sextarius 20 ounces Mensurles, which is a wine pinte and halfe of our measure with the better. By which reckoning he dke at one meale a run∣dlet of ten wine gallons well neere. (c) A Bird that feedeth upon grapes and figges especially, whereupon it tooke the name. In Autumne or the latter end of Summer it is so called: at other times Melanocoryphus, or Atricapilla, of the blacke cop, or hair-like fethers that it carieth upon the head. (d) Of this Bird for the daintie flesh of it Martiall made this Epigram, Inter aves, turdus, si quis  judic certet, Inter quadrupedes, groria prima Lep. Of fethered foules, if I may iudge, the blackbirde is the best, Among four-footed beasts the Haire surpasseth all the rest. (e) To invet and devise new pleasures. (a) ALLVDING partly to the Isle Caprea, and in part eyther to Capra in Latin, a goat, or to  in43 Greek, a wild bore, and that member, Quo viri sumus. (a) Seneca reporteth thus, lib. 2. de oenefic. cap. 27.49 Quater millies sesterti suum vidit. i. He saw of his owne, 400 millions of Sesterces. (b) Provided it was by an auncient law, and the same revived by IVL. CAESAR DICTATOR, that no person should in silver or gold possesse a∣boue 60 sestertia, that is, Three score thousand se∣stertis. This also may have a relation to that order set downe by him a little before, That named men and vsurers should lay out two third parts of their stocke in lands and houses, &c. (a) As we say, to make him Iustice of Quorum, &c. For the decuries of Iudges were they Quorum nomina,51 were written in the Commission Roll. (a) The Greeke verse is red thus, 53 , or . &c. (b) Scaliae Gemoniae. A place at Rome upon the A∣ventine hill, into which the dead bodies of malefac∣tors were dragged and throwen with shame. (a) THEY speake the Greeke language general∣ly throughout all Greece, yet not after one manner. For in divers parts were different kindes of Greeke56 called Dialects, to wit, Attick, Ionick, Acolick, &c. Like as with vs in Great Britaine a common English tongue goeth wel neere throughout the whole Iland, albeit there is a diversity perceived between the Scot tish or Northren English, and the Southerne, be∣tweene the Cornish and the Kensh, &c. (a) In so doing the bodie must needes be bared &58 some shame discouered which being an Impietie be∣fore the sacred Images of the Gods, was made Treason also before the Emperours Statue, unto whom diuine honours were exhibited. (a) The last Hexastichon or 6 verses, seemeth to make one entier Epigram by it selfe. Every Disticl59 before, carieth a seuerall sense. And as for the first two, they seeme to haue a reference to the time, whiles he abode in Rhodes, before he was Sui Iuris. (a) At which times, both among the Greekes and Romans also, the manner was to forbeare Execution yea and to ease prisoners of their yrons.61 (b) As if under his person he had offered abuse vnto the Emperour Tiberius. (c) He would say, The courage and generositys of the Romans died with them, seing that none arose
to recover their libertie oppressed and trode under foote by this Tytat Tberius. (d) Rather, two hundred and twentie. For Tau∣us lib. 6. Anual. reporteth, that all the suspected complices of Seianus were killed, Iacit immensa stra∣ge,  sexus, omnis , &c. (e) The like hypocriticall Religion was practised during the bloudie prescription in the Triumvirate. A young Gentleman nobly borne, because he might not be killed lawfully, praetextatis i. under age, and wearing still his embrodered garment praetexta, hee commaunded to put on his virile gowne, and so he was murthered. Appian. Di. (a) FOR wonderfully addicted he was to the stu∣die67 of Astrologie, and such curious Arts. (a) THE full stature of men in Italy, was six foot68 wanting two ynches, if men grew higher than sixe they were accompted exceeding tall, if to se∣ven, (and to that height men may grow, as Var∣ro, Gellius and Solinus doe write) they went for Gi∣ants. So that in Musters yong men were chosen sol∣diours, five foote high and ten ynches, which was called Iusta statura. (b) Some read subiti, and not subtiles, to signifie that such pimples continued not, but arose and felt at times, much like to those that the Physitians call Hidroa, Sudamina, or papulus sudorum according to PLINIE, proceeding of heat or swear, if the hu∣mours be sharpe. (c) Such be termed in Greeke . And if we may beleeve the Physiognomie delivered by A∣RISTOTLE: they be by nature deceitfull and wilie, given to circumvent, entrap and supplant others. (d) CORNELIVS CELSVS, among other good rules and precepts of Health, writeth thus,   qui & bene valet & suae spontis est, nullis obligare se legibus debet, ac ne dico neque alipta gere, &c. But give he what directions he will, and let us say what wee can to this point, that men and women may be Physicians to themselves, such is there mis∣government in diet and otherwise, that Physitians shall never want imployment. And as touching thirty years, of age TACITVS addeth moreover & saith, That Tiberius. he was wont to mock those and hold them to be fooles, who after the said yeares had neede of o∣ther mens instructions, to know what was good or hurtfull for their bodies. Whereupon might arise our English proverbe, A foole or a physiti. (a) SVCH as were sung to the Harpe. In which70 kinde Pindarus excelled among the Greekes, and Horace among the Romans. (b) One of AVOVSIVS [adopted] sonnes. Yet some read IVLIVS CAESAR. (a) A word usuall with us in these daies, for who71 knoweth not that Monopoly is, when one man en∣grosseth some commoditie into his owne handes, that none may sell the same but himselfe, or from him? (b) It signifieth in this place a peece of workman∣ship set upon a cup or other vessell of Gold or Silver to garnish the same, so fitted, as it may be put to, or taken away at our pleasure. The auncient Poets in La∣tin called such devises Insertas. (c) Contrarie to AVGVSTVS CAESAR, whose manner was ever and anone in his speeches and wri∣tings to interlace Greeke words and sentences. (a) A place neere the river Tiberis, so called of a27 Navell fight exhibited sometime there, by Iulius Cae∣sar Dictator, within a spatious pit receiving water for that purpose. (b) In the port high waies from Rome, the manner of the Romans, was at everie miles ende to pitch downe a great stone, and according thereto were the miles reckoned, like as with us in some places there stand crosses of wood or stone to that end. (c) i. A creeping Dragon. Which implieth, that there be others winged, or at least wise supposed to flie, in the common opinion of men. For the at∣tribute, Serpens, signifieth Creeping. Now, be∣cause all of them use most so to do, the general name of Dragons, goeth under Serpents. And as for the word Dragon, it is given to the whole kinde of their quicke sight, comming of Draco, in Latine, and  in Greeke,  i. of seeing. (d) Recidiva peior radice, say the Physitians. The relapse unto a former disease is more dangerous, than it was before. (e) It tooke the name of L. LVCVLLVS, the Lord thereof. (a) A towne in Campania where he tooke so great75 delight, and a place infamous for the licentious life of the inhabitants, whereupon grew the name of those lascivious and filthie Comedies, Atellan. A∣plague I say smiting well to hir beastly behaviour. As if he had beene vnworthie to be conveyed to Rome, the Citie which so long before he had abandoned. (b) As poore begger bodies were wont to be ser∣ved in hast, by the common bearers, and not fully burnt with leasure. (c) Where malefactors ordinarily were burnt.
ANNOTATIONS VPON Caius Caesar Caligula. (a) CALLED by some, An∣nales1 or Anariae: of o∣thers, Comitiales. By which provided it was, In what yeares of a mans age, he was capable of Questure, Preture, Con∣sulate, or any other like Office of State: as also, it was limited, within what time betweene, one might eftsoones beare the same Office againe. Item, what the terme of everie Magistracie should be? &c. And albeit the auncient Romanes had no such lawes, but (as CORNELIVS SCIPIO at his petition of Aedileship made answere, when exception was ta∣ken against him for his young age) whomsoever the Quirites would charge to be a Magistrate, hee had yeares enough on his backe, yet afterwards, sundrie Statutes were enacted in that behalfe: although by vertue of speciall privileges, the same were not duly obserued. By the Chronologie it appeareth, that he was but ninteene yeares old when he became Que∣stor, like as TIBERIVS before him. (b) Which TIBERIVS envying his greatnesse, wrought, therby to expose him unto greater dangers. (a) WELL might this unseasonable exercise puff3 up and fill his skin with crudities and foggie humors, but hurtfull unto his health it was, and brought upon him diseases, and namely, that, called Cardiac, of which, some say, he died. Let them looke to it ther∣fore, who, because they would be fat, not only fall to bodily exercise out of time, even upon ful stomacks, but also every morning eate in their beds and sleepe upon it, yea and ordinarily take a nap at noone, so soone as their meat is out of their mouthes. (a) By this Attribute, Civill, in our Author, ye must understand, Courtesie, Affabilitie, and a part not exceeding that of private Citizens, without ta∣king any state. (a) As if the Gods, whose Images were shrined5 within, were not to be honoured any longer as Gods, suffering so good a man as Germanicus was, to die. For, as in token of honour, the people used to adorne the Statues and Images of famous persons with flowers and greene leaves, so, whom they did vilipend and despise, they were wont to cast stones at their Images and Statues. (b) The Tutlarie Gods of the house which ordi∣narily stood within a closet, called thereupon La∣rarium. (c) For, to what end should they reare children any more? since Germanicus, growen to so good proofe, sped no better, but was taken away by un∣timely death. (d) In this place, the circumstance sheweth, that the King of Parthians is meant, how ever the Per∣sian King and such mightie Moches, having un∣der their Dominion other pettie Kings as Tribu∣taries or Homagers, be so called: like as AGA∣MEMNON also in . (a) Which, at Rome betokened a generall mour∣ning, occasioned upon some extraordinary calamitie, or feare of publicke daunger, even as with vs, the shutting in of Shop-windowes, &c. (a) ABOVT the mids of this moneth, began the feast Saturnalia, celebrated with good cheere, with revels, dances, gaming and all kinde of libere. (a) For, common souldiers wore a certaine stud∣ded shoe, named Caliga.9 (a) WHICH was later than the ordinarie time, by reason of Tiberius his lingering. For, usually these10 complements were performed at 17 yeares of age. (a) IN this habite and manner of attire, coun∣terfeiting a woman, thereby to decline suspicion when he entered into other mens houses for to dis∣honour11 them and abuse their wives, whom our au∣thor termeth heere Adulteria, pro adulteris, as else where, conjugi, pro conjugibus. (b) The fabulous Historie of Phaeth is well known, namely, how by misgovernment of the steeds which drew the Chariot of the Sunne his Father, he set the whole world on fire: By Phthon therfore is meant, a combustion (as it were) and generall confusion of the Provinces, like as by the watersnake, the verie bane and poyson of the Roman State. () To doe him the greater honour, they inter∣taine him upon the way (as the maner was), with Sacrifices, Torches, Tapers, and wax lights.13 (a) An opinion there was deepely setled in mens heads, that the death of one man might be excused and redeemed, with the death of another.16 (a) The two hundred penie. (b) His halfe image downeward from the head to the wast, portrayed with a Shield or Scutchion: & the same was commōly set out with the largest. Here∣upon, M. TVLLIVS CICERO, when he saw such a demie personage representing his brother QVIN∣TVS in the province that he governed (& a very litle man he was of stature) My brother, quoth he, in his halfe part, is greater than in the whole. (b) A festivall holiday solemnized by heardmen, in the honour of Pales their Goddesses and Patro∣nesse. Vpon which day, the foundation of Rome Citie was laid. This feast they kept, the 12. day be∣fore the Kalends of May, to wit, the 20 of Aprill. (a) Menius, a riotous unthrift, when he had wa∣sted8 his Patrimonie and sold his Capitall house in Rome, excepted in the sale, and reserved to himselfe
and his heires, one Columne or Pillar, from which he projected and put forth into the street a jettie, and upon i built a gallerie: out of which he might behold the sword-sencers in the market place, whereunto he had a fae prospect from the said Pil∣lar. Whereupon all such galleries or buildings jet∣ting out in the street, be called Maa.22 (a) THE end of one verse, and beginning of a∣nother, cited out or Hr in the second of his Ilias. The Poet ascribeth them unto sage lysses, in this sease. One [Soveragne] Lord, One King let there be. (b) By exchaunging the ensignes and Ornaments of the Roman Soveraigne or Emperor, with the Re∣gall Diadem, purple Robe and Septer. (c) Phoenicous is a water foule haunting lakes and fenaes, and the river Nilus, as Hsiodus writeth. The fethers be of colour read, or purple. Whereof it taketh the name: and the tongue is a most daintie and pleasant mosell. So said Apitius,   altis gurges. Of this Bird Martiall made an Epigram. D ihi pea ruens omen: sed ligua gulosu Nstra sapit. Quid si gula lingua fores. My name I take of wings so red, but unto glut∣tons tat, My tongue right pleasing is: oh, what, if it could prate as fast. (d) Some take them for Bistards: Birds decked, no doubt, with most beautifull fethers: as may ap∣peare by Tertullian against Marcion, in these words: Va Tetraons pennula, (taceo de pao) sordidm artifi∣cem pronuntiabit tibi Creatorem? (e) They are thought to be Hens of Guinny. (f) By the description of Clit, they be our Turkies. (g) The Phesant called in old time Itis, (which was the sonne of Terens and Progne, transformed, as Poets feigne, into this Bird) and afterwards Phasia∣ or Phasiana [Ais], tooke his nams of Phasis a river and Citie in Colchs, according to this Epigram of Martials, Argiva  sum transprtata Carina: Ate mihi not il isi Phsis erat. In Argive ship transported first, I was to forraine land: Fore-time, nought else but Phasis towne, I knew, or Phasis strand. (a) PHILO reporteth this farre otherwise, and23 telleth a pitifull Narration: How, by commission from Cai, certaine Colonels and Centurians came to young TIBERIVS, commaunding him to kill himselfe: because, forsooth, unlawfull it was for any other to murder a Prince of the Imperiall bloud. The youth, who had never seene any man killed, and by reason of his tender yeares was nothing at all experienced in the world, requested first of them, who were come thus to him, for to strike off his head, which he held out unto them: but seeing his request would not be heard, he desired them yet, to instruct him, in what part of his bodie he should stab him∣selfe for the speediest death? And so by instructi∣ons from them he was his owne executioner. (a) ROMVLVS avished the Sabine virgins:25 and AVGVSTVS, by force tooke from TIBERI∣VS his wife LIVIA. (a) Selena, in Greeke, signifieth the Moone. And26 well knowen it is, that as M. ANONIVS the Trivir called himselfe BACCHVS and OSIIS, so, CLEOPATRA his wife, tooke pleasure to be named Luna. i. the Moone, and Isis. Whereupon they gave to their sonne ALEXANDER be gotten betweene them, the name of the sunne, and to their daughter CLEOPATRA the name of the Moone, or Selena, which is all one. The Consuls were reputed still (in outward shew) Soveraigne Magistrates, although indeed, that Cae∣sars caried all before them, and were absolute Mo∣narches. (c) Some read, Tesseras decia citius. i. Before the tenth houre, or foure of the clocke after noone, for so long continued the Stage-plaies ordinarily. At which time, the Emperours were wont to bestow their Tickets or Talies among the people, by vertue whereof they received such and such gifts. (d) There be learned Criticks that expound this place farre otherwise, reading Pegmares, in steede of Pegmatis, and vnderstanding thereby such sword∣fencers, whose good hap it had beene to escape with life, the fall from those Frames or Pageants called Pegmata or Pegm, which with certaine vices or Skrewes were set up, and let downe, Vpon which as on scaffolds, malefactors were brought forth, eyther to exhibit a shew unto the people, fighting one with another at sharpe, to the outrance, or to make them sport, by falling downe into a pit underneath, where eyther wild beasts were readie to devoure, or fire to consume them. A devise wrought by dissolving the joynts of the said Pegmes under them. And in this sense they interprete the rest that followeth, concer∣ning Patresfamilias, i. good honest Citizens house∣holders. (a) HE had espied in the multitude of those pri∣soners27 and malefactors, two with bald heads, distant farre a sunder, and happily, as much as from the one end of the place unto the other: all those betweene, without respect of their cause, he commaunded to be put to death indifferently. (b) An ordinarie thing it was at Rome, to sweare by the Genius, as also by the Fortune, the health &c. of their Emperours. And what a devout oth this was, per Geniuns. i. the Damn, the spirit, or super∣intendent Angell of the Prince, which I take to be as much, as by his owne good selfe, appeareth by Tertullian Apologet. cap. 28. Citius apud vos per omnes deos, quam per Geniuns principis peieratur. (c) Seneca lib. 2. de Ira. cap. 33. reporteth the like example of Castor a right worshipful Gentleman of Rome, whose sonne, the same CALIGVLA, up∣on verie envie that the young man was a proper and beautifull person, put to death in his fathers sight, and then invited the old man to supper, provoked him to carouse and be merie, which the good father was faine to endure and make semblance of content∣ment, for feare, least the Tyrant would have done as much by another sonne, whom he had living. (d) Catenis verberatum. Among other chastice∣ments of the bodie, there is reckoned Vinculorum vrberatio, as Callistratus witnesseth, lib. 7: de poeis.
The ignorance whereof, hath made some to read, in Catenis verberatnm. 1. bound in chaines and then beaten, others, habenis, for catenis: as if he had beene well lindged with lether thongs or halters ends, as slaves were wont to be served by the . (a) ALBEIT, the proper use of these Graphia28 was to cut or engrave letters onely, in tables of barke or soft wood: yet, because it was unlawfull to weare weapons in the Senate house, some, of a mischievous minde, made those writing stiles or Steeles so, as they might kill therewith, Enacted therefore it was, that no man should carie about him such writing instruments of yron or steele, but of bone onely. And yet even these, as others also of reeds and quils, were made so keene and sharpe, that they were able to give a mortall wound. (a) For the manner of the Roman Emperours was, upon displeasure, to send men and women away29 into some desert Isles, and there to confine them. (b) Ellebor, that groweth in the Isles Anty cire, is of most effectuall operation. The roote is that, whereof is made our sneesing powder. It purgeth ex∣treemely by vomit. Thereupon ariseth the Proverb, Naviget Anticyram 1. Let him sayle to Anticyra, ap∣plied to one that is melancholicke in the highest degree, and little better than mad. See Plinie. Na∣tural. Hist. lib. 35. cap. 5. (a) Some conjecture verie well, that this Tetrinius38 was not surnamed LATRO, being the addition ap∣propriate to the noble Family of Rome, of the Por∣tii, but a notorious theefe or robber, such as in Latin is called Latro. And of that sort commonly were they that performed before the people this bloudie fight with unrebated swords, without foiles. And no mervaile, if he termed all the Citizens there as∣sembled Tetrinios. i. Theeves, considering he wished before, that he could cut of al their heads at one blow (a) He suspected, that she had given him some love∣drinks. (a) PRAETER aqum.] How this can stand33 with his pride or malice, which our author hath pro∣pounded to exemplifie, I cannot see. In some copies34 we read, praeter cum. i. beside him, that is to say, o∣therwise than he would have them, or approve. And one Critick or Iudicious Lawier, anc. Hottman, as also Coracius, read, prater Eccum, as if hee should say, All Lawyers shall give none other answere but this. Behold him, meaning the Emperor CAIVS, therby referring the decision of all matters to his will and pleasure. Lastly, Torrentius concludeth the Period thus, Ne quid respondere possint. i. That they should give no answere at all. And for praeter aequum, &c. he putteth praeterea▪ i. Moreover, for a beginning of the next chapter. (a) COLOSSEROS, seemeth to be a word com∣pounded5 of Colossos and Eros. The one importeth his talnesse, resembling the stately and Giant like perso∣nages called Col, and the other, his lovely visage, representing Eros, even Love, or Cupid it selfe. (b) These fencers, called Threces or Thraces, so think Sabelli▪ s. thought to be the same that Retiarii, were lightly appointed for armour, and put to desperate fight, as having all parts of their bodies exposed to daunger, whereu∣pon they were called also Tunicati, & were matched in oppositiō with the Mirillones, as this verse of An∣sonius implieh, Quis mirmilloni * componitur? aequimnus Thrax. Whereas the other named Hophmachi, had for their, cōmittitur defence, head peeces and targuets. Senec. lib. 1. Epist. 7. (c) The priest, called Rex Nrensis, of  place where Diana Ari was worshipped, within a temple beautified with a grove about it, by a barbarous cu∣stome of the Scithians, so long onely held his place, untill after one yeares revolution, some one stronger than himselfe, stepped unto him and overcame him in single fight, and so deposed him, like as, by the first institution, himselfe, foyling another in combat attained thereto. (a) Seneca writeth Consolat. ad Helv. That i was ordinarie with him, to consume at one supper ten37 millions of sesterces, and who studied himselfe, and laid his head to others, how he might at one supper make an even hand with the revenewes and tributes of all the provinces belonging to the state of Rme. (b) Some read for [e Cedris] Deceres, after the forme of Maneres, meaning by Decres a mightie al∣lie furnished with ten rankes of Oares, for such e Greeks call . (a) Dum inculta commissa fierent.] Which may be41 expounded otherwise thus, when as many things were forfaited and confiscate. (a) Taking the name from Exploratores, a mi∣litarie45 terme, signifying the Avant-couriers and fore∣riders, to discover the enemy, & to cleere the coasts. (a) Yet Din reporteth of him, that otherwhiles,51 when it thundred aloft, he would seeme to doe the like beneath with a thunder barrell, or such a kinde of devise: when it lightened, to make flashes with fireworks: and if a thunderbolt fell, to discharge like∣wise some stone out of an engine. (a) Which ornaments belonged to Iupiter and Aesculapi.52 (b) Resembling thereby Neptune, for it Symbolizeth his po er waters in Sea River. Lakes. (c) The Ensigne of Mercury, betokening his Elo∣quence. (a) So called, because they were exhibited in the Palatium.5657 (a) Capitalium, although , it was the state∣ly mount or Castle of Rome, yet it became a gene∣rall name of all Citadels and strong Castles built for the defence of any Citie. (b) Meaning the murder of Caius Iulius Caesar Dictator. (c) Bearing the name of a notorious theefe, or Captayne rather of theeves, crucified for his desertes.
ANNOTATIONS VPON Tiberius Claudius Drusus Caesar.

(a) BY vertue of this Act, himselfe, his landes9 and goods were proscribed and exposed to open sale, in a Table hung up by an Edict from the ma∣sters of the Exchequer or Citie-Chamber. And if within the time appointed, he came not in, to satis∣fie the debt, nor any chapman or suretie to under∣take it, he and his whole state, fell by escheate as for∣fait and confiscate into the Princes hands. (a) THESE Ilands are situate in the mouth of17 the River Rhosu. Rhodamus: and they be so called of the order in which they lie. (a) THE name of this Fencer Palamous, sig∣nifieth21 also in the Latin tongue a Stock-dove▪ which gave occasion unto him, to come out with this od jeast. (a) PROVIDED it was by the law Papia. That23 o woman under fiftie yeares of age should be ma∣ried to a man three-scor yeares old or upward: Item, That no man under three score yeares, or upward might wed a woman, fiftie yers old or above. Where, note: That these words [à Tiberio] as if he added the said Branch, seeme to have beene foysted in: considering that as it appeareth by TACITVS) the Emperour TIBERIVS went about to mode∣rate the foresaid law, and not to make it more strict by annexing such a clause. (a) For feare of breaking up the pavements, if they rode in coach, wagon, chariot, or on horseback.25 (b) In divers Greeke and Latin writers, the names of Iewes and Christians were confounded: so as by Iewes they understood Christians. (c) Orchestra was that place in the fore-front of the Theater or Scaffolds, and neerest unto the Stage, wherein the Senators ordinarily sate, and sometime the Emperour himselfe. (d) Popularia, were seats within the scaffolds and Theater, most remote from the Stage, wherein the common people were allowed to stand or sit. Be∣tweene the said Orchestra and these Popularia were raunged the Knights or Gentlemen of Rome, and those rankes bare the name of Equestria. (e) So called, of the mountaine Eryx in Sicilie, where she was highly worshipped, and where she had a Temple. (a) As for Drusilla his wife, a Iew borne, she had28 beene maried indeed before to king Azyzus, as Io∣sephus writeth: but as touching the other two Queens, whosoever they were, he was acquainted with them otherwise, and not in way of mariage, so farre as I can finde. (b) For everie man might not so doe, unlesse he had a Knights estate, which was foure hundred thousand Sextarij, or were free borne: Neyther Li∣bertines nor Mechanicall persons living by base trades and occupations were allowed. (a) Other writers, as Philostratus and Iulianus, say29 moreover, That without his wife and freed men, he was , and , much like to a player in a dumbe shew, and the bare Image of a Kings Majestie, as Plutarch reporteth of Ar∣ridaus. (a) This disease, some Physicians name .31 1. the heart-ach, or Cardiacam passionem, seated in the orifice of the stomach, which is called . The paine whereof, PLINIE affirmeth to be most intollerable, next unto the passion of the strangury. (a) Flatum crepitumque ventris.] By Flatum, under∣stand that riddance of wind downeward, qui ares ferit, non aures. Which in English commeth neere32 unto the Latin word, Visio, for that the verbe Visir, is the same, . As CICERO in his Epistles hath well, but covertly observed, out of the word D∣visio, Wherein he noteth Quiddam Cacemphaton. Which place some interpreters, for ignorance of the said verbe Visia, have expounded very absurdly. (a) So sumptuous were these feastes, that Ponti∣ficum33 Caena, and Saliares Epulae, grew into a prouerb, to expresse exceeding great bellie cheere, and most delicate fare. (a) Seneca. lib. 1. De lementia writeth, That Clan∣dius34 caused more Paricides to be sowed within a lea∣ther male, &c. in five yeares space, than had beene ever before his daies.

(a) For with their Grapbia, as hath beene noted35 before, they might do a mischiefe. (a) Irae atque Iracundiae. Ira signifyeth the hote38 and momentanie passion of anger, soone enflamed and as soone quenched, and Iracundia seemeth to be taken heere, for the continuance of the said anger, and an inveterate setled wrath▪ Howsoever our Dictionaries would teach us the contrary. The one may be called Gall or Choler, the other spleene or Melancholy.
(b) Stultitiam minem fingere.] or rather, Stultiti stultum inem finger. i. That no foole counter∣faits solly. (a) It was an inconsiderate speech of an Emperor,40 and foolishly let fall, in the Senate especially, tending much to his discredit and dishonour: as if he sent to the Taverne for his wine, by the pot or bottle, and had not his owne cellarage stored therewith. (b) These words without all time or eason were rife in his mouth, which unadvisedly he had taken up, and by use could not leave them. (a) Some thinke, that he devised not new letters41 in the Alphabet, but new formes▪ rather of the for∣mer: as namely to write for the  . . the inverted character , and for a diptho, a. (a) For, by report of Dion and Xiphili his sta∣ture43 farre exceeded the proportion of his years. (a) And yet by circumstances it may be collected,44 that he caught his bane and died in the Palatium at Rome. (a) These were, at it plainly appeareth, Questors,46 Aediles, Tribunes, Praetors, Censors and Consuls. Of all these, some one or other died, excepting Cen∣sors, as TACITVS writeth. 12. Annal. ANNOTATIONS VPON Nero Claudius Caesar. (a) THESE foure factions or5 crewes that ran with Cha∣riots for the prise, were di∣stinguished by foure colors of cloth, or liveries, & ther∣upon called by these names Alba. i. White, Veneta, wat∣chet or light blew, Prasina. i. greene, and Rosea. i. Rose coloured or read. Vnto which were added by Domitian Aurata and Purpurea. i. Gold coloured or yellow, and purple. The for∣mer foure Sidoni Apollinaris hath comprised in his Hendecasyllabes, thus, ——micant colores, Albus cum veneto, virens rubensque. Then shine these crewes and make a gallant shew In white, in blew, in greene and roset hew. Proportionate they are unto the foure seasons of the yeare: white, to the Autumne or end of Sommer, Watchet to the winter, Greene to the spring, and Red to sommer, or as some would have it, to the foure Elements. (b) Physicians have observed three kinds of drop∣sie. The first is Ascites, wherein the belly doth swell with much water gathered betweene the inner skin or rine of the belly, and the cawle which lappeth the guts, and some wind withall, so named of  in Greeke. i. A bottle, because in turning of the bodie to a side, the water is perceived to shog in the womb, like as liquor in a bottle halfe full, when it is shaken. The second, Tympanites, wherein the belly is ho∣ven vp with wind especially, and some water among. Whereby it will sound like a taer or drnm, if one tamper upon it, and thereof it was so called. The third Leucoplegmatias, ana sarca, Hyposarca, In Latin Inter us, or Aquae inter cutem, in the er Corne∣ Celsus at ibuteth this  to all,  kindes. proper signifi∣cation when the bodie all over is puffed up with wa∣ter and wind running betweene the fell and the flesh. And thereof as should seeme, died this Domitius. (a) To wit, the ninth day after he was borne, on6 which, they used to name their sonnes. And as this day was called Nominalia, so there was a goddesse forsooth, president of this complement and cere∣monies, whom they named Nundina. (a) The manner was, during these solemnities in7 the Albane moneth, (where the chiefe magistrates were present) to leave for Provost of the Citie, some principall young Gentleman of the Nobilitie, be∣fore whom sitting judicially, causes of no great im∣portance should be brought. (a) These youthfull sports Iuvenalia, or Iuvena∣les udi, were first instituted by this NERO, private∣ly11 in houses or gardens, and orchards. Wherein, of all degrees, ages and sexes they daunced and re∣velled. (a) The fabulous reports of Ladie Pasiphae wife12 to King Minos, how she was enamoured of a Bull, as also of Icarus the sonne of Daedalus, who would needs attempt to flie in the ayre, be well enough knowen to them that are but meanely seene in Poetrie. (b) Iuxca cubiculum eius decidit. By Cubiculm, he meaneth heere, a toyall seat raised on high wit in that quarter of the I heater called rchestra, under a rich Tent or Canopie, where Emperors were wont to sit when they beheld (such solemnities. These Pavillions were called in Greeke  in some sort resembling bed chambers. (c) So named because they that wrestled, ran, or otherwise exercised, were naked, like as the place it selfe of such exercises thereupon tooke the name Gymnasium. (a) Full and formall suppers, whereto men were1 invited, and at which the guestes sate orderly mar∣shalled according to their worth place, & were called caenae rectae, and after this manner in other Prin∣ces daies were their favorites feasted. In steed here∣of came in Sportulae. . allowances given unto them, eyther in money, or caes, in recompence of their ordinarie salutations and attendance. (b) As there were sundrie factions or crewes fa∣vourizing this or that colour of the Chariotters, so
were there likewise of Actours and players. whereup∣on many rots, outrages Fraies and thers were committed. (a) It should seeme, that for the pleading and tri∣all17 of causes, such Tritonell seats, pues, benches & barrs, were erected at first, for the present occasion, and taken downe againe by certaine persons, who gathered therfore a rent of those that went to law. (a) Diuers Kings of Ptus were named Poleones18 as of Aegypt Ptole whereupon the realme Pontus, is by Vopiscus called Polemonius, like as the Alpes Cotiae of Cottius. (a) Many had attempted this beside him: but all19 their cost and labour came to nought: (b) (a) In respect of a former fleet, that was wont to20 come before, and bring newes of the second laden with marchandise and vnder saile. Therefore those ships were called naes Tabellariae. Seeca. (b) Bombos. resembling either the buzzing and humming noise of Bees, or the sound of trum∣pets. (c) Imbrices. much after the manner of that rat∣ling, which a sodaine shewre makes vpon the tiles of an house, or the sound that crest tiles or gutter tiles may make. (d) Testas, to expresse the crashing of potsheards or earthen pots, clattering one against another. (f) Insignes pinguissima coa. In which sense we read of pingnes tga and Lacer. Yet some understand thereby . : whose lokes and faix were so slicke and glib with sweet oyles, that they shone againe. (a) For, so would he haue it to be called. And Thra∣seas21 Patus was iudicially convented, and deeply char∣ged, because he had neuer offred sacrifice for that heauenly voice of his. Tacit. (b) who was with child by her owne brother Maca∣reus, whereupon her father Aolus caused the childe new borne to be cast before hungrie dogs: and sent a sword to his daughter to kill her selfe with. (c) In reuenge of his father Agamemnons death, by her murdered, whereupon he fell into a furious kind of deepe melancholie. (d) who unwitting killed his owne father Lai∣us, as ignorantly wedded his owne mother Ioca∣sta. (e) By putting on a garment next his skinne, en∣uenomed with the poison of Nessus the Centaure, and so sent unto him as a token, from his wife Deia∣ira. [a] It may be thought, that he then acted Oedipus24 or Creon. or some other King, and therefore carried in his hand a regall staffe or Sceptre: Yet some inter∣prete this of a Lawrel rod or braunch, such as Actors held in their hands whiles they sung. (b) For, at Olimpia, were Games also of Criers, stri∣uing who could cry lowdest, for the prize. (c) These were called Hieroicae, as one would say, sa∣cred victories, to witt at the solemne games in Greece, Nea, Pythia, Istia, and Olimpia. (a) Five thousadd were there of these Gallants,25 as Xiphilinus writeth, ready to applaud him when he chaunted. (a) He meaneth eyther a peruke & cap of counter∣fait26 haire, , Dionis thereby disguising himselfe: the same that in Caligula he termeth Capilla∣mentum, or else some hood covering his head all save the eyes. Iulius Capitolinus calleth it Cucullionem, wherewith the Emperour Verus played such parts by night, in imitation of Caligula and Nero. (b) Quintana, was a Gate or Street rather in the Roman Campe, wherein was usually kept, Forum re∣rum tenfilium, in resemblance whereof, he termed a certaine place in his house Quintana, in which he made sale of such wares and commodities, as he had gotten together by  and rob∣bing. (c) It appeareth by Tacitus, that this was Iulius Montanus, who, albeit he had not sitten in counsell as Senator, yet was Laticlavius, and wore the Senators Robe, Such Gentlemen were called Iuvenes secundi ordinis, in distinction of those of the Imperiall bloud, or otherwise neere allied unto the Emperour. (a) The manner was in old time to imploy the17 day in businesses, and therein to take no liberall meales, putting off the full refection, and cherishing of the bodie untill night. Convivia de die, argued Intemperance, much more then, feasting from noone to midnight. (b) Ambubaiarum. These tooke their name (as most expositors have conjectured), Quod circa Baas versarentur. Yet some learned men of later time fetch the same from this Syriacke word , as if such were Syrian women, who being otherwise naughtie packes and callots, gat their liuing also by playing upon certaine instruments of musike, which they brought with them out of their native coun∣trey. (c) Copas imitantium. Although Copae, properly be such women as keepe victualling houses, readie not onely to entertaine, but also to invite and call in guestes, yet because these commonly are verie bold and unshamefaced, this terme goeth indifferently for strumpets and curtesans. For seldome shall a man see an impudent woman that is not withall inconti∣nent, so inseparably is modestie joyned with Cha∣stitie. (d) The corrupt text in this place, hath given oc∣casion of much obscuritie, and ministred matter e∣nough for Criticks to worke upon, while some read Mellita, others Myrtitrichila. By which are ment cer∣taine sweat junkets, as daintie wafers, &c. (e) This may be thought incredible, That ban∣queting conceits at one sitting should cost so much, and the aspersion of rose or other odoferous li∣quors arise to more. Where is to be noted the obser∣vation of some, who for, ab Syrta rosaria, read as∣persio rosaria, that is to say, the artificiall besprinkling and aromatizing (as I may so say) of banqueting rowmes, out of sponts and pipes, conveying odorife∣rous waters and oyles, going under the name of Ro∣saria. Which spouts, if they were made of silver or gold, (as we read they were at the feast of others, when he gave Nero entertainment) might soone a∣mount to that somme. To say nothing of the costly compound distilled waters, or extracts and oyles, themselves, drawen out of most pretious simples and spices.
(d) Him he called, as other Authors write, Sa∣bina28 and Poppaa, after the name of his wife de∣ceased. (a) In other writers he is named Pythagoras, so92 that it should seeme he caried two names. (a) A great Magician, whom he intertained thus30 royally, because he would have learned magicke of him. See Plinie. (b) Whereas AVGVSTVS when he played at this game, ventured no more, than for everie Talus, which were foure in all, a single deaier. For it should seeme that the game of Tals heere mentioned, was Pleistoboleuda. i. who could throw most with foure Tali' whether the same were cockall bones in deed, or made of gold, silver or Ivorie, with foure sides, everie one representing a chaunce, to wit, an Ace or unitie and sile, a trey and quatre, opposite, one unto the other. For they wanted deux and cinque, which the Tessera Cubus, or Die carying six faces, hath. (c) It is evident hereby, as also out of that verse of . Vtlati phaleris omnes & totquibus omnes. That these Phalerae, were not Trappings, and fur∣niture belonging to horses, but some other orna∣ments, wherewith footmen and horsemen both were trimly decked. (a) IN this verbe Morari, there is couched a dou∣ble33 sense, which gives the grace unto this pleasant scoffe. For, being a meere Latin word, and having the first sillable by nature short, it signifieth, to stay or to make long aboad, and taking it thus, NERO might be thought to imply. thus much, that CLAV∣DIVS was now departed out of the companie of mortall men, and raunged among the heavenly wights, but take the same word, as Nero spake it, derived of *  in Greeke, which fignifyeth, A. foole, and hath the first syllable long it importeth, that Cclaudius played the foole no longer here in the world among men. Read the little pamphlet of Se∣eca entituled , if ye would see Claudi∣us depainted in his colours, and in a fooles coat: which he, as it may appeare, composed of purpose to gratifie Nero in that humour of his. (b) The Greekes call this . And the Romans in honour of their Princes, were wont to compasse the same all about with a wall of flint, or other durable stone, as marble. (a) It may be it was in the same forme, that Iusti∣nus34 Martyr citeth out of Orphens. . Fortes opponite profaniss Which Virgil in some sort hath expressed thus. Procul este prafani. And Claudian after him. Gressus remorete profani. (a) THE like example is reported by Vopiscus in Aurelianus, who tooke wonderfull delight in a migh∣tie37 * Eater, that in one day before his owne table,. devoured a wild -full and whole, an hundred loaves of bread, a wether , and a pig. (a) This  verse as  writeth, was rise also in Tiberius Coesars month.38 (b) Alben this word, Iusula, beside the common signification of an Iland, it taken for an house stan∣ding entire by it selfe, a part from other, yet in this Author I obserue that it is put els where for other houses also and tenements let out to tenements by the owners and Landlord, who are called Dmini Iusularum. And euen in this acception, it may well goe in this place. (c) This toure Horace describeth. car. lib. 3. Od. 19. in these words. Mlem propinquam nubibus arduis, &c. (a) WHICH number ariseth to ten thousand a moneth. A mortalitie nothing comparable to that39 which as Eusebius reporteth, reigned at Rome in the daies of Vespasian, in which there died of the pesti∣lence ten thousand a day, not to that in Constan∣tinople, when many daies, there were likewise ten thousand dead bodies called forth Procop. lib. 2. di bello persico. (b) Such a rumor in deed ran rife, but untruly. Tacitus. (c) Orestes to reuenge his father Agamemnons death wrought by Clytemnestra his mother and Ac∣gysthus the adulterer, murdered her. (d) Alcinaeon sonne of Amphiarius and Eriphyle, killed her, bycause shee had contriued his fathers death. (e) Aeneas caried his old father Anchises upon his shoulders out of the fyre of Trey when it burned. Here is to be noted the duple sense of the verbe [Su∣stulit] in one and the same Latin verse: For in the former place, it signifieth to Kill, or make away, as Nero did his mother, in the later, to take vp and cary as Nero did his father. This yeeldeth and elegāt grace in Latin, and cannot so well be expressed in english. (f) Apollo, was surnamed  of  in Greek, which signifieth to strike, or of , to case and allay paint, as being a God, that both sendeth diseases, & also cureth them. But commonly the Romaines terme him so. in this latter and better sense. He is styled likewise Hecatebeletes in Greek, which is as much, as shooting or wounding from afarr. In these abstruse significations and obscure termes therefore this Epigram implyeth thus much: That whiles now in the habit of Appollo plaieth upon the harpe, and would seeme to be a milde and gratious Prince: the parthian King with bow and arrowes represent∣ing Apollo likewise, endaungered the Empire of Rome. and all, through the supine negligence of Nero geven to his Musick and other vanities excess∣uely. (g) This is ment by that huge house of  building, and hath a reference to that desolate estate of Rome, when it was sacked and fyred by the French, after the imfortunate battaile of Allia, what time the Romaines were in consultation to abandon the Cittie and departe to Veij., there to inhabte.
(h) It seemeth that Nero in his Poeme entituled Trca, had used to chaunt of Nauplis the father of , who abid many calamities himselfe, and in revenge of his sonnes death, wrought much mis∣chiefe to others. The Cynicke therefore, noteth Nero for his singing, as also for abusing his owne good parts in perpetrating all wickednesse, or else for mis∣pending his treasure so dissolutely. (i) . Artemidor. lib. 1. cap. vlt. (k) By Orcus, or Pluto, taken for the God of Hell or the Grave, is understood death, in this place, readie to seize upon the Senatours, whose over∣throw Nero had intended. Now, well knowne it is, that the manner was then, among the Romans, as at this day with us, to cary forth their dead with the feet forward. It should seeme, this answere was delivered in these words. . Of sixtieth yeare (I doe thee reed)40 And thirteenth more, see thou take heed. Whereby Apollo (for his oblique aunswers rightly of the Greeks termed Loxias) or the Divell himselfe, whether you will, playing with him in a two-fold and ambiguous construction, (as his manner was) delu∣ded him. For whiles he rested secure, dreaming still of the 73 yeare, which he supposed was meant of his owne age, and which he was farre short of, he fell into the hands of Galba, a man indeede of those yeares. Rome was wont to be served of corne from Alex∣and45 in Aegypt, in the time of dearth especially, when , otherwise reckoned Horreum populi Ro∣man. . the people of Romes Garner, 'was not able to furnish them. Now, when in steede of corne long expected, there arrived certaine saile from thence fraught with dust and sand for the sports of his gal∣lants: no mervaile if all the discontentment and heart burning of the people conceived against Corn∣mongers and such as made gaine by the scarcitie of graine, redounded upon NERO and his Cour∣tiers. (b)  The end of some Trimetre or Senrie Iaicke verse in a Tragedie. (c)  i. Now 'tis high time to drive or draw. In both which Empreses, by a most tart and bitter Sarcasmus, is taxed his excessive love of Charioting. (d) The speech of the people, or of his mother, who could not reclayme him. (e) As a Paicide or Killer of Parents, &c. whose judgement was to be sowed quicke within a lether budge, &c. (f) There is not onely an  in the word [Gallos] signifying the French Nation, and the crowing cocks,, but an Amphibole also in the sen∣tence: whereby it may be understood, eyther that NERO with his chaunting, had awakened the French, who began now to revolt, as not able any longer to endure his songs: or that the French awa∣kened him, to bestirre himselfe and looke better a∣bout him: as if they were the Cockes indeed, to raise him out of his drowsie securitie. (g) The ambiguitie of this word [Vindex], impli∣eth both a private chastiser of servants for their faults, and also C. IVLIVS Vindex or a revenger of pub∣licke injuries, and maintained of the common liber∣tie. Who now had taken Armes against Nero. (a) AVSPICIA, albeit they properly do signifie presaging tokens delivered by birds: yet the sequence and circumstance of this passage, lead us rather to some other uncouth prodigie and straunge sightes.

(c) Although there were divers Praefecturae in Ae∣gypt, called Noi, as one would say, Shires or Divi∣sions, as appeareth in Plini, 5. lib. cap. 9. Yet by this place is to be understood the Presidencie over all Aegypt, which by the institution of Augustus, was or∣dinarily conferred upon some Gentlemen of Rome. By which, it appeareth, he would play at small game rather than sit out.

(d) Domitian and other such monsterous Ty∣rants, as namely CALIGVLA, envied all per∣sons and things that were excellent. It behooved therefore Laia to be silent, and to dissimule what he thought, as well as he might: although, for griefe of heart, happily, hee could not chuse but fetch a secret sigh to himselfe with a He i. Helas. (a) I observe a double acception of this word12 CAESAR, in this Historie penned by SVTO∣NIVS. First for a noble house in Rom whereof IVLIVS CAESAR DICTATOR was descended. Whose line, eyther in bloud or by adoption, were cal∣led Caesares. And in this sense it is truly said, that Pro∣genies Csarum in Nrone defecit. i. that the race of the  was extinct in Ner. And in this sense the eires apparent of the Emperours in that line were named Caesars. Secondly for all the Soveraigne Em∣perours of Rome after Iulius Cesar. So Gala and the rest, his successors were stiled Cesares. (b) This exaction levied of the Iewes, which he calleth Iudaicum fiscum, was for the profession and exercise of the religion within Rome: who, as Xiphilinus witnesseth, were permitted before, by Ves∣pasan his father to observe the ries and ceremonies of their owne religion, paying an yearely Tribute, to wit, a Didrhme. i. two Roman eniers, or fifteene pence with us. And so the Christi∣ans afterwardes for a time had the same Indul∣gence. (a) IN some copies are inserted these words,15 Aream & Calvitium, to osense, unlesse ye would have him thereby noted, or his  and fall of haye, which some Physcians call Area.
(b) This FLAVIVS CLEMENS, is thought to have beene a Proselite, and convert to the lew∣ish r Christi∣anity rather Religion, by reason whereof, being somewhat mortified, and making conscience to do evill, he was reputed base minded, and as SVETONIVS saith,  inertia. Imputations charged by Pa∣ganes upon Christians, and the true servants of God, for their quiet cariage and modest beha∣viour.

(a) IT may be thought by the circumstance of18 this place, that this Rubr vultus in Domitian, was a tincture of vertue and modestie. But there was no∣thing lesse in him, so that it was rather an hypo∣criticall visard and maske, under which was couched a most fell and cruell nature, as being by the iudge∣ment of Tacitus more sanguinarie than Nero. For whereas Nero,  ,  ,  spectavit, sb      videri & aspii, c    pallibus, sufferes saville   & , quo se   . A  red therefore is n alwaies a signe of grace.
