THE HISTORY OF CALES PASSION: Or as some will by-name it, The Miss-taking of CALES presen∣ted in Vindication of the Sufferers, to forewarne the future. By G: T: Esq LONDON, Printed by W: Hunt, 1652.
To his much Honoured Cousin, Mr JOHN GREAVES. My worthy good Cousin, HAving thus trans∣planted this little Leane-too, from the calmnesse of my private Nur∣sery into the bleak and open Champion; and not knowing how much it there may suffer by the stormie Gusts of cen∣sure without some Extraordinarie stake supporting it, I thus betake me to your owne good selfe for pro∣tection, and if you please to passe it
under the value of your Name, misdoubt not the successe, and shall with much cheerfulnesse intercept all further opportunities of acknow∣ledging my selfe, Your most Affectionate Cousin, To Love & Honour you, G: T.
To the Reader. Be premised, THat the following dis∣course issues not from any pruriginous desire of being seene upon tl. shop-board, neither is it taken up by retaile and upon trust, the fault of many Modern Poems, nor yet rushed into without being consulted, and the second thoughts of such as suf∣fered in it; but the contemplation of an unfortunate journy, discovers here what were the Scruples that all along so sore∣ly
wrung our feet, lest After-ages might unhappily wander into the same gra∣vilie way; which briefe account be∣ing porch enough to such a little buil∣ding, let him now enter and take pos∣session of what is freely presented him by his affectionate Intelligencer. G: T.
The History of CALES Passion: OR, The Miss-taking of Cales. SO many and serious are the Lessons that may be read in defeates and de∣ficiencies, and La Noue that great Master both of Pike and Pen, is in his militarie discourses to direct in the point, that I have here the rather dislected our unfortunate Voyage Anno 1625, so pro∣perly by-named the Cales passion, or the Miss-taking of Cales, and thus discovered
it, that posterity might hereafter shun the Rocks upon which wee suffered ship∣wrack: not longer to deferr which im∣portant admonition, when upon the seri∣ous casting up of our old reckonings, much dalliance and dissimulation was still found upon the Spanish tally uncut out; and beeing hopelesse of any reparation or amends, unlesse it were exacted by the sword: To this end were all our yrons presently put into the fire; but who shall consider the Levies, Ammuniti∣on, Shipping, and season of imployment, will rather reckon the designe for a Pillar of smoake then of Marble. Levies I say were made both in City and Country, but of such inferiour probability to the worke, that some though weake and impotent, were yet taken on meerly by conspiracy, and with a let us kill them, that the inhe∣ritance may be ours; some againe so course and stigmaticall, even from the nipper of Bungs to the pricker of Praunces, that Mr. Cunstable was rather Mr. Scavenger since this farming all the beastly nookes
and corners of them both; and then some againe (with impropriety enough) were imprested meerly for expedition; those imployed in it, had their farmes to visit, or their oxen to try, and hudling up the number in List, regarded not the per∣sons in poll; such I say were many of those Argonauts which must yet fetch home the Golden Fleece, and that either a Boult or a Shaft might be made of the businesse, conducted thus into the West with much expectation, where through a lingering Vacancy of severall Months, without either requisite Officers or Ac∣commodation, there succeeded much dis∣order; and at Lorick in Cornewall so flat a Mutinie that Fower of the Delinquents were condemned, and cast Lots for the Gallowes: by which Punishment with a severe Proclamation backing it, there ensu∣ed a temper, their Fury being reduced into the former Chanell of Obedience; and then in this saire deport at length were they handed over to some of our Redemanded Netherlanders for their better disciplining,
an importunate (I had almost said) an im∣possible circumstance; neither can any trade be perfected without the Tools; if Ammu∣nition be wanting all our doublings are but Dances, and never before did Mars exercise so long upon the Truncheon, never were the postures so long slubber'd up by the Pli∣mouth Cloake. It was farr in September ere the Magazins were open, the first of Oc∣tober wee took Shipping, and I referr it over, whether the mediate time could reach to more then a Tumultuary Disci∣pline: were they formerly taught by their Provisionall Officers; yet (if approving all these of fit abilitie) where were the Ma∣terials? where Armes? the word drilling does well distinguish of what they might attaine to, for though some will igno∣rantly take this at large, it imports no more then variis motibus curfitare, but the Skill of distances, of Motions, but the parcell of a tacticke, and if we should yeild them this upon the Cudgell, yet where was the Pike, where the Musket that should embolden Tom Tyro? then againe they might per∣haps
borrow some few Armes of the Country, and this is the utmost that may be wrested; in answer to which, if we should grāt a disjunctive, a single use of their arms, yet is it much inferiour to that in grosse, and so little did our Musketeers know to fire, advancing, retreating, or to Skirmish in flank, that whereas our Retreit before Cales was furthered by many blinds, and the broken site of the place, had it been to make in Campania, we may presuppose how much we had been puz'led, and e∣ven a very dismall Catastrophie. As next to which, and still as ominous, the busi∣nesse drawing out so farr in length, and full of prejudice to the Counties of Devon and Cornwall, they became remisse in the Guard of their crosse-waies and passes, whereby many sufficient Men left the service: and with such connivency that Maugre any freshest pursuit, I never heard of any one intercepted. To conclude this point, some as but Lievres Morrionez were dismissed of necessitie, other-some had the opportuni∣tie to dismisse themselves; and thus had our
designe both a blow and a counterbuff. Concerning the Navy joyntly Engaged, though formidable enough in Bulke, even of eighty four Saile besids Hollanders, whereof twelve of the Kings, yet through a tedious tract of time, and ere the Mem∣bers of our Imployment could be knit into a Body, they began already so to fall from their feet, that when homeward bound, and beating to and againe, in the heights of 36 and thirty seaven degrees the half, for the Plate Fleet, our flaxen Wings booted little in respect of our Leaden Heeles, our Ships being indeed farr fitter for theTo be trimb'd or made cleane, of Carina the Keele of the ship. kreen then the chace: or what if I should retract in this point, yeelding that they were yare enough of Saile, and could full sungly Plow up the brinie billowes, yet how bootlesse is it to shew the teeth, when a∣las they cannot bite; for thus had we come to Buckle, to dispute it in Fire, our New-Castle Men which were above forty in Number (and I assure my selfe neither to be last nor least exposed) must have gone more roundly then really to worke, since
I could never hear that they had either crossebarr shot or langerell. Nay there still were other symptoms enseebling sore our Floting Body, the Viures, the Belly Tim∣ber being likewise so notorious, that our Newland Fish was become rustie, much of our Beere so necessarily staved for stin∣king, that some were as soone put to Beve∣rage as to Sea, the Husbands of the Fleet being much imprecated for it, and the Souldiers often upbraiding their Gene∣rallissimo for Sr. James Beverage; our Cheese was such, that, though amongst Souldiers and Sea Stomacks, it is not yet disgested; much of the Butter might have been mistaken for Castle Sope, and ere it came at the mouth gave the stomac enough at the Nose; but our victualler being thus shroudly mired, and plunging now as he thinks into fairer way, exclames here with a troubled Voice: yet what can be objected against the Beefe, Porke, Ling, Pease, Rice, and Poore-Iohn? for the first of which, though I should warrant it in qualitie, yet dare I be bold both con∣cerning
it and our Porke, that they failed much in quantitie; no Ship▪ Hus∣band or slaughter man but is prone e∣nough to licke his owne fingers, a Surloine or a double Ribb well befits his owne Ta∣ble, then againe his Gossip must not lose her longing, so that much being fraudu∣lently decorted, though the prescript pieces were payed, yet there wanted the Pounds: The Kings allowance was indeed Royall, but our Purviers, Butchers, and Pursers are as many bushes, and extorting every one his Locke, leave but a thin fleece; Concerning Rice, I spare not roundly to complaine, that for our owne Ship, either little was laied in, or much embezel'd, tis a neat Commoditie, and so susceptible of cleanly conveyance, that wee were admit∣ted it but thrice during the 9 weeks voyage; halfe our proportion of Pease also, as sub∣mitting to the like legerdemane, was long deteined from us: and then for Ling, our Seamen were of such privitie with the hold, that they put the pack upon us, had a double portion; only Poor-Iohn deserves
a better Title, and indeed to bee Sir Iohn, for this did us Knights service, till by becoming a continuall bush in every gapp, we had it at length, usque ad nauseam. Fourthly, there is a Time also when Kings goe forth to Battaile;2 Sam. 11. . which the Text specifies to be when the Yeare is expired, and the Scholiast ex∣pounds to be the beginning of the Yeare, the Spring-time; for thus will some derive Lent à Lentando, of its sup∣plying and tempering the Weather from Asperitie; so likewise Aprill ab peri∣endo, as letting out the World againe to that Activitie which the Rigid Win∣ter had so much obstructed. Now whe∣ther our Scene of Action were seasona∣bly laid is likewise so Remarkable, that heedlesse of this wholesome Principle, and thus to time it, nay presumptuously striving, even beyond Xerxes, to shackle the maine Ocean with a Ponderous Fleet, and full of ominous necessities; we were com∣manded Aboard in the beginning of October, but how miserably bandied up
and downe amongst the Billowes of a Winter Sea, will ere long be the dolefull Subject of my Discourse. I should be do∣ing now with Lievtenant Littleworth and his Captaine also (for there went but a paire of sheers between them) and relate how stifly they will maintaine, that wri∣ting, Reading, and Souldiership comes by Nature, that whatsoever some old Moth∣eaten Inkehorne Men have delivered, yet both Mars and Mercury may be made of any piece of Timber, without exception; a Court Paradox, and reflecting much also upon our present Imployment; but enough of the premises (I had almost said the por∣tents) and these being throughly weighed, though like the man in the Horne wee went boldly and branchingly in at the great end, no marvell though we came out againe at the tip both squeased, and miserable. I come now to the part Historicall, the Voyage it selfe; for after a tedious demur∣rer of neer three Months, Sr. Edward Cecill (both Admirall of the Fleet and al∣so
Lievtenant Generall, and Lord Mar∣shall of the Land Forces) came upon the 3 of September to Plymouth; so piecing us up with severall requisites, that at the Kings descent soon after, Sr. Samuell Argoll, who had been Imployed with eight and Twenty Saile against the Dunkerkers, pre∣sented him nine of their Ships as prize; and our little Army was with such Approba∣tion drawne into Battalia upon Roober Downe, that he there gave the Order to severall Captaines, Sr. John Gibson, Sr. Sheffield Clapham, Sr. Henry Sprey, Sr. Thomas Thornax, Sr. William Courtney, and Sr. James Scot, being made so upon the place, but this glimps of jollitie was quick∣ly faded; for though our expedition had hitherto most unnaturally been long and lazie, we were now againe full of Court Confidence; and with more hast then good speed, hurried soon after Aboard, falling through Cat-Water into the Sound, and so to Falmouth, where my Lord of Essex in the Swift sure expected us: of his Squadron. October the 9th we wethered
the Lysard, there meeting the Ann-Royall our Admirall, with the rest of the Fleet, only the Lyon our Rere-Admirall having sprung a Leake, was dismissed back to Ply∣mouth, the Saint George (in which Sr. Mi∣chael Geere Commanded) supplying the place. Being thus United and running by an East South East Winde, the Flagg of Counsell was soon after hung out in the Admirals shrowds, Commanding our Sea-Captaines Aboard for Orders; after which again, our own received a letter also from my Lord of Essex, with direction not to be opened, but when accidently disse∣vered from the Fleet. Vpon Wednesday at Night the Wind came more large, but withall so Boisterous, that we were Twenty eight houres in continuall Tem∣pest, the different Events whereof, and how cruelly we were Laboured in it, (that I might with some Variety refresh the Reader) is thus discovered in the Poem following.

ANd now after these Passive expressions in Verse, I return again in the following Prose, to relate, that when upon Friday the fourteenth, the Winde became more fa∣vourable, admitting a search into our scattered condition, wee found but Twenty two of the Fleet together; our owne Ship (one of the best sailers) being continually Imploied abroad for their reduction, till Thursday the Twentieth, when we rallied again about the Southern cape, continuing our course till upon the next Saturday we came before Cales, en∣tring the Haven with such Reputation, and Incussion, that the Citizens in a long File, and much affrighted were posting thence into the Continent. The Valiance of our old English, came (as it seems) now fresh againe in remembrance, and the flying Opinion was, that had we Troop'd up immediately to the City Ports, their own feare might have swaied much in
their overthrow. For though a pacer of∣ten declines the shower which a Galloper may overtake; yet Minutius also, if fitly timing it, knowes to win the day, when Fabius with his cunctation proves a loser. Howsoever my Lord Marshall, like an ex∣perienc'd Gamester, chose rather to goe in upon certainties, and had no doubt good Cards for what he did, though he let not everie one see his hand. We came I say into the Haven with a fresh briese, and allCam. fol. 807. At Cales action it was about two dayes af∣ter they came into the Ha∣ven ere they Landed. serenity, happy omens. My Lord of Essex and his Squadron had the Van, his Vice-Admirall and Rere-Admirall followed him, ours was the fourth Ship, where while I stood observing what might issue, the Spaniard, at my Lords comming with∣in distance, propounded to him in Fire, receiving againe the like answer, and still did the Swift-sure so beare in amongst them, that in the dispute she was six times shot through; but her opposites, as fearing yet a further Ingagement, and the generall Storme, now close to Windward, and coming on amaine, chose rather to
give way, and deferr at least what now they had but little possibilitie to divert. Three of their Gallies flying to St. Mary-Port, eight other, with about twelve Ships, through a narrow Channell to Port-Royall, when loe Minutius againe upon his close Pursuit might have stroke a Rich hand, and in all likelyhood cheap enough, wch the Vice-Admirall of Naples (a Ship by report of about eight and fifty Brasse Pieces) must needs acknovvledge vvith me, since by dravving much Water, shee ran on ground while shee ran away, and was thus sit-fasted for tvvo daies to∣gether, but here Sr. Thomas Love (held a Leviathan for Marine abilities) hal'd us vvith a countermaund, injoyning vvee should cast Anchor; to discourse the birth of vvhich prodigious Remora, vve had but one heat to take, neither could it last long, and all our Irons must be in the fire together. Concerning the Ships and Galleyes, there might bee novv much hast, yet aftervvards as good speed, if they could saile over land, vvell and good they
might take their course, otherwise they were locked up close at Port-Royall, and our owne sure enough. My Lord Mar∣shall a cording to this happy beginning might now rather fix upon some Land Service, and Improve himselfe by Ma∣stering the Iland and City, which were in∣deed to full of diffidence, as by a sodaine engagement might be forced to despaire, and this againe would humble both at his Devotion: these discourses (I say) might perhaps beget this Procrastination, and our being here so jaded with an after Game; for when the fourth day follow∣ing, Sr. Thomas intended their immedi∣ate seisure, advancing up to tow them out, and after him in Triumph, then ar∣row Channell was become so much ob∣structed with Bottomes purposely sunck in it, that what he could bring back was but a generall Imputation, of either pal∣pable Negligence, or Ignorance. Not to dwell upon these meerly Water-Works, but now proceed to what was mixt, and partly at Land; five of our Hollanders
were this night imployed in the batterie of Pointall, a strong Obvious Fort vvith eight Brasse Pieces, halfe Cannon and Culverin, beating tightly, and point blank upon the Channell: and these vvere like∣vvise seconded the next morning by as many Colliars to as little purpose; vvell might they Bark and Bellovv furiously, but it vvas vvithout biting; nay vvhen our ovvn Squadron next, and the rest of the Fleet successively Vomited their utmost Thun∣der, yet stood Pointall immoveable, and whether it vvere the toughnesse of the Pile, or that our Ship Batteries have a more fluid, a more yielding Center, vvhich vvith an indisposition, a spissitude of the mediate Aire, might dull and vveaken Execution, or some other Originall to be discussed a∣mong the curious Criticks, Poyntall vvas directly shot-free, vve vvere but philliping a Rocke of Marble; yet having at length vvth our much prejudice Dismounted their Ordinance, even at the heavy losse of Sr. John Bruse, Mr. George Raymond Captaine of the Great Saphire, some Soul∣diers
in our ovvn Ship, as also diverse o∣thers, and the deare Rate of above four Thousand great shot, vve novv this 23 being the Lords Day, vvent still more metteldly to vvorke. For my Lord Mar∣shall had been formerly taught by his old Maurice Prince of Orange. Martiall Master, that to fight such passi∣onate Ambitious Papalins, doth rather Damaske then Dishonour, vvee vvere novv I say more Actingly fired; Sr. John Burroughs and his Regiment being Im∣ploy'd on shore, to take it by Scalado. The Weather vvas novv Faire and Calme, and our Navie Rode about Pointall in a neer se∣micircle, circumstances admitting such in∣telligence, and infixing vvith so much im∣pression, that methinks I still see hovv such of our Long Boates as had Evaded the Tempestuous Bay of Biscay, vvere novv plying amaine tovvards the Fatall Fort: and vvhat Pity vvas it, that Men of such height, and daringnes, should so pre∣cipitately run upon their Ruine: vvhen not the Celebrated old Roman Braverie, but vvould here have been interposing
either with their Panosaids, or other like Defensatives. Methinks I still see how Mr. Bromingham the Dukes Captaine, who had the point and was to steele it, how and with what Gallantrie he stood in the prow of his Boate, couragiously Waving his Sword about his Head; nor this only, when Faire and further off, while all was whist and still, neither Man nor Musquetade stirring; but in the same threatning posture Engaged home amongst their thickest Volleys, even when the Fort like a many headed Hydra, plied him with such a storme of his∣sing Lead, as what Massie Pillar but must needs suffer under it; and though he fell at length like a Glorious Starr, and was seemingly extinguished, yet will his height and Gallantrie never be forgotten. Concerning those Engaged with him in the same Bottome, one alone of them (to prevent the Harque∣buse of his Active distance) could nim∣bly spring under the Castle Wall where it had lesse play; yet there likewise in¦stead
of shelter met with his slaugh∣ter; the rest were in their mettle so mel∣ted down with Death and many Wounds, that we could still see the Boat, like an empty shell, beating upon the fatall strand, but not a man stirring; which being well observed by Sr John Burroughes, and how unhappilie spault the point had been through an over-heate, he cautiously de∣clining to the left hand, Landed there the rest without disturbance, and with such ap∣probation, that we of my Lords Regiment presently hudled after; so piecing with him, and consequently streightning the besieged, that though they were securely Walled, even Eleven paces thick, and with the toughest Stone, yet a Treaty in∣stantly succeded, and then againe as so∣daine a surrender, whereby we tooke up our Lodging this Night at the Signe of the Starr; fuller both of quiet and confidence. The next day being all Landed; our Designe was farr higher, neither would we now goe lesse then very Cales it selfe, to which we must advance upon a surface of un∣even
and broken ground, even of many little hils and holes, and so presupposing danger, that a Forlorne of some small dissever'd parties was imployed first to dis∣cover it, our maine Grosse still following by degrees; by which circuit of Action, as some of our Enemies must needs be fur∣ther recollected, other-some were still eva∣ding by us, and as it were from between our teeth into the Continent; till at length a Reformado of my own Company affe∣ctionately byting at such a bait, so ten∣dered it likewise to some commanded men next the Passage, that they quit their post, charging home in hope of booty: the cautious manage whereof had doubtlesse found responsible satisfaction, but as they fell up entire in a wedge, part of the Calizi∣ans fled back to the City, others made as unrecoverably along the Passe, so that their purchase was only some few trifling pieces casually fallen from the run-awaies; however, thus was the City more expe∣ditely surrounded in order to the further threats of War; but alas, we were now at
the full of our prosecution, so waining alwaies after, and far from any nearer ap∣proaches, that leaving the two Collonels Burroughs and Bruce to make head before the Towne, we were immediately faces about, and marching up the Pass former∣ly specified, perhaps to seize the Bridge of Swaco, which joynes it upwardly with the Continent, perhaps to refresh our Troopes accommodated so very poorely, that for Eighty men, my land allowance was but Eight little Cheeses, and some few Biskets▪ To proceed, great was the perill, the preju∣dice that followed it, for having marched like Knights arrant till towards Evening upon the deep sandy stony Causey, we came at length to the house of Bacchus, there taking up our quarters; and who shall consider the plenty of excellent wines, then and there stowed in Magazin, or the swinish or disordinate abuse of them, will own this expression to be proper enough; for mine own particular, as not knowing vvhat danger might be lurking under such a precious baite I referred my thirst to the
satisfaction of such Oranges and Lemons as the neighbour trees imparted; but for many of the common sort, so palpable vvas their excesse, so vvildly hooted out in ob∣streperous clamours, firings, and like vvhimsicall distempers, as beat up all the Rules of Discipline before it, seizing our Commanders vvith extraordinary amaze∣ment; neither vvas there other addresse novv left us but immediately to heaven, vvhich my Lord Marshall like a true Chri∣stian Souldier as presently put in practice, by giving out God blesse us for the Word. And what shall I further say, but that this tyght and little prayer did by an often repe∣tition, and going continually the round, so strangely stickle for us, as puzzel'd both the counsell and courage of our enemies, vvhereas had they found to time it, and but given us novv a Cammisado, vve must needs have run a very desperate Fortune. This tedious night of dread and danger be∣ing at length vvethered out, vve vvere novv to retreat againe, little dreaming of any reckoning to be paid for our drunken deluge,
till we found a body of Spanishhorse attending upon our Reare, and exacting it with utmost cruelty, by the slaughter of such as were left behind, either still and stupidly surfet-seized, or else started aside and improvidently raking up and down for plunder: neither did this outragious Cavalrie thus give over, but still pursued us, though cautiouslie, and at such a distance as they might either take or leave at plea∣sure; till being jealous of such a neare ma∣levolent observer, and at length haulting upon a neck of land, one way narrowed in by some comberous salt-pans, and bro∣ken marsh grounds, on the other side by the sea, and a massie steeple-like-building of severall stories, we here laid a party of Musqueteeres in Ambuscado, seeking thus againe to repay these bloudy Butchers in their owne coine: the trap was now I say fitly laid, we still retreating as before, and our enemies likewise insisted, securely jog∣ging on through the narrow neck till very neere a costly sulphurous entertainement, when upon a Souldiers carelesse blowing
his match aloft within the Tower, they sprung with much affright back againe, precipitately spurring away for safety, and by a sudden husbanding this nicke of time, evaded to report how greatly little scruples, when irregular and going false, may disap∣point mighty projects; howsoever, though we thus failed in the maine, yet befell it hence upon the by, that we could now re∣turne free from any captious supervisors, and quarter againe with our reserve before the Towne. The next day (our former Bri∣gade being left at the point to answer all Alarmes) an arrant we had up the Passe againe, the purport of it to seize a discove∣ry of Long▪boats for our better accom∣modation when homeward bound; for now the Souldiers began generally to hitch and hummer after their return, look∣ing so often and affectionately towards the Fleet, that in our march back we could evidently see 7. Gallies of S. Mary-Port, now engaging with that good Ship of the Kings the S. Andrew; the weather was faire and calme, the Royall Vessell all alone, and
these creeping out like snakes in sunshine thus propounded to her in a storme of ball and powder, to which our honourable Countryman Sr John Watts (Commander there in chiefe) made likewise a seasonable replication; for though his opposites fell up to and again, with noise enough vapouring out their Ammunition, even when aloofe off, and to little purpose; this old and valiant Seaman, nothing moved with the chaffe of their vaine-glory, continued still in silence, his quu was not yet come; but having in the meane time travers'd all his peeces of furthest randome conveniently, and by this remissenesse whetted their Spanish arro∣gance into danger, he then powred in so sowre a broad side upon their bravery, that enough, enough, or (perhaps too much) for market was done already; and they sudden∣ly pack'd up and home again, with as cold a welcome doubtlesse as our owne was likewise empty at our returne before the Towne: for the belly began here to bark so loud for sustenance, and so with more noise, because the neare storehouse of our
shipping might relieve us now at pleasure, that hither did vve refer our selves, here did vve mediate vvith the sighs of our Souldiers for reliefe; but this meeting vvith a deafe eare, and succeeding not, our last refuge vvas either patience, or to value pre∣posterous and unnaturall for very vvel∣come and savory meat; my ovvn Compa∣ny being likevvise so cleare in the point, that a supper of Asinegoes flesh vvrought their extraordinary contentation, vvith a nights rest so free from either invvard di∣stempers, or any outvvard sallies, as better enabled us for our retreat the next morn∣ing. That I may decipher vvhich knotty piece, it vvas conferr'd necessarilie upon my Lord of Essex, Sir Henry Poore Vis∣count Valentia, and Sir Edward Harwood; the first of these vvas in his verie name here so formidable, that Hercules pillars fell at his arrivall into a shaking ague, and but for Sir Thomas Loves unhappie interpose, he had no doubt out of the shipping alone re∣turn'd a considerable victorie; the second hamor'd out his honour in the sad com∣bustions
of Ireland, having his former va∣lour there, written still and signally upon his forehead, in the midst whereof the full impression of a rigorous bullet was so deepely infix'd, as if Mars had purposely done it to set him fairer off; and never has any war (I except none whatsoever) af∣forded a more remakeable, a more glori∣ous badge of honour. Concerning Sir Ed∣ward Harwood, I dare report him (even up∣on many yeares observation) though sweetly temper'd, and without noise in the house, yet so high and active in the field, so far beyond our outside practice, and studi∣ed even in the very learned points; and my∣steries of his profession, that if perhaps he might have some equals, yet none of his contemporaries out-did him: and to speak much in little, this was the man whom that paragon of parts John late Lord Har∣rington selected from a world of others to be his bosome friend, and he likewise that having now the reere of all reeres, and disposing his shot in loose and little parties among the broken hils and blinds, did in
this posture detaine the enemy till our main Grosse was mostly ship'd againe; but after a long dispute, being now dangerously engaged, and much over-powred; some fresh commanded men from the bodies of our reserve, not only fought the prevailing Enemie into ballance again, but soon after from his late gotten ground; and though the command was to retreat, yet our new supplies still dapperlie followed and fired upon them, till their Bandeliers coming at length to be recruited, here the day be∣gan to change upon us, and our raw en∣gagers with their light matches, so sudden∣ly, and in severall places blew up our pow∣der, that at the Huffe our Opposites appre∣hending it, were newly whetted into edge, and fell on againe as bitterlie as ever; now was the generall cry throughout the field powder, powder; in the Fort (where like∣wise my Lord Marshall, and some other Commanders were observing us) retreat retreat with Orders accordingly, and that the bringers up of our Reare should imme∣diately follow our main Body already ship∣ped;
which considering the present feare, was with spurs and wings so very passi∣onately fulfilled, that being to passe my Pikes and Collours first aboard, as fraight enough for our little Ship-boat, yet did my Musquetteers so precipitatelie huddle in, surcharging and keeping it aground, that I was compell'd (wading the sea) to trim it againe with my Musketrest. Neither was it otherwise (as before is hinted) with our Souldiers at the point, and now engaged; for what with the scarcity of powder, and then the Calizians brisk and second charge, had not our Officers, with their rough browes and swords, conjur'd this pang of feare into a sense of honour, their heeles had possibly been much more nimble than their hands; a disaster so stiflie aimed by the pursuers, that through the broken ground they still beat all along upon our Reare: and about this time was it that for intelligence at the first hand, I now left my Musketteers haling themselves aboard, that I might help wheele up one of our Drake areare, to some already at the point;
where I found our enemies so risen high in crest, that they were now advancing out of covert after us into an open Levell neare the sea-side; but then againe began our little Guns to play with so much ter∣rour and incussion, so fatally spattering in upon their violence, that they as suddenlie relented, and shrunke back, locking them∣selves up againe in covert; and thus after a passionate dispute of neare foure houres, we wrought out the convenience (though with some losse,) to quit Pointall, and ship our selves againe in safety: for now was all our hope among the briny Billowes, all our confidence in Neptunes Kingdome; a wild and open champion I confesse, yet where the severall roades were full of pretious ware and sumptuous plunder; by these did Cortez heretofore transport his golden handmill of 3400 A Castelane is a Coine weighing a third part more than a Ducat. castelanes; his famous golden Colverin, & infinite other treasure; by these came the vast east Indie caract of 1000000 ducates taken by our Leveson and Monson; I, here the wealth, here the rarieties of the World are continu∣ally
transient: a motive so considerable, that though some would rather urge for the ta∣king of Dunshaul a rich city in the Madera Iland, yet our admirall and the Major voice declining it, our orders were rather to stand off to Sea amongst these conside∣rable passes; and in the height of thir∣ty six and thirty seven the halfe, to bid on still for an honourable welcome home, fortune would perhaps be brought about with importunitie, either mini∣string to us of the plate Fleet, or some such after-game from the spiceries, as with re∣markable stakes might draw likewise an extraordinary reputation; or if the winds should againe spit their winter venome, tyrannously chasing us as before, Budgrave in the Streights was appointed us Souther∣lie to rally in, Northerly the Isles of Bayon. Nay, we had other stormes here also to weather out, a dangerous gust, a personall clash, rising at this time between Viscount Valentia, and my Lord de la Ware Vice-Ad∣mirall to the Head-Squadron, whose command being transferr'd upon the for∣mer,
and my Lord not digesting it, there ensued a peremptorie competition of two red fore-tops borne out, and pretending to the same place of honour for severall daies together; till at length a temper be∣ing found, and the Viscount made Admi∣rall to the said Squadron, with my Lord in his remitter, and continuing as before; we bore up unanimously to the heights premised, there beating to and againe for purchase, and to snap some of the Spa∣nish golden Ingots. Neither was the Scene unfitly laid, since October the 31. we had three of their Ships in chase, and with such a neere capacitie, (as some will re∣port) that had one of our Captaines kept his Luffe, when he bore roome and gave over, they happilie might have defraied all our charges: but to chew this a little, and distinguish whether it may be safely swal∣lowed; let me here vouch the Ship in which my own Companie was mounted, one so yare of saile above others, that my Lord Admirall had formerly own'd, and imploy'd it as his Page; yet was our con∣dition
now so sad and sober, that though the being in chase often started me from my Cabine 'twas all in vaine, we never could engage; many a faire course we had, where there was neither bush nor brier for the game to Tapish in, but still lost ground till we were at last run out of sight; an instance so roundly pointing out our indisposition, that doubtlesse he that runs may likewise read it, and which must needs also scatter the cloud of prejudice injuriouslie gathering over Captaine Osborne. Nay so now be∣gan our Navy to groane under severall disabilities, that the Rainbow, and some other of our Shipping, were the eighth of this November dismissed againe for Eng∣land, we which were still behind (though likewise in our declination) persevering as before; neither could the jolting wa∣try wildernesse yet awake us from our soft and silver dreames, the plate fleet was now indeed our ultimate errand, our immedi∣ate masterpiece; but without any piece of Plate finger'd, save one of inferiour value,
and this at the drunken quarter beyond Cales. In conclusion, having for ten daies after been vainely tacking to and fro, and with much paine and patience hitherto weathered out the wrathfull Winter, our wants and weaknesses now at length be∣came importunate, and at a Councell aboord the Admirall, both moved for an immediate returne, and joyfully carried it; yet as the sowre sauce to this sweet refection, so were we hurried back in the stresse of a mighty working sea, and even with such a witnesse, that part of our Fleet was beaten in at Bastable, part at Bristoll, some into Sylly, our English Scyl∣la and Charybdis in respect of the Bishop and his Chaplaines; into Falmouth, Ply∣mouth, and Dartmouth some; the waves like wild horses had thus torne asunder and scattered the limbes of our Armado; that mighty bulke of our predominant Anne-royall was yet tost and tumbled into Ireland; Then concerning our Vice-Ad∣mirall the Swiftsure, she spent her fore-saile in the Tempest, split her Tillar, and vvas
so full of sicknesse, that an imprest of fresh men was imployed in bringing her from Falmouth about to Plymouth. The Constant Reformation, in which my Lord of Valen∣tia commanded, spent her maine mast by the Cradle, yet far more unhappie was her name-sake the Mary-Constance, and even beyond comparison, as being wholly over-wrought in this boyling Tempest, and swallowed dovvne into the Sea; Cap∣taine Hone, Captaine Shudborough, and some fevv others being hardly recovered from the Shrovvds. To come nearer home, and speake the bottome allotted that vali∣ant Gentleman Captaine Richard Bowles the younger, my selfe, and our tvvo Com∣panies, though exteriorly it made as good vveather as many other of the Fleet, yet our dangers since intestine and neare the heart, vvere therefore more fatall; that fire vvhich a Kettle of pitch accidentallie kindled in our Cook-roome may witnesse it; and though by Gods speciall provi∣dence this was againe opportunely smo∣thered, yet the Combustion betweene our
souldiers, and the seamen became unextin∣guishable; nay sometimes so flaming hot as would needs have prompted in our pis∣tols: The sea Captaine, though sufficiently seene in marine affaires, as having often sayled between Temple staires and West∣minster, yet referred all to his Mr. (for this he was indeed) and such a rough∣hewn Palinure, as meerely sway'd by passi∣on, made little or no bones of equity; a ca∣veat against Captaine Syllie-soule here∣after, and demanding those of more experi∣ence, better government; the want where∣of, had like a continuall dropping so day∣ly fretted out our patience, that being ari∣ved at Falmouth, I rather chose with Cap∣tain Bowles to land immediately at Peny∣come-quick, (though penilesse▪bench had been more proper for our empty purses) then thus to suffer further, to be longer thus imbroyled: and having once quit the Sea, here perhaps opinion will heale us up againe, yet at length presupposing a sceane of extraordinary comfort and refreshment; but alas the while so was death implaca∣ble,
with such feud pursuing us from Sea to Shore, that the passing-bell was now daily groaning in our eares, and at Ply∣mouth alone, the elder Captaine Bowles, Captaine Blage, Captaine Kirton, and Captaine Rice Skinner, with other Inferi∣ours, were now deduced into their for∣mer dust, by which scantling we may likewise guesse at our sorrie condition else∣where; only concerning my own Com∣pany, I must with all humble thankfulness acknowledge, that God was pleased pecu∣liarly to shine upon it with the light of his countenance; neither had death but such a single conquest in it during our whole Voyage, as yet defeated not the Corps of an English grave: who shall object, that as a tatter'd Colours, so likewise a shatte∣red Companie is of greatest honour, yet there was never a more remarkable mer∣cie, than when Israel conquered the Midi∣anites without the losse of any one Souldi∣er; and an hazarding with so much safety above others, must needs be an extraordi∣narie blessing. To close all with my pe∣culiar;
though outwardlie I held up, and faire a while after, yet this forbearance wrought so little quittance, that severall diseases (hence contracted) laid at length such peremptorie fetters of a warme bed, and a cautious diet upon me, that I was compell'd to retire; and in the following Stanzaes verse my selfe out of that professi∣on, vvhich I had been formerly vers'd in for many yeares together.
DIsloyall flesh and bloud, how has the Snn, Both his direct and oblique hitching course, Full often through the heavenly girdle run, Since our so plighted love, that nought could force Or puzzle it; and dost thou now deceive me? Now at the quu, the clinke of honour leave me? Our Mars in rust and cobwebs long decry'd, Yet rants it now, and on the wings of Fame Pitches his Tent, does now in triumph ride On his high places; now to shrinke? Be lame And crasie now? When Medals double paies, Victorious Belts and Crowns shall others raise.
Is this the troth of Friends? but then againe What Chimicall extraction, reach of Art May flesh unweaken, and with such a traine Of draw-backs does our Age it selfe impart; Such Paulsies, Gowts, Cyaticks, and Catarrhs, It baffles Action, Wars even with the Wars. Submit we then; the Moone her empty Lap Againe inlightens, and our Winter Trees Have yet another rising of the Sap; But Man when once declining, by degrees, By fits, and peeces droope and dwindle must, Till crush'd at length, and crumbl'd to his dust.
The first Tooth that he drawes convinces him Of past his best, and not a Sinew strain'd, Or Ligament, or Humour out of trim, But urges so for Age, that lastly main'd In all his structure, warping in his ties, And severall nailes, he druckens hence and dies. Submit we then I say, the Corslet quitting, For a retired sedentary course, Now not the Pike, the Pen is rather fitting; The French Proverbe is, Quiter le plu∣me pur dormir sur le dure. The Feathers, not the ground: ye brood of Mars On still and thrive, while thus the topling staires Of age, advise and lead me to my Prayers. FINIS.
