A STRANGE WONDER, OR, The Cities Amazement. Being a Relation occasioned by a wonder∣full and vnusuall Accident, that happened in the River of Thames, Friday, Feb. 4. 1641. There flowing two Tydes at London-Bridge, within the space of an houre and a halfe, the last comming with such violence and hideous noyse, that it not onely affrighted, but even astonished above 500. Water-men that stood beholding it, on both sides the Thames. Which latter Tyde rose sixe foote higher then the former Tyde had done, to the great admi∣ration of all men. LONDON, Printed for IOHN THOMAS, 1641.
True Newes from Heaven, IT hath been manifestly shewne how in all Ages for these 700. yeares, ever since the Conquest, dismall chances, and heavy events, have ever at∣tended such vnnaturall and undue motions of the Ocean; beseeching God Almighty that it may be his mercy in Christ towards us, that it may not misse of it wonted course and that no sad distasters or judgements follow or ensue it hereupon, al good people of this Kingdome are de∣sired to lay away dispute, and embrace devotion to surcease contention and strifes, to embrace charity in peace, and quiet, with humility, and thus disposed to pray day and night with vnanimous consent; for the joyfull Union, and prosperous harmony between King and Parliament, wherein consisteth the onely happinesse of this Kingdome. Not long since was printed an idle Pamphlet, entituled Newes from Hell, a pasquill onely intended for mirth and pa∣stime not so seasonable for these dayes of publike distraction, and seuerall discontent; if Salomon may be heard, who saith, that there is a time for all things under the Sunne. But see the chance, no sooner was that breviary of tales and collection of idle falsitie, publike exstinct and quenched men having both seene and read their fill. But behold comes Newes from Heaven, true Newes I warrant you, for God we know as the God of truth, so he delights in nothing lesse then falshood, that being as opposite to him as light unto darknesse, good unto evill, no questioning therefore any thing done by God for matter of Fact, because he doth them for the most
part so publickely (as who dares stand to and avouch them) that many times Kingdomes and Nations, at the least multi∣tudes of persons are forced, will they take notice of them, nay more if the world is so either stpid or Sottish, that it will take no notice, nor give any heede to Gods newes, (which are his signes and Tokens, appearing either in Skye, Earth or Water contrary or aboue the ordinarie steerage of nature) what time I say men shall spare to take speciall regard, and to slight the prodigious ensignes, if not ominous habingers in their addresse, and appearing, it is altogether a knowne cer∣tainty that they will take notice of him by their determinate working: God saith, that the very Snow and raine shall not returne without the accomplishment of that for which they were sent, which are the ordinary affects of naturall causes very familiar with us, and shall we thinke that his wonders stand for Cyphers, that his extraordinary workes (that some∣time the world is not acquainte with all once in an age) shall dye speechlesse, that his terrible Apparitions should de∣part empty, leaving no effects, no prints behind them, fure∣ly no, they are of greater consequence then so, and in all A∣ges they have by wofull instance, that have followed them compelled the world to be of another beliefe, the Heathen Phylosophers that had nothing but the glimmering of nature to helpe them, and some rovng guesse at naturall causes, that Blazing Starre of our time, the deaths of great Princes, and Po∣tentates, immoderate Windes Pague and Pestilence, intem∣perate Raines Rot, Murren among Beasts and Cattell, the unexpected suddaine and causelesse swelling of Rivers, Death and Famine, the dsorderly and changeable eb∣bng and flowing of the Tyde, blood, and discention, if the Heathen by the Candle of nre could not onely perceive v, but w Gods nble Messengers, and part∣ly e their arrant; shall Christians that live in the day of the Gospell descrye nothing by them, but take them to bee as dombe in effect as some of them are in sound, especia ly when
God himselfe cryeth, my Wonders shall fill the Earth, which is understood so much with their number, as their operation, if then Gods extraordinary Heralds, J meane his dread and vnacquainted predictions have ever had some vndoubted de∣signe, then this of ours that happened Februarie. the 4. being last Fryday, ought not to be passed over, as not worth the marking or observing, The strange tokens which GOD from Heaven, the day aboue-said, shewed amongst us, was this, Fryday Februarie 4. 1641. it was high Water at one of the Clocke at noon, a time, (by reason so accommodated for all imployments, either by Water or Land) very fit to afford witnesse, of a strange and notorious accident, after it was full high Water, and that it flowed its full due time as all Almanacks set downe, and Water-men the vnquesti∣onable Prognosticators in that affaire, with confidence mainetaine it stood a quiet still dead Water, a full houre and halfe, without moving or returning any way never so litle, yea the water-men flung in Stickes to the streame, as neare as they could guesse which lay in the Water as vpon the Earth, wthout moving this way, or that, Dishes, likewise and Woden Buckers they set a swimming, but it proved a stilling for move they would not any way by force of ream or water, so that it seemed that the water was indeed asleepe or dead, or had changed or borrowed the stability of the Earth, the Water-men not content with this evidence woud needs make the vtmost of the rryall, that they might teport with the more boldnesse the truth of the matter, and with more credble confidence they tooke their Boates and lanched into the streame or very Channell: the Boates that lay hailed p upon the shore moved as much, ex∣cept hen they used their Oares, nay (a thing worthy the admiration of all men) they rowed under the very Arches, tooke up their Oares and slept there: or at least lay still an houre very neare
their Boates not so much as moved through any way, either upward or downeward: the water seeming as plaine, quiet, even, and stable, as a pavement, under the Arch, where if any where in the Thames, there must be moving by reason of the narrownesse of the place, in this posture stood the water a whole houre and halfe or rather above by the Testimony of above five hundred Water-men on either side the Thames, whom not to believe in this case were stupiditie, not discre∣tion. At least when all men expected its ebb, being fil∣led with amazement that it stood so long as hath been delivered, behold a greater wonder, a new Tyde comes in, a new Tyde with a witnesse, you might easily take notice of him, so lowde he roared, that the noise was guessed to be about Greenewich when it was erd so, not onely clearly but fearefully to the Bridge, and up he comes tumbling, roaring, and foaming in that fu∣rious manner that it was horror unto all that beheld it, and as it gave sufficient notice to the care of its comming, so it left sufficient satisfaction to the eye, that it was now come, having raised the water foure foote higher then the first Tyde had done, foure foote by rule, as by evident measure did appeare, and pre∣sently ebbed in as hasty confused unaccustomed man∣ner, see here reader a wonder, that (all things conside∣red the oldest man never saw, or heard of the like, what God would signifie unto us by it, especially in these not well setled times) we must leave to him that in such cases teacheth and instructeth by the event, but for our, parts let it worke this good effect in us (knowing that in all ages from the Conquest hitherto, if we will believe our owne Chronologers the Feoffees in trust of the passed times, this vnusuall, sudden, vnnaturall
returne of the Tyde, hath in this Kingdome been ever∣more followed with continuall dismall heavie issues, either of deaths of unmatchable and Peerelesse perso∣nages, of Battaile, sicknesse, or Famine (as by sixe and forty mournfull instances we are able to make it ap∣peare:) this effect J say let it worke, let it end, or at least qualifie our dissentions & vncharitable disputes, let it worke in us a hate of Popish Idolatry, yet alone unto the men, to doe well as we say well to endeavour to joyne true charity towards our neighbour with true piety toward God, to couple true sincerity with true humility, to lincke true amity toward my friend, with true and vnfained Loyalty toward my Sove∣raigne. To pray day and night for a perfect Concord, and vnanimous consent, vndivided Union betweene King and Parliament, wherein consi∣steth the onely permanent hap∣pinesse of this King∣dome. FINIS.
