An ACT of Parliament passed in the First Parliament of King Charles the Second in Scotland, concerning the League and Covenant, and Discharging the Renewing thereof with∣out His Majesties Warrand and Approba∣tion. FOrasmuch as the power of Arms, and entring into, and making of Leagues and Bonds, is an undoubted Privilege of the Crown, and a proper Part of the Royal Prerogative of the Kings of this Kingdom, and that in Recognisance of His Ma∣jesties Just Right, the Estates of Parliament of this his most Anci∣ent Kingdom of Scotland, have declared it high Treason to the Subjects thereof, of whatsoever Number, less or more, upon any pretext whatsoever, to rise, or continue in Arms, or to enter into Leagues and Bonds, with Foreigners, or among themselves, without His Majesties special Warrand and Approbation, had and obtained thereto, and have Rescinded and Annulled all Acts of parliament, Conventions of Estates, or other Deeds whatsoever, contrary to, or inconsistent with the same; And whereas during these Troubles, there have occurred divers things, in the making and pursuance of Leagues and Bonds, which may be occasion of jealousie in, and be∣twixt His Majesties Dominions of Scotland, England and Ireland. There∣fore, and for preventing of all Scruples, Mistakes or Jealousies that may hereafter arise upon these Grounds, the King's Majesty, with Advice and Consent of His Estates of Parliament, doth hereby De∣clare, that there is no Obligation upon this Kingdom by Covenant, Treaties or otherwise, to endeavour by Armes a Reformation of Religion in the Kingdom of England, or to meddle with the publick Government and Administration of that Kingdom. And the King's Majesty with Advice and Consent foresaid, doth Declare, That the League and Covenant, and all Treaties following thereupon, and Acts or Deeds that do, or may relate thereto, are not Obligatory, nor do infer any Obligation upon this Kingdom, or the Subjects thereof, to meddle or interpose by Armes, or any Seditious way, in any thing concerning the Religion and Government of the Churches of England and Ireland, or in what may concern the Administration of His Majesties Government there. And further, His Majesty, with Ad∣vice and Consent of His Estates, doth hereby Discharge and Inhibit all His Majesties Subjects within this Kingdom, that none of them presume upon any Pretext of any Authority whatsoever, to require the renewing or swearing of the said League and Co∣venant, or of any other Covenants, or publick Oaths concerning the Government of the Church, or Kingdom, without His Majesties special Warrand and Approbation; And that none of His Majesties Subjects offer to renew and swear the same, without His Maje∣sties Warrand, as said is, as they will be answerable at their highest Peril.
