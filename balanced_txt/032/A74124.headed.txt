THE Estates of Parliament taking into their serious consideration the manifold grievances and complaints within the Kingdom against Ma∣sters, for oppressing their Tenants in outreiks of horse and foot, payment of the monethly Maintenance, and in Quarterings, as also against Officers and Souldiers, and Collectors of moneys for their disorderly carriage and unjust dealing. For remedy and redresse herein, they do Statute and Ordain, I. That the several Presbyteries send in to the Committee of Estates, a list of nine or ten understanding and conscientious men, that upon consideration thereof, and such other Information as shall be given to the Committee of Estates concerning these or any other persons, they may make choyce of five or six, to employ in that trust, and any three of them to have power to do and put in execution all things within the bounds of each Presbytery, which are referred to them by this Parliament, and that all grievances and complaints for wrongs done since the first of October last, or which shall be committed in time comming, being such as are by this Act referred to them by the Parliament, shal be presented to the said persons so nominated and chosen, and that the person first nominated in the Commission, shall conveen the rest at their first meeting, and take their oaths for the faithfull discharge of their duty, and then the next in Commission shall take his Oath; and that thereafter they meet at such times and places as they shall think fit, That they shall have power to conveen all persons interessed within the bounds of the Presbytery before them, to take the Oathes of parties, and to examine witness upon Oath, when they shall see it needfull, and that all Officers and Souldiers shall be assistant to them upon their direction for executing the power committed to them. II. That in all Levies of horse, the Tenant shall only furnish a sufficient man, and shall be free of all charge and expence whatsomever, unlesse they be rentallers or o∣thers, who have lands set unto them under the known worth and value, in which case, the Commissioners of each Presbytery to be chosen as aforesaid, shall have power to determin what shall be the proportion of the rentaller or others aforesaid, according to the ease they have of the land under the known value; Consideration being had what the tenant gave to the master at his entrie to the lands together with the yearly dutie and service; And that no rentaller, nor other aforesaid, shall be lyable to the payment of any part of the said Levy, but upon decreet of the Commissioners aforesaid, & that the heritors in the interim put forth the Levie; It being always understood, that where rentallers are already valued, distinct from the heritors by the Comissioneres apointed for the valuation of the shire that they shal pay conform to their valuation III. That in the Levies of foot the master shall find armes, and pay the advance or loane money, and that the tenant shal onlie find a sufficient man, and shall give unto him that shall goe forth the sum appointed by act of Parliament to be given by tenants, unless they be rentallers or others before mentioned, in which case, the said Commissioners shal determine as aforesaid what shall be their proportion. IV. That no master shall for benefit, spleen or private revenge, put forth any tenant of senyant in Levies, but that where there is any such complaint, the Commissioners aforesaid shall Judge of the fitness of the person. V That the Monethlie maintenance shall onlie be payed by the master, and the tenant to be free, unless they be rentallers or others as aforesaid, in which case, the Comissioners are to determine their proportions as is before expressed. VI. That all quarterings, whether local or transeunt shalbe allowed in payment of the Monthly maintenance in manner following, viz. that the master, or such as have power from the master to doe his affairs, shall deliver to the Collector a certificate, subscribed by two of the Comissioners aforesaid, that he hath allowed to his tenants the said quarterings (which are also to be instructed according to the Act of Parliament) in their maill or yearly rent and duty, and given them discharge for the same, before he get allowance of the quarterings in payment of the monthly maintenance, & that the Collector deliver the said certificate to the General Comissary; Or in case the master refuse to give the said certificate to the Collector, that then the collector bring two of the Comissioners certificate of the master his refusal, and if the Collector shall fail herein, that then he make accompt to the General Commissarie, for the whole monthlie maintenance, without any deduction for quarterings, and that the Comissioners take care that the masteres so refussing doe allow the said quarterings to the tenant in their maill and duties. VII And because quarterings upon particular persons, may exceed their proportion of the monethly maintenance, It is therefore statute and ordained, that the Collector of every shire shal make payment to all such persons as shal be so overburdened with quarterings out of the monethly maintenance of the shire, at the direction of the com∣mittee of war; And if the whole monthlie maintenance of any shire shalbe exhausted, that then the general Commissarie shal make payment to them for the said quarterings out of the monethly maintenance of other shires whose maintenance is not exhausted by quarterings.

That where tenants have not concurred in Iames Grahams rebellion, or been accessorie to the late unlawful Engagement against England, or the late Rebellion in the north, but have suffered therein, effectual course be taken for their ease and relief, that it be not in their masters power to oppresse and destroy them; And that the los∣ses of all such tenants as have suffered for their affection (there masters being guilty of any of the Crimes aforesaid) be cognosced and tryed before the said Comissioners, and what allowance and deduction shall be decerned by them, to be retained from their aforesaid masters (guilty as said is) shall be a sufficient exoneration and discarge to them of the mails and duties pro tanto, and is to be so allowed by all and whatsoever Judges before whom the said duties are to be pursued. And that the master be not permitted to pursue them for these duties before their own Courts, and if the master shal do otherwise, the tenant to have repetition pro tanto, provided, that nothing herein contained, shall extend to infringe any capitulation approven by Parliament.
