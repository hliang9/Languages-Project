TO THE RIGHT HO∣NORABLE LORD, ROBERT Earle of Salisburie, Vicount Cranborn, Barron of Essingdon, Principall Secretarie to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie, Maister of the Courtes of wardes and Liueries, Chancelor of the most famous Vniuersity of Cambridge, Knight of the most Noble Order of the Garter, and one of his Maiesties most Honourable Priuie Councell. PLato and Aristotle, the profoundest of their times, thought the best educati∣on to bee defectiue, without know∣ledge in Musicke, and Cicero reporteth, that although Themistocles was en∣dowed with many graces, yet was hee the lesse esteemed, being ignorant thereof, and such regard hath all anti∣quity had thereto that wee not onely find them to loue, but practise it, for amongst the rest, Saint Augustine recordeth that S. Ambrose Bishoppe of Millan, who ouerwatcht the Church, (then vnder persecution of the Arrians) intertainde
the time with songes and Musicke, and though the death of Nero,Tacit. was exceeding ioyfull to the people, yet was it much lamented, that his excellency in Musicke, should perish with him: which when I consider (Right Honorable) together with the worthy approbation you haue giuen to many pro∣fessors of the same. I am not onely encouraged, still to pra∣ctise, but willingly to publish these songes, (as the badges of my affection) to all posterity: And for, because those things are most embraced; which men find approued, by the voice of greatnesse, I therefore, ambitiously thought it best, to single out your Honor, being best able to protect them, hope∣fully assuring my selfe, that your spirites, (which are incom∣bred with many cares) may a little bee delighted in the hea∣ring of these songes, which if they may attaine, I your Ho∣nors humble votarie, shall be highly fortunate, and there∣by the rather perswaded to liue and die, Your Honours most bounden, in all humble duety, ROBERT IONES.
