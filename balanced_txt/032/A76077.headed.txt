Acts 9.3. 26   27   28   29   30   31   Observations. As the rebellion of Zedechiah moved Nabuchadnezar to rise up in Armes and to besiedge Je∣rusalem, so our rebelling against God and his Lawes has been the cause of these present warres, let the example of Paul serve as a motive to induce us to av our rebellous courses, and then doubtlesse the King will return in peace, & crown u with a wreath of glory.

Gen, 8.10. 17   18   19   20   21   22   23   24   25   26   27   28   29   Observations. This present time doth neere∣ly resemble that time, the world being involved, (though not with a deluge of water) yet with an inundation of Blood, for Warre is the onely Theame that is discourst of, upon the face of Europe, especially here in England, this land like Noahs Arke hath long soated on the troubled waters of division, a Dove is sent forth and (if heresie and hipochrisie hinder not) doubtlesse this Dove will re∣turn with an Olive Branch, and the King shall speak Peace to his People.

April. 1 The fist of this moneth Neha uncovered the. Arke and saw earth, Gen. 8.13. 2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10 The tenth of this month the children of Israell passd tho row the River Iordan on dry foot, Iosu. 4.19. 11   12   13   14 The fourtenth of this moneth the Isaralrtes departed out of Egipt, Num. 23.3. 15   16   17   18 The eighteenth of this moneth the children of Israel walked on dry land through the red Sea. 19   20   21   22   23   24   25   26   27   28   29   30   Observations The Religious Israelites of this land are at this day in the same strait an Army of destroyers dayly endeavour to destroy them, and on the other side they are invaded with the red Sea of division, superstition, and oppsi∣tion, yet let them not murmure a∣gainst God, for in his good time he will deliver them.

The waters being dried up, came forth of the Ark, Gen. 8.14. &c. 28   29   30   31   Observation. Let the murmurers of this Citie make this their president, and take heed that they murmure no more a∣gainst the Judgments of God, nor the means which God hath ordained to preserve his people from the pre∣sent judgments, least the Lord cause the clouds to raigne fire from hea∣ven, and suffer the the sword of enemy to prevaile over them, for the Lord has promised to deliver his children, and though he deffer his coming yet in the end he will come, and take Vengeance against those that murmure against him; and revile his Saints, and such as proffesse his name, here on the face of the earth, therefore waite patien∣ly, and the Lord will surely defend you from the power of those that seek to destroy you.

Jo∣sephas) lib. 5. cap. 26) and said it was burned after∣ward by the Romanes the same day. Therefore do the Iews on this day observe a most strait Fast, and go barefooted; and sitting on the ground, reade twice over the Lamentations of Ieremie. 11   12   13   14   15   16   17   18   19   20   21   22   23   24   25   26   27   28   29   30   31

Ierusalem was destroyed with fire and Sword, by Titus the Emperour, Iosephus, lib. 7. cap. 29. 9   10   11   12   13   14   15   16   17   18   19   20   21   22   23   24   25 The 25. of this moneth Nehe∣miah finished the wals of Ieru∣salem, Nehem. 6.15. 26   27   28   29   30   October. 1 The first of this moneth Ie∣rusalem, after it had been pos∣sed of Christian Princes 88. yeares, through mortall dissen∣tion, came into the hands of the Sarazens, Anno, 1187. 2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10 The tenth of this moneth the the feast of reconciliation was kept. 11   12   13   14   15 The fifteenth day of this mo∣neth the Jewes observed the feast of Tabernacles 7. dayes together, in memory of the Lords protecting them in the Desart. 16   17   18   19   20   21   22   23   24   25   26   27   28   29   30   31   Observations If mortall dissention was the cause of Jerusalems destruction, (as is ap∣parent by the testimony of the most ancient writers) then let England and in particular the City of London, beware of division, for if you do not in time gve a period to these destructive dissentions, and joyn in unity with thie Servants of God, and assist them against the common Enemie, I dare boldy pronounce that this ensuing yeare will produce the Sword, Plague, Pestilence, and Famine, with the destruction of this glorious City.
November. 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10 The tenth of this moneth An. 1483. D. Martin Luther was born in Istebia. 11   12   13   14   15 The fifteenth of this moneth was made a new holiday by Jeroboam, without the com∣mandement of God, whereup∣on he committed most wicked Jdolatry in Dan and Bethell, but he remained not long un∣punished, nor his People un∣plagued for the same, as may appeare, 1. Kings 12. ver. 32.33. 1. King 13.1.2. &c. 16   17 Queen Elizabeth began happily to raigne for the advancement of the Gospell of our Saviour Christ, the 17. of this moneth. 18 The 18. of this moneth Titus the Emperour most cruelly ex∣ecuted to death a great number of the Jewes, Iose ph lib. 7. cap. 10. 19   20   21   22   23   24   25   26   27   28   29   30   December. 1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11   12   13   14   15 The 15. of this moneth Anti∣ochus placed an abominable I∣doll upon the Altar of the Lord, 1. Mac. 1.57. 16   17   18   19   20 The twentieth of this moneth Esdras exhorted the Jsaralites to put away their strange wives 1. Esdras 9. ver. 5.6. 21   22   23   24   25 The 25. of this moneth our Saviour Christ was borne of the Virgin, the yeare after the worlds Creation 4018. On which day also Antiochus Epiphanes entered into Jerusa∣lem with a mighty Army, and spoiled the same, Ioseph, lib. 12. 26   27   28 The 28. of this moneth He rod caused the poore Innocent to be murthered, thinking there by to have slain Christ. 29   30   31   Observations. The world may be divided into three times every time consisting of about two thousand yeares, two of which times were ended at the come∣ing of Christ in the flesh, so that by all computations it is apparent that the third time is almost accomplished since the comming of the Messias at the end of which is expected Christs second comming in glory, nor is it without good ground that such conjectures are raysed, for if you go ac∣cording to the words of David, where he sayes that a thousand yeears are
but as a day in the sight of the Lord, which wordes are conceived to be  Propheticall discription of the neer resemblance between those six dayes wherein God made the world, and those six thousand yeares since the the Creation, wherein man was ordained to labour, and runne out a care∣full pilgimage, which being expired, our eternall Saboth is at hand, where we shall rest from our labour, but to confirme it more, looke upon the words of Christ Luke 21. ver. 8. and so forward, where he tels his Ap∣postles that they should know the time of his comming againe in glory by this signe, that there should be false Prophets, Warres and Seditions, Earthquakes, and Signes from heaven, all which are acomplished, false Prophets we have round about us, Warres and seditions we are too senci∣ble of, Signes from Heaven very many, especially some very lately in Ger∣many nere upon the time of the great conjunction of Saturne and Iupiter, for it is is certified by severall Letters ro Persons of Great Eminencie, that at Lipswicke, on the 14, of February last, it rained Fire from Heaven and there was such thundering and flashes of Lightning, that the inhabitants thought the day of Judgement had been come, after which was heard plea∣sant musicke in the Ayre, to the wonder and amazement of all the Coun∣try, though this relation may seeme contrary to reason, yet conclude not rashly, for Christ hath foretold that such things must come to passe, and the Scriptures must be fulfilled, these things I recommend unto thy consi∣deration o man, to the end that thou maiest prepare thy selfe to meet the Bridegroome, for assure thy selfe that the dayes to come are few and evill, therefore let the Regenerate man rejoyce, for the time of tribulation is al∣most accomplished and the dayes of peace are at hand. FINIS.
