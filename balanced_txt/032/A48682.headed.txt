A LIST of the Parliament of WOMEN. FOrasmuch as by the Laws of Nature, Women have a great share in the Creation, and that they eat, drink, sleep, talk, and do all the other Deeds of Nature, and natural Acts, as well as Man, having, to their great grief, seen the vile miscarriages of the Lordly and domineer∣ing Creature, Man, who hath very tyrannically excluded them from both Arts and Arms, and suffered none of them to use any other Ra∣pier, but a Needle, nor any Lance, but a Distaff, nor suffer'd them to come into the Pulpit, or to the Bar, though they have believed al∣ways, and do still believe, that they are able both to preach and plead, as well as many Men, having the member of the Tongue as loosly hung, and as long, brood, and exact, in all its dimensions, as man's; and they have also had, and still have a firm belief and opinion, that their Hearts are as big, and contain as much spirits and stoutness as man's; and also that their Skulls are as full of brains, and have as much wit and subtil∣ty, as any Man whatsoever. All this being Taely and seriously consider'd; and having also read of the famous Amazonian Kingdom, on the Banks of Thermodoon, and how well they were able to rule and manage the Affairs of the Common-wealth; and also, that among their Noble Ancestors, the Ancient Cauls and Saxons, the Women used to sit as Judges, and had a great stroke in the Affairs, and management of the Common-wealth. And now seeing the many miscarriages of late of the Men of this Kingdom, and that they have not ordered their Affairs to the content of all; and believing, they could manage Matters much better, they have, with one Consent, laid their Heads together, and resolved to congregate them∣selves, and to meddle with the Affairs of the Common-wealth, and to place themselves at the Helm of Government, and to endeavour to regain-their long lost Liberty. And having lately searched all the Records of Ʋtopia, they found an Ancient Writ of Queen Mabs, which they have sent to all Parts, both of City and Countrey, for the Women to choose their Representatives, forthwith to repair to London-Bridge, and there to sit, and order the Affairs, for the Good of the People, and for the Honour, Welfare, Reputation and Benefit of Woman-kind.

After much Debate, and great Disputes, they at last chose the Lady All Tongue for their Speaker, and so Adjourned till the next Week: What Acts, Speeches, Remonstrances, Bills and Orders, may be performed, made and done by them, Time will produce.
