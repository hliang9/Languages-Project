A Tender Salutation to the SEED. FRom the breathing of my life which I feel opening in the bowells of my Fathers love flowing forth to you, that we may be refreshed one in another; O thou Seed, thou Heir, thou beautifull branch and plant of the Lord for the healing of the Nations which shall flye and flock unto thee, as the Doves unto the windowes; O thou beautifull Bride, embrace thy Beloved, who stands ready to adorn thee, and to put his Comlinesse upon thee to purge and purify, and make an everlasting Covenant with thee to be espoused to thee for ever: this is the Lamb, the dread of all Nations, the Lamb of God, oh blessed are they that receive him in the way of his Coming, it is through the suffering, put it not afarre off from you, prise the day of Sion's visitation; oh my soul! praise thou the Lord for ever, who hath hid these things from the wise and prudent, and revealed them unto Lambes who love thy Law, and delight in Judgement, O let it be our delight for ever there to be found, in the fiery tryall and furnace of affliction, till the Rebellious be destroyed, thy wrath and fury pacified, and thy indignation passed over, and thy seed brought forth through the great tribulation, where the wicked cannot passe: oh the mournful Seed of the Kingdome! arise, arise, shake off the dust and clods of the earth, let the grave clothes fall off which oppresse the just; presse forward, forget what is behind, shine forth for the glory of the Lord is arisen upon thee; thou art the Lady of King∣domes, and the desire of Nations shall be after thee, and all shall bow and be wearied out before thee that is not of thee, it is the word of the Lord God that ariseth in my heart unto thee; for the banner of Gods Righteousnesse shall be displayed through thee, and in patience thou shalt overcome, for thou art the Chosen of the Lord, the burthensome stone; he that smiteth at thee shall be broken, he that smiteth shall be smitten, he that hath led captive is the Lord leading into captivity; for this is the stone cut out of the mountain without hands, that let us see our enemies to be they of our own house; oh you spiritual plants feel me, you who know from whence warres and fightings comes, who are exercised in the spiritual warfare, follow, follow, follow the Lamb who leads out of strife through death to life, through judgement to mercy, through the daily Crosse to the Crown; this is Jesus manifested in our mortall bodies, praises for ever, praises for ever, oh feel the rayes and overcomings of his life, that my soul is overcomed with that which flowes to you, for my soul is poured forth in the remembrance of you which abide in your places; keep in the Cross, dwell in the power, stand in the Authority of the Lord, a witnesse living, pure, simple, single hearted before God and man, so keeping peace with all, in the indwellling life with the Lord, where none can make you a∣fraid, and keep your meetings in the fear, dread, and power of the Lord God, be not afraid of the threatning of the wicked, nor overcome with their flatteries, but stand a witnesse for the Lord, and he will plead your Cause in their hearts, and deal with them in his own time, oh let bowells of pity flow forth to them, for they know not what they doe, the Lord forgive them, if it may stand with thy glory, and bring them into Covenant with thy self; And Dear friends abide in the Covenenant, keep in the Fathers house, look not out, let nothing shake your confidence, keep to your first love, in which you were gathered, in the light which is eternal and un∣changeable, and shall remain and abide for ever, though Gods enemies may be suffered to remove us into holes and prisons for the tryal of our faith, but the Teacher hath manifested his love unto us, through the anointing, that teacheth us, that shall never be removed into a corner: So dear Lambes learn of him, who careth for you, who will instruct and direct you by the pourings forth of his holy spirit upon you; And Dear friends, turn in, see the end for which the Lord hath chosen you and your standing in him, who hath all time in his hand, Center not below him, but follow him, for great is the Call and high, wherewith the Lord hath called us, seek not to be at ease, join not to the oppressour, keep to that which divides and separates, so shall you be made a blessing in the hand of the Lord, and not look down, but dwell in the long∣sufferings, in the patience, and God will give you the heathen for your inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for the possession of the Righteous Seed in you, and you shall be made the praise of the whole earth, and your enemies shall become your friends, as in some measure they are seen in this trying day in the hand of the Lord, doing service for him; so be not troubled at them, for the Lord hath the disposing of them, amd what they have done, the work laid out for them to doe, the Lord will either bring them in, or lay them aside, for all power is in his hand; good is the name of the Lord, it is as precious ointment poured forth to us who feel the drawings of the cords of his love, oh let our souls delight to dwell with him, in whom there is no wearinesse, nor shadow of turning, but we may runne the race with patience, in the wayes of his Commandements, there to delight our souls in the ocean of his life, to drink of the river of his pleasure, that we may live and grow and shine forth, serving the Lord in fear, and our generation in faithfulnesse, quitting our selves like men walking clear of all, that the bloud of none may be required at our hands, not loving our lives to death to do his will: This is the desire of your suffering brother, we may all here be found a sweet savour to the Lord, and one unto another, unto the end, and in the end. Amen. Written in York Castle, by your dear Brother, and lover of your souls, known unto you by the name of Samuel Thornton.
