THE TRUE Protestant Lettany. Hos fuge: Pestis enim nulla h√¢c immanior: Hi sunt Faex hominum, fons nequitiae, Sentina Malorum. FROM such as the honest Intentions oppose Of our true hearted Friends, and are led by the Nose, By the specious Pretences and Wiles of our Foes: Libera Nos Domine. From such as the Protestant Cause would betray, And give up their Lives to the Pope for a prey; If they will not sell Heaven as freely as they: Libera Nos. From Judges opprest with such dimness of sight, That they cannot discern what is wrong or what's right; If a Spiders Gold-Web do but hang in their light: Libera Nos. From those, who to finish their Treasons begun, When they fear'd that their Work would be left but half done; Did consult by the stars how to darken our Sun: Libera Nos. From Persons, who under a handsome Disguise, Would perswade us the only way to be wise, Is to forfeit our Reason and put out our Eyes: Libera Nos. From those who would Learnedly make it appear, That 'tis Factious either to shun or to fear The most eminent Dangers, though never so near: Libera Nos. From Infallible Fopps, who would make us believe We must pin our Faith to their Catholick Slieve, Till we suffer a Bondage beyond a Reprieve: Libera Nos. From the Factors of Rome, who hither are sent, To raise causless dislikes of the Kings Government; And to seperate him and his Parliament: Libera Nos. From such as will whisper the Traytors Defence, And do own they believe their avouch'd Innocence, Thereby to disparage the Kings Evidence: Libera Nos. From Powis and Peters, and all the whole Crew, And from all that would have them come short of their due; From Friers and Priests, and from Jesuits too: Libera Nos. And lastly from all that wish ill to the King, Or Popery into this Nation would bring; Who merit no less than a Paddington Swing. Libera Nos.
