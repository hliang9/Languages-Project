THE DECLARATION OF THE Lords, Gentlemen, Citizens, Freeholders, and Yeomen of this once happy Kingdom of ENGLAND. SInce it hath pleased Almighty God to suffer the Spirit of Divi∣sion to continue in this distracted Nation, and to leave us without any setled foundation of Religion, Liberty, or Property, the Legislative power usurped and contemned at pleasure, the Armies raised at first for our defence, abused and mis∣led into unwarrantable Actions, by the Cunning and Ambition of some of their superiour Officers; no face of Government appearing either in any single Person, or Body of Men in Counsel lawfully con∣stituted, to whom the grievances of the People may with any pro∣bability of success be properly addressed. Wee being conscious of our Duty, and sensible of our own, and the Nations Ruine, if these Distractions continue, or resolve into a more fixt Oppression, by some corrupt settlement, inconsistant with the Laws, Peace, and interest of the Nation, have taken Arms, in defence of our selves, and all others, who will pertake with us in the vindication and maintenance of the Freedom of Parliaments, a∣gainst all violence whatsoever of the known Laws, Liberty, and Pro∣perty of the Good People of this Nation, who at present groan un∣der illegal, arbitrary, and insupportable Taxes and payments, un∣known to our Ancestors. This being our Duty to God and Man, and our only Design, we cannot dispair of the Blessing of him that gives victory, nor of the chearfull concurrence of all good men, nor of the undeceived part of the Army, whose Arrears, increase of future pay, and advance∣ment to higher Commands, we shall by all means procure; suffe∣ring no imposition or force on any mans Conscience: To this we doubt not but all honest Englishmen will say AMEN.
