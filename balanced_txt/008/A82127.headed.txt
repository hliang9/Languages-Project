And They for their parts heartily wish they may be accursed as Corah and his Accomplices, that do or shall purposely occasion or foment any difference betweene His Majestie and His Parliament, And therefore they further declare their readinesse with their Lives and Fortunes to obey His Majestie as their most Deare and Dread Soveraigne according to their due Allegiance, and the reso∣lution to defend the just Priviledges of Parliament according to their free and just Protestation, and that as God and the Fundamentall Laws of this King∣dom hath joyned His Majestie and the Parliament together, So they cannot agree unto a disjoynted obedience, but do Declare themselves Enemies to all such as shall go about to put His Majestie and the Parliament asunder. And for this Resolution they have great encouragement from His Maie∣sties own Declaration attested with forty of the Nobility and Privie Councell, whereby He hath most graciously assured them and all other His People, that He hath no more thoughts of making war against His Parliament, then against His own Children, & that He will defend the iust Privileges of Parliament, and maintaine and observe the Acts assented to by His Gracious Maiestie this pre∣sent Parliament without violation; for which as for other His Maiesties seve∣rall gracious Protestations, for the defence of the Protestant Religion, and the Laws of the Land, they returne most humble thanks to His Majestie.
