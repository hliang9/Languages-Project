The New Courtier: The Tune is, Cloris, since thou art fled away, &c. UPon the Change where Merchants meet 'Twixt Cornhill and Thredneedle-street; VVhere VVits of every size is hurl'd, To treat of all things in the World: I saw a folded Paper fall, And upon it, these words were writ, Have at all. Thought I, if Have at all. it be, For ought I know, 'tis have at Me: And (if consequence be true) It may as well be Have at You: Then listen pray to what I shall, In brief declare, what's written there: Have at all. SONG. I Am a Courtier, who in sport, Do come from the Utopian Court, To whisper softly in your Ear, How high we are, and what we were: To tell you all would be too much, But here and there a little touch, Have at all. I was not many years agoe, In tater'd trim from top to toe: But now niy ruin'd Robes are burn'd, My Rags are all to Ribbons turn'd: My Patches into Peeces fall, I cogg a Dye, Swagger and Lye, Have at all. Vpon my Pantelonian Pate I wear a Milleners Estate: But when he Duns me at the Court, I shew him a Protection for't: Whilst he both to Protesting fall, I cry, Dam me, Sir, you lye, Have at all. Since Venus shav'd off my Hair, A powdred Perewig I wear, VVhich brings me in the Golden Girls, Game-Royal for Dukes, Lords and Earls: VVhen Love doth for a cooler call, My fancy drives, at maids & wives, Have at all. The Second Part, to the same Tune. MY Lodgings never are at quiet, Another Duns me for my Diet, I had of him in Fifty three, Which I forgot, so did not he: I call him saucy Fellow, sirrah, And draw my Sword to run him tho∣rough Have at all. Yet once a Friend that sav'd my Life, Who had a witty wanton wife, I did in (courtesie) requite, Made him a Cuckold, and a Knight: Which makes him mount like Ten∣nis ball, Whilst she & I, together cry: Have at all. But yet these Citts are subtile Slaves, Most of them Wits, and knowing Knaves; We get their Children, and they do, From us get Lands, and Lordships too: And 'tis most fit in those affairs The Lands should go to the right hairs Have at all. A Souldier I directly hate: A Cavelier once broke my Pate VVith Cane in hand he overcome me And took away my Mistress from me: for I confess I love a VVench Be she English, Irish, Dutch, or French Have at all. A Souldiers life is not like mine I will be Plump when he shall Pine? My Projects carry stronger force Then all their Armed Foot and Horse: VVhat though his morter-peeces roar My Chimney-peeces shall do more: Have at all. Thus I have given you in short A Courtier of Utopian Court. I Write not of Religion, For (to tell truly) we have none. If any me to Question call, VVith pen or Sword, Hab Nab's the VVord Have at all.
