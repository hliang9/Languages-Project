VVE the Gentry of the County of Norfolk, and County and City of Norwich, being deeply affected with the sence of our sad Distractions and Divisions, both in Church and State, and wearied with the miseries of an Unnatural Civil War, the too Frequent Interruptions of Government, the Imposition of several hea∣vy Taxes, and the loud Out-cries of multitudes of undone, and almost Famished People, occasioned by the General decay of Trade, which hath spread it self throughout the whole Nation, and these Counties in particular; and having met together, and consulted what may best re∣medy, and remove our, and the Nations present Grievances and Distra∣ctions, Do humbly conceive, that the chief Expedient will be, the recal∣ling of those Members that were secluded in 1648, and sat before the Force put upon the Parliament (We of the County of Norfolk) be∣ing by such Seclusion, deprived of any Person to represent us in Parlia∣ment,) and also by filling up the Vacant Places thereof; and all to be Admitted without any Oath, or Engagement, previous to their Entrance; which being done, We shall be ready to acquiesce, and submit in all things, to the Judgment and Authority of Parliament, without which Autho∣rity, the People of England cannot be obliged to pay any Taxes.
