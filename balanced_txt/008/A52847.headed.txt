A TREATISE OF Consumptions: IN WHICH Their Nature, Causes and Symp∣toms are briefly Explained; AND A New and Extraordinary Method by Specifick Medicines is Propo∣sed for the Cure of Consumptions; even such as proceed from Ulcers of the Lungs. By Thomas Nevett, Chyrurgion. LONDON, Printed by John Astwood, and Sold by Thomas Parkhurst at the Bible and Three Crowns at the lower end of Cheap-side, and Brabazon Aylmer at the Three Pidgeons in Cornhil. 1697.
TO THE READER. I Remember a Remarka∣ble Passage in some Ob∣servations upon the Ber∣mudas Berries, by a Dr. of Physick in the Country, addrest to the Honourable Esq Boyle, who professeth he had been for fifty years an exact Observer of the
Methodus Medendi, yet saith the Dr. for my part I firmly believe, that (Ʋni∣versal Evacuations being premised) the greatest Cures wrought in the World, are by the use of Specifical Me∣dicines. The higher the Attainments of any have been in understanding, the more freely have they ac∣knowledged that the great∣est part of those things they did know, was the least of those things they did not know; such men account
it not shameful to renounce an Errour, tho' never so antient, when perswaded thereunto by Truth and plain Demonstration: There are other narrow Spirits (abundantly satisfied in their own knowledge) that believe the Art of Physick hath been taught by our Ancestors, in such an abso∣lutely perfect manner, as that nothing remains to the In∣dustry and Diligence of Po∣sterity; it being too much their Humour to underva∣lue
every Medicine that they themselves are not Masters of, because they prefer their private Interest to the publick Good: But in the mean time where is that cordial Love to Mankind, which is one of the Badges of true Christianity? Nay, where is the Exercise of Reason? For how can a Man give his Opinion against a thing that he never heard of before, or at least never experienced? I an sure, this unjustifiable practise is
the way to put a stop to all useful Knowledge and Im∣provements: It is therefore expected from the Ingeni∣ous and Candid Reader, that he should adhere to Truths Cause, by whomsoever it is pleaded, weigh every In∣vention, not in the deceit∣ful Ballance of Custom, but in the just and even Scales of Reason, approve what is agreeable, and reject what is contrary to it. That I who am by Pro∣fession a Chirurgion, should
in such a polite and inquisitive Age, adventure my thoughts in publick concerning a Phy∣sical Case, may be to some matter of admiration, and to others of severe censure; es∣pecially such as may think I have invaded their Province. As for the latter, I am per∣swaded nothing that I can say will remove their Prejudices, and for the former, I shall only tell them, that being ala∣ramd by some of the Symp∣toms mentioned in the follow∣ing Discourse, whereby I
plainly perceived the constitu∣tion of my own Body inclin∣ing to a consumptive state, I strenuously applyed my mind iq study the Nature of this Disease, and to find out, if possible, some noble Specifick Medicines, which might indeed deserve that Name, and be able to oppose the growth of so fatal a Distem∣per, which hath insensibly flat∣tered so many into the Cham∣bers of Death. What I then laboured for, and search∣ed after, I have since (by the
Blessing of God) found, and with great advantage experimented on my self and many others, and now think fit to disclose for the good of all, not doubting but if a more Excellent Method and Medicine then hath hither∣to been generally practised, or prescribed, be treasured up in the Hands of any Person whatsoever, he doth more faithfully perform the part of a just Steward, by a due Improvement, than a close concealment of it. And on
the same Account, I judge it more my Duty to Jerve my Native Country, than mind the Clamours of Censorious Criticks; not at all questi∣oning but in a little time, the efficacy of these Medi∣cines will at once bring Health to the Patient, and Reputation to their Author: And when the World shall be convinced of the Power of these Remedies, by their Effects, I shall think it sea∣sonable to make them known, which many will now be
apt to contemn and neglect, until their Opinions be al∣tered by Experience, and their Prejudices removed by Demostration. From my House at the Chyrurgions-Arms in Fen Church∣street, Octob. 24. 1696. T. Nevett.
A TREATISE OF Consumptions. THe Design of this small Trea∣tise is not to trouble the Reader with many Divisions, or Sub∣divisions of Consumpti∣ons,
but briefly to enquire into the Nature and Cau∣ses of this Disease, as also to contribute my Mite, in order to oppose its Fury, by pointing at such Spe∣cifick Medicines as are most likely to engage it with Success. A Consumption in ge∣neral, is a wasting of all the solid parts of the Bo∣dy, for want of a due Distribution or Assimila∣tion of the Nutritious Juices.
By some Learned Men this is observed to be the Endemicall Distemper of England; and indeed our Weekly Bills at once de∣clare both the greatness of the Disease, and the weak∣ness of the Medicines where∣with its Cure hath been hitherto attempted. Be∣sides, that which seems to justifie this Observation, is the pernicious custom of the Inhabitants of this Island, who immoderate∣ly and unseasonably in∣dulge
their Appetites with several sorts of Meats and Drinks, whereby the Tone of the Stomach is so vitia∣ted, as that it cannot per∣fectly ferment and vo∣latilize the Chyle, which is commonly the internal procatartick cause of most Distempers among us, and consequently of Consump∣tions from those Distem∣pers, from whence comes a colliquation of the Chyle in Lienteries and Dysen∣teries, tormenting Colick
and Iliack Pains, Hy∣pocondriack Melancholly, hysterick Fits, scorbutick Twitches, troublesom Ca∣tarrhs, sluggish Passage of the Chyle through the mil∣ky Veins, scrophulous Tu∣mours and Inflammations of the mesenterick Glands, spasmodick Contractions or Convulsions of the Nerves, preternatural Fer∣mentation of the Blood and Spirits, Cachexys, Atro∣phys, Obstructions, Feavers Hectical, inflammatory and
putrid, Exulcerations of the Lungs and Marasmus, with many other Diseases, whence come they Origi∣nally and for the most part, but from the Weakness, Ill Habit and Indisposition of the Stomach? Now the proper Acti∣on of the Stomach is Chy∣lification; for though the Meat we take into our Mouths receives some alte∣ration there in Mastication, by the fermenting Juice that flows from the saliva∣tory
Glands, together with the acrimonious Particles, and fermentaceous Spirits of Liquors which we drink, yet it is not turned into a thick white Juice, till it hath passed down through the Oesophagus, or Gullet, into the Stomach, where by the help of its Fibres it is closely embraced, and mixed with specifick fer∣mentaceous Juices, separa∣ted by its inner Coat, and impregnated by the Saliva, then by a convenient Heat
there is made a mixture of all; for that the fermen∣taceous Particles entering into the Pores of the Meat, do pass through, agitate and eliquate its Particles, dis∣solving the whole Compa∣ges, in which the purer parts were intimately uni∣ted with the Crass, and ma∣king them more fluid, so that they make another form of Mixture, and unite among themselves into the resemblance of a Milky Cream, after which toge∣ther
with the thicker Mass with which they are yet in∣volved, by the Constricti∣on of the Stomach they pass down to the Guts, where by the Mixture of the Bile and Pancreatick Juice they are by another manner of Fermentation quite separated from the thicker Mass, and so are received by the Lacteal Vessels, as the thicker is ejected by stool. After the purer part of the Chyle hath been thus
strained thorough the nar∣row and oblique Pores of the Milky Veins, by the continual and peristaltick motion of the Intestines, it is yet further attenuated and diluted with a very thin and clear Lympha from the Glands of the Mesen∣tery to expedite its passage through those Numerous Meanders into the common Receptacle, from whence by the constant supply of such like Lympha from the small Glands of the Thorax,
it is safely conveyed through the Ductus Chyli∣ferus Thoracicus, subclavi∣an Vein, and the Vena Ca∣va into the Heart. The Chyle now ming∣led with the Blood, pass∣eth with it through the Arterys of the whole Bo∣dy, and returns again with the Blood by the Veins to the Heart, undergoing many Circulations before it can be Assimilated to the Blood; for every time the new infused Chyle passeth
through the Heart with the Blood, the Particles of the one are more intimately mixed with those of the other, in its Ventricles, and the Vital Spirit, and other active Principles of the Blood work upon the Chyle, which being full of Salt, Sulphur and Spirit, as soon as its Compages is loosned by its Fermentati∣on with the Blood, the Principles having obtained the Liberty of Motion, do readily associate themselves,
and are Assimilated with such parts of the Blood as are of a like and suitable Nature. After the Chyle hath been thus Elaborated, it becomes fit as well to re∣cruit the Mass of Blood, as to Nourish the whole Body, seeing it consists of divers Principles and Parts of a different Nature, there∣fore according to the vari∣ous Use and Necessity of every Part, and also that it may conform and fashion
it self to the different Pores and Passages, so it is seve∣rally appropriated, the most volatile and subtil part is separated in the Brain, and adapted to refresh the Ani∣mal Spirits, the Glutinous to nourish the Body, and the Sulphureous to revive the Native Heat: And in its passage with the Blood through all the parts of the body, all the mass of Chyle that is capable of being turned into Blood is sanguified, the serous and
saline part precipitated by the Kidneys, and evacua∣ted by Sweats or insensi∣ble Transpiration, the Bi∣lious is deposited in the Li∣ver, and the rest of its Ex∣crements retire to the several Emunctorys of the Body. Thus it comes to pass by the wonderful Sagacity of Nature, such extraordina∣ry Provision is made, that the purer part of the Chyle by these ways and means is more purified; and when it is thus purified and sub∣limed,
it is more capable of reinforcing the Blood and Spirits, as also of corroborating the Tone of every particular Part: Whereas when the Chyle is sowre and dispirited, the blood necessarily becomes vappid, the Animal Spirits that reside in the System of the Nerves are infected with a Morbid Dispositi∣on, and all parts of the Body begin to flag and waste. For indeed there is no other way to recruit
the dayly Expence of Blood and Spirits, but by a continual Influx of lau∣dable Chyle into the blood-vessels, which Chyle is made by the Fermentative Juice of the Stomach, and this Fermentative Juice supplyed from the Mass of Blood, so that there plainly appears to be a fixt Correspondence betwixt the Blood and Chyle, and a necessary Dependance all the Humours in the Habit of the Body have on the
Stomach; from whence it is reasonable to infer, That if the Chylifying Faculty of the stomach be depraved, the Blood and Humours must necessarily sympa∣thize therewith, and in a manner proportionable to the Distemper of this part. The immediate Cause of a Consumption of the Lungs is store of sharp, malignant, waterish Hu∣mours, continually distill∣ing upon the soft spongy Substance of the Lungs,
stuffing, inflaming, impo∣stumating, and exulcera∣ting them, whereby their Action, which is Respira∣tion, or a receiving in and driving forth Air is depra∣ved, as will more clearly appear by the following Description of these Parts. It may not be impertinent to our Discourse if we should usher in the De∣scription of the Lungs, with a short account of the Trachea, Aspera Arte∣ria, or Wind-pipe.
The Trachea or Aspera Arteria is a long Pipe, con∣sisting of Cartilages and Membranes, which begin∣ning at the Throat or lower part of the Jaws, and lying upon the Gullet, de∣scends into the Lungs, through which it spreads into many Branchings, and is commonly divided into two parts, the Larynx and Bronchus; the Larynx is the upper part of the Wind-pipe, the Bronchus is all the Trachea besides the Larynx,
as well before as after it arrives at the Lungs. The Substance of the Lungs is soft, spongy and rare, curiously compacted of most thin and fine Mem∣branes, continued with the Ramifications of the Tra∣chea or Wind-pipe, which Membranes compose an infinite number of little, round and hollow Vesicles, or Bladders, so placed as that there is an open Pas∣sage from the Branches of the Aspera Arteria, out of
one into another, and all terminate at the outer Membrane that investeth the whole Lungs : These little Bladders by help of their muscular Fibres con∣tract themselves in Expira∣tion, and are dilated in In∣spiration, partly by the pressure of the Atmo∣sphere, and partly by the Elastick power of the Air, insinuating it self into these Vesicles through the Wind-pipe and its several branches: Their Lobes are
two, the right and left, parted by the Mediastinum, each of which is divided into many lesser Lobules, according to the Ramifi∣cations of the Aspera Ar∣teria; they have all sorts of Vessels that are com∣mon to them with other parts, as Arterys, Veins, Nerves, Lympheducts, but peculiar to themselves they have their Bronchia, or the Branches of the Wind-pipe, for bringing in and carrying forth Air so ne∣cessary
to Life, that we cannot Live without it: And when we consider their admirable Structure, (as well as the structure of every individual part of our Body) how ought we to Adore the infinite Wisdom of our Creator! Now when these small Ve∣sicles or Bladders are re∣pleat with Extravasated Serum, or purulent Mat∣ter, the Natural Tone of the Lungs is so weakned, that we cannot enjoy the
Benefit of free and full Respiration, hard, scirr∣hous Tumours or Tuber∣cles are bred, attended with a dry and trouble∣some Cough, Oppression of the Breast, difficult and short Breathing, preterna∣tural Heats, Exulcerati∣ons, and other deplorable Symptoms, according to the Degrees of Obstructi∣on, and different Nature of the included Humours. The External Proca∣tartick Cause of a Con∣sumption
of the Lungs is cold Particles of Air, con∣stipating the Pores of the Body, whereby the Serum which ought to expedite the Motion, and tempe∣rate the Heat of the Blood is separated from it, and thrown upon the Glands of the Larynx, and the spongy substance of the Lungs themselves: For as the Lympha furthers the Motion of the Chyle, so the Serum accelerates the Circulation of the Blood,
being carryed about with it through the smallest Ca∣pillary Vessels and remo∣test parts of the Body, least it should be inflamed with a burning Heat, or stag∣nate by excessive thickness; during which circular moti∣on they are both called by the same common Name, but when some Portion of Serum is separated from the mass of blood, and retreats to some one or more of the Emunctorys, accord∣ing to their various Dispo∣sitions,
it derives a Name from those particular Parts on which it seizeth, as when it distils upon the Eyes, we call it Opthalmia, when upon the Nose Co∣ryza, and when upon the Thorax it goes by the pro∣per Name of a Catarrh. Now for as much as there is nothing makes a Separation of the blood more commonly than the want of usual Transpira∣tion, so nothing more con∣duceth to the Preservation
of Health, than that the Pores of the Body should continually let forth the hot Steams and Vapours that arise from the Ebulli∣tion of the blood; but when after taking Cold the Skin and Habit of the bo∣dy are on a suddain stop∣ped up, that the sulphure∣ous and waterish Excre∣ments of the blood cannot pass through the Pores, they are again resorbed in∣to the Mass of Blood, from whence proceeds a Feaver∣ish
Disposition; and un∣less they are carryed off by Stool, or precipitated by the Kidneys, are some∣times translated to the Glandulous Parts of the Lungs, where by Degrees contracting more and more Heat and Sharpness they inflame and exulcerate these tender parts. Nevertheless though a Consumption of the Lungs is sometimes thus caused by taking Cold, yet this comes to pass but seldom, unless
in such Bodys whose mass of blood being rendered Cachectick, through fre∣quent Influxes of dispirit∣ed Chyle, is predisposed to receive, and unable to free it self from this New In∣flux of Catarrhous rheum: For suppose two Persons in like manner deprived of the benefit of usual Tran∣spiration, by some great Cold, which though trou∣blesome in the beginning, because of a violent and continual Distillation of
Extravasated Serum upon the Glandulous Coat of the Wind-pipe, and other adjacent Glands, yet in the one of these it survives not the accidental Feaverish Disposition of the Blood, occasioned by the stop∣page of the Pores: For as soon as the Ferment ceas∣eth, the separated humours, partly for want of a new Influx of Serum, and part∣ly by the Natural Heat of these parts, are concocted in∣to a thick sort of Phlegm,
and coughed up; after the Expectoration of which se∣parated Serum the Glandu∣lous parts presently reco∣ver their Natural Tone, without any Remains of a Tumour, Cough, Short∣ness of Breath, or other In∣convenience; but in the other this Feaverish Fer∣ment, occasioned by taking Cold, is not transitory, but so Habitually fixed by means of some previous In∣disposition, as to increase the Effervescence and col∣liquation
of the Blood and Spirits; from whence all the Glands which are seat∣ed in the upper part of the Larynx, as also the Glan∣dulous Coat of the Wind-pipe it self are overflown with a Deluge of hot di∣stempered Humours, the substance of the Lungs di∣stended with hard Tu∣mours, the Branches of the Wind-pipe comprest, and the Wind-pipe it self from these Swellings irritated to Cough, by a continual
tickling, which promotes a frequent spewing out of hot sharp Humours all along the Aspera Arteria, till at length these Tuber∣cles growing very large, begin to inflame and sup∣purate; immediately upon the breaking or open∣ing of those Apostemes, sometimes such a flood of corrupted Matter is pour∣ed out of their Baggs or Cavitys, into the Branches of the Trachea, as compleat∣ly suffocates and choaks
the Patient; but at other times this Purulent Mat∣ter, mixt with streaks of Blood, and some thin Phlegm that is continual∣ly discharged from the Glandulous Coat of the Wind-pipe, is coughed up by degrees, and then this de∣plorable Case requires Spe∣cifick Medicines, to cleanse and heal these Ulcers. Such kind of Consump∣tions whose Original is store of malignant acrimo∣nious Humours, which are
most apt to inflame and putrifie, may be termed Acute, when compared to others that proceed from Humours more mild and benign. There may be likewise some difference made by omitting Bleed∣ing, and committing some egregious Errors in Dyet, Exercise, Passions of the Mind, or any other of the Non-Naturals: However, all Consumptions of the Lungs ought to be reckon∣ed in the number of Chro∣nical
Distempers, because they are contracted and augmented by degrees, and no other way to be reme∣died; yet this doth not prove them incurable in their own Nature, for Reason and Experience both teach the contrary: And indeed I must confess, it was from the marvelous Success of these Remedies that I first imbibed this Notion, viz. Ulcers of the Lungs are in themselves curable. Sometimes a Fea∣ver
or other Acute Di∣stemper may be jugulated, when either Nature or Art carrys off the Morbifick Matter by a suddain Crisis or plentiful Evacuation, but all hopes of dispatch∣ing a confirmed Consump∣tion of the Lungs instant∣ly are groundless seeing many inveterate Obstructi∣ons must be removed, a∣bundance of tough gluti∣nous Humous attenuated and evacuated, the whole Mass of Blood and Spirits
rectified, the Habit of the Body meliorated, and the Tone of Several parts re∣covered, before we can eradicate this fixed Di∣stemper. What will be the Issue and Result of this Con∣sumptive Disease, may ra∣tionally be prognosticated from its several Stages or Degrees: For when the Mass of Blood by a con∣tinual Influx of sowre di∣spirited Chyle is reduced to a sharp and Hectical
state, and the Serum which is separated from this cor∣rupted Blood only stuffs the Bladders and Glandules which are dispersed through the body of the Lungs, this Distemper may be said to be in its Infancy or beginning, (and if sove∣raign Remedies were then presented, they might ob∣tain an easie Conquest) but the increase is attended with a greater Distention of the Glands and Bladders, as also an Inflammation of
these Tubercles tending to suppuration: For when the Animal Spirits which are necessary to the Natu∣ral Fermentation of the Blood are vitiated with un∣wholesome Particles of a Foggy and thick Air, and the Humour which for a long time hath been con∣tained in the Baggs or Ca∣vitys of the Lungs is over∣heated by some extraordi∣nary Ebullition or Fer∣mentation of the Blood, with a total suppression of
Expectoration, the Cough becomes more violent, the Feaver inflammatory, and all parts more tabid. In its further progress or state all Symptoms advance a∣pace towards their Extre∣mity, Suppuration now succeeds the Inflammation of these Tubercles, for that the Purulent Matter is ei∣ther breeding or already made, the Inflammatory Hectick is changed into a putrid Intermitting Feaver, attended with an Universal
Colliquation of the Nutri∣tious Juices and plentiful Separation of them from the Mass of Blood by all ways of Evacuation that Nature affords; whence the Patients strength sud∣dainly decays, and in a short time he is reduced to the highest state of a Ma∣rasmus, with an Hippocratick Face. Thus having demon∣strated to the meanest Ca∣pacity the greatness of this prevailing Evil, with its
efficient and material Cau∣ses, Reason it self presently suggests nothing less than great and noble Medicines can tame a Distemper so formidable. It is no less obvious to the Understand∣ing of every one that pro∣fesseth any thing of Phy∣sick, that the sooner the Cure is begun the better, the more moderate the Patient is in the use of the six Non-Naturals, the more likely to succeed; the Spring time is the best Season,
Universals are to be premi∣sed, Extraordinary Symp∣toms and Circumstances peculiarly attended, and such like things must run through the whole Course of Practise. No doubt but the Cha∣libeate Mineral Waters when impregnated with the Volatile Salts and Spirits of a serene Air, pleasant Society, delightful Recre∣ations, Morning and Even∣ing Walks, regular Dyet, Freedom from Business,
vexatious Thoughts, and the rest may be serviceable: But if the Jesuit were sen∣tenced to perpetual Exile, I think the Consumptive have no reason excessively to lament, for I can tell them who hath a Febri∣fuge Antihectical, without a Grain of the Jesuit, more excellent far than the Peru∣vian Bark, because it makes a safe, not a treacherous Peace, and can give a Rea∣son of its working so stu∣pendiously, though they
that know not how a thing can be done, think it im∣possible to be done. For my part, I do not believe any Medicine can work a Cure in the way of a Charm, yet they that either know or use no other (at least for the most part) than ordinary Me∣dicines, cannot conceive how such wonderful Effects can be wrought, unless by Enchantment. The common Method of Cure is by Phlebotomy,
or Opening a Vein, to abate the Effervescence or Colliquation of the Blood, and prevent the Tumour and Inflammation of the Lungs, by Vomits to re∣lieve the Stomach opprest with store of ill Humours, and remove divers Ob∣structions of several Bow∣els and small Vessels, by Stomach-Purges gently to carry down the peccant Humours; and lastly by Diureticks and Diapho∣reticks with some mixture
of an Opiate, plentifully to carry off the Colliqua∣ted Serum by Urine, or the Pores of the Skin, without raising a fresh Catarrh by a new Commotion of the Blood. After a due Ad∣ministration of these uni∣versal Evacuations, (which in their respective seasons are highly necessary) the frequent Use of Pectoral Apozems and Pulmonary Linctusses is next enjoin∣ed, to retund the Acrimo∣ny of the Humours that
Ouze out by the Wind-pipe, by their mucilaginous and incrassating quality, and so mitigate the trou∣blesome Cough. How far serviceable to this end and purpose the neatest Forms of such Dispensations that I ever yet saw may be, Ile not dispute, only this I must take leave to say, be∣cause to me (as also to the unprejudiced I humbly conceive) it seems evident, that such fulsome Ingredi∣ents of which they are
compounded, are more apt to spoil a weak than reco∣ver a lost Stomach, and consequently not the fittest Medicines Consumptive Persons may have recourse unto: For how ma∣ny by woful Experience have found the constant and frequent use of such Antistomachicks lead them from one Degree of this Malady to another, 'till their decaying Appetite hath been quite over∣thrown, (and consequent∣ly
their Hectick Heat in∣flamed) their Bodys so emaciated, as to render them uncapable of necessa∣ry Evacuations, and they themselves at last given over to a Milk Dyet, Asses Milk, some Chalibeate Mi∣neral Waters, or such like Liquids, to which the poor distressed Stomach Ecchos aloud, Miserable Comfort∣ers all! If therefore I can, as I have Reason to believe, with Medicines less offen∣sive in Quantity, and more
useful in Quality, restore the lost Appetite, and do the same, if not greater Service towards the Con∣cocting and Expectorating that load of separated Se∣rum with which the Pipes of the Lungs are stuffed, (which will easily be per∣ceived by the Patient in a few Weeks, with due Care and Management) I think I have gained a great Point, for as much as the Recovery of the Stomach may reasonably
be looked upon as an Ear∣nest of the Cure. The Medicines I do here recommend to my Countrey-men as Speci∣ficks in the Cure of Con∣sumptions of the Lungs, arising from the fore-men∣tioned Causes, have a pe∣culiar Faculty of warming, comforting and strengthen∣ing weak Stomachs, attenu∣ating and gently carrying off that load of Tartareous Matter which is lodged in their rugous Coat, depra∣ving
both Appetite and Digestion. In their Pas∣sage through the whole circumference of the Guts, they likewise dissolve that crusted Slime and Filth which hinders the Pressure of the Chyle into the Mil∣ky Vessels by the Peristal∣tick motion of their Spiral Fibres: Thus having re∣moved these Fundamental Obstructions, they hasten together with the Chylous Mixture, which by this time is somewhat Invigora∣ted
towards the Relief of the Sanguineous Mass, pre∣sently upon their Conjun∣ction the Blood revives, and by degrees becomes brisk and vigorous, able to cope with, and give some check to the preter∣natural Hectick Heat, stop the Influx of Rheum into the Glandulous Substance of the Lungs, concoct that which is already collected, and release the Animal Spi∣rits, intangled with a vi∣tious disposition of the
Nervous Juice. Having gained these Advantages, things begin to look with another manner of Aspect, the Habit of the Body grows firmer, the Mind chearfuller, the Counte∣nance fresh and brisk, the Emaciated Parts gather Flesh and Strength, the Lungs and Glands of the Larynx recover their na∣tural Tone, and the whole Constitution improves to∣wards a State of Health. Moreover, These Antiph∣thisicks
are really impreg∣nated with such Volatile Spirits and Salts, that like unto Lightning they pe∣netrate the remotest Cor∣ners of the Body, exter∣minating the very Seeds and Roots of this grievous Disease, powerfully and effectually, yet pleasantly and securely, if plentifully taken in the manner of a Dyet: For thus in time they chear up the drooping Animal Spirits, fortifie the System of the Nerves, and
so influence the whole San∣guineous Mass, as that the Blood it self becomes the most precious of all Na∣tural Balsoms, marvellously cleansing the putrid Ulcers of the Lungs, and finally reducing them to a perfect Cicatrix. Wherefore let none be deceived by the flattering Nature of this Distemper in the beginning, nor give themselves over for lost in the highest state, because these reviving Cordials are
calculated for the weakest Constitutions, seeing at the same time they offend the Diseased Matter with the one hand; they support Nature from sinking under any Evacuations with the other. It is therefore my Advice to the Consump∣tive, or consumptively in∣clined, and their Interest (by way of Prevention) to acquaint themselves in time with these Soveraign Antidotes. Better Coun∣sel I cannot give to the
best of my Friends, if they are desirous to save them∣selves a great deal of Pain and Misery, as well as Charges, and render their Lives comfortable to them∣selves and serviceable to others. The Warmness of these Medicines, which is the on∣ly Objection that ever I met with in the use of them, is so far from being a real Discouragement, as that upon serious and ju∣dicious Considerations it
becomes a Notable Ar∣gument to enforce the ta∣king of them, for other∣wise they would be too weak to engage the Origi∣nal Cause of Hectick, burn∣ing and Putrid Feavers; whereas by this active Principle of Heat, they work so effectually upon the whole mass of Chyle, as to separate the sharp and dispirited from the Nutritious Particles there∣of, thoroughly insinuate themselves into all the
Avenues of the Adversary, cut and divide the tough viscous Humours that di∣stemper the Veins, Arteries and Nerves, destroy the Acidity of the Nervous Juice, recover the Natu∣ral Temper of the Animal Spirits, sweeten the mass of Blood, by separating the Impurities thereof by the Cutaneous Glands, gently forcing a Transpi∣ration of the Feaverish Particles of the whole, and so banish that Preternatu∣ral
Heat which is Proof to all common Remedies. And that Diseases which carry in their outward appearance a shew of pre∣ternatural Heat are thus to be treated with warm Medicines, is indeed ob∣servable to every discerning Eye: For the most malig∣nant Feavers are attackt and conquered by the briskest and warmest Alexi∣pharmacks and the most vi∣olent Erysipelas, or St. An∣thony's Fire, is discussed and
breathed out by strong and Spirituous Fomentations, but are both of them ex∣asperated by refrigerating or cooling Medicines, and their preternatural Heat more and more increased, till the one at length ter∣minates in the cold sweats of Death, and the other in a compleat Mortification. To multiply Instances of this kind is remote from my intended brevity, there∣fore take this remarkable one for all: The Wife
of Mr. Fowles, who be∣longs to the Mint in the Tower of London, in the beginning of November, 1695. sent for me to open a Vein; after a lamentable Complaint that she was nothing the better, but the worse for all the Phy∣sick she had taken: I took leave, wishing her to Ex∣ercise Patience, and conti∣nue in the use of those things the Dr. had pre∣scribed; though I also told her, if she found no Be∣nefit,
I would do her all the Service I could, if she sent for me: About the middle of January follow∣ing she did send for me again, and told me Dr. H. her Physician, and Mr. W. Apothecary, had given her over, therefore desired some Assistance, according to my Promise: I found her in a very low Condition, under a Hectick Feaver, troublesome Cough, tedi∣ous Asthma, Colliquative Loosness, with a Compli∣cation
of Convulsive and Epileptick Fits, (of which she had sometimes to the Number of Eighteen or Twenty in a day) Total Deprivation of Appetite, having for some Months together received no other sustenance from Food, than what a Glass of Sack with a Toast afforded, whereby all the Parts of her Body were wasted and consumed to the highest degree of a Maras∣mus that ever I saw, resemb∣ling a walking Ghost, or a
perfect Skeleton, invested with nothing but Skin. For my part I was not very for∣ward to do any thing, fear∣ing a few days would put a period to her Life; nei∣ther indeed was the Season any ways inviting: How∣ever, the good Opinion she was pleased to entertain of my Endeavours, encourag∣ed me more than I could her, and with the Blessing of God on both Method and Medicines, without any assistance from the Bark or
Mineral Waters, she was quite freed from her Hecti∣cd Heat, her Fits abated almost every day, her Sto∣mach returned, her Bones wire cloathed with Flesh, and her Strength so far re∣cruited, as that she was able to walk several Miles toge∣ther without a Supporter, though she could not ex∣change the unwholsome, foggy, Tower Air, (at this time more than ordinarily polluted with store of nasty black Particles, from the
smoak of Coals) for the fresh clear Country Breez∣es, till the latter end of Summer. Before and since this prosperous Event I have given these Remedies to others, and taken them my self several hundreds of times, and have always found then Operations in offensive, for the most part successful, and sometimes wonderful. FINIS.
