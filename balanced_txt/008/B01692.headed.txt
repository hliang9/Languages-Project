ON THE THUNDER, Happening after the SOLEMNITY OF THE CORONATION OF CHARLES the II. On St. GEORGE'S Day. 1661. Exhilarant ipsos gaudia nostra Deos. Mart. HEavens! we thank you, that you Thundred so! As We did here, you Cannonado'd too. A brave Report! as if you would out-vie Volleys, discharg'd by Charles His Cavalrie. 'Twas still in Clouds and Tempests your voice came! For lesse than That could not have spoke His Name. Thus mighty Jove, Co-partner in Our Joy, Out-sounded, what we cri'd, Vive le Roy! A sacred kind of Rival-ship! for here, VVe gladly Feign, what They are Doing there. 'Tis a bold Challenge (but I'le make it good) VVhether our Flames were lesser than their Flood? As if St. George's Bon-fires would have done More, than They could, by Inundation. Avaunt Philosophy! we plainly prove, The World must burn, but—'Tis with Charls his love. Well! let us think upon't! who ere did view The Sun in's Glory, but 'twas cloudy too? Great Lights Eclipse the Lesse: Nor were you made To shine so clear, as not t' admit a shade. You are Our Light, Our Comfort, and Our Hope; Every good Subject is, your Heliotrope. Two Suns, at once, within our Horizon! VVhilst we dispute, which was the fairer One! A Pretty Emulation! Both did strive VVho should receive most beams, who most should Give: 'Till th' upper-Lamp shrunk in his uselesse Ray, And left, the Conquering Charles, to rule the Day. 'Twas his Discretion, for had Both shone Bright, Heat had surpass'd the Comfort of the Light; Then did he weep for joy, — A lovely weather! It Rain'd as Heaven and Earth would come together: And yet — these April-tears, would have us know, They griev'd above, at Male-Contents below. To see, that Heaven, should design a Court For Us, like Their's, & some — not Thank them for't. Hen. Bold, olim e N. C. Oxon,
