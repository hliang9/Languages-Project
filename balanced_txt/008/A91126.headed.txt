THE PROTESTATION OF THE ARCHBISHOPS AND BISHOPS OF IRELAND Against the Toleration of Popery agreed upon, and subscribed by them at DUBLIN, the 26 of NOVEMBER. London, Printed, 1641.
The Protestation of the Arch∣bishops and Bishops of IRELAND, against the toleration of POPERIE, agreed upon, and subscribed by them at DUBLIN the 26 of Novemb. in the yeare of our Lord 1626. THe Religion of the Papists is Su∣perstitious and Idolatrous, their faith and Doctrine erroneous and Hereticall; Their Church, in re∣spect of both, Apostaticall. To give them therefore a Toleration, or to consent that they may freely exercise their Religion, and confesse their Faith and Doctrine, is a grievous sinne: and that in two respects. First, It is to make our selves accessarie, not onely to their Superstitions, Idolatries, Heresies, and in a word, to all the abominations of Poperie; but also (which is a consequence of the former) to the Perdition of the seduced people, which perish in the deluge of their Catholique Apostasie. Secondly, To grant them a Tolleration in respect of
any mony to be given, or contribution to be made by them, is to set Religon to sale, and withall, the soules of the people, whom Christ our Saviour hath redeemed with his most pretious blood. And as it is a great Sinne, so it is a matter of most dangerous consequence, the consideration where∣of wee leave to the wise and judicious: beseeching the jealous God of truth to make all those who are in Authority zealous of Gods glory, and the advancement of true Religion, and resolute and couragious against all Popery, Superstition and Idolatry. FINIS.
