THE FOURE WISHES OF Mr. JOHN HUMPHREY, In Conclusion of his SERMONS Printed 1653. Intituled An Humble ADMISSION UNTO The LORD'S SUPPER, &c. I. I Wish we had a Government established in the Church, the neerest in Chri∣stian Prudence that may be to the Word of God. II. I Wish the Duty of Fraternall Correption, a watching over, and admonish∣ing one another in Love, were better known and Practised amongst us. III. I Wish, that men would look more into their own Consciences, and leave the judging of other Spirits, Hearts and Reins alone to the judgement Seat of Christ. IIII. I Wish, though there may be some judgeing by the Fruits, that Wise Religi∣ous men would be more cautious of countenancing these Separations in the Visible Church, seeing upon the same ground that you goe to gather a Church out of my mixt Congregation; another will gather a Separation out of your Church, and so continue (as I have intimated from our sad experience) an end∣less Separating untill this first Separation shall in a few years be able to take up the saying of that Greatest Grandmother, unto those many Schismes she shall see issuing, as her naturall Off-spring out of her owne Bowells: Rise up daugh∣ter, go to thy Daughter, for thy Daughters Daughter hath a Daughter: for this Seperati∣ons Separation, hath a Separation. FINIS.
