TO ALL NATIONS, KINDREDS, LANGUAGES, TONGUES, and PEOPLE, WITH YOUR PRINCES and RULERS▪ And all People from the Highest to the Lowest. This to you is the Word of the Lord God. FEar God and give glory to him, for the hour of his Judgements is come, and his dreadful terrible Day will come speedily upon all Nations and People; therefore worship him that made Heaven and Earth, and the Sea, and the Fountains of Water, and them up∣holds by the Word of his Power; let his fear and dread be upon you all: People, see what acquaintance and union you have with him; he is a God that will not be mocked, who is now coming in his pure dreadful Majesty, and glo∣rious Almighty Power, to break down and dash in pieces like a Potters Vessel all people from the highest to the lowest, from the Prince on the Throne, to the Beggar on the Dunghil, in and amongst all Nations, Kindreds, Languages, Tongues, and People, who put the Day of the Lord God afar off, and live without the knowledge of the onely true God in this world, serving an unknown God in the ignorance of your minds, and in Traditions; worshipping you know not what, and walking every one in your own wayes, doing your own works, which leads to satisfie the flesh in the lusts thereof: All which is abomination to the onely true and ever living God, to whom you must give an account for every idle word, and all your deeds done in the body. All people upon the face of the Earth, let the time past be sufficient you have lived without the knowledge of the onely true God; in this day the living God visits you with a day of Visitation of mercy, to declare his Counsel to you, that ou may come to the knowledge of him; be warned to de∣part from the evil of your wayes, and hearken diligently to the Counsel of the onely true God, who waits upon you to be gracious unto you, whose grace hath appeared unto all men, which is the Light Christ Jesus the Son of God hath ighted you with, that discovereth unto you the secret evil of your hearts and consciences; in the fear of the living God, search your hearts with the Light, which is the Counsel of God, that convinceth you in your hearts and Consciences, that Lying is a sin, Swearing is a sin, Covetousness a sin, Pride a sin, Drunkenness a sin, and Gluttony a sin, Whoredom and Uncleanness a sin, Cozening, Cheating, and Dissimulations sins, Tyranny, Cruelty, and Oppression, and Murther are sins; which fore-mentioned, cryes to the God of Heaven for Ven∣geance, which if you do not walk in obedience to the Grace of God, the Light, which discovereth them, to guide you out of them: As the Lord God destroyed the old world, who received not his Counsel, so will the Lord God of Hea∣ven and Earth break in upon all you people, scattered in all Nations, Kindreds, Tongues and Languages; for his eternal Decree is gone over you all who walk in your wicked wayes, he will break you down and dash you to pieces, and you shall become an abhorring to all flesh: Therefore prize your time while God preserves you, for the Day of your Visitation is come, wherein the God of Heaven visits you, and exhorts you in the Power of his Spirit to return to him, which if you diligently hearken to his Counsel the Light, which sheweth you your evil wayes, and convinceth you of your sins as be∣fore written, and wait on him in the Light to lead you out of all Idolatry, and every sinful and evil way; then will the on∣ly true God give you power over your sinful and unclean na∣ture, and he will teach you his Wayes and lead you in the Paths of Righteousness, and save you out of all your Idola∣trous wayes you have walked in, and will establish you in e∣ternal Rest and Peace, with all his Children that walk in obe∣dience to his Counsel the Light, which convinceth of sin in the secrets of your hearts and consciences, in which Light he is gathering of his People out of all Nations, Kindreds, Lan∣guages, and Tongues, and People, into his own Kingdom, in the Light with him to walk, who is now establishing his Kingdom in the Earth, which Kingdom shall break down all other King∣doms, and their Dominion take away, and destroy to the end. Then shall the Kingdom of the everliving God be known in the Earth to destroy the Image, (that will not submit to him,) and to establish all those that walk in the Light, in his everlasting Kingdom to dwell, and there to praise his Name alone, who is worthy over all, God blessed for ever. HEAR and FEAR all Nations, Kindreds, Tongues, Languages, and People, REPENT and TURN to the onely true God, in hearkning diligently to his Counsel the Light, that convinceth of sin in the secrets of your hearts and consciences, that ye be not cut off in the dreadful terri∣ble Day of the fierce wrath of the everliving God, wherein he will destroy all Idolatry out of the Earth, and perform ac∣cording to his Word, here to you declared, and none of you shall escape, which disobey his Counsel the Light, and you shall certainly know the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it, what he will bring upon all Nations. Remember you are warned in your life-time, in this Day of your Visitation, if you slight it, your destruction is of your selves, and your blood is upon your own heads. From the Righteous Seed, of whom it is written, It shall be no more said, the Lord liveth that brought us forth of the Land of Egypt; but the Lord liveth that hath raised up his Seed, and brought it forth of the North-Countrey, Jer. 23. 7, 8. Forth of the Northern Countrey called England, from the Seed of God there risen, that shall spread over all the Nations of the World. W. D. LONDON, Printed for Robert Wilson, at the Sign of the Black-spread-Eagle and Wind-Mill, in Martins Le Grand, 1660.
