¶ A compendious form and summe of Christian doct∣rine, called the Testimonie of a true Faith, meete for well dispo∣sed families, for the more knowledge in God, and better nourishing vp, and confirming of all such, as loue saluation in Iesus Christ. Gathered, corrected, and newly augmented, by Christopher Shutte, Maister of Arte, Seene and allowed. Psal. 34.11. Come ye children, hearken vnto me, I wil teach you the feare of the Lorde. ¶ Imprinted at London by Thomas Dawson, dwelling at the three Cranes in the Vinetree. 1579.
To the right Honora∣ble, and his singuler good Lorde, George, Earle of Cumberland &c. Christopher Shutte wisheth all increase of grace in the holie Ghost, & long conti∣nuance of life in al hap∣pie health and prosperity. AFter that I called to minde (Right Ho∣norable,1. Re. 2.1. Pro. 4.1. 2. Re. 23.1. and my ve∣rie good Lord) the diligent care, and prudent prouision, which Dauid and o∣ther good Princes and rulers of Israel had, for planting true religion in their Families, for their better conuersation and good gouernement, according to the lawe and rule of faith: and had bene also often intreated and earnestly inuited by some, my verie friendes, and suche as loue the saluation of the faithfull, to contract some compendi∣ous and Christian forme of godlie in∣structions
and sweete prayers much re¦quisite in well disposed families, whose godlie demaunde I was not willing to denie,1. Luc. 214. bothe because I see the lacke thereof in manie families, to require so needefull a labour, and also, because I woulde not abridge my duetie to my brethren and felowshippe of the faith∣full, if it were but, with the poore wi∣dowe, to cast two mites into the trea∣surie: And waying also with my selfe, howe manie busie braines are occupi∣ed, to quarrell without a cause with truth it selfe. I thought your honoures Godly Patronage to be a sure asyle, to support and defende against the sting of carping Zoilus, whatsoeuer in godly wise herein I shoulde propound. And therefore I haue boldlie presumed too rest vpon your Honoures hoped pro∣tection, as the chiefest anchore holde I had herein, and take effecte, to the ende my laboures might the better proceede. Whereto (my good Lorde) I was diuerslie incensed. First by your Honoures good liking and procurati∣on of good litterature from time to time whiche, neuer happened to anie
without deserued prayse and iust com∣mendation. Secondly, I was moued by your Honours good acceptation of my stu∣dies in the Lorde, and other good re∣membraunces towardes me, both of youre honour, vnto whome I re∣count my selfe most deepely indebted, and also of my good and most vertu∣ous Ladie, whom the Lorde hath ioy∣ned, as a moste comfortable delight and helpe, vnto your honour. Whose faithfull societie and happie felow∣ship, importeth an euident argument of Gods greate goodnesse towardes you, in blessing you with the felowship of such a one, as few or none excell or goe beyonde in trew godlinesse, hone∣stie, and vertue. To whom for her Ho∣noures good affection to Christian re∣ligion, I recognise my selfe muche bounde with all obedience. Thirdly, I was prouoked herevnto, specially, because such is and ought to bee the zeale and loue of all nobilitie, (whereof your honour is a most tow∣warde Braunche) alwayes with maine and might, to defend the cause of true
Religion to the glorie of God, and sal∣uation of his people, for whiche cause the Lorde hath stirred vp moste noble men and godlie Magistrates, to be as Patrones, and protectoures to the Ambassadoures of his worde, for the better proceeding of religion. So he raysed vp Moses to Aaron, Iosua to Eleazar, Dauid to Nathan, Asa too Azariah, Iehosaphat to Micha, Eze∣chias and others to Esaie and Ieremie, Zerubbabel to Iehoshua, and finally, the Emperoure Constantine to the councel of Nice. All which were right∣lie termed Nobles, for the zeale and loue they had to true religion. And albeit, by sinister and crooked meanes some were ennobled, and so crept in∣to the carefull chaire of worldlie dig∣nitie, yet none were euer rightly and in verie deede accompted noble, but such as vndertooke the patronage and aide of Christian religion, which thing I humblie craue vpon your Honoure. For euen in this wise,Deut. 4.4. Moses doth call the Israelites a pretious and a noble ge¦neration, so long as they obserued the commaundements of the Lord. Vpon
the like condition,Psal. 89. &. 132. the Lord established his mercies with king Dauid his Ser∣uaunt: that the throne of Iuda should not be destitute of one to raigne vpon the same for euer.1. Reg. 2.1. To which thing Da∣uid had respect, when he lay vppon his death bedde, and therevpon councel∣led Salomon his sonne, (to whom the kingdome was promised,) to walke in the way of truth, wherein he had bene brought vp: to the ende he might pro∣sper and haue good successe.Fox Pag 125 To like purpose, Romanus a man of great no∣bilitie, being caried to the place of martirdom for the profession of Chri∣stian religion, (a rare thing in Nobles to beholde) boldely auouched, that his nobilitie rested not so much in the bloude of his Auncestoures, as in the profession of the Christian faith, and other vertues thereto agreeing. And therefore he saide, Non progenitorum sanguis, sed Christianae pietatis professio me nobilem facit, that is, Not the bloud of my progenitoures, but the profes∣sion of Christian religion, maketh me noble and renowned.Rom. 11.17. And in deede if we shoulde with a single eye, looke to
the Prosapie of Adam,Eph. 2.23. and wild oliue tree, out of the which all fleshe was ta∣ken, there woulde be no great cause of triumph to anie, of any thing whiche wee haue of nature:Ro. 6.5. &. 8.15 16. But this is and ought to be manns chiefe nobilitie, that he is graffed in Christe Iesus by faith, adopted to be the child of God, made by faith pertaker of his graces,Theodorit. lib. 5. ca. 17. and felow heire of his kingdome, and this is very nobilitie. Wherewith Saint Ambrose beeing moued, aduertised the Emperour Theodosius (and in him all nobilitie) to consider his nature to bee fraile, least happilie principallitie shoulde blinde him, and make him quite forget himselfe, and his obedi∣ence towardes God. Wherevpon, it may be gathered (right honorable) that not onelie the Poten∣tates of al sortes, ought well to remem∣ber their calling, but specially, to ad∣dresse them selues in all obedience, to serue the Lorde, to foster his churche, to promote and defende his true religion: For therefore are they cal∣led to nobilitie,Psal. 2.11. Isa. 49.23. wherein, I woulde to God it might well please euen all de¦grees
of suche as bee exalted on highe and gouernoures of families, deepely to acknowledge and confesse, that the Lord hath made them Fathers for his trueth, Patrones to mainteine religi∣on, and lightes of godlie life for o∣thers to followe. For, like as the sonne in the firmament,Plato. giueth light to all the regions rounde about him, and by his bright appearing expelleth the darke∣nesse, comforteth and cheereth the worlde: Semblably, shoulde nobili∣tie banish sinne and corrupt religion, and be a lantern of Godlie life to com∣forte and shine to others, that they mighte directe their liues after their good ensamples,Phillip 2.15. as the Apostle wisheth the godlie to bee without rebuke, in the middest of a naughtie and croked generation, among whom they should shine as lightes in the worlde. For as the Philosopher Plato saith, suche as the Heades and Rulers be, such com∣monlie bee the rest of the common multitude.Isocrates Vpon the which considera∣tion the Athenians Oratour Isocrates wisheth all men of nobilitie, to pro∣pose their liues, as a paterne for others,
to follow, knowing, that the manners of a whole towne or countrie doe re∣semble the wayes and dooinges of the higher sorte.Lib. 3. Ca. 1. To the like ende sayeth Enagrius in the ecclesiasticall histories. that the life of a noble man shoulde be an image of vertue, for his subiectes to follow,Contra Dona∣ristas. that they might the sooner bee allured to vertue and godlinesse. Thus Sainte Augustine saieth, that ru∣lers ought to serue GOD, not onelie in liuing godlie and modestlie them∣selues, but also in bringing others to vertue and true Religion. Thus it was saide to Arcadius the Emperour, that godlinesse was sufficient to the sal∣uation of the noble men, without the whiche their Pompe and outwarde strength was nothing woorth. Where∣vppon (my verie good and vertuous Lorde) I may conclude and define with Sozomenus,Sozo. lib. 9. Cap. 1. that godlinesse or loue of true Religion,Lib. 1. Ca. 1. is the greatest honour and renowne of true nobilitie. And therefore as Constantine saide sometimes to Sapors king of Persia,Theodorit. lib. 1. Ca. 25. so say I to all such of high degrees, which feare the Lorde: like as in keeping of
the sacred faith, they are pertakers of the light of truth: so in following the light of truth, as a guide, they at∣taine straight to the sacred faith: which thing may well inkindle in the lo∣uing and zealous hearts of noble men and all others a feruent minde, to the imbracing and spreading abroade of true religion.Niceph. lib. 4. Ca. 34. And euen as Cyprian let no day passe, without the reading of Tertulian: nor Alexander without the reading of Homer: nor finally, Apelles without some line proportio∣ned: so were it meete that no degrees, shoulde lose anie opportunitie or oc∣casion graunted to the meditation of Christian religion: but rather being taught by the example of the Empe∣rour Constantine, woulde repose their whole studie in the word of God And as for other things in the worlde, they are but vanitie and vexation of spirite. For all flesh is grasse,Eccle. 1. Isa. 40.6. and all the glorie of man is as the flowre of the fielde, which standeth beautifull to day, but tomorow is cut downe, dried vp, and withered. And what harme were it then, if some good man would put all
degrees in minde, as the Macedonian did Phillip,1. Iohn. 2.16. and say: remember man, that thou art but mortall, and that no∣thing is in the worlde, but the luste of the flesh,1. Cor. 7.31. 2. Cor. 5.10. the lust of the eyes and pride of life, & that the figure of this worlde vadeth fast away, that wee must also all appeare before the tribunall seate of God, that euerie one may render an accompt for that which he hath do ne in the bodie, be it good or euill. Were it not a meanes, to make euerie one more watchefull in his office? wherein than ought mans delight to be? surely as the Prophete saith: Let not the wise∣man glorie in his wisedome, nor the strong man in his strength,Iere. 9.23. nor the riche man in his riches: but let him that reioyceth, reioyce in this, that he vnderstandeth and knoweth me: For I am the Lorde, whiche shewe mercie, iudgement,Eccle. 11.9.10. &. 12.2. and righteousnesse in the earth, for in these thinges I delight, saith the Lorde. To the like purpose, is the good and wholsome counsel of the Preacher, Reioyce (O young men) saith he, in thy youth, and let thy hearte cheere thee, in the dayes of thy youth,
and walke in the wayes of thine heart, and in the sight of thine eyes, but knowe that for all these thinges, God wil bring thee to iudgement: therefore take away griefe out of thine hearte, and cause euill, to departe from thy fleshe: for childehoode and youth are vanitie. Remember now thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth, whiles the euill dayes come not, nor the yeares approche, wherein thou shalt say, I haue no pleasure in them. O woulde to God that this godlie counsel might preuaile in princelie and noble hear∣tes, and in euerie high and low degree, and especially in heades of housholdes, which best becōmeth their personages: Than woulde they enquire after the Lorde, and make his trueth, their cheife delight, and lay a sure foundati∣on in the way of righteousnesse, than shoulde this bee their ioy and tri∣umph: To knowe the Lorde to be their GOD, and themselues to be his peo∣ple, and to haue the testimonie of a good conscience. Than shoulde they make answeare to their obedience rightlie to the woorde of GOD,2. Cor. 12. than
shoulde they doe the dueties of faith∣full and loyall subiectes, and satisfie her Maiesties desire. Finally, than woulde they tender the state of Churche and common weale, and shew themselues carefull for the saluation of Israel. And because there is no good be∣ginning for the accomplishing of these things, but in the wisedome, feare, and knowledge of the Lorde, the seede whereof is sowen in your honoures heart, to my great comforte and hap∣pie hope of helpe, that your honoure will set forwarde and mainteine the trueth of Iesus Christ in this poore countrie, and Labirinth of ignorance & sinne, I here most humbly commend vnto your honoures godlie zeale, a shorte forme of Christian Religion, and godlie gouernement, most meete in wel disposed families to be obserued. Wherein is to be scene the summe of Christian doctrine, faith, and godlie prayers, most meete for this our pre∣sent estate: beseeching your good Ho∣noure, in lieu of better, to accept the same in good parte, at my willing handes, recognising my selfe muche
bounden vnto your Honour, with all obedience for euer. And therefore knowing the knowledge of true Reli∣gion, to be the delight and comforte of the godlie,Psla. 119.24.105. Ro. 10.8. Isa. 11.4. Iohn. 1027. 2. Cor. 2.16 the light vnto theyr pathes, the doctrine of faith vnto sal∣uation, the scepter and protection of Gods kingdome, the marke and badge of Gods Elect, and sauour vnto life, I here do present, the summe therof vnto your Lordship, in token of a thankefull remembraunce of youre Honoures courtesie towardes me, and in hope of fauourable acceptation thereof, Wish∣ing no lesse vnto your Lordeship, then increase of all heauenlie graces and perfect happinesse tho∣row the mediation of the Lord Iesus: in whom I bid your Honour most hartely fare well. Your good Honoures most humble to commaund C. Shutte.
The Testimonie of a trew faith, containing short questions very necessarie to all Families for the more knowledge of God, and better bringing vp of children in his faith and feare. 1. Question. FOrsomuch as our Sauiour Christ in the Gospel admo∣nisheth his electe,Matth. 6.33. first to seeke the kingdome of God and the righteous∣nes therof, and thereto adioyneth the promise of other, blessings to ensewe: I would gladly vnderstand, howe the same might be perfourmed, which hee requireth so necessarily. Answeare. There is no way so expedient to the atteyning of Gods heauenly graces, as to lay a good foundation of trewe religi∣on in the feare of God. Forasmuch asDeut. 28. toto Psal. 1.2.3.13..15.22. obedience to the Lawe of God, is
he readiest & onely way, to the fountaine of all perfect happinesse. And for this causeDeut. 6.6. 2. Sam. 6.11 Reg. 2.3. Act. 4.23. Luke. 19.9. the godly men of all ages, proui∣ded alwaies from time to time, that they might nourish trew religion in their Fa∣milies, to the end, both they and theirs might be instructed better in the Lawe of God, and haue good successe in those thinges which they went about. 2. Question. Doest thou than thinke, that those housholdes are disordered, and not rightly ruled, where there is no dayly meditation of religion kept? Answeare. Such Families may rather be accoun∣ted a sincke of sinne, where the people are carefull of worldy profits and vaine de∣light, & careles of the woord of God, and trewe religion.1. Sam. 2.25. And therefore they are∣in this case often times nearer to de∣struction. 3. Question. How doest thou order and gouern thy house in Christian religion. Answeare. Deu. 6.6As Moses commaunded the people of Israell, to teach their children the
Lawe of the Lord, that in all their af∣faires they might haue an eye vnto the same: so am I carefull, that my whole Familie feare God and know his woord by some dayly exercise, and meditation thereof. So as1. Pet. 3.15. they may be the better able to render a reason of their faith.Act. 4.23. They pray and geue thankes together in all their doinges.Tit. 2.12. They liue godlily, soberly and righteously.Luke. 19.9 They make re∣stitution, to whom they haue done wrong. And finally whatsoeuer they doo, they doo all to the glory of God,Ios. 1.8. and so they prosper, to God be praise therfore. 4. Question. Well than I pray thee shewe me the summe of that religion, which thou doest keepe in thy Familie? For it is the duetie of a true Christian, alwayes to be ready1. Pet. 3.15. to render an account of his faith, to the ende it may appeare, that he is notMat. 10.32. Rom. 10.10. ashamed of Christ and his doctrine. Let me therefore heare what thou canst say of the principall points of Christian Religion. Answeare. There be three speciall partes there∣of, the first isIohn. 17.3. 2. Cor. 13.5. to knowe God and my
elfe: the second is,Ioh. 5.24. the meanes where∣by my saluation is wrought: the third,Mat. 6.9. and 26.26. what helpes God doeth further me withall vnto life euerlasting. 5. Question. What saiest thou of the knowledge of God? Answeare. The same is of two sortes: the one is vniuersall, and knowenRom. 1.19. Psal. 19.1. by the creati∣on of heauen and earth, wherein God of∣fereth himselfe to be seene and knowen of me, as the onely fountaine of all good∣nesse, who aloneDeut. 6.13. ought to be worship∣ped. For hisGen. 1.1. Act. 17.24. eternitie appeareth in the making of the world: hisPsal. 36. goodnesse in preseruing the same: hisPsal. 107. Act. 17.28. Psal. 115.3. prouidence in the tokens which are seene and felt, wherby what pleaseth his godly will commeth to passe, and not by blinde for∣tune: hisPsal. 104.24 wisedome in ordering of the thinges created: hisRom. 2.7.8.9.10. righteousnesse in deliuering the godly, and punishing the wicked: hisEzec. 18.32 mercy in patiently for∣bearing sinners, and calling them to re∣pentance. So that what may be knowen of God, is manifest in the thinges crea∣ted, which vniuersall knowledge taketh
awayRom. 1.20. all excuse from the vngodly, which woorship not God aright: but to me, it is aPsal. 19.1. ready way to bring me to the true worship of God. The other knowledge is speciall, and onely properIoh. 17.3. Iere. 31.34. to the elect, whereby, tho∣row faith poured into my hart by the ho∣ly Ghost, I am assured that my saluation is wrought by Christ the sonne of God: by whomRom. 8.16. I am made the childe of God thorow grace, and heyre with Christ of his kingdome: which knowledge onely commeth ofLuke. 10.21 grace, and so is geuen to me, but it is restrained from the wicked, because of theirMath. 13.14 sinne and hardenesse of hart. 6. Question. What sayest thou of the knowledge of thy selfe? Answeare. By creation I was made in Adam, according to theGene. 2.27. Image of GOD (I meane not any bodily shape, for God is aIohn. 4.24. spirit, and without body) in true righ∣teousnesse and holynesse,Ephe. 4.24. that is to say, in al perfection and happinesse of nature, both in right iudgement, reason, will and strength. In which happy state, if Adam
had continued, both I and all his posteri∣tie had bene blessed for euer. 7. Question. Howe didest thou fall from this grace. Answeare. My fall appeareth, in thatGene. 3. toto. Adam who had this blessing for me, thorow the intisement of the Serpent brake the com∣maundement of God, in eating of the for∣bidden fruite, and by the same depriued himselfe of his former happinesse, and brought sinne, death, hell, the wrath of God, and all kinde of miseries into the world,Rom. 5.12. as iust punishmentes for his de∣sertes. In which his sinfull act, his pride, disobedience, lacke of faith, vn∣thankefulnesse to his creatour, and light credite to the Deuill appeared. In which offence, both I and al his ofspringe are wrapped, in as much as in him wee all haue sinned, for he had the blessing ge∣uen to keepe or loose for him and his. Wherefore I and all others descending of him, by him, & in him, haue fallen from grace, and are infected with his corrup∣tions,Psal. 51.5. conceyued in sinne, borne in ini∣quitie, andEphes. 2.3. by nature the children of
wrath,Rom. 3.10. and vtterly vndone, without the grace and mercy of God. 8. Question. What is mannes free will, his pow∣er, strength, wisedome, and such lyke vertues lost by this his fall in Adam, all which he had in the beginning? Answeare. Concerning mans will, before his fall the same was free, but afterward not so,Iohn. 8.36. but as the same is freed by grace. ForPsal. 14.2.3 his iudgement is vnperfect and often deceiued, his will in many thinges hin∣dred, and his strength decayed,Iohn. 3.5. & 15.4. 2. Cor. 3.5. Phillip. 1.6. &. 2.13. that of himselfe, he cannot perceiue the thinges which belong to the kingdome of God. So that as now to will aright is the gift of grace, so, to wil & chose amisse, is the lacke of grace: And yet this will of man not regenerate, in some respect may be termed free, becauseEccle. 13.9. a man doeth euill by his owne consent, and not by compul∣sion. And as for other his vertues and good giftes, which he had before his fall, lyke as in a ruinous house, there remaine certaines reliques of an house, although nothing comparable to their former ex∣cellencie: so after Adams fall, man not
egenerateIsa. 29.4. 1. Cor. 1.19. Ro. 8.7. &. 10.3. hath a certeine kinde of wisedome, carnall knowledge, shewe of religion and holines, and yet the same so imperfect, both by his naturall corrupti∣on, & by the tyrannie of the Deuill, thatIohn. 3.5. till hee bee regenerate and sanctified with grace from aboue, he can not please God. 9. Question. Howe art thou restored to grace a∣gaine? Answeare. My restauration commeth thoroweTit. 3.5. Ephe. 2.4. the free mercy and fauour of God, who after this my fall in Adam, raysed both him and me vp againe with the comfor∣tableGenes. 3.15 &. 12.2. &. 22 18. promise of a Sauiour, who by hisRom. 3.25. Col. 1.22. 2. Cor. 5.21. death should pacifie the wrath of God, and bring me into his fauour a∣gaine:Rom. 5.19 by whose obedience I am made righteous: which my regeneration com∣meth thus to me, whilestMatth. 3.2. Luke. 24.47. by the prea∣ching of the Lawe, I am brought to the feeeling of my sinnes, and raysed vp with the comfortable promises of the Gospel,Act. 15.9. 1. Cor. 3.16. receyued by faith. My harte is light∣ned, purified, and gouerned by the holy Ghost:Ephe. 4.24 my will and minde reformed, & the Image of God renued againe in me.
10. Question, Why did God regenerate thee, and not raither get him selfe glory, by con∣demning thee according to thy sinnes. Answeare. Although the LordeRom. 3.10. & 9. toto. Deut. 7.8. Ezech. 36.22. Ioh. 15.16. Ephe. 2.4. 2. Tit. 1.9. Tit. 3.5 might iustly haue condemned all Adams posteritie, by reason of their sinnes, yet notwith∣standing some of them according to his iust iudgementes, he leaueth in their owne corruption, deuoid of all grace, and Vessels of his wrath vnto damnation: O∣thersome he embraceth in his great loue vnto saluation, whome hee accepteth in mercy wtout any deserts of their own. Of which number, my conscience dooth per∣swade me that I am one. And therefore he hath regenerate me,Eph. 14.5. 1. Pet. 1.3. Iohn. 3.16. Rom. 8.29.30. first to declare his great loue, mercy & euerlasting kind∣nes towardes me, whom he chose in his sonne Christ to saluation. And therefore in an happie tyme, he hath called me by the preaching of his woord, and iustified me by my onely faith in Christes death:Matth. 5.16. Rom. 6. toto. Ephes. 2.10. 2. Pet. 1.10. Secondly, that I being thus borne a∣newe, may bring foorth the fruites of righteousnes to glorifie him withall.1 Pet. 1.3.4. Act. 26.18. Rom. 6.22. Thirdly, that all the end of my regenera∣tion
is life euerlasting: so at the Lordes good time, I may receiue the same a∣mong his Saintes. 11. Question. Shew me what be the meanes, wher∣by thy saluation is wrought? Answeare. The ordinarie meanes commonly are two, that is to say,Luk. 24.47. Rom. 10.17. the woorde of God, and faith. 12. Question. What is the woorde of God? Answeare. It is those Canonicall scriptures2. Tim. 3.16 2. Pet. 1.21. written by the spirite of God, & commen∣ded to man both in the olde and newe Testament, wherein are conteinedDeut. 4.2. & 12.32. Galat. 1.8. Luke. 16.29. all thinges necessarie to our saluation, accor∣ding to the which, the Lord will haue all his religion measured, without either adding or diminishing. 13 Question. How canst thou knowe the true re∣ligion, in so many sundrie opinions of the same, as be in the worlde? Answeare. Act. 17.11.First, I trie the religion taught me by the woorde of God, and by his spirite
geuen me to vnderstande the same.Iohn. 5.39. Se¦condly,1. Iohn. 4.1.2. I knowe this spirite to be a right spirit, because it confesseth Christ to be come in the fleshe, that is to say, as∣cribeth the whole worke of my saluation to him, and to no other thing. Thirdly,Rom. 3.31. I expounde one place of Scripture, as it is not contrarie to another. And thus I trie the truth,Iohn. 12.48. making the worde of GOD to iudge and determine what I ought to followe. 14. Question. What is the cause why the word of God is preached to many, and yet ta∣keth place but in few? Answeare. The causes are manie,Ro. 10.16. & 11.7. first manns owne disobedience and contempt of the worde, through want of faith, 2. Cor. 4.4.Secondly, the malice of Sathan, who blindeth and hardeneth the hearts of the vnfaithfull, that they shoulde not see and beleeue the truth. 2 Thes. 2.11. Rom. 1.14. Apoc. 13.8. &. 14.9.Thirdly, the iust iudgement of God: Who, because they refuse to receiue and beleeue the truth, doth giue them vp in∣to a reprobate minde, and sendeth strong delusion among them, that as they doe
delight in lies and m vnrighteousnesse, so the same may be their destruction. 15. Question. How is the worde of GOD deui∣ded? Answeare. Into theMat 3.2. Luke. 24.47. Lawe and the Gospel. 16. Question. What is the Lawe.? Answeare. It is the ten commaundementes of God, requiring of euerie oneDeut. 27.26. most pure perfect, and perpetuall obedience,Leuit. 18.5. Rom. 10.5. Mat. 19.17. pro∣mising saluation to them which fulfill the same, threatning death and damnation to the transgressours thereof. 17. Question. Rehearse the same to me. Answeare. 1Exod. 20. Thou shalt haue none other Gods but me. 2 Thou shalt not make to thy selfe any grauen image, nor the likenesse of any thing that is in heauen aboue, or in the earth beneath, or in the waters vnder the earth: thou shalt not bowe downe to them nor worship them, for I the Lorde thy God am a ielous God, and visiteth
the iniquities of the fathers vpon the chil∣dren vnto the thirde and fourth generati∣on of them that hate me, and shewe mer∣cie vnto thousandes in them that loue me, and keepe my commaundementes. 3 Thou shalte not take the name of the Lorde thy God in vaine, for the Lord will not holde him guilteles, that taketh his name in vayne: 4 Remember that thou keepe holy the Sabboth day: sixe dayes shalt thou labour and doe all that thou hast to doe, but the seuenth day is the Sabboth of the Lorde thy GOD, in it thou shalt doe no manner of worke, thou, and thy sonne, and thy daughter, thy man seruaunt, and thy mayd seruaunt, thy cattel, & the stran∣ger within thy gates: for in sixe dayes the Lord made heauen and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the se∣uenth day, wherefore the Lorde blessed the seuenth day, and hallowed it. 5 Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy dayes may be long in the lande, which the Lord thy God geueth thee. 6 Thou shalt not kill. 7 Thou shalt not commit adulterie. 8 Thou shalt not steale.

Question.
What sayest thou of the seconde? Thou shalt not make. &c. Answeare. God doth therein declare how he wil be worshiped. For seeing that his true worshipDeut. 6.13. Rom. 14.23 Matth. 5.16. is worke or seruice commaun∣ded in his woord, proceeding of faith, and tending to his glory; as he is aIohn. 4.24. spirite, so he will be woorshiped in spirit and truth, withoutLeuit. 18.3 Deut. 7.25. & 12.2. &. 14.3. any mixture of I∣dolatrie or superstition. And therefore he forbiddethDeut. 4.23 Esay. 40.18. the making of Images, to expresse him byExod. 34.14. Psalm. 97.7. all manner deuotion or reuerence geuing to them, eyther in looking at them, or in bowing the knee before them in prayer: he is the Lorde our God, and will not haue his power to be contemned:Exod. 34.14 1. Cor. 11.2. he is ielous ouer vs, and will not suffer eyther our soules or bodies to be defiled with any filthinesse of Idolatrie: which if we doe, he will re∣uenenge the same to the third and fourth generation. Briefly he forbiddeth here∣byDeut. 12.2. all representations and tokens of Idolatrie,Esay. 29.13. all straunge worship de∣uised by man,Apoc. 13.15 and 14.9, & 18 4. all antichristian Decrees and whatsoeuer corrupteth the true ser∣uice and spirituall woorship of God.
20. Question. What is commaunded in the third? Thou shalt not take. &c. Answeare Herein the Lord commaundeth a re∣uerend vse of his name,Deut. 6.13. truely to sweare and testifie the truth, notIerem. 4.1.2 onely in truth, iudgement, and righteousnesse, but alsoIosu. 2.12. 2.

The Lorde commaundeth not onelie1. Cor. 6.15 1. Thes. 4.4 perfect chastitie both in soule and bodie, whether it bee in marriage or in single life, that all our parties may be sanctified vnto him: but also he forbiddethGalat. 5.20 Apoc. 21.8. all manner of adulterie and fornication,1. Tim. 4.3 Eccles. 5.5 the restraining of lawfull mariage in a∣nie calling, and the rashe vowing of sin∣gle life,Math. 5.28. Rom 6.12. and 7.7. vnlawfulll lustes,Esay. 3.16. 1. Ti. 2.9 1.

Answeare. Herein God commaundethPsalm. 15.2. Tit. 2.12. Rom. 13.8 righte∣ousnesse and true dealing in euerie cal∣ling, and that euerie man be contente with his owne state, geuing to euerie one what of right he ought to haue: forbid∣ding alsoEphe. 4.28. 1. Thes. 4.6. all robbing and falsehoode,Luke. 12.15 Psalm. 15.5. Prouer. 11.1. couetuousnesse, vsurie, oppression, by∣ing and selling with false measures,2. Thes. 3.10 i∣dle liuing,Luke. 15.13. vnhonest wasting of goodes or substance, and what else doth sauoure
of deceite, the same is stealing. 27. Question. Shewe the sence and meaning of the neinth? Thou shalt not beare false witnesse, &c. Answeare. God commaundeth herein,Ephes. 4.25. Isai. 33.15. in courte and iudgement, and in all our wordes and couenantes, that trueth may florishe, to saue our neighboures harmelesse,Deut. 1.16. Isai. 10.15. for∣bidding wrong iudgement, or anie re∣specte of persons therein, the making of wicked lawes and decrees, alsoDeut. 19.16. Ephes. 4.25. 1. Cor. 13. toto. false witnesse, and lying tales, flatterie, suspi∣tions, false accusations, and whatsoeuer impaireth the good name of our brethren. 28. Question. What saiest thou of the last, Thou shalt not couet &c? Answeare. In this the Lorde commaundethDeut. 6.5. Matth. 22.37. Luke. 10.27. the whole heart to be possessed with loue, that whatsoeuer man doth wish or desire, may bee free from lust and corrupt af∣fections, and serue to the glorie of God, and profite of his neighboures, forbid∣ding herebyGenes. 6.5. Matth. 5.28. Rom. 6.12. all wicked thoughtes and vnlawfull desires both of soule and bodie,
although our consent be not thereto,Ephe. 2.24. all corruption of originall sinne by Adam, all lacke of grace, and whatsoeuer wan∣teth of the integritie & perfection where∣in man was made. By all whiche pre∣ceptes, it may appeare, thatIob. 15.14. Deut. 27.26. Leuit. 18.5. Luke. 17.10. nothing but true righteousnes and innocencie can please God. 29. Question. By this I vnderstande, that thou art not able of thy selfe,Rom 8.3. because of thy sinnes, to fulfil these lawes: why there∣fore did God commaund that, which thou canst not doo? Answeare. First, hereby he declareth howe that his image in meEphes. 4 23.24. is corrupted with sinne, for nothing is here required, which I coulde not haue done before my fall in Adam. Secondly,Deut. 27.26 here is nothing commaun∣ded which I am not bounde to do. Thirdly,Deut. 6.25. he doeth not respect what I of my selfe can doe, but what his iustice doth require. Last of all, it setteth foorth theRom. 4.15. and .7.7. wrath of God, and bringeth me to the feeling of my sinnes. 30. Question.
Why, God is merciful to thousands, & will not surely punish sinne so sharp∣ly, as thou thinkest. Answeare Exod. 20.6.God in deede is mercifull to them that loue him, and truely repent, but he is apsalme. 7.6. and. 11.7. Deut. 32.35. iust iudge, and a God of venge∣ance, to punish the wickednesse of the vn∣godly, which breake his commaunde∣mentes. 31. Question. By this I gather, that many are in a wofull case. Answeare. Concerning the wicked, whiche bee voide of faith and of the mercie of God,1. Tit. 1.9 Deut. 27.26 the curse of the Lawe hangeth vppon them: But touching the elect, of which companie I am perswaded that I am one,Iohn. 3.16 2. Cor. 5.21. Rom. 3.25 Iesus Christ the sonne of God in myne owne nature hath suffred, to deliuer mee from sinne, and the punishmentes thereof, and hath brought me into fauour of God againe, of whiche benefite I lay holdeRom. 1.16 Act. 15.11 with a true faith,Rom. 10.17 which com∣meth by the preaching of the Gospell. 32. Question. What is the Gospell?
Answeare. It is theRom. 10.8 doctrine of faith,Math. 11.28 Iohn. 5.24. contai∣ning the promises of God vnto saluation,Luke. 24.47. Iohn. 3.15. and 6.47. to all which truely repent, and lay holde of Christes merites, by a sure trust in the same. 33 Question. Why callest thou the Gospell the doctrine of faith? Answeare. First becauseRom. 10.17. faith commeth, and is nourished by the preaching of the Gospel: SecondlyIohn. 3.16 because the promises there∣of, must be receiued onely by faith. 34. Question. What do the promises of the Gos∣pell meane: Answeare. First they teach me that the Lawe of God is fulfilled for me by Christ,Rom. 5.19. Ephe. 2.15 Galat. 3.13. by whō I haue my sinnes forgiuen, and with1. Cor. 1.30 2. Cor. 5.21. whose righteousnesse I am clothed, and may now boldely stand before the iudge∣ment seate of God. Secondly that my saluationRom. 3.24. and .4.5.16. cōmeth onely of the free mercie of God, without my merites or good deedes. ThirdlyMatt. 22.14. although they be offred to
all, yet they take effect in none to saluati∣on, but onely in the elect, whose hearts GOD lighteneth with faith. 35. Question. Shewe me what faith is. Answeare. There is a kinde of faith, calledIames. 2.14. Act. 8.13. a deade fayth, beleeuing the woord of God to be true, and all thinges therein contei∣ned, and goeth no farther: but the true faith isIohn. 17.3. the sure knowledge of the fa∣therly good will and mercy of God shew∣ed towardes man in Christ,Ephes. 3.17. and a sure trust in the same, whicheRom. 6. toto. in due tyme bringeth forth the fruites of good liuing. 36. Question. What doest thou learne hereby? Answeare. First I learne to know God, who is madeRom. 8.16. my Father by Christ, thorowe a∣doption and grace. 2 Secondly,Galat. 2.20. I applie to my selfe by this my faith, al the merites of Christ as fully, as if I had doone the same my self. 3 Thirdly,Rom. 4.19. Hebr. 4.16. and 10.22. I haue a sure trust in his merites and mercy, and boldnes to offer vp my prayers to GOD the father by him.
4 Last of all I knowe his promises toHeb. 11.1. be faithfull and true, and that he will perfourme them, whē it pleaseth his god∣ly wisedome. 37. Question. Whence commeth faith? Answeare. It is the giftMath. 11.25 27. &. 13.11. Act. 16.14. Rom. 12.6 Galat. 5.22. Ephe. 2.8 of GOD, wrought in my hart by the preaching of the Gos∣pell, and by the holy Ghost. 38. Question. What is the summe of faith? Answeare. I beleeue in God the father almigh∣tie, maker of heauen and earth, and in Iesus Christ his onely sonne our Lorde, which was conceiued by the holy Ghost, borne of the Virgin Mary, suffred vnder Poncius Pilate, was crucified, deade, and buried, he descended into Hell, and rose againe the third day from the deade, he ascended into heauen, and sitteth on the right hand of God the father almightie: from thence he shall come to iudge the quicke and the deade. I beleeue in the holy Ghost: the holy catholike Churche, the communion of saintes, the forgiue∣nes of sinnes, the resurrection of the body and the life euerlasting.
39. Question. What art thou taught hereby? Answeare. 1 First, what to beleeue of God my father and creatour: 2 Secondly, of Christ my redeemer: 3 Thirdly, of the holy Ghost my sanc∣tifiour: Last of all, concerning the church of God: 40. Question. What canst thou say of God? Answeare. God isIohn. 4.24 a spirituall nature,Rom. 16.26. euerla∣sting,Sam. 45.5.6.7. Rom. 3.4 almightie,Psalm. 139.7.8.9. infinite,Psalm. 119.137. true,Matth. 19.17 goodPsalm. 11.7. righteous, and mercifull,Exod. 34.6. who hath made the worlde, andGenes. 1.1 hath begotten the Sonne of himselfe from euerlasting. Iohn. 1.1.The sonne is theProuer. 8.23 Hebr. 1.3. Apoc. 1.8. wisdome and image of the father, begotten of the father, very God of very God,Iohn. 1.14. Galat. 4.4. who, in his time ap∣pointed, became man. The holie Ghost isIohn. 14.16 26. the power and vertue proceeding from them both, which three, although they beMah. 3.16 27. distinct in per∣sons yet are theyDeut. 4 6. equal & al one in God∣head,Iohn. 1.1. & .5.18.21. 1. Iohn. 5.7 eternitie, dignitie, and power. 41. Question. What sayest thou of the first parte
of this faith? Answeare. I beleeue, that God is not onely theMath. 3.17 Rom. 8.16. naturall father of his sonne Christ, but also that he is by grace my father, by whose wisedome as heauen and earth, and all things therin conteined, were made, so the same by hisPsalm. 145.15. Heb. 1.3. Mat. 10.28. power is go∣uerned and preserued. 42. Question. What thinkest thou of the second? Answeare. I beleeue thatHeb. 5.15. the sonne of God be∣came man, in all thinges like vnto me, onely sinne excepted, and in my nature wrought what was needefull to my sal∣uation,Matth. 1.21. Act. 4.12. wherefore he is named Iesus, that is, a Sauiour. 43. Question. How is thy saluation wrought. Answeare. This woord Christ, doth teach the same, for first it signifieth him to be a king, and to haue purchased to him selfeAct. 20.28. Luke. 1.33. by his bloode, the spirituall kingdome of his Church,Iohn. 8. 1. Iohn.  all the enemies thereof conquered. Whiche kingdome now he gouernethEphe. 1.13 1. Cor. 6.19 by his woord, and by his spi∣rit,
whereby he raigneth in my hart, and in the hartes of his elect. Secondly, it teacheth that he was aHeb. 5.5.6.7 prieste to offer vp him selfe once for all, a swete sacrifice, to take away my sinnes, and to be aIohn. 14.13. Rom. 8.34 mediatour, by whom, and in whose name I may offer vp my prayers to God my heauenly father, and through him be heard. Thirdly, it putteth me in mynde that he wasAct. 3.21 a Prophet, sent to preach the will of his heauenly father, whomMath. 17.5. alone I must heare and obey, as my Lord: who being thus appoynted of his father,Mark. 14.10 & .15.15.24 Iohn. 19.38. was betraied of Iudas, condemned by Pilat, crucified by the Iewes, buried by Ioseph of Aromathia and Nicode∣mus, suffredEsay. 53.4. Collos. 1.2.20. in his bodie, not onely the punishmentes due to my body, but alsoMath. 27.46. in his soule, the punishmentes due to my soule, that was the very tormentes of hel and death, and separation from God,Rom. 5.19. Col. 2.14 1. Iohn. 3.8 Apoc. 20.14. by whose death my obedience is wrought the malediction of Gods Lawe cancel∣led, the Diuell, and his power subdued, the wrath of God appeased, and I set in his fauour agayne. And thus is the death of Christ, the onely and full raunsome for
my sinnes, by vertue whereof, sinne also dyeth and is killed in me. 44. Question. It is verie needefull to keepe this ex∣cellent benefite alwayes in minde: tell me therefore, howe thou canst medi∣tate the same aright. Answeare. FirstIsay. 53 toto Rom. 4.25. Galat. 3.13 Ephe. 2.14. I consider, howe great the wrath of God was towarde my sinnes, which coulde be appeased with nothing, but onelie with the deare bloudshedding of his sonne: and thereby, I beginne to hate and eschewe sinne euermore. Secondly,Iohn. 3.16 &, 10.17 herein I doo behold also the great loue of GOD,Iohn. 4.10 whiche spared not his sonne for my sake, and likewise the great loue of his sonne, that vouche∣safed to doe so much for me. Thirdly, IGallat. 2.20. applie and appropriate the same vnto my selfe, whatsoeuer Iesus Christ herein hath done: for I am fullie assured, that he did it for me. 45. Question. What sayest thou of his resurrecti∣on? Answeare. As he died for my sinnes, so he rose a∣gayne
for my iustification,1. Iohn. 3.8. hauing got∣ten the victorie ouer sinne, death, hell, and damnation, and geueth me power through his spirit,Rom. 8.10.11. to rise vnto newnes of life, assuring me, that my bodily death shalbe no destruction, but that I shall rise againe at the last day, to life euerlasting. 46. Question Shewe thy minde of his ascention. Answeare. He ascendedact. 1.9. and 3.21. Mat. 28.18.20. with his bodie into hea∣uen, where he remayneth, hauing all po∣wer geuen him of his father, but with his spirite he is present with his people:Iohn. 14.2. Tit. 2.5 Collos. 3.1.2. by which his ascention, he hath taken possession for me in heauen, where he al∣so continueth a mediatour to make inter∣cession for me to his father, and finally, teacheth me to set mine affection vppon heauenlie thinges. 47. Question. What meanest thou by his com∣ming to iudgement? Answeare. I beleeue, that he which is my sauiourMat. 24.31. 2. Thes. 1.8.10. Luke. 21.35. shal come to cleare me and all his elect in iudgement, and to condemne the wic∣ked, which in their life time refused him,
to followe their pleasures. 48. Question. What saiest thou of the holy Ghost? Answeare. I beleeue that1. Cor. 6.11. he is the spirit of sanc∣tification,2. Cor 4.6. geuen to lighten my mynde,1 hn. 16.13 and to leade me into all trueth, he is2 Cor. 1.22 the earnest of mine inheritance in heauen,Ephes. 1.13. the seale to imprinte Gods promises in my heart,Iohn. 7.36. Esay. 55.1 the fountaine of grace, and the water which purgeth me from mine vn∣cleannesse, andRom. 8.10.11. maketh mee to die to sinne, and to be holy vnto God. 49. Question. Shewe thy minde concerning the Church. Answeare The Church isRom. 8.29. Ephes. 1.4.10.11. the societie of all faithfull people, whom God in Christ hath chosen to saluation before the world was made, of1. Cor. 15.55 which number I beleeue that I am one. 50. Question. What, is there no saluation without the Church? Answeare. No,Iohn. 16.4. for as the branch, except it abide in the Vine, cannot bring foorth fruite,
but dyeth and withereth, and so is cast into the fyre: euen so, except a man be graffed into the bodye of Christ, which is the Church, & therein continue, he can not be saued. And therefore not euery re∣ligion shall saue the professour thereof, but onely the truth of Iesus Christ. 51. Question. What be the markes thereof. Answeare. Iohn. 8.47. and. 10.27.The sincere woord of God,Matth. 28.19 the right administration of the Sacraments,Matth. 18.17 1. Cor. 5.1. and Ecclesiasticall discipline, 52. Question. Why is the Church called holy? Answeare. Because God will haue his people to liueTit. 2.12. holily, soberly, & righteously in this world, and notEphes 4.30 to greeue the holy Ghost by any vncleannesse, by whom they bee sanctified, and by whom, whilest they suf∣fer themselues to be led, theyIohn. 16.13. cānot erre in matters of faith and saluation. 53. Question. I pray thee herein by the way, what thinkest thou of the church of Rome, whose doctrine hath bene receiued many yeares, hath she erred and beene
deceiued. Answeare. The Churche of Rome in the begin∣ning and long after the Apostles time, was a true Churche, and so long as she followedIohn 14.16.17. the worde of God, and suffe∣red her selfe to be guided with his spirite, shee was free from eroure in matters of faith.1. Tit. 6.5. 2. Tit. 3.2. Apoc. 18.11. But when she began to abounde in wealth, she forgate hir former husband Christ Iesus, and committed fornication with straunge Gods,Galat. 1.6.7.8. 2. Tit. 4.5. 2. Pet. 2.4. leauing the doc∣trine of Christ and his religion, and deui∣sing a new worshippe of her owne, where∣in2. Thes. 2.11. Apoc. 14.8. according to the iust iudgement of God, she florished a long time, and there∣withall, polluted and made drounken the most part of the worlde, whilest so many embraced her lawes and religion, yea, e∣uen all those whiche were notApoc. 7.3. &. 13.8. &. 17.5. chosen to saluation, and sealed by the spirit of faith.2. Tit. 4.3. And of this her departing from the faith, sprang that great darkenesse, and ignoraunce of true religion in these lat∣ter dayes. 54. Question. What meaneth the communion of Saintes?
Answeare. It signifiethRom. 12.5. 1. Cor. 12.12. the felowshippe which all the electe haue one with an other,1. pet. 4.10. Galat. 6.2. communicating according to the measure of faith, all spirituall graces amongest themselues,Ephes. 4.3. & the studying to keep the vnitie of the spirit in the bound of peace. 55. Question. What beleeuest thou of the forgiue∣nesse of sinnes? Answeare. First, I beleeue that before my sinnes be forgeuen me,Rom. 5.8.10. Ephes. 2.1.2. 1. Cr. 6.11. there is nothing in me but meere wickednesse. Secondly, I beleeue that al my sinnes, and the punishment thereof bee taken a∣wayPt. 2.4. Esay. 53.5. 1. Cor. 1.30. 2. Cor. 5.21. by Christes death, and I made pertaker of his righteousnesse. Thirdly, I beleeueRom. 3.25. that faith alone, without anie worthinesse of my selfe, doth make me partaker of these graces, and this my righteousnes before God. 56. Question. What sayest thou of the rest, the resur¦rectiō of the bodie, & life euerlasting? Answeare. I beleeue when this life is ended, thatEccle. 12.7. Apoc. 14.13. Luke. 16.22. Phillip. 1.23. my soule shall goe to God, and my bo∣die,
to rest in the earth til the last day, when they shall both ioyne together againe1. Cor. 15.53. incorruptible, and remaine with God for euer in the kingdome of heauen. 57. Question. Howe knowest thou, that thou hast suche a faith as this? Answeare. First, I knowe the sameRo. 8.16. by the testi∣monie of the holie Ghost, which assureth my conscience, that I am the childe of God, and whiche maketh me crie, Abba father, in ful and perfect assurance thereof. Secondly, I knoweRom. 8.9.10. Gal. 2.20. Rom. 6. toto. by the workes and fruites of faith, whiche Iesus Christ being vnited and ioyned vnto me, brin∣geth forth in me, by the vertue of his spi∣rit, killing my corrupt and sinfull nature and quickening me, to righteousnesse of life. 58. Question. Than cannot such a faith as this bee fruitelesse, and without good workes. Answeare. No, but good workes doe follow faith, as theMat. 7.17. Iacob. 2.24. 1. Pet. 1.12. testimonies and fruites of my thankfulnesse to God, whereby my faith is knowne, and approued of men:Galat. 5.6.
wherefore it is called faith, whiche wor∣keth by loue. 59. Question. What workes must thou doe? Answeare. Suche as be commaunded me in theMat. 19.17.18. lawe of God,1. Cor. 1.8. Ephes. 2.10. whiche as they come of grace geuen me, and not of mine owne power, so must they needes be done: for first1. Pet. 1.16. God hath so commaunded. Second∣ly, hisRom. 6. toto. Tit. 2.14. benefits bind me thereto. Third∣ly,Colos. 2.12. my baptisme doth teach me to die vn∣to sinne, and liue vnto righteousnesse. Fourthly,Mat. 5.16. 1. pet. 2.12. I must glorifie God by my well doing. Last of all,2. pet. 1.10. I must make strong my faith and election, and learne to auoyde the wrath of God. 60. Question. What rewarde shalt thou haue for thy good deedes? Answeare. The woorkes, whiche I doe before I be iustified before God by Christ,Rom. 14.23. Heb. 11.6. Iohn. 3.36. can not please him, because they be done with∣out faith. The workes which follow my regeneration,Apoc. 7.14. Math. 25.40. Luke. 17.10. 1. Cor. 15.58. doe please GOD, not because of anie woorthinesse of mine in them, but God accepteth them, because
of my faith in Christ, through whom they are not done in vaine, so that the rewarde which is geuen vnto them, commeth one∣ly ofApo. 22. the free mercie and fauour of God whilest he rewardeth not my deserts, but crowneth his giftes of grace in me. 61. Question. But the Scripture maketh mention often, of rewarde to good woorkes. Answeare. It is trueCor. 15.58. Luke. 17.10. that my labour is not in vayne in the Lorde, yet my good workes are not such, that of themselues they can deserue any suche thing. For there bee three thinges required to the nature of merites: First, that the good woorkes be mans owne, for but to bestowe and repay agayne the same which he had lent him, what rewarde can he haue. But as1. Cor. 4.7. Eph. 2.10. Luke. 16.2. & 19.13. for mans good workes, they be not his own, but the giftes of God lent him to vse, & he himselfe Gods instrument to occupie the same. Secondly, it is required, that a man doe the worke of his owne accorde, with∣out constreint, or respect of duetie, for he that is bound to doe the same, cannot wel pleade of merite, for he doeth but what
of duetie he oughte to doe. But whatso∣euer the righteous doe,Psal. 115.1. Rom. 8.12. it is of duetie, for he is infinite wayes indebted vnto God. Thirdly, to the nature of deseruing, it is required, that there be a iust proporti∣on betweene the thing giuen, and the thing receiued: butRom. 8.18. Apoc. 22.17. none of mans works are comparable to euerlasting life. And therefore, I confesse, that I can not de∣serue any thing of the kingdome of hea∣uen by mine owne works, for the reward which God geueth vnto my woorkes, is the free gift of grace, giuen to me onely for my faithes sake in Christ, in whome my workes please God. Wherefore, yf man be neuer so vertuous in the sighte of the world & haue neuer so faire a shewe of good deedes, and not being graffed by fayth on Iesus Christ, they are altogea∣ther vnfruitefull and vayne. 62. Question. With what helpes doeth God fur∣ther thee to saluation? Answeare. Besides that the worde of God,2. Thes. 3.3. doth helpe to vphold my faith, the sacraments and prayer are also helpes to me, for by them the Lorde helpeth mine infirmitie,
byMat. 28.19 1. Cor. 11.23. Genes. 11.17. outwarde signes representing to me spirituall graces. 63. Question. Doe the Sacramentes serue thee to anie other purpose? Answeare. They serue not onely toExod. 12.11.12.13. Mat. 26.26. 1. Cor. 11.23.26. 1. Cor. 10.17. teache me heauenlie thinges, but also to kindle a desire of Gods promises in my heart, to stirre me vp to thankesgeuing for my re∣demption, to knitte me in loue with the Godlie, and as markes of religion to testifie howe. I differ from the heathen and wicked. Wherefore, such as refuse to vse the same, doMark. 8.38. Luk. 14.18.24. not onlie denie God, but are also arrogant and proude. And therfore not to be accompted Christians, because they refuse in vsing of the Sacra∣mentes, to make open profession thereof. 64. Question. What is a Sacrament? Answeare. It is an holy signe, instituted ofMat. 21.25. Iohn. 3.5. Act. 2.38. Rom. 4.11. God to confirme my faith, and to seale in my heart the promises of Gods mercie tow∣ards me, for the forgiuenesse of my sinnes and saluation in Christ. 65. Question.
Whether doe the Sacraments geue grace to the receiuer, or no? Answeare. TheyIohn. 1.33. Act. 8.18. 1. Cor. 10.5. Ro. 2.29. 1. Pet. 3.21 neither of themselues nor in themselues include or geue grace, for that is the gift of the holie Ghost, but they be holy signes, whereby, as by an instru∣ment, God doth worke and seale grace in my heart by faith receiued, and yet they bee not bare or naked signes, but grace is truely present to my faith, when I receiue the same aright. 66. Question. Who ought to minister the Sacra∣mentes? Answeare. Gen. 6.14. & 17.23 Mat. 28.19.None but suche as be ministers too preach the woorde, for these two offices in the scriptures, concurre and goe toge∣ther, and therefore to none, but to such as may lawfully minister the woorde, ap∣perteineth the ministring of the Sacra∣mentes. And hereby women are forbid∣den to minister baptisme. 67 Question. How manie Sacramentes be there? Answeare. Two, the one is Baptisme, where∣with I am receiued into Christs church.
The other is the Supper of the Lorde, wherewith I am nourished in the same. 68. Question. What is Baptisme? Answeare. It is a Sacrament, wherein, as wa∣ter washeth away the filthinesse of my body, soAct. 2.38 1. Pet. 3.21 the blood of Christ sprinkled vpon my soule, by the hand of faith wa∣sheth away my sinnes, and the punish∣ment thereof, wherebyRom. 6.5. I am incorpo∣rate into his body, and made partaker of his benefites, to dye vnto sinne, and to liue vnto righteousnesse, and this is the right vse of baptisme, that we be sure that our conscience be cleane, and that we shewe it to others by our good woorkes, in mor∣tifying our affections & in doing the will of God. 69. Question. Why are children to be baptized? Answeare. Because byEphe. 2.3. Rom. 5.12. Act. 2.39. Gen. 17.7 nature they be the chil∣dren of wrath, by Adams sinne, to whom also the promise of Gods free mercy and fauour reacheth. So that being inhe∣tours of Gods free graces, they must be baptized, and whan they come to age, be
instructed, what the meaning of baptisme is. 70. Question. What is the Lordes Supper? Answeare. Mat. 26.26.It is a Sacrament of redemption dy the death of Christ, wherein by the mi∣sticall receiuing of breade and wine, tho∣row a true faith, I am made1. Cor. 10.16 Luke. 21.19. Iohn. 6.51. pertaker of all the benefits of Christes passion, for as bread broken doth feede and nourish my body, and wine refresh my hart, so theLuke. 22.19 Iohn. 6.51. body of Christ was torne vpō the crosse, and his blood shed, to washe away my sinnes, and to feede and refresh my soule, to life euerlasting, 71. Question. Whether is the bread chaunged in∣to the natural body of Christ or no? Answeare. The Sacramentes of bread and wyneMat. 26.29. Iohn. 6.51.53.5. 1. Cor. 10.16.17. & 11.24. remaine still in their former nature and substance, neuerthelesse there is a greate chaunge, for those thinges which before were but as common meates, are nowe made the Sacramentes or holy signes of Christes bodye and blood, b but so that we must seeke Christes body in heauen,
and not in the Sacrament. 72. Question. How doest thou eate Christes bo∣dy, or drinke his blood? Answeare. Iohn. 6.35. Rom. 4.24.Spiritually by grace, whilest I be∣leeue that he dyed for my sinnes, and rose againe for my iustification, for it is faith that maketh me pertaker of his benefits, and goodnes which are sealed to me, by his Sacraments. And therefore by faith I am made one with him, for by his spi∣rit he dwelleth in me, and is ioyned with me, as the heade with the members. So then by this coniunction, I may be per∣taker of his graces. 73. Question. Do all men, which receiue this Sa∣crament, receiue the spirituall grace a∣lyke? Answeare. As in baptisme none1. Pet. 3.21. Act. 2.38. & 8.18. Marke. 16.16. but the faith∣full receiue remission of their sinnes,1. Cor. 11.28.29. so in the Lords supper, none but such are pertakers of the grace, and benefittes of Christes death. The wicked in deede re∣ceyue the outward elementes of breade and wine, but because they lacke true
faith, they are not partakers of the spiri∣tuall grace. 74. Question. Whither must thou once a yeare, as some doo of custome, or often, come to the Lordes supper? Answeare. Although the benefit rest not in the of∣ten, but in the worthy receiuing thereof, yet must I so often as I can conuenient∣ly, do the same, euer more and more to be thankefull for my redemption wrought by Christ. 75. Question. How must thou frame thy selfe, to re∣ceiue this Sacrament worthily? Answeare. First I mustMat. 26.75. Iere. 24.7 Ioel. 2.12.13. Rom. 6. toto. consider the greeuous∣nesse of my sinnes, & from my hart vnfay∣nedly, hate and detest the same, and euer after geue my selfe to godlynesse and ver∣tue. Secondly,1. Cor. 11.28. & 2. Cor. 13.5. I must try and examen my selfe, whether I haue a true faith in the promises of Christ. Thirdly,Mat. 5.24 & 22.39. I I must reconcile my selfe to all men, and continue in Christian loue. 76. Question.
What thing is required, that thou mayest doo these thinges the better? Answeare. Mat. 3.1. & 26.21 Act. 31.14 & 20.7. 1. Cor. 11.28 2. Par. 23.19It is very expedient, that as in the primitiue Church the woord of God was preached before the administratiō of the Sacramentes, which thing is the life of the Sacrament, and also an examination taken of the communicantes, before the Lords supper was eaten: So is it I say, necessarie, that the woorde bee preached, and the people instructed in this mistery, that they may shewe foorth the Lordes death vntill his comming againe. 77. Question. Nowe remaineth the other helpe geuen thee of God, that is to say pray∣er? Tell me what it is. Answeare. Prayer is theMat. 6.6. Iohn. 16.23. 1. Tit. 2.8. lifting vp of my hart to God and asking in Christes name, of thinges needefull to mee and the whole Church,Phillip. 4.6. Colos. 4.2. with thankesgeuing, for his benefites, and goodnesse. 77. Question. To whome must thou pray? Answeare. To a God alone: first, because I b be∣leeue
in him alone.Psal. 50.15. Iohn. 16.33. Secondly, he alone1. Reg. 8.39. knoweth my harte:Rom. 10.14 thirdly,Esay. 42.8. he will not geue his glory to any other, and therefore I am forbidden to pray to Saintes. 79. Question. How canst thou, which art a sinner, pray to God that hateth sinne?Ioh. 14.13.14. & .16.23. Act. 4.12. 1. Tit. 2.5.6. 1. Iohn. 2.2. Answeare. I pray not in trust of mine owne righ∣teousnesse, but in the name of Christ, who is theIohn. 14.16. way for me to come to the father, whoRom. 8.34. 1. Tit. 2.5.6. 1. Iohn. 2.2. continueth my Mediatour at the righte hande of the Father,Iohn. 13.34. loueth mee and hathColos. 1.22. reconciled me to the Father,Matt. 3.17. and in whom the Father is well pleased. 80. Question. For whome must thou pray? Answeare. For all men liuing, for1. Tit. 2.1.2. Math. 5.44. Luke. 6.27. kinges, ma∣gistrates, ministers, yea and for my eni∣mies: but for the deade I haue no com∣maundement to pray, neyther can I help them after they be gonne hence, for as they be found at the day of their death, so shall they rise againe, onely this can I doe, to geue God thankes for their deli∣uerance out of this world. 81. Question.
How must thou prepare thy selfe to pray? Answeare. First, I mustRom. 8.26. 1. Iohn. 5.14. be touched with the necessitie of those thinges which I pray for, my minde must be deuout,Mat. 6.7. and not ca∣ryed to and fro with vaine thoughtes. I must appeare before GodPsalm. 51.17. Iacob. 1.6. in true repen∣taunce and fayth,Mat. 5.23. being at loue with all men,Esay. 1.18. & .59.2. framing my life ryghteously, &1. Iohn. 5.14. 1. Cor. 14. toto. Mat. 6. Luke. 11.1. as∣king in such a tongue as I vnderstand, acording to the will of God. 82. Question. How must thou pray? Answeare. According to the forme prescribed of our Sauiour Christ, in these woordes: Our Father which art in heauen: hallo∣wed be thy name. Thy kingdome come. Thy will be done in earth as it is in hea∣uen. Geue vs this day our dayly breade. And forgiue vs our trespasses, as we for∣geue thē that trespas against vs. And lead vs not into temptation, but deliuer vs from euill. For thine is the kingdome, the power, and the glory, for euer, and e∣uer. So be it. 83. Question.
What is the meaning of this praier? Answeare We pray to God in the first petition thatpsal. 89.5.6 1. Cor. 10.31 Iosu. 24.14.15 his glory may appeare, and thatRom. 2.24. our liues and conuersation may set foorth the same. In the second, we pray that God wouldIohn. 16.13. Rom. 8.10.11 gouerne the kingdome of his Church, killing sinne, and the lustes thereof in the same, and to renue it to ryghteousnesse of lyfe. That he would al∣soRom. 16.20. 1. Iohn. 3.8. treade downe Satan and al his pow∣er, and that he would shortlyApoc. 22.20. accomplish the number of his elect, and hasten the comming of Christ to iudgement. In the thirde we prayLuke. 22.42 that all our dooings may be agreeable to his will, without contradiction or murmuring. In the fourth, we desire himPsal. 14.1.15 to graunt vs what soeuer is needefull to the sustenance and preseruation of our lyfe, and that all our dooinges may be to his glorye, and the profit of our neighboures. In the fifth, wee prayePsal. 51.9 1. Iohn. 2.12. & 18.35. Mat. 5.45. for the forgiuenesse of our sinnes and the punishment therof, for his mercies sake, euen as we shall pardon o∣thers their offences doone to vs, without bearing mallice, or hatred towardes them.
In the last wee praye that GodEphes. 6.10. Rom. 16.20. would guyde vs wt his spirite, that we may get the victorie ouer Sathan, sinne, and hell, and be defended from all euills. After we conclude with these woordes: For thine is the kingdome &c. To set foorth our de∣sire to his glory, his honour, and prayse, whose power is also infinite, and there∣fore he can graunt our requestes.Ro. 11.36. Act. 4.9.11. Psal. 114.7. 1. Chro. 29.10. We make an end with this woorde, Amen, both desiring, that what wee haue asked may be fulfilled, and also assuring our selues, that our requestes shalbe fulfilled accordingly as they bee agreeing to the will of God. 84. Question. What if God do not graunt thy pe∣titions at the first? Answeare. That may beLuke. 11.12. 1. Iohn. 5.14. either because I haue not asked in assurance of faith and accor∣ding to the will of God, or els by differ∣ring the graunt of my requestes, he will trye and exercise my faith more in calling vpon him, that I might continue in prai∣er & depend vpon his mercifull goodnes, who notwithstanding at the first he dooth not graunt my requestes, yet in his good
tyme he will accomplish the same. 85. Question. Is there any helpe for thee to praye more deuoutly? Answeare. Yea truly,1. Pet. 5.11. Act. 13.3. fasting is a speciall pre∣paratiue to the same. 86. Question. What is a Christian faste? Answeare. It is not onely anEsai. 58.3. Ioel. 2.12. Psal. 35.13. Zach. 7.5. abstinence from meates, and drinkes, to chastice my body but also from sinne and the delights ther∣of, which hurte the soule, to the end tho∣rowe true repentance, faith, Godly prai∣er, and renouncing of euyll, the Spirite may haue dominion in me. 87. Question. What is the right vse of fasting? Answeare. 1. Cor. 9.27.First to chastice my body, and to bring it into subiection to the spirit. Ioel. 2.12.Secondly, to be a witnes of my true repentance and submission to the will of God. M 26.41.Thirdly, that my spirit way be more ready to prayer. 88. Question
Is there any abuse in the exercise of fasting? Answeare. Yea, many,Esai. 58.3. Zach. 7.5. first to fast longer then the body may endure, & after to tare more deliciously. Secondly,Colos. 2.16. Galat. 4.10. 1. Tit. 4.3. to put holinesse in fasting one day more than an other, or in abstayning from one meate more than from another. Thirdly,Esai. 58.3. Rom. 3.24. to thinke by fasting to purchase forgeuenes of sinnes: whereas the same commeth onely of the free mercy of God in Christ, without any mannes woorthinesse or deseruing. Last of all in abstayning from meates, & not toGalat. 5.24. Tit. 2.12. abstaine from sinnes, and all thinges which cause or nourish the same. 89. Question. Hitherto thou hast answeared verie well to all pointes of thy faith, yet one thing further I desire to know, which is, why al men be not of this opinion in religion, that thou art of? Answeare. Although there be but one true God,Eph. 4.5. and one perfect religion, yet must you not thinke that all men will euer agree toge∣ther in one religion, for thereGene. 5.13. is and hath bene alwaies a continuall hatred be∣tweene
Christ the seede of the woman and the seede of the serpent. And there∣fore many are professed enemies to the way of truth. 100. Question. What way than thinkest thou best, to winne such as be out of the way, and to bring them to the imbracing of true religion? Answeare. As it is specially required in building of an house, first to remoue away the im∣pedimentes, and than toMat. 7.24. 1. Cor. 3.11. lay a sure foun∣dation, and afterward to vphold the buil∣ding: likewise those thinges which tend not to the glory of God,2. Re. 18.44. but which men haue abused must be rooted oute, as all re∣liques of papistrie & superstitiō, & in stead therof a good foundatiō layd by the word of God,Exod. 25.40. 1. Reg. 23.3. by which all reformation must be made. Secondly,1. Re. 2.35. Tit. 1.5. Prou. 11.14. it is specially re∣quired, that a good and godlye preaching minister be placed in euery congregati∣on, for where such a one wanteth, the peo∣ple perish. ThirdlyMat. 18.15. Act. 14.23. Rom. 12.8. that there be a right and perfect vse of ecclesiasticall censure and correction, to the end the congrega∣tion may be better kept in awe of duetie
and obedience, so that the best may be af∣fraid to offend. 101. Question. To be short, doost thou thinke it sufficient, onely to knowe these things aforesaid? Answeare No, butMat. 7.21. Phillip. 1.27. Colos. 1.23. Iacob. 1.22. it is required, that I ioyne good lyfe and conuersation with know∣ledge, and therefore I pray daiely that I may haue grace geuen me, that I maye liue godlily righteously and soberly, in this worlde, and so bee confirmed in the truth, that I may proceede from faith to faith, and be so comforted with the good spirit of God, that my whole delight may be reposed, where true ioyes are to be sought, that whan I shall finish this mor∣tal race, I may end the same in the faith and true profession of Iesus Christ my onely redeemer and sauiour. To whom with the father and the holy ghost, three distinct persons and one eternal God, be al glorie & praise for euer. So be it.
A prayer to be sayde, be∣fore the receiuing of the Lordes Supper. O Most mer∣cifull God, whiche of thine euer∣lasting kind¦nesse, haste wroght our redemption by the me∣diation of thy onely sonne our Sauiour Iesus Christ, and also sealed the same vnto vs, for the more confirmation of our faith, by the heauenly and misticall banquet of his last supper, instituted and ordeined as a pledge of his endles loue towardes vs, that we in vsing the same, from tyme to time might keepe a continuall remem∣braunce of his death and passion, and te∣stifie our thankefulnesse for our redemp∣tion: We most humbly beseeche thee in thy tender mercies to looke vpon vs, and to pardon vs all our iniquities, our incre∣dulitie, and hardnes of hart, and to poure into vs thy heauenly grace, that wee be∣ing
watred with the same, and purified by faith in thine euerlasting promises, may be arayed and clothed with the excellent righteousnes of Iesus Christ, to the end hauing vpon vs our wedding garment, we may be welcome ghuests, by thy grace, to thy holy table, Where our soules may be nourished with the precious me∣rits of thy sonne our Sauiours death and passion, and that we also through faith in the same, by thy grace may be fedde vnto immortallitie and lyfe. O Lorde wee beseech thee to nourish and sustaine our hungry soules, with the spiritual graces of thy sōne, quēch the thirst of our harts, wt the dew of thy holy spirit, that we may feele our sinnes clearely to be forgiuen vs, and our consciences assured by faith of all the benifites of thy sonnes suffrings, euen so fully to be doone for vs, as if wee had doon the same our selues. Good Lord for his sake, geue vs grace to proced from faith to faith, and more and more to bee confirmed in the way of our saluation, by the reuerent and godly vse of these thy holy misteries, giue vs a right iudgment and vnderstanding thereof, and euer hold vs from all Popish corruptions of the
same, vnite vs more and more through thy grace vnto thy Sonne, that hee maye dwell in vs and wee in him, that he may be one with vs & we with him to the end that being graffed and planted in him, we may be thankefull, and bring foorth the fruites of all holines of lyfe, to the honour and glory of thy holy name, through Ie∣sus Christ our Lord. So be it. 1. Cor. 11.28. Let a man examen himselfe, and so let him eate of this breade, and drink of this Cuppe. For he that eateth and drinketh vnwoorthily, eateth and drinketh his owne damnation, because he discer∣neth not the Lordes body.
¶ The forme of the con∣fession of the Christian faith, meete for all well gouer∣uerned housholdes, and necessarie for euery one to confesse, which sincerely professe Christ and his truth. I Beleeue and confesse my Lorde God, the onely true, eternal and almightie God, incō∣prehensible, infinit, righteous, and merci∣full, being but one in nature and substance, but distinct in three persons, the father, sonne and holie Ghost. Which God by his wisedome and almightie power, made heauen and earth, and all thinges therein, and nowe by his fatherly prouidence, gouerneth and preserueth the same. I beleue & confesse that Iesus Christ the sonne of God, equall to the father and the holy Ghost, at the time appointed of the father, became perfect man, yet with∣out sinne, borne of the virgin Mary, the Godhead and manhood being vnited and
ioyned together. Who in mine owne nature sanctified by his grace, fulfilled the Lawe of God for me, and suffered in his body and soule, the punishmentes due to my sinnes, and made full satisfaction and payment for the same, with his sacri∣fice vppon the crosse, doone once for all. And deliuered me from the curse of the Lawe, from sinne, hell, death, and dam∣nation, reconciled me to God the Father, washed me from my sinnes, cloathed me with his righteousnes, and renued mee to righteousnes of lyfe. And as by his death my sinnes are taken away, and I set in the fauour God, so by his resurrec∣tion, death was conquered, and righteous∣nesse restored vnto me, wherein the victo∣rie of my faith consisteth. I beleeue and confesse, that Iesus Christ ascended into heauen with my fleshe, where he hath ta∣kē possessiō for me, & where he maketh in∣tercession for me. And yet neuerthelesse, is present with me, and all his elect, by his spirit and grace, and at the end of the world, shall visibly come to iudgement. I beleeue the holy Ghost equall with the father and the sōne, who regenerateth and sanctifieth me, from my vncleannes,
to liue holilie, and righteously in this worlde, assuring my conscience, that I am the childe of God, and heire with Ie∣sus Christ of life euerlasting. I beleeue and acknowledge the vni∣uersall Church of Christ, euen al the com∣panie of the elect, agreeing together in the vnity of spirit and truth, which church is not seene to the eyes of man, but onely knowen to God, of which number I am perswaded that I am one. I acknowledge also a visible Church of God in this world, wherein first, the sacred woord of God is taught vnto his people, being sufficient to instruct them in all thinges necessarie to saluation. Wherwith together with the ministerie of the spirit, he ruleth the same. Second∣ly in this Church, the two Sacramentes of Baptisme and the Lords Supper are rightly and sincerely ministred. Wher∣in, as by Baptisme I am regenerate and receiued into the houshold and felowship of Christians, my sinnes being washed a∣way through faith in Christes blood: So by the Supper of the Lorde, wherein spi∣ritually by faith my soule is fed with the graces and benefits of Iesus Christ I
am nourished and sustayned in the church being one with Christ, and Christ with me, dwelling also in him and hee in mee. Thirdly, there is in this Church due punishment and correction for offences, the end whereof is excommunication by the consent of the Church. Lastly, I beleeue and confesse, that onely in this Church there is saluation, and free forgiuenes of sinnes to mee & al the elect of God, through faith in Christ, by whose obedience we be made righte∣ous, and by whom we are chosen to an in∣heritance immortall and euerlasting in heauen. Which I most humbly beseeche my Lord God to confirme and streng∣then in me, and shortly to make an ende of these sorrowful daies, & to translate me to euerlasting glory, through Iesus Christ my redeemer and Sauiour. Amen. O Lorde increase our faith. ❧ Imprinted at London, at the three Cranes in the Vintree, by Thomas Dawson. (1579.)
