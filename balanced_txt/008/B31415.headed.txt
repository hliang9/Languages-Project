A speedy way to supply Their MAJESTIES Occasions. I. THAT Bills with a Seal, and signed with hands appointed, be given by the Parliament to the King to pass for Mo∣ney, until the Summ given by Parliament be paid upon these Bills out of the Exchequer. II. That these Bills pass from hand to hand, as Currant Money, for the Summ included, so that any Commodities may be bought with them, and Debts paid. III. That the Exchequer Monthly give notice how Moneys come in, that Bills may be paid off without Exchequer-Fees. IV. That it be Treason for any to Counterfeit these Seals, or Ali∣enate the Money given. V. To avoid their being Counterfeit, let Five or Six Offices be kept in and about London, let the Bills be Indented, and the Coun∣ter▪ parts kept in the Offices, to try whether they be Counterfeit or not, and each Office to have 100 l. per Annum only. VI. That when any one brings in any one of these Bills into the Exchequer, it be subscribed only, Received in full of the Bill, the Day and Month, and his own Name. And the delivering in these Bills upon the Exchequer-Account be a discharge to it. VII. It is but reasonable these Bills should have the same Credit as Bankers Notes have, which are Currant for any Summ. VIII. That these Bills only continue until the Summ given by Par∣liament be paid into the Exchequer, and sometime after for bring∣ing in the said Bills. IX. This will be as good as ready Money to the King upon all Accounts. Advantage from hence, I. THAT seeing so much of the Publick Money goes away for Interest, and Buying Dear without ready Money, It may save the Nation great Summs. II. The King pays for Interest Eight Pounds per Cent. which for a Million of Money for a Year, is Eighty Thousand Pounds. III. The King Buys Dearer Twenty Pounds per Cent. for want of ready Money, so that there is a Fifth part lost, which in a Million of Money, is Two Hundred Thousand Pounds. In all, 280000. E. W▪
