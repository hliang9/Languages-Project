To His Highness the Prince of Orange. The Humble ADDRESS OF THE Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Commons OF The City of London, In Common Council Assembled. May it please your Highness, WE taking into Consideration your Highness's fervent Zeal for the Protestant Religion, mani∣fested to the World, in your many and ha∣zardous Enterprizes which it hath pleased Al∣mighty God to Bless you with Miraculous Success. We ren∣der our deepest Thanks to the Divine Majesty for the same, and beg leave to present our most Humble Thanks to your Highness particularly, for your appearing in Arms in this King∣dom, to carry on and perfect your Glorious Design, to Res∣cue England, Scotland, and Ireland from Slavery and Popery, and in a Free Parliament to Establish the Religion, the Laws, and the Liberties of these Kingdoms, upon a Sure and Last∣ing Foundation. We have hitherto lookt for some Remedy, for the Op∣pressions, and Eminent Dangers We, together with our Protestant Fellow-Subjects laboured under, from His Majesty's Concessions and Concurrences with Your Highness's Just and Pious Purposes, expressed in Your Gracious Declarations. But herein finding Ourselves finally disappointed by His Majesty's withdrawing Himself, We presume to make Your Highness our Refuge: And do in the Name of this Capital CITY, implore Your Highness's Protection; and most hum∣bly beseech Your Highness to vouchsafe to Repair to this CITY, where Your Highness will be Received with Uni∣versal Joy and Satisfaction.
