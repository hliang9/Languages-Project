A Brief Exposition OF THE Ten Commandments AND THE Lords Prayer. By Symon Patrick Rector of St. Paul Covent Garden. LONDON, Printed by J. Hayes for S. Thomson, at the Sign of the Bishops Head in St. Pauls Church∣yard. 1665.
TO MY Welbeloved FRIENDS THE PARISHIONERS OF St. Paul Covent Garden. THere being a solemn Vow upon you, made in Baptisme, to keep Gods holy will and Commandments; it is as necessary to understand them, as it is to be honest men, and not to falsifie or break your word. For an help therefore to the meanest capacities in a bu∣siness of such importance, I have drawn up an ex∣position of the Ten Commandments in this plain and familiar way of Questions and Answers: not knowing what other course to take that would be of such general use. For the Ignorant can reap little benefit by that which is purposely contrived to the pitch of the wise; but there is no man of such un∣derstanding that may not serve himself very much of that which is writ to the simple people. And to say the truth, the plainer and more common any no∣tion
is, of the greater weight and moment we shall find it, and the more every man is concerned in it. Let me intreat you then not to despise this little Pa∣per, but to read it deliberately, and ponder every sen∣tence in it: For it being so brief (that the memory may not be burdened) there is not a word superfluous, which is not necessary to the unfolding the sense of the command Search the Scriptures also whereby every thing is proved, and afterward search and ex∣amine your selves about the breach of any of these Precepts, either in whole or in part. And if the Judgments of God that lie now so heavy upon us, have begot any purposes of amendment, do not add this new aggravation of your guilt, to break those fresh Vows whereby you have bound your selves to God. And for the strengthning of them, Give your selves to Prayer, as the Psalmists phrase is Ps 109.4. Considering also seriously (as an help to that) what it is you ask of God in that form of Prayer which our Lord made, of which I have also added a short Explication. And remember withall, that all the Prayers you make will not profit you, unless they cause you to keep Gods commands better, which is the end likewise of all you believe. Read over that which we call the Apostles Creed, and you will find that every branch of it doth naturally bring forth an holy life. When you confess God to be the Creator of the World; it plainly implies his Supream Authority over you, and the obedience you owe him upon that account. When you acknowledg
Jesus to be his Son and your Lord, it lays a necessa∣ry ingagement on you to be governed by those Laws which the Father Almighty hath sent him to give us. For he died and rose again to confirm and seal them. He ascended to heaven to take upon him the government of the whole World. And he will come again to Judg both the quick and dead accord∣ing to their works. And therefore what manner of persons ought you to be in all holy conversation and godliness, that you may be found in peace at his ap∣pearing? But it is not my business now to expound the Creed; whose words are better understood▪ then it's designe; which is (I say) to lead us to the obe∣dience of Gods holy will in all things. That is it which I would gladly promote. And I earnestly beseech you that this small labour may have no small effect, but be so successfull as to excite in you such a working Faith as will save your souls. God Almighty take you into his protection, and revoke the Orders he hath given to the destroying Angel; that you may not die, but live, to declare the works of the Lord, and to pay your Vows to the most High. Amen. Sept. 13. 1665.
Exodus 20. GOD spake all these words, saying, I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bon∣dage. 1. Thou shalt have no other Gods before me. 2. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven I∣mage, nor any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. Thou shalt not how down thy self to them, nor serve them: For I the LORD thy GOD am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that ate me; and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my Commandments. III. Thou shalt not take the Name of the LORD thy God in vain: For the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his Name in vain. IV. Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy: Six daies shalt thou labour, and do all thy work but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God, in it thou shalt not do any work, thou nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor thy cattel, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: for in six daies the LORD, made heaven and earth, the sea and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the LORD blessed the sab∣bath day, and hallowed it. V. Honour thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee. VI. Thou shalt not kill. VII. Thou shalt not commit adultery. VIII. Thou shalt not steal. IX. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. X. Thou shalt not cover thy neighbours house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbors wife, nor his man-ser∣vant, nor his maid-servant, nor his oxe, nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbours. The Lords Prayer. OVr Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name, Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven, Give us this day our daily bread, And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us, And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the Kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever, and ever, Amen.
A Brief EXPOSITION OF THE Ten Commandments AND THE Lords Prayer. Question. WHat doth the Preface to the Commandments teach you? Answer.Lev. 11.44, 45. Lev. 19.1, 2, 3. Lev. 20.7, 8. Deu. 10.12, 13. The right that God hath to Command, and the reason that I have to obey, both as he is my Creator and Benefactor. Q. Ʋnto what Duties doth the first Commandment engage you? A. To acknowledge the one God of Israel to be the onely true God, so as to honourMal. 1.6. worshipPsal. 95.6, 7. Psal. 96.6, 7, 9., fearLev. 19.14., loveMat. 22.37., and believe him1 Chr. 20.20., to trustPsal. 62.7, 8., and hopePsal. 130.7. in him, to offer the sacrifices of Prayer and Praise to himPs. 50.14, 15. Psal. no. 1, 2, 3., and perform all other du∣tiesDeut. 10.12, 20, 21., which a creature owes to his all-seeing CreatorHeb. 4.13., and to him onlyMatth. 4.10.. Q. What Duties do you think are re∣quired of you by the second Commandment?
A. That I give all that external wor∣shipPsal. 95.6. 1 Cor. 6.20. to the invisible God which he hath prescribed, but by no means make any corporealDeut. 4.12.15, 16, 17, 18, 23. Isa. 40.18, &c. image of him, nor give such religious worship to the image of any thing whatsoever itPsal. 97.7. be. Q Can you discern any reason whereby God doth inforce this Command? A. Yes, I observe first that he was jealous of his own people, that the very having of an Image would estrange them from him. And secondly, That such worshippers of other things he accounts Haters of him, and will punish them e∣ven in their Posterity, to the Third and Fourth Generation. And thirdly, that he will multiply mercies. To many Ages upon those who onely serve him, as the persons who truely Love and obey him. Q. What are the Duties to which by the third Commandment you take your self to be obliged? A. First, Not voluntarily upon any occasionMat. 5.34, 35, &c. Jam. 5.12., or for any purpose to swear at all; and secondly, when upon weighty causes I am legally required, never to swear falselyMat. 5.33. Eccles. 5 4, 5., nor promise that which I mean not to perform; and thirdly not to use the name of God but with greatLev. 19.12. re∣verence. Q. Are the sins against this Command∣ment more dangerous than others? A. Yes,Zach. 5.3, 4. Jam. 5.12 Gods plagues shall certain∣ly light upon such sinners. For he saith expresly He will not hold them guilt∣less.
Q. What do you think the fourth Com∣mandment teacheth you? A. First To set apart from my lawful, worldly imployments and recreations, one day in seven for the solemn worship of GodLuk 4.16. Act. 13 14, 27. Act. 17.2.; That I may advance myPsal. 92.1, 2.12, 13, 14. soul in Piety, and learn to cease all my life from sinHeb. 4.10., thereby preparing my self for the eternal praising of God and my Re∣deemer, in the Rest which remains for his peopleHeb. 4.9. and secondly, to endeavour to bring those who are under my charge to the same observation. Q. But why do you observe the first day of the week, when the Commandment speaks of the seventh? A. In memory of Christs rising from the dead on the first day, that he might enter into his glorious rest, having here finished his work of redemption;Act. 20 7. 1 Cor. 16.2. Rev. 1▪ 10 for which I have the example of the holy Apostles, and the Church of God. Q What do you here take notice of, that enforces your allowing Gods worship such a portion of your time? A. I see that he hath allowed me six times as much for my worldly business; and that he himself hath by his proceed∣ing in the Creation, signified so much to me, and thereupon allowed one day, af∣ter six daies labour, to be a day of bles∣sings unto me. Q. What do you think you are bound to practise by the fifth Commandment? A. First, To reverence,Heb. 12.9., love1 Tim. 5.4. and

Q What duties do you charge your self withal from the sixt Commandment? A. Not to take away my own lifeAct 16 27, 28., nor any other mansGen. 9.6. (unless publique JusticePsal 101.8. Rom. 13.4., and necessary defence of my own lifeExod. 22.2 Deut. 22.26. make it unavoidable) nor willingly to go to war, unless when I am lawfully commanded, for preservation of the peace. Jam 4.1, 2. Q Are these all? A. No, I take my self necessarily en∣gaged, First, to suppress all causeless, and immoderate, long continued (though not causeless) angerMat. 5.21, 22.Secondly, to put away all contumelious, railing, and con∣tentious languageIbid & Ephes. 4.31.. Thirdly, To root out all hatred, and to love even my ene∣mies, and to do them good1 Joh. 3.15 Luk. 10.29. &c. Mat. 5.44..

Eph. 5.3, 4, 5 Col. 3.8. Ezek. 16.49, 50., are thereby prohibited; And that I may not so much as gaze upon a womans beau∣ty to satisfie my lust, without being guil∣ty of hidden AdulteryMat. 5.38. Mat. 5.32.. Q Is there any thing else that you can here observe also to be forbidden? A. Yes, the putting away of a mans wife (except for adultery) and marrying another, or the marrying her that is so put away. Q. What charge doth the eighth Command∣ment give you? A. First, Not to take away or de∣tainJam. 5.4. Deut. 24.15. Pro 3.27, 28. 1 Tim. 5.18. my Neighbours goods, either by force or fraudProv. 11.1. Lev. 19.13, 35 Deut. 25 14.. Secondly, not to with∣hold relief from those that need it1 Joh. 3.17. Prov 14.21. Lev 19.9, 10, 11. Deut 24.19.. Q.

Rō. 1.29, 30.; and all rash judgment, and censures of him in my own breastLuk 6.37. Rom. 14.4. 1 Cor 13.5, 7..
Q. What Obligations do you think the tenth Commandment laies upon you? A. Not to desire to my self the pos∣sessions of my Neighbour, nor to envy them to him; but to be content in what∣soever state I am, without carefulness for the future, Phil. 4.6, 11. Mat. 6. ult. Heb. 13.5. Q Have you never observed any place of scripture that briefly comprehends the sum of all these Commandments? A. Yes, Christ tels me of two Com∣mandments upon which the whole Law and Prophets hang; which are mention∣ed (besides other places) in Mat. 22.37, &c. Mar. 12.30, &c. Rom. 13▪8, 9, 10. Q. What is the meaning of those words which secure all your duty to God, viz. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and all thy soul, and all thy mind, and all thy strength? A. That I esteem and desire him a∣bove all things, and bestow upon him my whole self. Q. What mean you by these words which give your neighbour security from you? viz. Love thy Neighbour as thy self? A. That I deal with every man so justly as I would he should deal with me, and so mercifully as I wish to be dealt withal by God. Q. Canst thou do all these things of thy self without Gods special grace? A. No, without me, saith Christ, ye can do nothing.
Q. How do you think to obtain his grace? A. One way is by frequent prayer of faith. Q. What is frequent prayer? A. That which bears some proporti∣on to my minutely needs, to the great∣ness of the blessings which I ask, and to the favour of being invited to be much in the presence of God, by praying without ceasing. 1 Thes. 5.17. Q. When do you pray in faith? A. When I pray with an humble con∣fidence that God will give what I ask,Jam. 1.5, 6, 7 Heb. 5.7. and with an obedient readiness to do that my self which I desire he would do for me. Q. Hath Christ left any direction for your prayers? A. Yes, he hath taught me when I pray to say,Luk. 11.2, &c. Mat. 6.9, &cOur Father which art in Heaven, hallowed be thy Name, &c. Q. To whom do you direct your Prayer? A. To our Father who is in heaven. Q. What do you mean by that appellation? A. I express by it my reverenceMal. 1.6. Eccl. 5.2. to him, and my faith in him, that his good¦nessMat. 7.11. will, and his powerPsal. 115. can, grant my request for my self and others. Q. What are those requests which you have such an humble confidence that he will grant? A. They are six. In the three first, I more immediately respect his glory, in the three last my own good. Q. What do you desire in the first Peti∣tion,
when you say, Hallowed be thy Name? A. That God may be known to be what he isRom. 11.36. and accordingly esteemedPsal 89.6., worshippedPsa 97.7, 9. and praisedPsa. 113., in wordPsa. 63.4, 5, and deed1 Cor. 10.31. Mat. 5.16. 2 Th. 1.11, 12, throughout the worldPsal. 86.9.. Q. What is it that you pray for in the second, saying, Thy Kingdom come? A. That Christ may so rule in mine own, and all mens hearts by his holy Laws and spiritMat. 24.14. Rom. 6.12, 14., that his Kingdom in this world attaining its just height1 Cor. 15.25., the eternal Kingdome of the Father may appearMat. 13.43.. Q. What do you beg in the third, saying. Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven? A. That he will give to me and to all men else his grace, whereby we may as cheerfully, unanimously, and impartially execute his CommandsAct. 96., and submit to his disposalsAct 21.14.,Cor. 15.28. as the Angels doPs. 103.20 Rev 22.9.. Q. What do you intreat of God in the fourth, saying, Give us this day our daily bread? A. That he would day by dayMat. 6.25, 34. while we are in this world, grant us (in the use of honest means2 Thes. 3.10, 11, 12. 1 Tim 69. Mat. 7.9, 11. Luk. 11.11, 13. Mat. 5.16. 2 Th. 1.11, 12.) all things fitting and sufficient for the support of our bodily p, and spiritual life q. Q. What is it that you ask in the fifth, saying, Forgive us our trespasses, as we? &c. A. That he would not so charge us with our sins as to punish usPsal. 51.1.; we promising the like kindness and mercy to the persons who offend usMat. 5.7..
Q. But Why doth Christ teach us to beg this thing conditionally, rather than any of the rest? A. For two reasons. Q. What is your first? A. To learn us that forgiveness of sin (upon which all our Religion depends,Isa. 1.16, 17. Act. 3.19. and without which we can expect none of the other blessings) is not absolutely granted to any. Q. What is your second? A. To learn us that this particular of forgiving others, is one of the most befit∣tingEph. 4. ult., yet difficult conditionsMat. 18.24, &c. 35.. Q. What do you pray for in the sixth and last petition, saying, Lead us not in∣to temptation, but deliver us from evil? A. That God would give us grace to persevere, and go on to perfection, that we may not fall back to our sins againJoh. 5.14. Joh. 8.11, by the force of any temptation2 Tim. 4.17, 18. Rom. 16.20. 1 Pet. 5.8, 9. Luk. 22.31, 32. from the world, the flesh or the Devil. Q. Why do you so conclude all your re∣quests, saying, For thine is the King∣dom, the Power, and the Glory, for e∣ver and ever? Amen. A. We do again express, First, our sense, that to God of right belongs eter∣nally that dominion, obedience, and ho∣nour, which we ascribed unto him1 Tim. 6.15, 16.; and Secondly, our confidence that he is wil∣ling, able, and in honour, ingaged to grant all these our petitionsMat. 21.22. 2 Cor. 1.20. Ephes. 3 20▪ 21.. The Lord fulfill all thy Petitions, Ps 20.5. FINIS.
