¶ To the right Honourable Lord, Fraun∣ces, Earle of Bedford, one of her maie∣sties most Honourable priuy Councell, Knight of the Noble order of the Garter: A. G. wisheth prosperity in this world, with increase of peace, mercy, and grace, and in the worlde to come life euerla∣sting. ALbeit (right Honourable) the multitude of foolish Pamphlets, & friuolous toys, which in these our dayes are put in print, haue brought almost no lesse contempt of the faculty of printing, then discouragement to those that woulds write more waightye matters: yet I thought it in conscience good for me to bee no more therby discouraged from attempting any thing, which may either tend to the glory of God, or benefit of his Church, then for a man to be squaimish to eate, because he hath seene another surfet. It could not come in my minde (though it rowled too and fro towardes many) vnto whome to dedicate this rude and simple worke of mine, rather then vnto your honour, whose iust & most deserued commēdation, as∣well
in matters of religion, as also in all other politique affayres, as I spare presently to vt∣ter; (because to prayse any man to his face▪ doth seeme rather fained flattery, then pure loue) so the trueth it selfe deuoid of partiality, can not vniustly conceale, nor iniuriously sup∣presse. I coulde easily haue procured vnto my selfe many pulbacks, lets and hindrances▪ from attempting so aduenturous an enterprise, had not the assured knowledge of your Honoures singuler humility, in abasing your self to them of lower degree; fully perswaded me to the con¦trary. Neither the worthinesse of the writer, (who is as bold as blinde Baiyard) nor the ex∣cellency of the worke, (as it proceedeth from so base a workman) deserueth in any wise so ex∣cellent a patronage, but in that it redoundeth to the repairation of the ruines of Christe his Church, whereof as it hath pleased the Lorde in mercy to make you a maintainer, so you will no doubt from Day to Day, and time to time, shew your selfe a notable fauourer, yea, euen of the smallest stones in the building, which (be∣cause they bee neither grauen with curious worke, or pollished with exquisite art) though some doe rashly condemne, yet I know youre honour will not reiect▪ but rather will consider, that notwithstanding the chambers of Christs
church are in some places a trimming vp with beautifull worke, yet in some other places (the groundsell being scarse layd) strong oken Tim∣ber, so it bee sounde, may doe more good, then fine firre if it bee weake. The worke which I make bolde at this time to shrowd vnder your protection, is briefe & pithy, framed in man¦ner of a dialogue, handling al the cheefe points of Chrstianity, with many additions, no lesse profitable then necessary, for those that desire to be further instructed in many points, where I thought it most requisite and conue∣nient. All men, yea euen the simplest, haue neede nowe to get assuraunce of saluation to themselues, not by workes without knowledge, (which bewrayeth intollerable Hipocrisye,) but first by true faith grounded vpon the rock of Gods word, and then by workes proceeding from the same; that they may bee able to giue an account of their fayth, & to stop the mouth of the aduersary in the day of triall. The false Apostles are already craftily crept in, which seeke to vndermine vnstable soules, wresting and writhing the scriptures to their own dam∣nation, whose iudgement is iust: for the Lorde hath sente them strong delusions, that they should beleeue lies, that all may bee damned which beleeue not the trueth, but haue plea∣sure
in vnrighteousnesse, & as they haue not regarded to know God, so God hath deliuered them vp to a reprobate minde, to doe those things which are not conuenient. The cheefe respect and finall end of this my small labour, according to my poore Talent, is to helpe the simpler sort, whom I know (the more is the pi∣ty) to be yet besotted with ignorance, whome I seeke rather to enstruct, because they bee not skilfull, then to confound the aduersary, who is very subtill. Wherefore I present this small worke vnto your honour, as a token of my vn∣fained good will, and great zeal towards you, beeing readye at all times, and in all places to perfourm all other duties, wherwith the Lord shall enable mee, with no lesse feruent prayers to the Lerde for your health of bodye to his pleasure in this life, then cuntinuall supplica∣tions, for the placing of your soule and body in the heauens, with our cheefe Lorde and Cap∣tain Iesus Christ, among the angels and bles∣sed saints, in the life to come, of which ioy the Lorde make your honour, and all those that loue the cmming of Christ▪ partakers, for the same Christes same. Amen. Your honours most bounden; Alexander Gee.
A Christian mans duety.  The reward of sinne. The ground of Christiani∣tie. In maner of a Dialogue, betweene PAVLE and TITVS. PAVLE. WHat is the chiefest duety of a Christian man in this life. TITVS. The chiefest duety of man, and not of man onely, but of all the creatures in the world, in their nature is to set forth the Gen. 1, 26. eph▪ 1, 6. exod. 9, 16. psa. 8, 1.glory of God. PA. How shall we performe this duety? TI. To perfourme this duety it is necessary to know vnto what death we by our selues are subiect, what great saluation God of his Dent. 4, 37 & 7, 7, 8▪ ios. 4. 2 psa 44. 3. ioh 15, 16. act. 13, 48, & 2, 14. rom. 5, 6, & 9, 11, 1, & 11, 7, 35. 1. cor. 4, 7. eph. 1, 4, & 2, 10. colo. 1, 12. 2 tim. 1, 9.free mercy hath giuen vnto vs through faith, and what thankfulnes we owe vnto him for our deliuerance. PA. Tell me these thinges in order, first, what is sinne, and what doth it deserue. TI. 1. Ioh 3, 4. Sinne is the breach of the law of God, con∣teined in the ten commandements: and the reward of this sinne is eternall death. PA. Rehearse the ten commaundements. TI. Exod. 20. 1.

PA. VVhat meaneth the second commandement that we shall not make any grauen image? TI. In this commaundement be contained three thinges: first▪ that we should not thinke God to be like either Deut 4. 15 &c. act. 17, 27 esai. 40, 18, 25 esai. 6. 3.man or woman, gold or siluer, or any o∣ther thing, and therefore that we make no image of God in any case. Secondly, that onely Iohn. 4. 24.in spirit and truth we worship God alone, and beside him none Psalm. 97, 7 esa. 44, 19 dan. 4, 18.other, no Saint, no Angell, no creature, and there∣fore that vve make no image of any other thing, ei∣ther to worship the image it selfe, either God, Saint, or Angell, by the image, neyther Abac 2, 18 ier. 10, 14, 16.yet to this ende, to be the better put in minde of God by the image. Thirdly, that we worship not God in any Deut 12, 32 & 5, 32, ios. 1, 7outward worship according to our ovvne fantasies, but one∣ly as himselfe hath commaudded in his vvorde. PA. VVhat meaneth the third commaundement,
Oth forbidden.  The vse of the Sabbaoth. that we should not take the name of God in vaine. TI. God chargeth vs in this commaundement these three things: first, that Deut. 28. 58 59 p al. 8, 1 iere. 10, 6 2 hro 29, 13we vse with most high reuerence the name of God whensoeuer we speake or think vpon him.

As for Masse, Crosse, Roode, or such other, we ought so to detest such manner of Idols, that they shoulde not once be named among vs. PA. VVhat meaneth the fourth commandement, Remember thou keepe holy the sabbaoth day? TI. The hallowing of the Sabbaoth day is, to rest from Deut 5, 14 exod 16, 26▪our labour in our calling, and in one place to assemble our selues together, and with feare and reuerence, to heare, marke, and lay Math. 13, 23vp in our hearts the word of God Acts 20, 7 & 15, 21 & 13, 15 16. luke. 4, 16preached vnto vs, to Math 18, 19.pray alto∣gether that which we 1 Cor. 14, 15vnderstād with one consent and at the times appointed 1 Cor. 11. 33 acts 2. 42 acts 20. 7.to vse the Sacraments in faith and repentance, and all our life long to Num. 29 7. heb. 4. 9. 10.rest from sinne and wickednes, that the Lord by his ho∣ly spirite may vvorke in vs his good vvorke, and so

The meaning of it is, that we should honour, that is to say, loue, feare, obey, and relieue our Leuit. 19, 3. & 3, 20, 22, 23. ephe. 6, 1, 2, 3.Pa∣tents, or any other that are vnto vs in their steede, as our Exo 2, 28. rom. 13. 1, tit. 3, 1.Princes, Rulers, & Magistrats, Heb. 13, 17. 1. thes. 5, 12. 13our Pastors, and teachers, our Eph. 6, 5, 6, 7. tit. 2, , 10.masters, and all other vvhich are aboue vs in any calling placed by God, the Leui. 19, 32.aged & grayheaded.

Cor. 7, 2, 9 heb. 13. 4.gift of chastity be not giuen vs, to vse the lawfull remedy appointed by God, which is marriage. PA. VVhat meaneth the eight commandement, Thou shalt not steale? TI. In this commandement the Lord forbiddeth all Leuit. 1, 11 de, 5, 19. eph. 4, 28.stealing and robbing in outvvarde dedes, all 1. Thessa. 4, 6deceit, all Exo 22, 21.lying and oppression, all Deut. 2, 14 am▪ 5, 4.withholding of the labourers hie, all Deut. 10, 19.vnurteousnesse to the stranger, widowe, and fatherlesse, all Amos. 2, 6.gifts to peruert iudgement, all Leui. 19, 36. deut. 25, 13. pou. 0, 10 mich 6, 11.false measures, coueousnesse, and whatsoeuer vvrongfull dealing.

PA. VVhat meaneth the ninth commandement, Thou shalt bear no fals witnes against thy neibour. TI. Herein the Lord God doth command vs: First, that we should neuer speak pro 19. 5, 9 & 21, 28.falsly in witnes bea∣ring.

Fiftly, on the contrary side, vvee must carefully and boldly testify all trueth, vvhatsoeuer vve knovv to the futtherance of iustice. PA. VVhat meaneth the tenth commandement, Thou shalt not couet thy neighbours house? TI. Here in playne wordes God forbiddeth all in∣ward Rom. 7, 7.desire vvhatsoeuer is vnlavvfull to bee done, vvhich desire is not onely sinneful vvhen vve Gen. 6, 5 & 8, 21. prou. 20. 9.con∣sent vnto it, but the very motion is enemy to God and banished from his presence, for it is vnpossible those bodies shoulde see God, vvhich can nourish euill concupisences in them, euen as it is impossi∣ble 1 Cor. 15, 50.that corruption should inherite incorruption, or that flesh and bloud in this similitude of Ephe 4. 22 collos. 3, 9.old A∣dam should inherit the kingdome of God. So that by this commaundement, most clearely vvee may see the image of that man that pleaseth God, euen such a one in vvhome is nothing impure, neither in wil nor nature. PA. Canst thou fulfill all these commandementes, vvithout breaking any one of them? TI. These are the commaundementes of al∣mightye God, the perfect fulfilling vvhereof, Rom 3, 23 24 & 8, 3, 4 & 11, 32 1 iohn 1. 8.no fleh can attaine vnto, no although I doe all that I can, yet I breake them daily, both in thought, word, and deede. PA. VVhat punishment doth God appointe for breaking any one of them? TI. The punishment for the breaking of the least commaundement euen in Math. 5, 28thought, yea if it vvere but Iam. 2, 10. gal. 3, 10.once in all my life, is the heauy wrath of God,
Reward of sinne.  God is mercifull and iust. which hath no end, & Deut▪ 27, 26. gal 3. 10.his euerlasting cursse, which conteineth all the tormentes that can bee deuised both of soule and body, and in the scripture is cal∣led by diuers names, to expresse the pain, Math▪ 10 28. & 25. 41 mark. 9, 4.as hel fire the Mark. 9. 44.worme that neuer dieth, vtter Math 22. 13. math. 25. 30.darknes, Apoc. 19, 20. & 20. 14.bur∣ning lake, second Apoc. 20. 6 & 21, 8.death, damnation, and such like. PA. Now I know what is sinne, euen the breache of the Lawe of God, and because of the excellencye of Gods maiesty, which by sinne is offended, I see the greatnesse of sinne, and how it deserueth eternal death, of which without exception, by nature we are guilty But tell me nowe, is there no punishmente in this life, by which we may recompence our sinne. TI. There is no sufficiente recompence in the vvorld, no goodes nor multitude of riches, no libe∣rality to the uk. 17. 10.poore, no whipping, nor Col. 2. 23scourging, nor hurte of thine ovvne bodye, nothing that thou canst deuise, so precious is the Psal. 49, 8.redemption of the soule, and the continuance for euer. PA. Yea but God is mercifull, vvill he therefore punish sinne so sharply thinkest thou? TI. God is in deede a God of all 2 Cor. 1, 3. psal. 145, 8 psal. 86. 15 psal. 111. 4 & 116. 5 ioel. 2 13. ions 4. 2.mercies, & fa∣ther of all consolations, vvhose louing kindnesse hath no end, and in the great riches of his compas∣sions he hath appointed to make knowne the glory of his maiesty vnto his childrē: but God is also Psa. 7. 9 & 11. 7 8. rom. 3. 4 iohn. 3. 33 2 chro. 12. 6 ioh▪ 9. 19. esai. 45. 2 apo. 16. 5.iust, & iudgeth righteously, and therefore of iustice and trueth, hee must punish such as through infidelitye despise the ritches of his goodnes, and disobey the vvord of his glorious power, vvith that punishment vvhich he hath appointed for sinne. PA. Seeing then this punishment must needes be suffered, are we in our selues able to suffer and ouer∣come
How we may be deliuered from Gods anger.  Saluation onely in Christ. it. TI. None is able to suffer and psal. 130, 3 mal. 19, 25, 26. apoc. 6, 16, 17.ouercome this great punishment of sinne, being onely man. PA. Sith that sinne hath condemned vs to eternal death vvithout already in our selues, tel mee novve hovv we may be deliuered from the anger of God, and pains euerlasting. TI. Mark and I vvill tell thee, pray vnto God to giue thee vnderstanding, and to be lovv in humility of spirite, I vvill declare the saluation of the Lorde vvhen vve had sinned, and by sinne had Eph, 5, 5, 6 heb, 3, 17prouoked God to anger, and so were Act, 26, 18 1. cor, 15, 22.subiect to Satan, hel, & condemnation, that the righteousnes of God might stand, it vvas necessary that these things shoulde be born and suffered, the anger of God, the tyranny of Satan, and the paines of Hell, vvhich all follovved sinne, and therfore he that shal be a sauiour for out sinnes, Gal. 3, 13. 2. cor. 5, 21.he must take this vpon him, & in his ovvne righteousnes he must be deliuered again from them PA. For so much as the iustice of God requireth, that sinne bee punished in the nature of man by vvhich it vvas committed, tell me then, vvhere shall we finde such a sauiour. TI. The Lord psal. 25, 4 colo 1, 27.lighten our eies, that vve may vn∣derstād the Eph. 3, 18riches of his glorious mistry, the Lord reueale his secrete vnto vs, the Lorde make vs se vvith all his saintes, vvhat is the height, the bredth, the length, and the depth, that vvee maye sing vnto him the praises of al his mercies. This sauiour whō vve seeke for, vvho for our sinnes must taste Heb, 2, 9, 10death, and yet in the power of Rom, 1, 4his ovvn righteousnesse must rise from death to life, he cannot be psa, 74, & 49 , & 146, 3, 4.found a∣mongst the children of men.

Pet. 2, 4.vvayed them dovvne to hel, and bound them for euer in the chaines of darknesse: so that in men and angels there i no hope, but God that is Ephe. 2, 4.ritch in mercies & whoe compassions haue none end, he sent his ovvne sonne in the Rom. 8, 3.simili∣tude of sinfull fleshe to be a Redeemer, and to con∣demne sinne in the fleshe, so that this is the Saui∣our sent into the vvorld, euen Iesus Christ the righ∣teous, in Col. 2, 9.vvhom the fulnes of the Godhead doth dvvell bodily, that vvhen there vvas no saluation in al creatures, God might 2. Cor. 5, 19.be in Christ, and reconcile the vvorld to him selfe. PA. Seeing then the oddes & variance is between the immortall God and mortall man, and that the mediatour betvveen them must needes haue of the nature of both the parties, vvhich are to be agreed, and also haue ageement vvith both the parties, or othervvise he should haue no mean to agree them, shevv me the reasons thereof. TI. As it vvas necessary that Christ shold be Math. 3, 15. rom. 5, 1. 2. cor. 5, 21.god, or else he could not haue been so perfect righteous as the law of God required, nor yet haue borne the heauy burthen of si so it vvas also necessary, that he shoulde be 1.

VVhat ïs true sayth. haue been partakers of his grace, if he had not been partaker of our nature; nor we could not haue ben free from the vvrath of God, and rigour of his lavv, except our nature in him had felt his fathers anger, and he perfect man for vs had beene accurssed: For God had so appointed, that the soule that had sin∣ned, it should dye, and he is not Num. 23. 29.like vnto man that he should repent, but the word that he had spoken, he would surely accomplish: and therfore that God might be righteous in his iudgementes, Christ vvas man like vnto vs, and so in our flesh offered himselfe vnto death, as if he should haue said vnto his father, Execute, O God, thy iudgements against man; and Psalm. 40. 4 heb. 10, 7, 8.lo, beholde me a perfect man, I vvill be are them. And thus was our sauiour Iesus Christ perfect God, that he might be stronger then Satan, and take sinne avvay and Luke 23, 47 rom. 1, 3. 1. tim 15, 1. ioh. 4, 2. 1 pet. 2. 22.perfect man, that vve might haue parte of his redemption, vvho in all things vvas like vnto vs, sinne onely excepted. PA. Sith Christ God and man hath thus payde the punishment of our sinnes, are vve novv all dischar∣ged before God? TI.

PA. VVhat callest thou this true faith? TI. This true and liuely faith is a full Col 2. 2. 1 iohn 3. 2. eph, 3, 2 & 1, 18 rom 3. 38. 39.persuasion and assurance of my Rom▪ 10. 9. ephe. 3, 17, 18.heart, grounded vppon the Rom. 4, 3▪ & 10. 8 & 1▪ 16promise of God, and vvrought in me by the holy Eph. 1, 17, 18 1 cor. 1. 22 & 5, 5. 1 cor. 2 10 & 2, 4, 14.Ghost, whereby I am fully assured that vvhatsoe∣uer Christ hath wrought for mans saluation, per∣teineth

How can it bee that thy sinnes are forgiuen thee, and yet according to Gods truth, fully punni∣shed vvith that punnishment vvhich God hath ap∣poynted for sinnes? TI. By this my true fayth, I see my sinnes both to be forgiuen, & yet fully punished: for in Iesus Christ to satisfie 2 Corin. 5. 21. rom. 3. 25. 26.Gods iustice, they be 1. Ioh. 2. 1. 2. galat. 3. 13. rom 4. 25.fully punished, & yet to me they be 2 Cor. 5. 19.orgiuen, because in me they be not punished, but in Christ for me, to set forth Gods mercye, and therefore shall neuer be layde to my sai. 50. 8. rom. 8. 33.charge. In this maner therefore I see the Lorde my God to be most mercifull and iust. PA. Yea, but although the punishment of thy sins be payd in Christ, yet seeing there can no vnrighte∣ousnesse dwell vvith God, how canst thou stand be∣fore Gods iudgement seat as righteous, seeing thou haste no righteousnesse but such as is stayned vvith so many sinnes. TI. I stand as iust and righteous before the throne of God, not clothed with mine ovvne righteous∣nesse vvhich I haue vvrought in mine ovvne per∣person, but with the 1 Cor 1 30. 2. Corin. 5. 27.righteousnesse of Iesus Christ, vvhich righteousnesse beeing taken hold vpon by a Abac. 2. , rom. 3. 28. ios. 3. 18. gal. 2. 16. & 3▪ 11. eph. 2. 8.true and liuely fayth, is made mine. Thus am I iust in the sight of God, not in respecte of mine ovvne vvorkes vvhich I haue vvrought, but taking holde vpon Christes workes to be mine by fayth. PA. Doth not this make men runne into all sinne and vvickednesse. TI. No, for this true fayth, as soone as it is wrought

PA. Rehearse the umme of this fayth. TI. I beleeue in God the father almighty, &c. PA. VVhy mkest thou mention of God the Fa∣ther, God the Sonne, and God the holy Ghost, see∣ing there is but one God? TI. As the scripture teacheth vs most plainely that there is but one God, so likewise it teacheth vs, that in this dinine essence three persons do subsist, being in deede distinct in their seuerall properties, the fa∣ther, Mah 3. 16. & 28. 19. 1. ioh. 5. 7.the sonne, and the holy Ghoste, which three persons are one God Act. 17. 22. deut▪ 4. 12. 1. cori. 12. 11.eternall, infinite & most per∣fect in it selfe. And when God shall giue vs such eies as shall be able to see the glorious maiestye of his Godhead, then we shall haue also such heauenly wisedome as shall easily perceiue the distinction of the persons. In the meane while vve vvill beleeue the truth of his eternal worde, and hate and detest all contraty heresies. PA. God grant vnto vs all this sobrietie. But tell me now, what beleeuest thou concerning God the Father? TI. Firste I beleeue that God the Father through Christ, into Io. 1. 12. rom. 8. 1. 11. galac. 3. 26.whose body I am grafted by fayth, is not onely a Rom. 8 25. 16 2 Corin. 6. 18.father of other faithfull, but euen my father, and therefore loueth Rom. 5. 8. 9. s. 54. 6. 7. 8.me. Secondly, that he
Christ God and man.  Christ our Lord and Sauiour. is almighty, that is, that he hath all Esa. 45 5▪ 6. 7. 12 & 46 10. 11.power in his hande, guiding and ruling all things, so that nothing can be done in Amos. 3. 6. psa. 139. 7. 8. 9. 10.heauen, earth nor hell, without his prouidence. PA. VVhat beleeuest thou concerning God the Sonne? TI. I beleue that Iesus Christ is one God, Rom. 9. 5. 1. h 10. 11.in sub stance vvith the Father and the holy Ghoste, took Rom. 1. 3. math. 1. 20.flesh of the virgine, and is become perfect man, as I am, in all things, sinne onely excepted, Heb. 2. 14. 15and in my nature hath wrought for me whatsoeuer is needeful for my saluation. PA. VVhat meaneth the name Iesus? TI. Iesus is as much to say, a Math. 1. 21.Sauiour, because he hath saued his people from their sinnes. PA. VVhy is he called Christ? TI. Because he was ordayned of the Father, and was annointed of the holy Eph 4. 7. ioh. 3. 34. luk. 4. 18.Ghost the highest pro∣phet and Doctor, vvhich hath opened vnto vs the secrete counsell, and all the vvill of his Father con∣cerning our redemption and deliueraunce, and the Heb. 9. 26. 28. & 7. 25.highest priest, who with one sacrifice & offering of his body, and no mo, hath appeased Gods vvrath, bought vs againe, and continually maketh interces∣sion for vs to his Father, and a king vvhich gouer∣neth vs by his worde and his spirite▪ and defendeth and keepeth the saluation vvhich vve haue gotten by him. PA. In vvhat respect sayest thou that hee is our Lord. TI. Not onely because we are his creatures, but chiefly because he buying 1 Cori. 6. 20.againe our bodies and souls from sinne, not 1. Pet. 1. 18. 19. Act. 20. 28. Apo. 5. 9.with gold nor siluer, but with

PA. VVhat meanest thou when thou sayest, He suffered vnder Ponce Pilate. TI. Because the maner of death which men doe suffer by the sentence of the Iudge, and vnder the title of Iustice, is more Deut. 21. 23. philip 2. 8. gal. 2. 13.shamefull, slaundrous, and terrible, then if a man shoulde dye naturally in his bed, therefore Christe tooke on him our person to shevv him selfe before an Psal. 2. 2. act. 4. 27. 28.earthly Iudge, and to be condemned by the Math. 27. 26. iohn. 19. 1. 13. 19.mouth of Pilate, he beeing then Iudge, that thereby vve might be cleared be∣fore the iudgement seat of God. PA. VVhat meanest thou vvhen thou sayest Christ vvas crucified, dead, and buried. TI. I meane that he payde the whole and full sa∣tisfaction for our sinnes, which he tooke vpon him he vvas bound, to vnbinde vs, condemned to Esa. 53 12. Rom. 1. 8. 1. Pet. 2. 24.deli∣uer vs; he suffred great and infinite shame, to deli∣uer vs from all confusion; hee vvas nayled Colos. 2. 14. luk. 23. 33.on the Crosse, to fasten thereon our sinnes, he dyed and sustained the cursse and malediction which was Gal. 3. 13. 14.due to vs, to appease the vvrath of God for euer by his onely oblation once made, he was Math. 27. 57. 58. mark. 15. 43. luk. 23. 52. ioh. 19. 40.buried to ap∣proue and verifie his death, and to vanquish death, euen to the house thereof, that is to saye, euen to the graue, vvherein he felt no corruption, to de∣clare
How Christ de scended into Hell. that euen in dying, he had ouercome and van∣quished death. PA. VVhat meanest thou concerning this, that Christ descended into hell? TI. I meane that (vvhether vvee doe take this vvorde Hell, for 1. Sam. 2. 6. Psal. 18. 4 & 9. 13 & 30. 3. act. 2. 24.death it selfe, and for the extrea∣mest and greatest perils, dangers, and griefes, dolors and anguishes, that a man can sufer here in this vvorlde, and vvhereby he may be brought vnto his death, and consequently for 1. Cor 15. 55the sling and povver of death, for the iudgement and wrath of God, and for the bottomlesse pit of all miseries & calamities: vvhen our Sauiour Christ vvas so ouragiously delt vvithall, vvhen he did sweat Luk 22. 44.bloud, when his soule vvas heauy, euen vnto he Math 2. 38.death and when he was hanged most opprobriously, depitefully and hay∣nously betwixt two theeues, as Math. 2. 46. psal. 22. 1.forsaken of God and all creatures, vvithour ayde, helpe, or comfort, and so hanging on a tree, did giue vp the ghost, bea∣ring the cuisse, and anger of God, vvhich is a verye hell, & feeling vpon him the condemnation, paines and torments that were due vnto vs for our sinnes) then vven the in deed down into hel, which thoght to ouervvhelme him, but it coulde not, becaue he vvas both vvithout sinne, and also the true and na∣turall sonne of God. And doubtles most especially he descended into hel, when he did by his diuine po∣vver make all the elect, whose soules vvere in Abra∣hams bosome, to feele Ioh. 5. 25. 28. & 11. 25. 26. rom 14. 8. 9.

Christes ascention. godly might, that they were depryued of the merits of his death and passion, and of the grace, health, & saluation, purchased vnto his elect and chosen chil∣dren. PA. VVhat fruite haste thou by this death of Christ? TI. Firste, I beleeue that this death and punish∣ment vvhich Christ suffered, is Heb. 9. 12. 13. 2. 28. 1 pet. 2. 1. 1. ohn. 2. 2.the appeasing of Gods vvrath, and a full satisfaction to God for all my sinnes. Secondly, that Galat. 5. 24. rom. 6. 6. 7. 8. 11.as he is dead for sinne, so he will cause sinne to dye in my mortall body. PA. VVhat proit hast thou by the rysing againe of Christ? TI. Firste, I am assured by his rising againe from death, that he hath 1. Cor. 15. 55. 56. rom. 8. 33. 34. rom. 4. 25.ouercome death, hel, and sinne, and hath finished my iustification. Secondly, that as he is risen from death, so he causeth me as a mem∣ber of him to Rom. 6. 4. colos. 1. 2. 3.rise from sinne and delight in righ∣teousnesse. Thirdly, he rising againe by his own po∣vver neuer to dye any more, is a sure pledge to mee, that 1. Cor. 15. 16. 20.my body shall in like maner rise againe, and be quickned in him for euer. PA. VVhat is the meaning of this, that Christ as∣cended into heauen? TI. Christ as touching his manhoode is Act. 1. 11. & 3. 2.onely in heauen, but in his Math. 28. 20.Godhead and comfort of his hol spirit he is with vs to the end of the world PA. VVhat good gettest thou by the ascending of Christ into heauen? TI. First Christ his ascending into heauen is a sue pledge vnto me, that Ioh. 14. 3. phil. 3. 21. collos. 3 4. 1. thes. 4. 17.I shall in like maner as a mē∣ber of him, by his power be receiued into heauen in the same nature wherein he is ascended. Secondly,
Christes ascension.  Iudgement. Holy Ghost.  Catholique Church. Christ hauing ascended into heauen maketh Rom. 8. 34. heb. 9. 24. 1. Ioh. 2. 1. 2.con∣tinuall intercession for me. PA. VVhat is the meaning of this, that Christ sit∣teth at the right hand of the Father? TI. Christ sitteth at the right hand of the Father, that is, hath Mat. 28. 18. ephe. 1. 28. 21. 22.all power giuen him of the father ouer all things. PA. VVhat fruit doest thou receiue by this, that Christe shall come to iudge the quicke and the dead? TI. To me that am a member of Christ, it is a sin∣gular comfort, Math. 24. 31. & 25 34. luk. 21. 27. 28. 1. The. 1. 10.vvhen I knovve that none shal be my iudge, but he that is my Sauiour: but terrible it vvill be to those that flee from Christ, Math. 25. 41. luk. 21. 25. 26. 2. Thes. 1. 8.vvhen they shall see him come to iudge them, vvhome they in their life time refused to be their Phisition and Sa∣uiour. PA. VVhat beleeuest thou concerning God the holy Ghost? TI. I beleeue that God the holy Ghost dwelleth in my heart, as the Rom. 8. 9. 11. 15. 16. 17. gal. 4. 6. eph. 1. 17. 18.seale of mine election, and per∣suadeth me that Christes benefits are all mine, and vvorketh in me that I dye vnto Eph 4. 23 24. collos. 2. 11. 12. 13.sinne, and liue vn∣to righteousnesse. PA Nowe tell me vvhat callest thou the Catho∣lique Church? TI. The catholique Church is the Rom. 8. 29. ephe 1. 10. 11. 12. math. 16. 18. ioh. 10. 16.vvhole com∣pany of true faithfull people, vvhich euer were since the beginning of the world in all places, vvhich also be novv, and shall be to the ende of the vvorld: of the vvhich number I beleeue that I am Rom 8. 16. 2. corn. 13. 5.one, I be∣leeue that God 2.

The communion of Saints, is the societie that we vvhich beleeue haue vvith God, through Christ Iesus▪ and vvhich all we haue one vvith anoher, as 1. Cor 12. 13 & 10. 17. eph. 4. 15. & 5. 30. col. 1. 18. rom. 12. 5.members of our head Iesus Christ, vvhereby vve are Luk. 11. 28. gal. 6. 2 ph▪ 2. 1. 2. 3. 4.ready to communicate al Gods benefites both spirituall and temporall, to the mutuall helpe and comfort one of another, according to the meaure of fayth which wee haue receyued of God in this life. PA. VVhat is it to beleeue the forgyuenesse of Sinnes? TI. I beleeue that Iesus Christ hath vvholly 1. Ioh. 2. 2. col 1. 14. 19. 20. 21▪ 22. 1. Gor. 1. 30. esa. 53. 4. 5. 8. 12. rom. 3. 23. 24 25. & 5. 8. .

VVhat beleeuest thou of the resurrection of the body? TI. I beleeue that after this lyfe ended, my soule Eccles. 12. 7. Luk. 16. 22. & 23. 43.shall go to God that gaue it, and that my bodye shall rest i the graue till the appointed time, and then I shall Iob. 19. 26. 27. 1. Cor. 15. 42. 43. 1.

The Lord increase this sayth in vs. But tell m, haue vve this fayth in our ovvne power to be∣leeue of our selfe will. TI. No, but sayth is the gyft h. 2. . phil. . 29. 2▪ Thes. 1. 3. & 3. 2.of God, euen as our saluation likevvise is, and of our selues there is not one of vs that can so much as name the Lorde Iesus, but it is wrouht in  by the holy Ghoste Ioh. 17. 20. Rom. 14. 17. 1. tim. 3. 15. 1 Cor. 1. 21.through the preaching of the vvorde, confirmed, and made strong through the vse of the same vvord and Sacramentes. PA. VVhat callst thou Sacramentes? TI. Sacramentes be Gen. 17. 11. Exod. 12. 3. 4.outwarde signes ordayned of God for the greater assurance and strengthning of our fayth, beeing vnto vs Rom 4 11.sure pledges of those benefits of our saluation which we receiue in Christ to be outs, and are represented vnto vs y the out∣vvarde signes of vvater in Baptisme, and breade and vvine in the Supper. They serue also for a marke of our profession, whereby vve differ from other people vvhich be heathen. PA. How many Sacraments be there? TI. There be two 1 Cor. 10. 1. 2 ioh. 19. 34.Sacramentes, that is to say, Baptisme, and the Supper of the Lorde. PA. VVhat strength of fayth haue vve through our Baptisme?
The vse of Baptisme.  Of the Lords Supper. TI. Baptisme is a seale and token by which God vvill haue me assured that Mark. 1. 4. act. 21. 16.my sinnes are forgiuen me, and that my lyfe is acceptable in his sight▪ for as the vvater vvasheth away the filthynes of the body, euen so should I through the holy Ghost be therby fully certified that the Act. 22. 16. eph 5. 26. tit. 3 5. 6. 1. Pet. 1. 2. & 3. 21. 1. iob. 1 7. 8.bloud of Christ being sprin∣kled vppon my soule by the Act. 15. 9.hande of faith, hath vvashed away both the giltinesse of my sin, and the punishment due to the same. And as after our out∣vvarde vvashiug the body is more comely, so after our Baptisme the spirite of God vvorketh in vs that sinne Rom 6. 3. 4. 5. 6. &c.is dead in our mortall bodyes, and vve be ri∣sen vp into 2. Cor. 5. 17. gal. 5. 24. 25.newnes of lyfe, and in vvhom soeuer baptisme hath not this worke, he may well haue the name, but in deed he is no Christian. PA. VVhat strengthning of our sayth do we finde in the vse of the Lords Supper? TI. The Supper of the Lorde doth through the holy Ghost strengthen my fayth, that I shoulde not doubt, but as surely as I receiue the bread, & vvine into my body to become of perfect substance vvith my flesh, 1. Cor 1. 30. & 10. 16.so Christ hath giuen him selfe wholly to become mine, and nourisheth my soule to euerla∣sting lyfe, Rom. 4. 25.his death and passion is my deliuerance from sin, his 2. Cor 5. 21.righteousnes is my iustification: euen so surely confirmed vnto me, as if I my self had per∣formed in mine owne body that moste holy obedi∣ence vnto his father, vvhich he alone fulfilled. Thus I receiue the Sacraments as signes and seales of the righteousnes that is by fayth. PA. Are not then the bread and vvine in the Sup∣per of the Lorde, turned into the body and bloude of Christ?
No transubstantiation.  Preparation to the Lords Supper. TI. The breade and wine as touching their na∣ture and substance, are Mat. 26. 29. mat. 14. 2 1. cor. 1  1. & 11.  2. 28.not turned, but as touching the vse of them, they differ from common breade & vvine, in that they are appoynted of God to serue vnto vs as Rom. 4. 11.seales and pledges of those benefites which Christ to his body wrought for vs. PA. Now then for as much as the Lordes Supper in respecte that it is holye, it muste haue the guestes holy, and it refuseth them that be prophane, and in respect that it is misticall, it must haue such guestes which are able by their well practised sences, to dis∣tinct the invvard mysteries from that which appea∣reth to the eyes: and in that it hath a remembrance, it requireth a mindefull heart of the good turne re∣ceyued. Tell me therefore in vvhat manner ough∣test thou to prepare thy seife to the receyuing of thse misteries? TI. In preparing my selfe to receyue the Supper of the Lorde, I ought diligently to obserue these three thinges. First, to 1. Cor 11. 28examine my selfe vvhether I 2. Cor. 13. 5.stand in sayth or no, vvhich I shall know if I feele my 2. Cor. 1. 21. 22. & 5 5. eph 1. 13.hart Rom. 8. 15. eph 3. 12.assured by the spirit of God, that the 1. Ioh 1. 12.pu∣nihment of my sinnes is fully discharged in Christ: and that vvhatsoeuer he hath done perteyneth not onely to others, but euen Esai. 53 6. 7. 8. 9. &c. eph 3. 17. 1. tim. 15 16.to me. Secondly, to exa∣mine my selfe, whether I finde my selfe invvardly 1 Cor. 4 4. ioe. 2. 12. 13. mat 26. 15. 2. co. 7. 10. 11.sory for my sinnes, vvith an inward hatred and lo∣thing of sinne, and an Rom 6. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. & 8. 11. phi. 3. 13. 14.earnest desire and sure pur∣pose vvholly to conforme my selfe to the vvill of Gods word. Thirdly▪ i any offence be betwixt o∣thers and me, that I Mat 5. 23 24.reconcile my selfe vnto them. All these thinges, although they ought earnstly to be considered in the vvhole course of our Lu. 1. 74. 75.life, yet
Our works imperfect.  True causes of well doing. then especially vvhen vve come to the Supper of the Lorde. PA. Sith that this is then the doctrine of saluation, that when vve vvere dead through sinne, God of his great mercy sent his sonne to be made man, to dye for our sinnes, and to fulfill all righteousnes, Math. 315.that he might bring agayne lyfe into the vvorlde, and so giue that lyfe vnto euery one whosoeuer should re∣ceiue the holy Ghost to beleeue, that so vve might be saued by fayth, vvho before were condemned by our vvorkes. VVhereto then now serueth our wel∣doing, or vvhat auayleth it to do good workes? TI. True it is, our good vvorkes deserue Esai. 64. 6. pro. 35. 7. psal. 16 2.nothing at Gods hand, for in his sight our good vvorkes are not good, and all our righteousnesse is like a defiled cloth, and vvere they neuer so manye, yet by them God receyueth nothing at our handes, and all our vvell doing extendeth not vnto him: and therefore if vve vvill aske any thing by vvorkes, we must aske of them of whom we haue deerued it, at the hands of God we can aske nothing, and therfore as tou∣ching merite, we will let our vvorkes alone, but we haue greater causes of vvell doing, and which ought more to enforce vs, then eyther lyfe or death: vve must do vvell, first to shevve our thankfull Rom. 6. 11. 12. & 12. . 1▪ pet. 2. 5.heartes to our Sauiour Christ, & to testifie our loue towards him, vvith keeping his commandementes: by which workes, vve make our election more certaine vnto our selues. Againe, vve ought to doe vvell, that our example may call our brethren vnto righteousnesse that they also may become with vs of the houshold of fayth.

A Godly Prayer. And againe (O Lord) I see thy heauy vvrath, ven∣geance, and iudgement against sinne to be intolle∣rable, so that the least vvicked thought and moste secret cogitation of my heart procureth thy vvrath & cursse, vvhich haue none ende, the tormentes of hell, and euerlasting fire, yea although in all my life I had but once in thought broken any one of thy cō∣maundements. Exod 20. 5. luk. 18. 7. 8. psal. 5. 5. 2. cor. 6. 14.And I know, O Lorde God, that thou art true and iust, and canst not abide sinn and vvickednesse, but vvilt iustly punish euery sinn with the selfe same tormentes of hell vvhich thy iustice hath appointed.

I looke into my selfe vievving mine ovvne povver, vvhether I am able to ouercome this punishment of sinne or no, and I see that the most cruell and paynefull punnishmente that I can deuise to my selfe, as in vvhipping my body all the dayes of my life, wearing haire cloth, pining my selfe vvith fasting, or any other payne.

VVherfore I am driuen from my selfe, and all that I can doe to eeke this punishment ischarged othervvhere, or else to quayle and perishe for euer, vnder the heauy burden of sinne, I see there is no hope for me in An gelles, Saints, and mortall men, but only in that per∣fect man Christ Iesus thy deare sonne, in vvhome I see the full punishment of my sinnes fully payed, sa∣tisfied, discharged and ouercome. In him I see death vanquished, the payne of hell in victory svvallovved vp, the cursse satisfied, & the eternity of the punish∣ment through his euerlasting povver ouerreached: This I see, O Lorde, by the eyes of sayth, beeing through thy holye spirite fully assured, that all the vvhole punishment of sinne payed by my Sauiour Christ, is not onely payd for other men, but also for me and my sinne.

VVhat it is to giue glory to God. PAVLE. WHat is it, I pray thee tell me, to giue glory to God? TITVS. No man can yeeld true glory vnto God, without the true knowledge of Christ. 1. Cor. 20. 31 ephe. 4▪ 3. 21. iudg. 15. apoc. 4. 9. & 5. 13. & 19. 7.Verily man was created to this ende, that he should glorifie his Creator. But through the fall of our first parentes, it came to passe that neither he knew God aright, Rom. 1. 20. 21no gloified him aright. If thou demaunde what it is to giue glorye vnto God: to giue glory vnto any bodye, is nothing else but to attribute true vertue vnto him, as vvhen some King dealeth iustly vvisly, valiauntly, and mercifully, his subiectes yeeld him glory, that is to say, his subiectes like well of his doynges, and vvith singuler good vvil doe blaze them abroad.

The wisedome of God is seene in this, that he re∣paireth againe men vvhome he had created to his glory, so as he might be his sonne borne of a vir∣gine, recouer again the image of God, which he had lost through sinne, and so giue glory to the wisdom of God. His righteousnes is seene by this, that hee would not receiue into fauour man that had sinned vvithout amendes made for the wrong that he had done, for vvhere as it was of necessity that eyther man must haue perished euerlastingly for his sinne, or else that some one of mankinde must haue made satisfaction vnto God, abyding punishment for all

Mercy of God. Psal. 145. 8. ionas. 4. 2. esai. 55. 7. His mercifulnes shineth in this, that by his sonne, and for his sonnes sake, he taketh againe in∣to fauour mankinde forlorne and oppressed by the tyranny of the diul, and ouerwhelmed with excee∣ding great miseries, calamities, death, hel▪ and dam∣nation. This mercifulnes of God exceedeth all the workes of God, which both the good Angels and elect men shall set out euerlastinglye: yea, and the very diuels shall acknowledge, though aginst their willes. His truth is made manifest in this, that bea∣ring Gods trueth. Psal. 100. 4. & 117. 2. & 119. 0.in minde his promises of olde time, he perfor∣meth that which he had promised long agoe: for at such time as our first parents fell into sin, he promi∣sed them the Gen. 3. 15. galat. 4. 4.seede of the woman, which shoulde tread downe the heade of the serpent, and this pro∣mise he fulfilleth now in giung vs his son. For these vertues therefore glory is to be giuen to God, and God gloriied.that especially by those that feele his benefits. This glory is then rightly yeelded vnto him:  First assoone as we acknowledge this vvonderful benefit of God:  Secondly, vvhen vve imbrace his Sonne by fayth:  Thirdly, when vve prayse God vvith minde, vvith voyce, vvith confssion, and vvith behauiour:  and fourthly, vvhen vve allure as many s vve can to the

Man made after the i∣mage of God, did fall from that blessed estate, to the condemnation of him selfe and all his posterity, & Christ for man being thus fallen, did oppose himself to the iustice of God a mediatour, paying the ran∣some and price of redemption for Adam and his vvhole posteritie that refuse it not.

PA. VVhat differēce puttest thou between the of∣fice of a Prophet of Iesus Christ, & other Prophets? TI. Firste it is, that God hath not spoken in his church in the person of Iesus Christe onely, Heb. 1. 1. 2. deut. 18. 15. math. 21. 11. luke. 3. 16. ioh 6. 14. & 7. 40 & 9. 17. actes 3 22. & 7. 37.in the maner that he hath heretofore spoken by his Pro∣phets in sundry sortes more cout and darke, but hath spoken by his ovvne sonne plainely and vvith an open face, and hath shewed vnto vs by him the doctrin of saluation so fully and Psal. 22 23. math. 22. 16. & 23. 23. 8. 10. ioh 1. 18. & 3. 2. & 13. 13. & 17. 6.perfectly, that we may not attend any other perfection in this world, that none may adde any thing more vnto the doc∣trine that he hath brought, and that none oughte from that time foorth to looke for anye more am∣ple or perfecte reuelation and manifestation of the will of God. Secondly it is, that Iesus Christ is not a Prophet, hauing none other power but to shevv foorth the vvord of God by word of mouth, as the other Ministers of the same do, but beside that he hath the power to Luke. 24. 32. ioh. 17. 6. rom. 15. 18. 19. 2. cor. 12. 9. heb. 1 3.imprint the same in their harts, by the vertue of his holy spirite, and to giue it Math. 7. 28. mark. 1. 22.ver∣tue

It is necessarye that the same mediatour should be very God and very man together in one very person, chiefly for three causes. The first is, that if he had not been very Gen. 3. 15. esay. 11. 10. rom. 15. 10. galat. 4. 4. iohn. 1. 14. rom. 1. 3. rom. 8. 2. rom. 9. 5. 1. corin. 1. 30. heb. 1. 10. 11. math. 3. 15. rom. 5. 18. 2. corin. 5. 21. collss. 1. 22. tim 2. 1. 5. 1. iohn. 4. 2.mā, he could not haue suf∣fered in our flesh and nature, that which he hath suf∣fered and vvas to suffer for vs, vvhere vpon this in∣conuenience vvould ensue, that he should not haue borne for vs in our nature and fleshe, the vvrath and cursse of God which we had deserued, and then hee shoulde not haue satisfied the iudgement of God through his obedience: to put avvay by the same in our flesh & nature the rebellion, by the which we haue deserued his iudgement. Secondly, if he had been but onely man, and had not been vnited vvith God, beeing very Iohn 1. 14. esay. 9. 6. iere. 33. 16. actes. 20. 28. rom. 9. 5. galat. 1. 12. philip. 2. 6. titus. 2. 13. 1. iohn. 5. 20.God and very man in one very person, he coulde not haue beene able to beare this burthen of the wrath of God, vvhich is so great and importable, but that he should haue been svvallow∣ed vp, hovv iust or innocent soeuer he should haue been. Thirdly, he shoulde not haue beene able to haue brought saluation and life to man, if hee had not had the fountaine in him selfe by meane of his diuine nature.

PA. Though the Sacrifices of the old lavv be en∣ded, and though Christes Sacrifices be a full & per∣fect satisfaction for our sinnes, doth there novv re∣mayne no other Sacrifices in the time of the Gos∣pell? TI. Yes, the scripture calleth the children of God a holy 1. Pet. 2. 5. Genes. 5. 10. & 1. 6.priesthood, to offer vp spiritual sacrifices ac∣ceptable vnto God by Iesus Christ, by vvhome vve offer the sacrifice of righteousnes, and the Sacrifice of Psal. 4. 5.faith. Moreouer, the Lord hath promised that he vvill not refuse the sacrifice of a contrite spirie, and of a Psal. 50. 22. & 51. 17.broken heart. And they also do offer Sacrifice to God, that offer prayse and thankes giuing, which is the fruit of the lippes that confesse his name. And the prayer of the faithful is as incense▪ Heb. 13. 15. psal. 41. 12.and the lif∣ting vp of their hands, is as euening Sacrifice. The Lord refuseth the old ceremoniall Sacrifices of the law, but he requireth Mat. 1. 17. Ose. 6. 6. 1. Sam. 15. 2.mercy, & knowledge of God and obedience in their stead. Also to do good & to distribute Heb. 13. 16. phil. 4. 18.to giue almes to the maintenāce of the Minister, & of the pore, are a sweete smelling sauor, and a sacrifice acceptable and pleasaunt to God.
VVho may sacrifice for sinne. And Saint Paul in the twelfe to the Romains saith, I besech you brethren, by the mercies of God, that you giue vp your bodies a liuing sacrifice, holye and acceptable vnto God, vvhich is your reasonable seruing of God. PA. VVhat Sacrificer maye offer Sacrifie for sinne? TI. There is none other true and perfect Sacri∣ficer, which may offer vnto God perfect sacrifice, to make an agreement betweene him and mankinde, but Iesus Christ onely, for so much as he is perfect and vvithout sinne. Esa. 43. 11. ose. 13. 4. iere. 17. 5.Beside vvhich reason, this is also to be noted, that euen as the paine due to our sinnes is infinite, euen so the sacrifice of Iesus Christ is of merite & vertue infinite. And the reason ther∣of is. because he is not onely vvithout sinne and vvithout spot, but also because he Heb. 1. 1. 2.is the true and naturall sonne of God, and his humaine nature is ioyned to his diuine nature, vvhich is infinite, of the vvhich the humaine nature taketh his vertue, for his humaine nature coulde not giue life of it selfe, ex∣cept it tooke it of the diuine nature, vvhich is the fountayne, and therefore Iesus Christ hath sayde, Ioh. 6. 63.The flesh profiteth nothing, to vvit, if it be consi∣dered as seperate from his diuine nature, and from his holy spirit: but it is the spirit vvhich giueth life, that is to sye, God dwelling in Iesus Christ corpo∣rally (as Saint Paul sith) to vvit, really, and in deede reconcileth the world to himselfe. PA. How can the death of Christe alone make sufficient and ful amends for the sinnes of the whole worlde? TI. Iohn. 1. 29. Behold the lamb of God (saith Iohn) which
From whence groweth the estimation of Christes workes and passion. taketh avvay the sinnes of the vvorld, for of the vn∣diuidable and vnspeakable vnion of the Godhead and manhood in one person groweth the worthi∣nesse, estimation and endles merite of al the workes and passions of Christ. Therfore when it is sayd, the sonne of man hath 1. Cori 6 20. 1 pet. 1 18. 19 actes. 20. 18. apoc. 5. 9.redeemed vs by the desert of his passion, a worke of inestimable price & incom∣parale value is named, because the same sonne of man that hath suffered, is also God. Also the death of the sonne of man is a satisfaction, because it is the death of such a man as is God. The obedience of the sonne of man is our righteousnes, because it is the obedience of a man that is God. So the son of man forgiueth sinnes, because he is God Math. 9. 6. mar. 2. 5. 7. 9. luk. 5 20. & 7. 48.The flesh of Christ is the food of life, because it is the flesh of a man that is God. And although the Godhead in Christ suffered not, but 2. Cor. 13. 4. 1. pet 4. 1.his manhood only, (as saith Peter) Christ suffered in the fleshe, yet his passion extendeth to his vvhole person. In so much that whatsoeuer reproch is done to Christs Mat. 1. 18. 28 luk. 1. 38. 42. 43.manhood, the same redoundeth to the reproche of his vvhole person according to this sentence, 1 Cor. 2. 8. iohn. 3. 13. acts. 20. 28. 1. iohn. 1. 1. & 3. 16.they haue cru∣cified the Lord of glory. In consideration whereof the Church confesseth the sonne of God to haue suffered, because he suffered in the manhoode which he had taken vpon him. PA. Hovv manifold is the meditation of Christes passion? TI. The healthfull meditation of Christes passion is sixfold.

Peraduenture thou maist surmize that God could haue deliuered mankind by some other mean VVhat art thou that vvill teach God what he might haue done, think thou vpon Gods iustice and mer∣cy together, for as his mercy moued him to saue, so his iustice moued him to looke for rightfull amends of the vvrong. Man sinned, and for so doing hee must eyther perish or Math. 3. 15. rom. 5. 18. 2. cor. 5. 21.make amends. Novv Ro. 3. 23. 25. acts. 20. 28. esai. 6. 3. 11. rom. 14. 23. heb. 11. 6.man beeing no more but man, could not satisfie Gods iustice, and other then man, none ought to doe it. Gods vvisedome therefore found through mercy, a remedie in this case, vvhich vvas, that the eternall sonne of God shoulde Rom. 8. 2. 2. corin. 5. 21. heb. 4. 15. 1. pet. 2 22. & 3. 18. & 1. ioh. 2. 1.become man, by meanes vvhereof he both vvas able to satisfi Gods iustice, because he vvas God, & ought to doe it, because he had takē mans nature vpon him. Thus in Christes passion appeareth mercy to be myxed vvith iustice, and vvisedome hath tempered them both. The third is, that therby vvill come to minde the moste excellent and vnspeakable loue of the sonne of God tovvards mankinde, vvho vouchsafed to turne the vvrath of his father to himselfe, and to abide so slaunderous a death, and that for his enemis, Rom. 5. 10.

This applying of it is brought to passe three wayes, by the word, by faith, and by the sacraments. By the word, as it were by the hande of God, is the benefite of the Lordes passion offered vnto thee: vvhere, and as often as he Gospel of Ie∣sus Christ is preached, & the Ministers of the vvorde do in Gods stead shew the 1. Cor. 11. 26fruite of our Lords pas∣sion to all that heare the gospel. Againe when the benefite of the Lordes passion is thus offered, as it vvere by the hande of God, it must be receiued by faith, as it vver a certaine hand of man, the vvhich faith the Rom. 10. 17. epe▪ 1. 18. 19. 1. cor 12. 5. 9. 11. ioh 17. 20. rom. 14 17. 1. tm 3▪ 15. 1 cor. 1. 21.holy ghost worketh in men that heare the Gospell, and obey.

Therefore vvhen thou rehersest the article of thy beleee concerning the passion of the Lord, persuade thy selfe firmely, & beleeue most assuredly, that the sonne of God suf∣fered death for thee, vvhich thing if thou doe, thou art partaker of the Lordes death, in so much that all the vvhole obedience of Christe is thy acquitall from 1.

But there is a double obedience to bee marked in Christe, his obedience of the Crosse Gala. 3. 13.and his obedience of the Lavve, vvhich vvas his perfecte fulfilling of the same. Like as his obedience to the Crosse is our cleansing from sinne  Eph. 2. 15. colos. 2. 14.so his obedience of the law, is imputed to vs for our righteousnes.

Therefore is it sayde of Bernard very vvell, vvhat good doth the spirite or holye Ghost in vse doth warne moue, and teach: he doth warne our remembraunce, he doth moue our vvilles, and Iohn. 14. 26. 1.

Therefore if there be any good∣nes in vs, it is the fruite of his grace and vertue, but all our giftes vvithout him are meere darknes of the mind, and vvicked peruersnes of the heart. PA. Hovve vnderstandest thou the eyght of the Romaines and 15. verse, vvhere he speaketh of the spirite of bondage, and spirit of feare? TI. One and the selfe same spirite of God brin∣geth foorth tvvo effectes, the first is called the spirite of bondage or feare, which engendreth in vs feare & sorrow. Heb. 12. 18. for first by the law and threat∣nings, it maketh afrayd those men that are to be iu∣stified, and breaketh and vexeth them with scourges and stripes of the conscience, that vtterly dispairing

Christ beareth our sinnes of them selues, they maye flye vnto Christe, vnto vvhome vvhen they are come, and that they em∣brace him by fayth, they are not onely iustified, but also are freely and of their own accord stirred vp to iust, vpright, and holy workes: The other is the spi∣rite of grace and adoption, which is giuen vs by the preaching of the Gospell, the first belongeth vnto Rom. 8, 15seruauntes, the seconde vnto sonnes. Gal. 4. Rom. 8. 18. 2. Tim. . 7. Heb. 10. 29. Yet doth it not here∣of follow that all Prophetes and Patriarkes vvere seruauntes: or there vvere no Sonnes before the reuealing of the gospell, but it compareth the giftes of the one vvith the other, abasing the giftes of the Lavve in respect of the giftes giuen vnder the Gospell. PA. Is it then sufficient that Christ is dead & that he hath yeelded to God his father on such an obe∣dience, yea, (I say) is it sufficient for the sualuatiō of man, that the sonne of God vvas made man to bear the iudgement, the wrath and cursse of God in their ovvne nature and their ovvne flesh? TI. If that vvere ynough all should be saued in∣differently, as well the Reprobates as the elect, and the vnbeleuers as the faythfull. PA. VVhat is more requyred then? TI. That the same satisfaction which Iesus Christ hath made to God his father may be cōmunicated & aplied to vs that beleeue, for the vnbeleuers haue nothing common vvith Iesus Christe, but that they are men of the same humaine nature, but the Ioh 3, 16 & 15, 19 & 13, 1 1. ioh 2, 2 & 4 14faith∣full haue this more, vvhich is the principall, that all that they haue is common to Christe vvith them,
Participation betweene good and and that vvhich Iesus Christe hath is common to them also. PA. VVhat is it that Iesus Christ may take of thē, for asmuch as they be all none other then pore and sinfull men? TI.

PA. He taketh then nothing of vs but onely the euill vvhich is in vs. TI. VVhat other thing may he take, seeing there is no other thing in vs, but the nature of the aliance and Communion that Iesus Christ hath vvith the faithfull, and that the faythfull haue vvith him by the Esai 48, 16 act 13, 2 act 20 28. 1. cor 12, 6povver of the holy ghost, which ioyneth them vvith him by true and liuing fayth, for othervvyse there should be no perfect communion, and so the aliaunce shoulde not be full, if there vvere no parti∣cipation of good and euill, suche as it shoulde and ought to be among those vvhich be allied. PA. Then on the contrary, it must be, follovving the nature of this communion and aliaunce that vve receiue of Iesus Christ, the good things that are in him, as he doth the euill that is in vs. TI. It is so to be vnderstood. PA. According to that vvhich thou haste sayde, the Church doth not only obtaine remission of sins but also the victory against sinne, death, hell, and the diuell, and likevvise eternall life, the vvhich Math 2, 39 ioh 13, 34, 35 rom 14, 5. 1. cor. 10▪ 24 & 13, 4, 5, &c. 2 cor 11, 2 2 gal. 6, 2. phil 2. 1, 2, &c.Iesus Christ hath wone for it, because she is the spouse of him, and that shee entreth into communion of all his goods vvith him by meane of this spirituall ma∣riage,

Novv then, I would haue thee tell me the meane that the Lord vseth in this spirituall mariage. TI. No mariage can be made except the husband and the vvyfe do giue the fayth of mariage the one to the other, the vvhich importeth all that vvhich belongeth to true mariage. For the true founda∣tion of mariage, lyeth in that Fayth vvhich the hus∣bande and the vvyfe doe giue the one to the other, and therefore men say, that they vvhich haue so gi∣uen their faith, are assured by promise that is made on both parts, vvhich can not be don but by words, vvhereby the husbande and the vvyfe declare their vvill and consent.

PA. VVhence hath this vvoorde (Iustificare) beene borrowed, and vvhat signifieth it? TI.

Iames did write againste them which did vt∣terly contemne & dispise good workes. 2. And ther∣fore Paule sheweth the causes of our iustification, Iames sheweth the effectes and fruites of the same. 3. Paul declareth how we are iustified. Iames decla∣reth how we are knowne to be iustified. Paule ex∣cludeth workes as not the cause of our iustification, Iames approueth workes as effectes proceeding of the same. 4. Paule denieth that any good workes can be in them that be not iustified, Iames affirmeth that they vvhich be iustified can in no vvise bee without good vvorkes. PA. VVhat difference is there betvveene the righteousnes of the law and the Christian, the Pha∣risaicall righteousnes, and the righteousnesse of the Gospell? TI. The first difference betweene the righteous∣nes of the law & the Christian righteousnes is, that the righteousnes of the law, is of the Math. 3. 15. & 5. 20. act. 13. 10. rom 2. 13. & 10. 3. 4. &c. tit. 3. 5. heb. 9. 8. rue. 3. 15. 1workes of the law, but the righteousnes of the Gospell is without the workes of the law. The second is, that the righ∣teousnesse of the lavve is the righteousnesse of the worker, but the righteousnesse of the gospell is the

The third is, that the righteousnes of the lavv is not▪ imputed freely, but commeth to passe of the desert of a mans ovvne obedience, but Hab 2, 4 rom 1, 17 rom 3, 11 gal 3, 11 heb 10, 38 gen 15, 6 act 10, 43 rom 3, 24 rom 4, 5, 8, 24 phe 1,  & 2, 8 psal 32, 1 gal. 3, 8 2 corin. 5, 18the righteousnesse of the gospell is imputed without desert of a mans ovvn obedience. The fourth is, that the righteonsnes of the lavv is a formal righteousnes, as vvhich is framed to a mā by his iust dealings, but the righteousnes of the gospell is an imputed righteousnes, vvhen the iust dealngs of Christ are imputed to him, that beleeueth. Ther∣fore that man is said to be iustified according to the form of the lavv, vvhich of an Leuit. 18, 5 ezek. 20, 11 rom. 10, 5. gal. 3, 12.vnrighteous person becōmeth righteous, through his ovvn iust dealing & fulfilling of the law, according to this saying. The mā that doth these things shalliue in them: but he is sayde to be iustified after the maner of the Gospell, vvho of a guilty person is made not gilty, by reason of Christs Esai 53 11. rom 3. 20 & 5. 18.righteousnes, vvhich is taken holde on by faith. The righteousnes of the lavv is a perfect obedience of a man to the lavve of God, but the Christian or gospell righteousnesse is Christes obe∣dience imputed to him that beleueth. A Gen. 15, 27 & 17, 1 iob. 1, 8 luke 2. 25 psal 10, 1, 6.righteous mā after the lavv, is he that dealeth iustly & vpright¦ly, according to the meaning of the lavve: but he is righteous after the gospel, to vvhom God orgiueth his sin, & Psal 32, 1. rom 4, 8, 24imputeth Christs righteounes, & vvhom he accepteth to eternall life freely for Christes sake.

The christian righteousnes exceedeth the Pharisai∣call in theese foure thinges. In cause, qualitie, effect, and end The cause of christiā righteousnes is God, Christes desert and faith taking hold of the benefite offered: but the cause of Pharisaicall righteousnesse, is mans hipocrisie, ignorance of Gods righteousnes and an outvvarde Esai 29. 13 mat. 15, 3, 6, 9 marke 7, 7. collos. 2, 8, 22obseruance of mens traditions. The qualitie of Christian righteousnes, is the obe∣dience and fulfilling of the lavve in Christe: but the qualitie of Pharisaicll righteousnes, is but only an outward visure of feined & Mat. 6. 2. 16. & 15, 7, & 23 5, 27. mark 7. 6 luke 11. 39. & 20, 47.counterfait holinesse. The effect of Christian righteousnes, is newnesse of spirit, the feare of God, true godlinesse, inuocation, true humilitie, patience, and a beginning of obe∣dience tovvardes Gods lavve, in so much that a man beeing iustified by fayth, desireth nothing so muche as to obtayne God. To bee briefe, his chiefe pleasure is in the lavve of the Lorde, after he knovveth that damnation is taken away by Christ merite: but the effect of Pharisaicall righteousnesse is, pride, glorying before God, superstition, dis∣daine of ou neighbours, and to be short, such as e Mat 7, 17 1 19. & 12. 33 luke 6. 44the▪ tree is, such is the fruite, for an euill tree can not bring forth good fruite The ende of Christian righteousnes is, to haue Rom. 5. 1.peace with God, to haue accesse vnto God, to giue glory vnto God, & final∣ly to obtaine euerlasting life freely for Christs sake: but the end of Pharisaicall righteousnes is, to giue Math. 5. 20 luke 11. 39.prayse to a mans own selfe, & to take it from god, and to vaunt among men, vppon vvhich at length shall ensue horrible punishment, vnlesse there be a

And to speake yet more fully, I say that faith instead of bringing to God any thing that is of man, brin∣geth him to Iesus Christ, to receiue of him thereby that vvhich he can not finde in him selfe, to wit, the e Luk. 7. 50. & 8. 12. ephe. 2. 8. 1. pe. 1. 9.righteousnes of Iefus Christ, vvhich maketh a man righteous before God, euen as though hee vvere vvholly innocent, for as much as God esteemeth him for uch a one, accepting the iustice of his Son Iesus Christ for full satisfaction, and allowing the same to him, as though it were proper to the man to vvhom it is allovved. PA. VVhat commoditie bringeth it? TI. It bringeth also this commoditie, that wher∣as before he coulde doe nothing but euill, this faith doth 1.

PA. How doth faith sanctifie man?
Fth sanctifieth man.  Kindes of Sanctification. TI. In this sanctification of man by fayth, tvvo things are to be considered First, because that Iesus Christ hauing taken our owne flesh in the VVombe of the Math. 1. 16 23, 25. luke 1. 30. 31. & 2, 7.virgin, hath sanctified him in his, which thing the holy ghoste hath testified, vvhen in forme of a Doue he descended vpon Iesus Christ which is our heade, in vvhome all his members are foorth vvith Sanctified. Secondly, Rom. 5, 1. rom 8, 16. heb 10▪ 22, 2. 1. iohn 4. 13.because that fayth vvhich embraceth and receiueth wholy Iesus Christe vvith all his gifts and graces, is neuer in man vvithout the spirite of him, nor the Spirite of him, vvithout his fruites, which are altogether contrary to the workes of the flesh; to vvit, of the corrupted man that is not regenerate by the spirite of God. PA. Expound novv to me the kinds of sanctifica∣tion, and the difference of them. TI. I vvill say vnto thee for the first, that we must put difference in this matter, betweene the cause of our saluation, and the testimony of the same, and then afterward between the sanctification by Iesus Christe vvhich is imputed to vs, and that which is ioyned to our person. PA. VVhat thinkest thou to be the cause of our saluation? TI. Math. 20, 2 mark 10. 45. iohn 11, 5. act. 20. 28. rom 4. 15. & 14. 9. 1. cor. 5, & 7 15. 3. Iesus Christ dvvelling in vs by fayth. PA.

And vvhat inconuenience vvere it to holde our Sanctification for the cause of our Salua∣tion? TI. For the better vnderstanding of all this mat∣ter, it is meete that I expound it to thee PA▪ VVhat difference doest thou put betvveene the sanctification of Iesus Christe vvhich is allowed vs, and that vvhich is ioyned to our proper person, and then the fruites of the same? TI. I doe call Sanctification properly that vvhich we consider in the very person 1. Cor. 1. 30. 31.Iesus Christe, the vvhich sanctification is not properly ours, as a qua∣litye coniunct to our person, but onely by impu∣tation. PA. VVhat meanest thou by that imputati∣on? TI. That it is allowed vnto vs, as his psal. 32. 1. Rom. 4. 8. 24. Gal. 3. 8. Ephe. 1. 5. 2. cor. 5. 18.iustice is attributed and allowed vnto vs by the iustification which vve obtaine in him by faith. PA. Is that the cause vvhy S. Paule sayth, that 1. Cor. 1. 30 3 2.God hath made Iesus Christ vnto vs vvisedome, iustice, sanctification, and redemption? TI. There is no doubt of it, but it must be consi∣dered, that beside this kind of sanctification that is so imputed and allowed vnto vs, ther is yet another that is ioyned to our very person, not onely by im∣putation, but as a qualitie sticking in vs, which pro∣ceedeth from that first kind of sanctification wher∣of
Kindes of sanctification and difference of them. we haue euen now spoken. PA. VVhat vertue hath euery of them in vs? TI. The first doth fully sanctifie vs before God, because it is full and perfect. PA. The other, is it not of the same nature and force? TI. No, for it sanctifieth vs but in Iohn 1. 16. ol. 1. 10. & 2. 9.part. PA. For what cause? TI. For because it is but begun in vs, and not per∣fect, wherefore it cannot fully sanctifie vs, except it be full and perfect. PA. And when shall it be so? TI. VVhen our regeneration and reformation to the image of God shall be. PA. It shall not then be in this mortall life? TI. It is true: but it shall bee in the life to come, in the which our life which is now hidden in Iesus Christ shall be shewed, and what we be shal appear, when we shall be made like vnto the glorious body of Iesus Christ. PA. VVhat difference puttest thou betvveen these two kinds of Sanctification? TI. I call the first perfect: for that is is the verye sanctification, not onely of that which Iesus Christ is sanctified in his flesh and humaine nature, but al∣so by reason whereof he is called the holye one of holy ones, for so much as by the communication of the same 1. Pet. 1. 15. 16. 2. pet. 3. 10 11.he doth sanctifie all his elected, to make them holy without blame before God, who hath chosen them therevnto. PA.

If it be perfect in him, it is also perfect in vs, in so much as dvvelling in vs by faith, vve haue him vvith all the holines that he bringeth with him, the which we cuer dravv out of him, as of his true foun∣taine, the vvhich vve haue in our selues vvhen vvee haue Iesus Christ. PA. If vve haue in Iesus Christ the fountaine of all holines, vvhereby vve are continually and perpetu∣ally sanctified, vvhat other imperfect sanctification may then be in vs? TI. That vvhich vve consider in our own proper flesh and nature, regenerate and renued by the spirit of God, vvhiche is as it vvere vvatred vvith the streames of that fountaine of all sanctification, to make vs bring forth the Heb▪ 6. 11, 12 2. pet. 1. 10. luk. 19. 8, 9. act. 2. 44.fruits of true sanctificati∣on and holmesse, in the stead of the fruites of sinne which it brought forth in time before, as the earth, which being cursed & barren, is afterward made fer tile, & beareth better fruites by the blessing of God. PA. Thou vvilt then saye, that this seconde kinde of sanctification is not onely adherent to the per∣son of Iesus Christe, and that it is not onely ours by imputation, as is the first, but that it is also adhe∣rent to our flesh & nature, as a nevv qualitie which Iesus christ hath put into vs by his holy spirit, which maketh our flesh holy in it selfe, to doe aftervvardes holy vvorkes.

PA. Thou mayest not denye for all that, but the good and holye workes are very agreeable to him. TI. If it were otherwise, they ought not to bee done, but thou must note therein that they bee not acceptable vnto him as cause of our saluation, but as Math. 5. 16. 1. pet 2. 12.testimony of the same. PA. Howe vnderstandest thou that they be testi∣monies of our saluation? TI. In that they testify that Iesus Christe is in vs, and that he there worketh by his holy spirite: wher∣fore it followeth that we bee iustified and sanctified by the Rom. 5. 1. & 8. 7.iustice and sanctification of Iesus Christ, the which God beholdeth, and for the regarde thereof he doth beare with the imperfection that yet re∣mayneth in vs, and doth pardon vs that wherein we do yet daily offend him.

That albeit we be iustified already, sanctified and purified of our sinnes by the sayth that we haue in him through his word, yet for all that, forasmuch as there resteth in vs alwayes certaine filthinesse and corruption, which proceedeth of our corrup∣ted nature, which is not yet throughly well renued and reformed to the Gen. 1. 27.

Can our works in no wise please God? TI. There is no man that maye doe anye worke vvhich may be acceptable to God, if first the person vvhich doth it, ee not acceptable to him. Novve sinne of his nature deserueth the vvrath of God, & not his loue and fauour. Therefore because al men are sinners there are none vvhich are agreeable to him, and if their persons bee not agreeable to him, no more can their vvorkes please him so long as he doth consider them in their owne nature vvithout

But if a man thinke to do well, and doth that which he doth to none other ende but to honoure God, is not that inough? TI. No, for then it had not beene needefull that God should euer haue giuen a law to man to teach him but that he had onely commaunded that euery man shoulde doe that which liked him, where hee hath done clean contrary, saying, Deut. 12. 8.

PA. VVhat commodities doth this assurance bring to men? TI. Two, whereof the first is, that man haue the Maiesty of God in such high estimation, and bea∣reth him so great reuerence, that not onely hee will not vvillingly Rom. 6. 1. 1. cor. 6. 11. 1. pet. 4. 1.offende him, but also hee vvill not put himselfe in any hazarde, and doe any thing at auenture, vvhen there is question of the seruice and honour of God, and therefore he will euer bee assured of his will, for in whome a man hath his cheefe trust, to him doth that man reuerence, and seruice, such as he knoweth shal please moste.

It then foloweth by that which hath beene sayd, that those which are not cal¦led but onely by this outwarde calling, are not also iustified, nor consequently glorified. PA. How hath God alwaies accustomed to vtter his will to men? TI. By his Psal. 119. 10 deut. 4. 2. & 5. 32 & 18. 5. & 28. 14. & 30. 12. 13. 14, 15. 19. math. 7. 2 & 12. 50. & 25 3. 2. cor. 3. 6. 14 gal 3. 15. 17.vvorde, and by some outvvard signe for looke what the vvord putteth into mens ears to be conueied vnto the minde, the same thing doth the signe set before the eyes to be seene, to the in∣tent that by them as it vvere with vvindovves, a certein light might be conueyned in vnto the soul, so as the vvorde and the signe might bee a double warrant audible & visible, the end & drift of vvhich is all one. Hovvbeit so as the interpretation of the signe is to bee fetched alvvaies out of the vvor alone.

And the Lambe vvas but a naturall Lambe vvhich they killed at the Lordes commaundement, and the Passeouer was spoken of none other, but of the Angell vvhich stroke the E∣gyptians, & yet for all that, the maner of the speach wherby Circumcision is called the Lords couenant and the Lambe the Passeouer, is not proper and na∣turall, but Sacramentall, nor it can not be sayd, that Circumcision properly and naturally is the Coue∣nant, & the Lambe the Passeouer, but as that vvas the signe Sacramentall of the couenant, so vvas this also of the passage of deliuery.

Therefore let vs agree in iudgement, that the bread of the supper is the very body of Christ cru∣cified, and dead for vs, as he sayde; Take▪ eate, this is my body vvhich is deliuered for you, and so let vs keepe these vvords euery one in their proper signi∣fication, & when the manner is asked hovv bread is the lords body, let vs say that it is a report or speech not natural, but sacramental, so that the bread is the Lordes body, neither naturally, nor corporally nor personally▪ no really, but sacramentally. Iren. lib. 4. cap. 34. Tertul. against Marcio lib. 40. and against the Iewes.To be sa∣cramentally, is to be according to the nature and meane of a sacrament, as the breade in as much as it is a sacrament of the Lords body, in that respect it is the Lords body giuen for vs, in such order & vvay as is conuenient to sacraments, like as by the order and vvay of his ovvne nature it is breade. And it is therefore called the Sacrament of the Lordes body, because that by his ordinaunce it is the holy signe and remembrance of his body giuen for vs, by breaking and distribution of which, he doth recom∣mend the communion of his bodye, and remem∣brance of his death vnto his Church. It is one mat∣ter to say of any thing vvhat it is in deed of it selfe,

If a man take this saying, Hoc est corpus meum, in a naturall sence, it is made im∣possible and vnreasonable. But if a man take it in the sacramentall sence▪ shall be sayde of breade, not vvhat it is naturally and substantially, but vvhat the Lord vvoulde haue it to be sacramentally, and for what he vvould haue it taken, & to what vse he ap∣pointed them the breaking, distribution, and com∣munion of it. PA. How is Christes body present to the recey∣uers? TI. Christes true body is truely present to them that truely receiue him, but Iohn 6. 50 1. cor. 10. 14. ephe. 3. 17.spiritually And so is it taken after a spiritual sort, for vvhen he sayd, This is my body, it is all one as if he had sayde, This is the breaking of my body, This is the shedding of my bloud, as oft as you shall doe this, it shall put you in remembrance of the breaking of my body. And the shedding of my bloud: that as surely as you receiue this sacrament, so truely shall you receiue the bene∣fite promised by receiuing the same worthily This I say that Christ entereth into vs, both by our eares, and by our eyes, vvith our mouth vve receiue the body of Christ, and teare it vvith our teeth, that is to say, the sacrament of the body of Christ. VVher∣fore I say and affirme, that the vertue of the sacra∣ment is much, and therfore Chysostom many times speaketh of sacramēts no otherwise then of Christ himselfe. No man seeth Christ vpon the earth, he is seen with the eyes of our mind, with faith & spirite.
Of the Lords Supper. PA. Howe doe our bodies receiue Christes natu∣rall body? TI. As Christe, not after his manhood, but after his diuine nature, liueth naturallye by his Father, which diuine nature of his, worketh also in his man∣hood an immortalitye: so our spirite and soule re∣ceiuing the naturall body of Christe in the myste∣ries by Iohn. 6, 35 acts. 4, 10, 12 rom 4, 24, 2 & 5, 8 & 14. 9.faith, do receiue also then nature of his body, that is, his purenesse, iustification, innocency, power, glorification, life, eternitie, and beatitude, the opera∣tion whereof redounding likewise vnto our bodies, doe make the same also capable of the same glorye and immortality. And thus it is true, that as Christe liueth naturallye by his father, so vvee liue naturally by the body of Christe, eaten in the mysteries, ha∣uing respect both to the manhoode of him & of vs, for as the flesh of Christe, in respect of bare flesh, li∣ueth not naturally by the father, but for that it is ioi¦ned to his diuinity, so our flesh liueth not naturally by Christes bodye eaten in the Sacrament▪ for then euerye vvicked man eating the sacrament shoulde liue naturally by him, but for that our flesh Rom 9. 3 1 cor. 12, 12 13. eph. 4. 15, 16 & 5. 30 gal 3. 27.is ioy∣ned to the spirite and soule vvhich truely ateth the body of Christ by fayth, and so onely the bodies of the faythfull doe liue by eating the body of Christe naturally, in participating the naturall properties of the body of Christe. PA. After what ort is Christe present in the sup∣per? TI. Christ that sitteth in heauen, is present in the supper in mystery and by grace, and is olden of the godly, such as communicate him, not only sacra∣mentallye with the hande of the bodye, but muhe

The Sactamentall sort of eating Christes body, is itera∣ted as often as the Lords supper is celebrated, which is not iterated often times to this end, that we shold iterate the eating and receiuing of the Lords body in very deede, like as we doe with corporall meate, vvhich doth perish after it is eaten, but to thintent that in celebrating the remembrance of the Lords death, according vnto his institution, we may feede our fayth in him, and offer a sacrafice of praise vnto our Redeemer. For as the breade of life once truely eaten & receiued, vvasteth not after it is eaten and receiued, so it doth not require to haue the iteration of eating and receiuing, for it sticketh by them, fee∣ding them into euerlasting life vvhiche are once made partakers thereof. Hereof I doe admonish men, because of the ignorant, that they doe not re∣ferre the iterating of this eating & receiuing to the very heauenly meat it selfe, but vnto the sacrament thereof. The Ioh 6, 35. 51 54. 55. 1, corin. 11, 28, 29. 1, cor. 6. 15. & 12. 27. ephes 4 15. 16. & 5. 30.continual and vncessing sort of ea∣ting Christs body is not sacramentall, but spiritual, and that onelye haue povver and efficacy to feede vnto euerlasting life, vvhereunto vvee must apply those thinges that be vvritten in the sixt Chapter of Iohn. This is obtained by fayth onely, by which we incorporate into Christe, and being once incorpo∣rate, doe liue in a continuall fruition thereof, by the grace of the redemption purchased by his flesh and bloud. 1.

The spirituall eating which I do acknowledge to be in the Lords supper, doth derogate nothing of that which I haue said of the coutinuall and vnceassing fruition of the body and bloud of Christ, for that spirituall eating is no∣thing else if it be well considered, but a certain put∣ting in uk. 2. 19. 1. cor. 11. 24. 26remembrance of this, whereby, and by the efficacie of calling to remembraunce, the grace of Christ once receiued is reuiued againe in the hearts of the faythfull communicantes, by the faythe in Christes worde, which is set fotth in the supper▪ And this kinde of chewing the cudd vvhich is vsed in the Sacrament of the Lords body and bloud by faith, is not vnfitly called the spirituall eating, forasmuch as by it the heauenly meate is called vp again into the mouth of the hart to be ruminated, and doth so by the sweetenesse thereof most pleasantly refesh our spirite▪ and the meate is also by this order made more sauory and effectuall. PA. Tell me what it is to be spiritually present? TI. To be Ioh. 6. 40. 6.spiritually present, is to bee in a spiri∣tuall sort, that is, in such sort as appertaineth to spi∣rites. VVherefore vvhen vve say that Christ is spiri∣tually present in the supper, we doe not mean of the inuisible presence of his body, which the papists do appoint vnder the formes of bread, but of that way that he is present by the working of his spirite fe∣ding and refreshing their minds which doe receiue vvith sincere and true fayth that vvhich he gaue at his last supper.

And therfore vve beleeue that Chistes death is auailable to the redemption of the worlde, to the forgiuenesse of our sinnes, and for our reconcilement vvith God the father. Moreouer vvee beleeue that our onelye succour and refuge is to flye to the mercy of our fa∣ther by Iesus Christ, and assuredly to perswade our myndes that he is the obteiner of forgiuenesse for our sinnes, and that by Math. 20, 28 titus 2. 14. 1 peter 1. 19 poc. . 9.his bloud all our spottes of sinne be washed cleane, that he hath pacified and set at one all things by the bloud of his crosse, that hee by the same one onely sacrifice vvhich hee once of∣fred vpon the crosse, hath brought to effect and ul∣filled all things, and that or that cause he said when he gaue vp the ghost, Iohn 19, 30.It is finished, as though hee vvould signify that the price and ransome vvas novv full paid for the sinne of all mankind. Lastly, vve a∣gree in this vnity in the Lord, that that redemption once made in verity for the saluation of man, conti∣nueth in full effect for euer, and worketh vvithout ceassing vnto the end of the vvorld, that the sacrifice Heb. 5, 6 & 7 26 & 9 11. 12. 4 & 10 9. 10.once offered, cannot be consumed, that the Lordes death and passion is as effectuall, the vertue of that bloud once shed, as fresh at this day for the washing avvay of our sinns, as it vvas euen the same day that it flovved out of the blessed side of our sauiour.
Of the Lordes Supper. PA. VVhat couenances or similitudes be there in the Lordes supper? TI. Ther must be three similitudes in this sacra∣ment, a similitude of nourishing of vnitie, and of conuersion. The similitude of Ioh. 6. 35. 53 54, 55.nourishing is this, that as the bread and vvine do nourish our bodies, and comfort our outvvarde man, so the body and bloud of Christ be the meat and food of our soules, and do comfort the invvard man. Secondly, the si∣militude of vnitie is this, that as this loafe of vvhich vve eate, vvas made of many cornes of vvheat by the liquor of water knoden into dovve, and yet is but one loafe, and as the vvine vvas made of the iuyce of diuers grapes & yet is but one cup of wine, so all they that eate Christes bodye and drinke his bloud, beeing many, Rom. 9. 3. 1. co. 12. 12. 13 eph. 4, 15, 10 & 5. 30. gal. 3, 27.are made one body & flesh, by the liquor of charitie and loue, are made (I say) the misticall body of our sauiour Christ, vvhich is his church, not his naturall body, for the breade is a Sacrament not only of his natural body, but also of the congregation and misticall body, and therefore S. Paule sayth that albeit vve be many, yet notwith∣standing vve are one loafe and one body. Thirdly, the similitude of conuersiō is this, that as the bread and wine is turned into the substance of our bodies, so by the receiuing of Christes body and bloud vve are turned Ioh. 15, , 6 7 1 cor. 6. 17. 2 peter 1. 4into the nature of them, we are changed and made Ephe. 5, 30 1 cor. 10. 16.bones of his bones & fleshe of his flesh. Ioh. 6. 56.He that eateth my flesh (saith Christ) and drinketh my bloud, he abideth in me, and I in him, that is, we be made one flesh & one bloud, and the same na∣ture that my flesh and bloud haue, the same getteth he that eateth me.
Three maner of Sacraments. A Table declaring three manner of presence, eating, and vnion, with diuers and sundry respectes, hovv the holy reall body of Christ our sauiour, both in the Sacrament and besides the Sacrament, i present, eaten, and vnited to vs. Really Christe not present THe body Math. 26. 11 mark. 14. 7. ioh 12. 8. & 14. 2. 3. 28. & 16. 5. 7. 16. & 17. 11. 12. 2. cor. 5. 8. 9 phil, 1. 23. 1. pe. 1. 8.of Christ vvas really present once here on earth with vs, and shal be againe at the day of his comming Othervvise it is not here really present, but onely to our fayth really apprehen∣ding his body in heauen, and here feeding vpon the same in earth.

The body of Christ is spiritually present, vvhen either the body of Christ is present to our Ioh. 6. 40. 63spirit & fayth, or vvhen the vertue of his body is present, & redoundeth to our bodies and spirites by grace, & this differeh from the other real presence aboue in this, that the one hath respect to the body apprehē∣ded, the other to the thing that doth apprehend. The body of Christ is sacramentally present by Gen. 17. 10. 11. & 41. 26. exod. 12. 11. 1.

To the sacramentall presence and eating of Christ perteineth two things chiefly to be considered, that is, Mutation, Operation. Mutation is substantiall, or accidentall. Mutation substantial is, vvherby one substance is changed into another, as Iohn 2. 9.vvater into vvine, the rodde of Exo. 4, 2, 3, 4 & 7. 11. 12.

And of this mutation speak the Theodoret. 1 dial imutabi∣lis & dialogue . in confusus.doctors, meaning not of the change of sub∣stunce, but of accidents, which standeth in three f Hierom. vp∣on the prea∣cher.

In the vse, as when the vse of common bread is changed into a misticall and heauenly vse, In name, as when the name of bread & vvine passe away, and are changed into the name of the bodye and bloud of the Lord, and so is the name changed. In honour, as vvhen the bread and wine, which be∣fore vvere receiued not vvith honour, are now re∣ceiued vvith honour and reuerence, not that vve honourthe bread and vvine, but the thinges repre∣sented by them, as in a kinges Letters and seale vve honour the king and not the seale. Operation in the sacraments & of the sacraments
Of three manner of presence. is to be considered. The operation of the vvorde in the sacrament is this, to change not the  substance b 1 Cor, 10. 16 17. 1 cor. 11. 24 26 27. 28.of the sacrament, but that the substance thereof re∣mayning, may be made the body of Christe, that is sacrament of the body of Christe. And this Ope∣ration can not come but by the holye Ghoste, vvhereof Augustine lib. 3 cap. 4. de Trinitate sayth, Panon sanctificatur in Sacramentum tam magum, si o∣perante inuiliter spiritu Dei: The operation of the Math 3. 11. ioh. 3, 5 & 15, 3. rom. , 9, 10 1 cor. 10, 1, 2, 5 ephe. 5, 25, 26. 2 pet. 3. 21.sa∣craments is thought of the Papistes to giue grace, vvhich in very deede giue not grace of their ovvne vvorke, but onely serue as instruments and meanes of that grace and life vvhich commeth from God. So Peter calleth it, Verb vit, The vvorde of life. And S Paule calleth the gospel of Christ, the power of God to saluation, not that they of them selues giue life and saluation, but that they are certaine meanes and instruments of that life and saluation vvhich commeth to vs from God. To the spirituall presence and manducation of Christe principally belongeth the sixt Chapter of Iohn, albeit tvvo sorts of breade are there specified bodily or sacramentall breade, and spirituall bread. Bodilye or sacramentall breade of the olde Testa∣ment, signifieth Christe to come, Num. 11, 6 & 6. 24. psalm. 106▪ 14. exod. 17. 6.  cor. 10, 3, 4.as Manna, the Rocke▪ Bodily or Sacramentall breade of the nevv Testament signifieth Christ beeing already come, as the holye Euchariste.

Because Gods election and predestination are the greatest misteries of our saluation, and al∣though ioyfull to the godly, yet fearfull to the vvic∣ked,  vvoulde at the last haue thee shevve mee thy knovvledge in them.

Election only pertaineth to them that be saued: predestination in that it respecteth the reprobate, is called Reprobation, in that it respec∣teth the saued, is called election, and is thus defined.

So vvas Gen. 25. 21. mal. 4, 2 rom 11.Iacob chosen and Esau refused, before either of them began to vvorke.

To answere to vvhich question, this first is to be vnderstanded, that although our election & vocation simplie in deed be knowne to God onely in him selfe frō the beginning, yet notvvithstanding it may be knovvn to euery particular faithfull man, a posterre, that is, by means, which means is faith in Christ Iesus crucified, forsomuch as by his faith in Christ a man is iustified, & there by made the childe of saluation. Reason must needes leade the same to be then the child of election, chosen of God vn∣to eternall life: for hovv can a man be iustified but he must be saued, & how can a man be saued but by consequence it follovveth that he must also be elec∣ted? and therfore of election it is truly sayd, we must iudge of election by that which cōmeth after, thatis, by our faith & Esa. 53. 1. & 54. 13. ioh. 12. 39. & 6. 45. & 10 25. acts 13. 48. rom. 10. 10. 2. tim. 3. 16. 17 tit. 1. 1. & 3. 6. heb. 8. 11. 1. pet 1. 3.belief in Christ, which faith althogh in time it follovveth after election, yet it is the pro∣per and immediate cause assigned by the scripture, vvhich not onely iustifieth vs, but also certifieth vs of this election of God. For election albeit in God it be the first, yet to vs it is the last opened, and ther∣fore beginning firste vvith creation, I come from thence to redemption and iustification by fayth, and so to election, not that fayth is the cause effi∣cient of election, beeing rather the effect thereof, but is to vs the cause certificatorye, or the cause of our certification, vvhereby vve are broughte to the feeling and knovvledge of oure election in Christ.

So hee that beleeueth that God hath his election from the beginning, and that hee also is one of the same elect and predestinate, hath a good beleefe, & thinketh well, but yet this beleef alone, except it be seasoned vvith another thing, vvill not serue to sal∣uation, as it auayled not the olde Ievves, vvhich so thought of themselues, and yet think to this day to be Gods elect people; Onely the faith vvhich auai∣leth to saluation, is that vvhose obiect is the body & passion of Iesus Christe crucified, so that in the Act of iustifying, these tvvo, faith and Christ, haue a mu∣tuall relation, and must alvvayes concurre together, fayth as the Action vvhich apprehendeth, Christ as the obiect vvhich is apprehended: for neither Iohn 17, 21 rom. 9, 5 col. 2, 7. 1 cor. 10 16. rom. 8, 50. 1 corin. 1, 30.doth the passion of Christe saue vvithout fayth, neither doth faith help, except it be in Christ. As vve see the body of man ustained by bread and drinke, not ex∣cept the same bee receiued▪ and conuayed into the stomack, & yet neyther doth the receiuing of euery thing sustaine mans bodye, except it be meate and drink which haue power to giue nourishmēt. In like fort it is vvith fayth, for neither doth the beleeuing of euery thing saue, but onely faith in the bloude of Christ; neither again doth the same bloud of Christ profite vs, except by fayth it bee receiued. And as the sunne being the cause of al light, shineth not but to thē only which haue eies to see, nor yet to them neyther vnlesse they will open their eyes to receiue the lighte, so the passion of Christe is the efficiente cause of saluation, but fayth is the condition wher∣by the said passion is to vs effectuall. And that is the cause why we say with the scripture, that faith Genes. 15, 6 hahak. 2, 4 math. 9, 22 mark 5, 36 uke 7, 50 acts 10, 43 & 15, 9. rom. 3, 23, 24 28 & 4. 5 & 5. 1. galat▪ 2, 16 & 3, 11. 22 & 5. 6. ephe. 2, 8.only iustifieth vs, not excluding thereby all other extern

But vvhen vve say, that faith only iustifieth vs, the mea∣ning thereof is this, that of al internal actions, mo∣tions or operations in man giuen to him of God, there is no other that contenteth & pleaseth God, or standeth before his iudgement, or can helpe any thing to the iustifying of man before him, but onely this one action of faith in Iesus Christe the sonne of God, for although the action of praying, fasting, almes, patience, charity, repentaunce, the feare and loue of God be high gifts in man, & not of man, gi∣uen of God to man: yet be none of al these actions in man imputed of God to saluation, but only this one action of faith in man, vpon Christe Iesus the sonne of God, not that the action it selfe of belee∣uing, as it is a quality in man, dothe so deserue, but because it taketh that dignitye of the obiect, for faith, as it is an action in man, is not to be conside∣red alone, but must euer goe vvith his obiect, and taketh his vertue thereof. Like as the looking vp of the olde Israelites, did not of it selfe procure anye health vnto them, but the promise made in the ob∣iect, vvhich vvas the brasen Numb. 21, 9 iohn 3, 14.Serpent vvhereuppon they looked, gaue them health by their looking vp; Euen so, after like sort are vve saued by our fayth & spirituall looking vp to the body of Christ crucified, vvhich faith to define is this.
