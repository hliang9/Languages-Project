An ACCOUNT of the Election of the CONVENTION of SCOTLAND, with the Scotch Reasons why the said Convention should Proclaim Their MAJESTIES of England, WILLIAM and MARY, KING and QUEEN of Scotland. SIR, YOurs of the 28th past I receiv'd, and as your Account of the Affairs and Transactions of England is by several Hands (to our general satisfaction) here confirm'd, so I must be bold to tell you, you are very much deceiv'd and abus'd in your Intelligence concerning this Kingdom: For whereas in one Clause of your Letter you insinuate your fears of a Rupture, or a Disagreement at the meeting of our Grand Convention (which will certainly be the 14th. of this Instant. I assure you there is so little reason for your Doubts, that the general Belief of this Kingdom is, that they will in nothing differ from the proceedings of your Conven∣tion, as to the settlement of the CROWN, but in the time for having so good an Example and President at hand, is thought there will be but little delay in their Resolves; Besides, the Country have in the Choice of their Re∣sentatives, been so free and unprejudic'd, that I dare affirm there never was a more just or lestal Assembly than this will prove; many of them do here publickly already applaud and approve the Wisdom and Choice of England; an Instance of which is this Paper therewith sent you (written as is suppos'd by one of the Members) whereby you may guess at their Inclinations, though I cannot say we are wholly without Wicked, Disaffected, Restless, and Turbulent Spirits in some parts, who would willingly Embroil us, if possible; but we doubt not but a happy Agreement of this Healing Convention, in a General Declaring for their present Majesties of England, will confound all their Devices. THô it may be reasonably expected that allitrue Scotsmen may by this time be fully Sensible of what may be most conducing for the Settling this Ancient Kingdom, yet considering that the time for meeting of the Great Con∣vention draws near, and the Affair anent which they are to meet, is of so great Importance, I shall presume to give this brief Advice, And in the first place, I humbly conceive that we cannot pitch upon more feasible means for the attaining a setled and lasting Peace, than that which our Elder Sister England has already fixed upon, viz.That the late King James the Second, having endeavoured to Subvert the Constitution of the Kingdom, by breaking the Original Contract between King and People; And by Advice of Jesuits and other Wicked Persons, having Violated the Fun∣damental Laws; And having withdrawn himself out of his Kingdoms, has Abdicated the Government, and that the THRONE is thereby Vacant; For which Misgovernment He has forfeited the Trust of the Regal Inheri∣tance of the Executive Power both in Himself and in his Heirs Lineal and Colateral; so that the same is devolved back to the People, who have also the Legislative Authority; & consequently may of Right give & dispose thereof by their Representatives for their future Peace, Benefit, Security, and Government, according to their good Will and Plea∣sure. And forasmuch as it is absolutely necessary that the Government be speedily Settled on sure and lasting Foun∣dations, and consequently that such Person or Persons be immediately plac'd in the Throne, in whom the Nation has most Reason to repose an entire Confidence, and therefore have Proclaim'd the Prince and Princess of Orange, King and Queen of England, France, and Ireland &c. And this will easily appear if we Consider, 1. What great dangers the said Neble Prince has exposed himself to in rescuing us from Popery and Slavery, which otherwise would undoubtedly have overflown our Land: And therefore who can we imagine will be so care∣full to Preserve all things in their right Channel, as he that was at such pains to reduce them thereto. 2. By this means we shall secure to our selves the best of Princes, such too, as the whole World that we wat of, does not afford their Equals. 3. We shall in like manner deliver our selves from that Race of POPISH SUCCESSORS that would otherwise certainly be Obtruded upon us, should King James be called home, to the no less prejudice of the Royal Blood, than the Destruction of our KIRK and STATE. For should he be sent for again, we could not Evite the Pretended Prince of Wales's Succeeding him; and if he should dye, the same Tricks would be used for the Im∣posing another upon us, and what an ill Comb we should bring to our own Heads by swae doing, we may easily imagine; And we are not foolishly to expect to be delivered from such a Grievous Bondage as that would be, by extraordinary Miracles, especially if we slight such singular Mercies as GOD has now put into our Hands for the preventing our falling thereinto. 4. We may easily foresee the grievous Inconveniencies that will follow upon the not taking the same Measures that England has taken; for then we can expect no less than to have our Land a seat of War, & to be filled with Rapine & Blood-shed; Let not the old Proverb that we frequently use, to wit, That Scots Folks are aye wise behind hand, now be verified of us. If we are not wilfully Blind, we have a fresh Instance before us of the Mischiefs that shall befall us (if we suffer our selvesito be Imposed upon by Papists and other Disaffected' Persons among us) in the Neighbouring Kingdom of Ireland, which is already so plundred, that in Seven Years it will not recover its Prestine state, and who knows what it may yet Suffer; Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum. 5. By this means both the Succession will be preserved, and the Liberties of the People sufficiently vindicated: For the Princess of Orange is the next Legitimate Successor to the Crown, and her Father having Deserted his Dominions, tle Rights of Succeeding devolves upon her, and in Swae far as she cannot pretend a Right to Succeed during her jathers Life, She comes now to the Crown by Election, which does mightily Confirm the Liberties of the People that a some Case they have a Power to Elect a Governour, and this frees us from the Fears of having a Popish Successor im∣posed upon us. These Things consider'd, I hope our good Patriots, who are to meet in the ensuing Convention, will follow the Pattern which the English Convention hath Cast them, especially seeing, besides the infinite Advantages which will redound to us in this Ancient Kingdom: The whole Protestant Interest abroad, will be very much Supported thereby, which has Suffer'd so much in many Places for several Years, and the King and Queen We are to make Choice of, have always made it their Work to Defend that Interest to the utmost of their Power, and We shall enjoy a Hap∣piness that for several Years we have been wholly Strangers to. In the next place seeing the said Illustrious Prince, has given you a Liberty to redress the manifold Grievances, un∣der which not long ago, you groan'd as under an Aegyptian Bondage: I hope you will take such Methods for freeing your Selves therefrom, that not only the present Age, but even After Generations will have a grareful Remembrance of your Names, and so doing, you shall wipe off that Odium that hath been cast upon our Nation, by the Cruel and Barbarous Acts that have been made by some-Self-seeking Court Parasites that have crept into our Parliaments some years Ago. I shall say no more, but, Verbum Sapienti sat. LONDON: Printed for John Flemming. 1689.
