, OR, HYPERPHYSICALL DIRECTIONS IN TIME OF PLAGUE. Collected out of the Sole-au∣thentick Dispensatory of the chief Physitian both of Soule and Body, And Disposed more particularly (though not without some alteration and addition) according to the method of those Physicall Directions Printed by Com∣mand of the Lords of the Councell at OXFORD 1644. and very re∣quisite to be used with them. Also, certain Aphorismes, premised, and conclusions from them deduced, concerning the Plague, necessary to be known and observed of all, that would either prevent it, or get it cured. By LIONELL GATFORD, Bachelor in Divinity-Physick. In his disease he sought not to the Lord, but to the Physitians. 2 Chron. 16. 12. OXFORD, Printed by H. Hall. 1644.
To the Right Honourable the Lords of the Councell, and others His MAJESTIES Commissioners for the Government of the City of OXFORD, Lionell Gatford wisheth in∣crease of honour, and the blessing of Peace, Temporall and Eternall. BEing unjustly forced from that Cure, whereunto God had called me, as the most of my▪ Profession are, that will not turne Mountebancks and poyson the Peo∣ple) and not suffered▪ upon His Majesties gracious Exchange, (after seaventeene months impri∣sonment in London, without any cause shewen in all that time) either to returne to that Care or to practise any where else with safety (though licensed for all parts of this Kingdome) I was necessitated to repair to this City made happy in the midst of miseries by your Vigilancy & Gods blessing thereupon. I had not beene long here, but I saw and partooke (praysed be the Lord for it) of one of the greatest mercies (let others value it as they please) that ever this City was blessed with: A vast, and in their owne opinion, an invincible Army surrounded
us,2 King 18. and 19. as sometimes the Assyrians did Jerusalem: Their Tartaris, their Rabsarises and their Rabsakehs opened their mouths wide both against our religious Hezekiah, and against all his loyall Subjects then attending his sa∣cred Person, thinking (as their own bloudy Pamphlets did intimate) instantly to have devoured them all. And without doubt, If the Lord himselfe had not been on our side.Psal. 124. If the Lord himselfe had not beene on our side, when those men thus rose up against us, they had swallowed us up quick when they were so wrathfully displeased at us: But bles∣sed be the Lord, he did not give us up as a prey unto their teeth; but put his hooke in their nose,2 Kings 19▪ 28. and his bridle in their lips, and turned them back by the way, not by which they came, but by which they became the object of their Sove∣raign's tender mercy and compassionate pitty, whom they then pursued with their Rebellious malice and mercilesse cruelty. This unspeakable mercy of God to this City, or rather to this whole Nation, was attended upon (whether for our unthankfullnesse, or for our o∣ther sinnes, or for both! with that formidable judge∣ment of Plague. Upon the increasing and spreading whereof, observing, that your Honours, in your extra∣ordinary care of this place, had commanded certaine Physicall directions in time of Plague to be published, I was encouraged to beleeve, that Hyper-physicall directi∣ons for such a time could not want your patronage, And therefore finding none other of my calling, though farre more able, to have prevented me, I pre∣sumed to present you with these: Knowing withall, that without your helpe and assistance, both Physicall and Hyper-physicall prescripts, how excellent soever, will be but of little benefit or profit to the most of men; all
men being naturally prone to reject, at least to neglect that advise which would do them most good: and un∣lesse the Magistrates make them know that they beare not the sword in vaine, but will proceed to severe correction where wholsome instructions are despised, the Divine and Physitian both may prescribe till they are weary, and all to no purpose.Numb. 16▪ 46. We reade of an Aaron needing a calling upon from Moses to do what belonged to him in the time of a Plague.Numb, 25. 8. But as the Plague may be (and, for ought any man knowes to the contrary, this Plague may be such) the Magistrates actuall exercising their power in the execution of justice upon some pro∣voking Offenders may be so necessarily required, that the raging contagion will not cease without it. This I am confident of, and not without good grounds: That would your Honours be pleased but to revive the execution of some of your owne Lawes against that one horrid crying sinne of swearing and blaspheming Gods name, which so raignes in our streets and houses, the Plague of God would not rage so much in them, as now it doth.Exod. 20. 7. The Lord (saith the Commandement) will not hold him guiltlesse that taketh his name in vaine 'Tis swearing (saith one of the Prophets) that brings the flying rowle of the curse into mens houses,Zach. 5. v. 3, 4. and makes it to remaine there, till it have consumed both them and the very timber and stones thereof. And 'tis for swearing amongst other foule crimes (saith another Prophet) that the Land mournes.Hose 2 4, v. 2, 3. As therefore ye tender particu∣lar mens persons, that have jeoparded their lives, for you, as ye regard the welfare of this City, wherein God hath preserved you, and as ye love this whole Land, wherein God hath highly honoured you, suffer not the
sacred Name of that gracious and glorious God, who hath wrought these and other infinite mercies for you, to be dishonoured and profaned so as it is by cursed Oathes and blasphemous Cursings. Let some sharpe mulcts against Cursing and Swearing be duly inflicted and required, that if the dread of that Name do not ter∣rifie men from so abusing it, yet the feare of that Power wherewith God hath intrusted you, and their owne just punishment for disregarding both, may make them affraid to use that Name in vaine, which you have found by so often experiment not to be in vaine to those that honour and rely upon it: so shall your names be preci∣ous in Gods account, your freinds and servants that fly hither for succour be solaced and confirmed in their expectation thereof, your enemies mouthes be stopped in one of their lowdest clamours, and all both freinds and foes, that visit this City, be constrained to acknowledge, that the streets and ordinary places of concourse, under your Government are sweeter and better kept, then the Churches and Pulpits under the Rebells Tyranny. Pardon me (I humbly beseech you) for Pleading thus earnestly in this cause. The King's, your Honours, and this whole Kingdomes hopes of deli∣verance from those sore judgements, under which they still groane, (as well as those miraculous deliverances that have beene vouchsafed us) depend wholly upon that great Name. And therefore if not my zeale to Gods glory, yet my loyalty to my Soveraigne, my duty to your Honours, and my love to my Nation, may ex∣cuse my boldnesse in minding you of a speedy vindi∣cation of the honour of that Name. I know there are many other crimes amongst us, that cry alowde for
your more then ordinary care and diligence, zeale and courage,Hom. 3. ad pop Antioch. in chastening and correcting the daring a∣ctors of them: but (as Chrysostome once-spake) I con∣ceive this to be the best way of correction,. to beginne first with one part of the Law, and see that that be observed, and then to go on to the rest. And with what part should ye begin first, if not with that, which is most transgressed, and (if it be rightly considered) easiest to be amended: Ʋp, then in the name of God, and sanctify the People by purging out from them this spreading sinne of cursing and swearing;Joshus. 7. v. 13 and proove the Lord whether he will not,Malach. 3. 10. upon your banishing the Plague of God, and other rash curses and oathes out of mens mouthes, banish that Judg∣ment of the Plague it selfe and other Judgements from this City; The forementioned Father was bold to in∣gage his word & credit to the Citizens of Antioch, that upon their abstaining from swearing God would free them from that great Calamitie which was then upon them., &c. I dare not undertake so farre; but it were well if you would please to make tryall, whether God would do so much, or not. This you may be assured of, for you have Gods owne word and promise for it, whe∣ther the Plague shall thereupon be removed from o∣thers dwellings or not,Hom 3. ad Pop. Antioch. That love of yours to his name shall keepe you and your owne dwellings safe.Psal. 69. 36. & Psal. 91. As for your Honours observing these Directions your selves, it were too presumptuous a thought in me to expect, that any advise of mine should be hearkened unto by you who have so many learned and renowned Doctors to consult upon all occasions: yet where you find that I speake home to the purpose and God himselfe speakes the same, though not for my sake, yet for his, daigne
it the hearing, I and the following too, if you love your owne safety. Howsoever if you shall but tolerate and approve these Directions so farre, that others under your present charge, who cannot, many of them have accesse to those that are more learned and better able to counsell them, or rather are affraid or ashamed to appeare to such, how willing or ready soever to re∣ceive them, may by that your toleration and approba∣tion (the Reverend Doctors not dissenting be fully satis∣fied, that there is nothing herein prescribed, but what is good and wholesome, and will, through Gods bles∣sing, conduce much to their health and preservation, this will be ample honour and encouragement to Your Honours most humbly devoted Servant L. G.
Certaine Aphorismes and conclu∣sions from them deduced, concerning the Plague, necessary to be knowne of all that would either prevent it, or get it cured. AS there is a Corporall or Bodily Plague; which is by Physitians defined to be, A Com∣mon Epidemicall disease, most acute, contagi∣ous, and pernicious, that with its secret or close-lurking malignity, and Spiritfull poison invades and infects the heart and vitall spirits with all other parts of the body, suddainly and speedily over∣throwing them by causing extreame putridnesse and raging di∣stempers therein; shewing it selfe at the last, and for the most part, in spots, sores, or Carbuncles, together with other dange∣rous and deadly Symptomes. So there is also a Spirituall or Soule-Plague1 Kings: 8, 38., called Sinne, which according to Divines, is a transgression of Gods Law1 Iohn. c. 3 v. 4. Rom. 7. v. 7, 8. cap. 4. v. 15. causing deathRom. 7. v. 9, 10, 11. cap. 5. 12, Deut. 30. Ezek. 18. temporall and eternall; and may, for its neare resemblance to the other Plague, be further described in the same termes with it: viz. An universallRom. 3. v. 9, 10, 11. 12, 19. 3. 1 Iohn. c. 1. v. 8. 10. or epidemicall diseaseEz. k. 34. v. 4. Math. 8. v. 17., most acuteGen. 6 5 Ps. 19. 1., conta∣giousIsah. 6. cap 24. 5. Psal. 106. 35. Re∣vel 18. 4., and perniciousLevit. 26. Deut. 28. Rom. 6. 23. 1 Cor. 6. v 9, 10., that with its secret or close-lurkingPsal. 19. 12. Rom. 7. 23. malignity and spiritfull poisonDeut. 32. v. 33. Psal. 140. 3 James 3. v. 6. 8. invades and infects, &c. (2) The Plague of the Soule is the originall or principall cause of the plague of the bodyLevit. 26 v. 23. 25. Deut. 28. v. 15 21. Jerem. 29. v. 18, 19. Ezek, 14. v. 23. 19. Numb. 12. v. 4. 33. cap. 16. v. 41. 46.. And therefore without all di∣spute the best and surest, if not the onely course for avoiding or expelling the Plague of the body, is to avoid or expell the Plague of the soule1 Kings: 8. v 37, 38, 39. Ezek. 9. v. 4, 5, 6..No disease, say Physitians, can be ta∣ken away, unlesse the cause be taken away; and the cause being removed, say the Naturalists, the effect removes
with it; and the onely way that the Scriptures prescribe to get quit of any judgement, is first to get quit of SinneJerem. 18. v. 8. Ezek. 18. 30 Hosea: 6. v. 1. Luke: 13. v. 3, 5.. (3) As the Plague of the body (according to Physitians in their Physicall way) is caused either by externall causes, such as the consuption of the aire, the contagious touch of some bo∣dies or things, &c. or else by internall causes, such as the putrefaction of the bloud or humours, &c. So the Plague of the Soule (according to Divines in their Theologicall way) is caused either by externall temptations and provo∣cations, and those principally of the sensesGenes. 3. v. 6, 17. cap. 6. 2. 2 Sam, 11. 2. Prov. 6. v. 24, 25. cap. 7. 21., to some where∣of the poison of the temptation is conveyed by the aire, to others by some contagious touchProv. 6. 29. cap. 7. 13. 2 Co. 6 17.; or else by internall cor∣ruptionRom. 7. v. 20, 21, 23, 24. Genes. 6 5. Matth. 15. 19., the seed whereof is derived unto us from our ParentsPsal. 52. 5. Rom. 5. 12. Ezek. 16. 3.. And therefore if we would be preserved from the one plague as well as the other, we must provide and furnish our selves with such antidotes and preservatives, such cordialls and other approved remedies, as are good and pro∣per for the resisting and expelling of both sorts of corrupti∣on and putrefaction, as well externall, as internall. And such you shall finde by and by prescribed in their due order. (4) Not onely the Body-PlagueLevit 26. 25, Deut. 28, 21. Numb. 1 33. cap. 16. 46. 2 Sam. 24. 15. Amos 4 10. it selfe, but also all the na∣turall or physicall causes thereof, are themselves caused by God, as the supreme and hyperphysicall causePsal. 38. v. 3, 7. Deut. 28. v. 22, 61. Psal. 74. v. 17. Job. cap. 37, & 38. Amos 3. 6.. And therefore as we endeavour by Physicall preservatives to keepe and de∣fend our selves against the naturall and second causes of that disease before it seize upon us; and as we apply to our selves physicall medicines to cure us of it, when it hath taken hold on us: So we must not faile to addresse and apply our selves by hyperphysicall meanes and wayes to the supreme and first cause1 Kings: 8. 37, 38. 2 Sam. 24 v. 17, 18, 21. 2 Kings: 20, v. 2, 3. 7. Hosea 6. 1. 2 Chr. 16. 12., who disposeth and ordereth both that disease it selfe and all its causes as he pleasethDeut. 32. 39. Psal. 135. 6..
(5) It is acknowledged by the best of Physitians (as a learned Doctor in that faculty Mathias ƲntzerLib. 2. delue pestif∣ra. informes me) That although there are many excellent medicines found out, and by reason, use, and experience of the wisest approved to be very happy and successefull, both for the preventing and cu∣ring the Plague of the body; yet it was never said, written, read, nor heard (they are the Authors owne words) that a∣ny mortall man, of all those that have beene, or are, could truly assume so much glory to himselfe, as to say that God had shewne and revealed to him any true certaine Antidote or Medicine against it, either to preserve man from it, or to expell it from man; but God reserves that skill to himselfe; and that, (as some Physitians as well as Divines conceive) because God would not have men to know any sure defence against that his just scourge of Sinne, but onely in him and from him. And therefore though we doe and ought to make use of such preservatives and medicines2 Kings. 20, 7. in time of Plague, as GodJob. 5. 28. James 1. 17. 1 Cor, 12. 9. hath by learned and experienced PhysitiansColoss 4. 14. impar∣ted unto us; giving him thankes for themEphes. 5 20.: Yet we can∣not and ought not to rely upon them: but we must submit all to the Lord and rest upon himDeut. 32. 39. Psal. 121. v. 1, 2. and Psal. 107, v. 18, 19, 20. Luk. 8. 43, 44.. And if we so doe, and re∣pent truly of our sinnes, and doe that which is just and right; although the Physitian can prescribe no certaine infallible re∣medy for it; yet the Divine can, so farre as to assure thee that it shall not hurt thee. For thy so doing (I meane thy re∣penting truly of all thy sinnes, and relying wholly upon God in and through the merits and mediation of Christ,) will undoubtedly preserve theeEzek. 18. 30. Psal. 1▪ 9 1 and Psal. 31. 19., if not from its stroke, from its venime and poison; so that, if it kill thee, yet it shall do thee no harme; for that he will be the death of its death, or the plague to its death for theeJohn: 11 25, 26, 1 Cor. 15. v. 55, 56, 57: Hos. 13. v. 14.; and thy death shall be an advantage to theePhilip. 1. 21.. (6) Whatsoever we take or make use of to prevent or expell
the Plague either of Body or Soule, must be taken or used speedily, without the least delayNumb. 16. 45. 46. 2 Sam. 24 15, Joel. 2. 12. Psal. 95. v. 7, 8. Isaiah 55. 6. Prov. 1. v. 24, 25, 26, 27, 28.: for the poyson of both Plagues is so subtill and spiritfull, that it both infects and kills in a very short time; oftentimes in a few houres. These Aphorismes and conclusions being premised, I hope the following Directions will prove the more benefi∣ciall, provided that these two cautions be observed. First, That these Directions be look't upon directly as they are, not as the originall prescripts of a Divine, for then there had beene lesse of the Physitian in them, but as the oc∣casionall meditations of a Divine upon the originall pre∣scripts of a Physitian, and so there is a kinde of necessity, that they should favour the more both of the Physitians and his  to, his medicinall confections and his medicinall expressions. Secondly, That whereas the Director keeping close to the Allegory makes use of Physicall termes to expresse Theo∣logicall graces, the Reader be not so gracelesse as to abuse those expressions to the venting of his owne rudenesse and prophanesse.
HYPERPHYSICALL DIRECTI∣ons in time of PLAGUE, &c. THe first and most generall preservative against this infection is not named by the Author of the Physicall directions; for that (as I suppose) he thought it more dangerous to fly from this City, as the case then was, then to abide in it: it being better to fall into the hands of God, who in wrath remembers mercy; then into the hands of such mercilesse bloody men, as then did, and still doe lye in waite to de∣vour us: howsoever I shall be bold to mention it, as being altogether requisite in that case that I shall apply it unto. The Preservative that I meane, is the flying from such Persons and places as are infected. 'Tis approved of in the Letter concerning the Body-Plague; provided, that they who would make use of that meanes have no publique or private bond upon them to the contrary, and that they doe not take that course, as an occasion to save their purses from contributing to the releife and support of those who stay behind them, and are in want; as also, that they do not trust too much upon their flight, as thinking themselves secur∣ed thereby. But in the Allegory as it concernes the Soule Plague, the flying from Persons and plates infected, is not only a prescript of Councell but of Command; and the con∣tagion cannot well be avoyded without itNumb. 16. 26. Jerem 51. 6. Rev. 18. 4. Tit. 3. 10. 1 Cor. 5. 11. 2 Cor. 6. 17. Prov. 5. 8. and cap. 24. 21.. Whether men fly or not, let as many, as have not done it before, set their houses in Order, and settle their estates2 Kings 20, 1. making the best provision they are able for their Wives and Children1 Tim. 5. 8., and not forgetting the PooreProv. 19. 17. and cap. 21, 13. Psal. 41. v. 1, 2, 3. Dan. 4. 27.. Have a care what Strangers thou receivest and entertain∣est in thy house. To entertaine strangers especially in times
of distresse, is an excellent meanes of preservation to a whole family, for thereby some have entertained Angels unawaresHeb. 13. 2., and those such Angells as have preserved them and theirs from the universall destruction of that City wherein they have livedGen. 19.: and 'tis a most acceptable thing both to God and Christ to entertaine some strangersDeutr 10. v. 18, 19. Job: 31. v: 32. Mat. 25. v: 35, 40. 3 E∣pist John v: 5. Isaiah 58. 7. 8., and the excluding or neglecting them most distastfullMat: 25. 43, 45.. Yet 'tis good to be∣ware whom thou entertainest, lest otherwise thou chance to entertaine Devils in the forme of Angels. In particular beware of false Prophets, or false Teachers, who privily bring in damnable heresies, where e're they come, causing the way of truth by their pernicious wayes to be evill spoken of, and with their fained words make merchandise of mens soules2 Pet: 2. v 1, 2, 3., you shall know them by those markes, by which Saint Peter describes them, such as the despising of govern∣ment, carrying themselves presumptuously and selfe-will'dly; speaking evill of dignities2 Pt: 2. from v: 10, to v: 20., &c. If any such come unto you, or any other that bring any other doctrine then what is consonant to the doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, receive them not into your house, neither bid them God speed2 Epist: John v: 10.. Be∣ware also of all such as use to creep into houses, and lead Captive silly women, whether they be Prophets, or not2 Tim: 3. 6., you shall know them also by those markes which Saint Paul sets them out by2 Tim: 3. v: 3, 4, 5., if you be but carefull to observe them. And because you will say 'tis impossible to know whether strangers be such, or not, I would advise you to be the more carefull, that those strangers whom you do entertaine be able to shew you some way or other either by the re∣port of othersAct: 10. 22. and cap. 22. 12. Heb: 11. 39. 3 Epist: John v: 3, 6., or by their owne deportmentJames 2. 18. and cap: 3. v: 12, 13. Mat. 7. 16., some good testimoniall of their being free from all such infection or con∣tagion. But if they cannot do that for the present. Not∣withstanding use them humanely and intreat them kindly, so long as thou knowest nothing to the contrary, but that they are cleare and free, and that for his sake who shewed such kindnesse and compassion to thee, when thou wast a stranger to him and stript of all thou hadst that good was, and wounded and cast out into the high way ready to perish,
those that knew thee, passing by thee, neither willing nor able to helpe thee. I meane Jesus Christ himselfe, who tells thee this of himselfe in a parableLuke 10. v: 30, 31. &c., and bids thee do the likeI: v 37.. Nay further; If thou suspect them or know them not to be free from infection, yet if they be in extreme want, make the best provision for them that thou canst with safety to thy selfe and family. And that still for his sake who entertained thee when thou wert a stranger to him and to all worth and goodnesse that might any wayes deserve the least kindnesse from himEphes: 2. v: 12, 13, &c:, viz. their Lord and thine; they being his crea∣turesEzek: 18. 4. Mala: 2. 10. and bearing his imageGen: 9 6., as well as thy selfe, and stand∣ing and falling only to himRom: 14. 4.. And so I passe on to the preser∣vatives prescribed in the Physicall Directions.

An especially care must be had of thy wearing clothes, for that they being of a loose porous spongie substance, are vey apt to receive and retaine contagion. And we are told by good Authors that have written of the Plague, that some∣times
the poyson thereof hath layen in clothes, and other things of that nature, which have beene layed aside before they have beene well ayred, not onely divers monthes, but yeares, and then infected all that have medled with them: the experience of divers amongst us can witnesse much in this particular. And 'tis further to be noted, that the poyso∣nous seed of this contagion being in a garment, doth passe from thence, not onely into the living bodyes of men, but also into things without life; as namely, from one garment into another, and doth sometimes so lurke in garments, that it hurteth not him in whose garment it is, and yet infects and kils others that come neere it. It behoveth every one then to be very carefull of his wearing apparell; as they were of old commanded to be, when the Plague of LeprousieLevit. cap. 13. & 14. was in any place, or other foule diseasesLevit. cap. 15., And to that purpose be ad∣vised to avoyd all fantasticall affected fashions of garmentsZeph 1. 8. Is. 3. 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. the contagion thereof being very catching. The fashion of open breasts, how common soever amongst women, is very infectious, and some men may with more safety come neere breasts full of Plague-spots, then such breasts: for the uncovering of the breasts, is, for the most part, a symptome of excesse of lustfull heate in the body: and the laying open to common view that reserved repose of modest lovePro. 5. 19., is a strong temptation to immodest desires to take up their lodg∣ing thereHos. 2, v. 2., as supposing those breasts not unwilling to be bruisedEzech. 23. v. 3. 8., that are willing so to be exposed. Neither is this all the danger; (though it be danger enough, one would thinke, to hazard the losse of thine owne, and others soules, by thy fond and wanton attiring thy body) but thou hast cause to feare, lest thy making naked, and discovering those parts, which thou shouldst not, provoke God to strip thee of all thy apparell and ornaments, and leave thee naked and bare to thy shame and confusion here, as well as to thy con∣demnation hereafterIs. 3. 17, 18. Ezek. 16. v. 37. 39. cap. 23 v. 26▪ 28, 29, 34. Hos. 2, v. 3.. Blacke spots and patches, and other paintings and pargetings of the face, as constantly worne by some as any other dresse or attire, are most fouly contagious, & although now (the more is the pity) they are become the
weare of some honest and honourable personages, yet they are suspected to have had their first originall from that pestilentiall disease, called luet venerea, a very sore infe∣ctions Plague: and notwithstanding that they are by some re∣puted to render faces the fayrer, yet the more sober and chast judge such faces, and their whole bodyes not alitle the fouler for them1 King. 9. v. 30. Pro. 7. 13. Je. 3. v. 3 cap. 4. v. 30. Nalt. 3. 5. Hos, 3. 2 sower that place thus. Let her put away her for∣nications from her face &c.: and let such faces take heed they doe not one day gather other blacknesseNahu. 2, 10. Lam. 4. 9.; therefore weare no more on thy face, then thou wilt be willing to appeare with before the face of thy judge. Superfluity and excesse in apparell is also exceeding dangerous, especially in times of Gods, wrath. We reade of men threatned to be cut off for it, and that (as 'tis thought by divers of good judgement) not onely for being effeminate themselves, as too many Phanta∣stickes use to be in their unmanly habits and fancies, but for suffering and maintaining their wives and children in that their folly and vanityIs. 3. from v. 16. 10 26. 1 Pet. 3. v. 3 4, 5. 1 Tim. 2, v. 9.. There is no little danger likewise at such times, and more particularly on dayes of publique hu∣miliation, to weare soft rayments or costly apparell, which may be worne by such as are of place and dignity, on other dayes and at other times.

And, which is worth our inquiring into, ve∣ry few, if any, of those who have beene infected with the

Se afterwards in Diet. I would not have thee to breake the' publike religious Fast, if any be appointed by the supreme Magistrate, no nor thine owne private religious fast, resolv∣ed on for thy selfe alone, or for thine owne family with thee;
for so farre thy power extends; but that is the utmost ex∣tent of a private fast, and they, who goe farther in appoynt∣ing a Fast, incroach upon the Princes royall power, whosoe∣ver they are. The taking those things which I prescribe, is no breach, I am sure, of either of these fasts, but an helpe to the better keeping of both; and, as farre as I yet apprehend, the taking of such things, as are in such times prescribed by the Physitians, or otherwise communicated for preservation, is in that respect the like; The fast, that I advise thee to breake, is that fast whereunto every man, through the aboun∣dance of corruption that is in him, is most naturally inclined, viz. the absteining from all spirituall food and nourish∣mentAmos. 8. 12. 1 Cor. 10 v. 3, 4., &c. and this fast thou must breake in the time of Plague especially.

This bread and flesh if thou canst feed on it by a true and a lively faith, my life for thine, no plague shall
hurt theeIb.. Eate thereof every day more or lesse according to that provision which thou hast made; and as oft1 Cor. 11. v. 25. 26. as thou are invited; if thy appetite be good, doe but examine thy selfe, and eate freely of it at thy Lords Table1 Cor: 11. v. 27, 28, 29. cap. 10 v. 21.. To prescribe what particular meates every man should, or should not eate, were not onely ridiculous but impossible, so different and contrary are severall mens tempers and constitutions, and so much also, upon occasionall alterations, doth the same mans temper and constitution differ from it selfe. Those meates which are wholsome for some, are little lesse then poison to others; and that which at one time nourisheth a man, may at another time helpe to destroy the same man.

Fish that is taken by poiso∣ning or intoxicating them1 Sam. 15, 23, Ga∣lat. 3. 1., or by the Angle of deceitHb: 1, 15., or by the net of hypocrisyIb., or by the degree of violence and ra∣pineIb., (the prime wayes that those great Fishers neare Lon∣don upon the bankes of Thames use in these times) may per∣chance be sweet in the mouth, but either they prove very ill of digestion, or being digested, generate onely putrid and corrupt humours, which dispose and expose the eaters there∣of to all manner of plagues and diseasesSee the places now cited for every parti∣cular.. Some Fruits are of admirable virtue against all infection, as fruits worthy of repen∣tanceMath: 3. v. 8:, the fruit of wisedomeProv. 8. v. 19., the fruit of righteousnessePhilip: 1, 11., and all the other fruits of the SpiritGalat. 5. v. 22, 23.: Other fruits are as deadly poisonous, as the fruit of the wickedProv: 10. 16., the fruit of our owne wayProv: 1, v. 31., and all the fruits of the flesh, commonly called, the workes of the fleshGal. 5. v. 19, 20, 21..

Deu 16, v. 16.. But the avoiding all such emptinesse both of heart and hand is most consistent with such fasting as the time of Plague calls for and God accepts; And therefore though I allow not emptinesse, yet I cannot but magnify fasting as one of the best courses that can be taken either to prevent or expell the Plague, if it be observed ac∣cording to the following prescript.

And if the Plague should feise upon thee whilst thou art thus exercising thy selfe, happy will it be for thee to be
found so doingMat. 24. 46., whereas to be found idle or ill employed at such a timeMat. 24, 48, 49, 50, 51., gives the Plague the more power over thee, as finding more corruption in thee to lay hold onPro. 24. 30, 31., and thee out of that way wherein God hath promised to protect and keepe theePsa. 91. 9, 1, 11, Psal. 33, 18, 19. Psal, 144, 20.. The last meanes of preservation according to the com∣mon prescrips of Physicians, is that which ought to be the first and chiefest in the care and practise of every wise man. Namely, the fortifying and defending the heart and vitall parts by Cordials, against the venime and poyson of that perni∣cious disease. For although there be no member, no entrall, no part or particle of the whole body of man, which doth not feele the insulting cruelty and rageing tyranny of this acute destroying disease; yet of all the rest the heart is the most infected, corrupted, tortured and afflicted with its pe∣stiferous venome; because the heart is the magazine of a∣ctive heat, the royall fort of life, and the fountaine of all the vitall Spirits; which being once vanquished and taken, the victory over all the other parts of man is most easie and ex∣pedite: and it is the nature and property of all poyson, e∣specially of this most subtle and deadly poyson, chiefely and principally to assault and invade, and so to wast and ruine the native heat, and vitall spirits, and in them life it selfe. It may, and doth make its way to the heart by, or through o∣ther parts of the body, and so perhaps shewes it selfe in them first: but 'tis the surprising and overcomming the heart which it principally aimes, and drives at. Take this either literally of the Body-Plague, or Allegorically of the Soule-Plague; you will finde it most true of both. The heart is the principall subject of the Plague of the body; so Physitians; The heart, (that is, the understanding, will, and affections) is the principall subject of the Plague of the soule, so the Scriptures1 K. 8. 38. Gen. 6. 5. Mat. 15. 19. Eccle. 8. 11. Deut. 29. 18. 19. Jer. 11. 8. cap. 17. 9.. Above all things then have a care to preserve thy heartPro. 4. 23.

And for Cordials, because there are so many excellent ones,
and particular mens, tempers and cases are so different. I ad∣vise every one to make his addresse (as before in point of diet) to some discreet learned expert Divine-Physitian of knowne honesty and integrity; and unlesse there be some very good reason to the contrary, rather to his own Physici∣an that hath undertaken the care of him, and best knowes his state, then to any otherSc Dyet. let.

I shall willingly cor∣rect it: Or if he shall prescribe any, that are more accurate, I shall amongst others most humbly thanke him for it. Now for Curation, I observe that that Reverend Physiti∣an, whose method I have kept the most close to of any's, adds very little for the curing of the Plague to what he had prescribed for the preserving from it,Psal. 38. Genes. 4. 13. Mat. 27. 3, 4, 5. except it be for curing the botches, sores, or Carbuncles. And as I apprehend, he therefore doth so, first, because the same physicke, especially the Cordiall Physicke, that is good for preservation, is as good as can be thought on, in ordinary cases, for cure, only where need requires, as it doth in the most, the quantity of the ingredients must be augmented. Secondly, because mens tempers and constitutions as I before told you are so differ∣ent, and in a manner contrary, and the poyson of the disease infecteth and corrupteth in such different wayes and degrees that 'tis not good, scarce safe either for Physitian or the par∣ties infected to adventure upon any Physicke, without the advise (where 'tis to be had and time permits) of some able Physitian, whom they shall please to acquaint with their particular present state and condition. The like course upon the like reasons shall I observe in these my Hyperphysicall Directions. For generall curative Physicke, in generall cases,
where any are infected, (as who can say I am cleaneProv. 20. 9. John 15. 15, 16. 1 John 1, 8  10.?) I know no better, then what I have acquainted you with, by way of preservatives: onely the quantity of the ingredients, and so of the DosesThe quantity of the severall ingredients and particular doses both for preservation and curanen, I there∣fore omitted because their nature is such as cannot be proporti∣oned., is to be increased, as there is cause. And for particular cases I once againe, as before, advise every man that desires to deale safely for himselfe, and would have his Physitian to deale so too, by all meanes to repaire (if he have the Liberty) to some discreet learned Divine Physitian for his particular counsell concerning his particular stateSee before Diet. let.

A Postscript of Gratitude. To the Worshipfull Master Thomas Smith the late Loyall Major of the renowned City of Oxford. Worthy Sir, THese Directions published for the common good of this City, and therefore dedicated to those Superiour powers, which at this time have more then ordinary influence into the Government thereof, could not passe quietly from my hand to the presse with∣out giving you some particular interest in them, both because I re∣ceived (besides other kindnesses) the constant food that sustained me all the littletime wherein I was composing them (as well as be∣fore and since) at your table; and so 'tis but a due returne of that fruit which your bounty and liberality help't to foster; as also, be∣cause 'tis conceived by them that know you, that your good ex∣ample in observing them, will be no small inducement to others, especially of your owne politie, the more readily and willingly to put them in practise. Other retribution, though none more cor∣diall, shall hereafter be made you, if God make me able. Let it suf∣fice for the present, that as you forget not to doe good, and to commu∣nicate Sacrifices with which God is well pleased: Heb. 13. 16. So that good which you have done, and those good things whereof you have communicated, are not forgotten by all those that have par∣ticipated of them. By all did I say? nay I verily beleeve by none at all, that are truly loyall, and such onely, as neare as you could, were the constant partakers of your courtesie and hospitality; for certainly, they that in such times as these dare be loyall, scorne to be ungratefull. Let this poore commemoration of your rich boun∣ty to such be an earnest thereof: and what I and others of His Ma∣jesties Loyall Subjects are not able to requite, without doubt, that God, for whose sake and cause you have done it, will abundantly recompence into your bosome. For which purpose Saint Pauls benediction, That he that ministreth seed to the sower, will both mi∣nister bread for your food, and multiply your seed sowen, and increase the fruits of your righteousnes. 2 Cor. 9. 10. Shall be the daily prayers of Your much obliged L. G.
