A True Testimony OF OBEDIENCE TO THE Heavenly Call, For which I suffer the loss of all things, that I may be found in obedience to him who hath called me. A Servant of the Lord, and a Prisoner for the Testimo∣ny of Jesus, whom he hath called by his grace to deny the world, and am made partaker of his suffer∣ings, being in outward bonds (by the deceit) in West-Chester, and of his free-will hath given me not only to beleeve, but to suffer for his Name sake, who hath called me out of my own Country, and from my fathers house, and to go in obedience to his Command whithersoever he shall call me: while I was young I girded my self, and went whither I would, and then I yielded obedience to my own will and to the will of man, and was a man-pleaser, but the Will of God I knew not, neither was obedient to his Commands; but when the Lord was pleased to reveal his Son in me, and
make known his Will unto me, to enlighten me with his true Light which hath enlightened every one that cometh into the world, and by it let me see my self to be a strrnger to him, and knew him not, though I was grown mighty in the Egyptians wisdom, and was in love with the world, and in the favour of men, and in a profession and words of mans wisdom exceeded others, being in a form of godliness, but was ignorant of his Power and his Word; but when his Power was made mani∣fest, and his Word spoken within me, which Word was in my heart, and was as a fire or a hammer, and this Word being made manifest within me, and my Conscience being awakened by the light of God, which did convince me of sin, and did testifie against all my words and actions, and that just Judg∣ments of God were revealed from Heaven against that nature I lived in, and the Trumpet of the Lord was sounded within me, and the Earth did tremble, and the vials of the wrath of the Almighty was poured down upon me, and the powers of the Earth were terribly shaken, the foundation of wisdom and earthly knowledg was shaken, and the Judgments of God were upon the outward man till my flesh was wasted off my bones, and the bones smote one against another, and I knew the Lord to be terrible, and his Word powerful, in burning up and hammering down the lustful nature I lived in, in pleasure and wantonness, in pride and fulness, which the Word of the Lord was declared against, and this Word I witness spoken from the Lords own Power within me, which made my flesh and bones to tremble exceedingly, and did cause pain in all my loyns, and paleness of face, my comliness was turned into cor∣ruption, and my joy into lamentation, and I was brought to the bed of sorrows, where I cryed out in the bitterness of my spirit, and I had no ease nor rest, day nor night, for the hearing of the ear which I did hear, and the sight of mine eyes which I did see; I heard the sound of the Trumpet, the Alarum of War within me, terrors, wo, misery and destruction was upon me, in my trouble I cryed in the evening would God it were morning, and in the morning would God it were evening; and the terrors of the Almighty being upon me, my Acquaint∣ance
and familiars stood afar off me, for they knew not the power of the Lord, nor the Judgments of my God, which I do witness to be revealed and made manifest in me; and the Lord raised up in me a love to his Word, by which all the powers of the Earth did tremble, and the Earth it self was shaken by it, and by this Word was I called to go and declare it, as I had received it from the Lord; to those who lived in the same heathenish nature, without the knowledge of God, and to declare the Judgments of God against sin and ungodliness, as they were made manifest in me: and by this Word was I call∣ed to forsake father and mother, lands and living to go in obedience to the Lord, who commanded me not to take thought what I should eat, or what I should drink, or where∣with I should be cloathed; but cast my care upon him, and this I witness the Lords care, and those whom the Lord calls into his Work and who labor in his Vineyard need not to com∣plain to the wold for want, and for yeilding obedience to the Lord and his Commands, and not giving obedience to the corrupt will of man: who commands me contrary to what the Lord hath commanded: do I suffer under the persecution of those who are set in the place of Rulers, and Magistrates professing themselves to be Ministers of the Law of England and to act Justice according to that Law, and do bear the names of Major Justices of peace, and Magistrates, and say they act according to the Law of the Nation and present Go∣verment, but they are seen to be in the generation of those who were ever persecutors of the righteous Seed, where ever it is brought forth: and the Servants of the Lord in all ages were ever persecuted by that generation, professing to be Ministers of Justice; but that which is acted is cruelty persecution and Injustice, and the Righteous suffer, which the Law was not for; but for the Lawless and disobedient, and was added be∣cause of transgression: The Righteous Law of God was made to be afflicted upon Transgressors and breakers of the Law; but the unrighteous Law of men is afflicted upon the Righteous who walk blameless, and are proved no Transgres∣sors: but in Obedience to the Lord, do witness a good conver∣sation
towards God and towards men, our consciences bearing us witness in the sight of God, and those who are Rulers of the City and rulers of the sinogogue under which I suffer imprison∣ment, Say, this is their law that if I will go home into my own country and to my fathers house, and stay there, and depart this City, I may be free upon this accompt, else I shall remain in prison, and this is contrary to the command of the Lord, for he hath commanded me out of my own country and from my fathers house, but my own country, dwelling and fathers house, the world knows not, that which I am called from they know the natural man knows that which is natural, and this is con∣trary to the law of the nation, for the law of the nation doth not confine any to stay at one place, nor to be kept from any one city, being proved no transgressor, nor breaker of the law, but I seek a countrey and a City whose builder and maker is God, and truly if I had been mindfull of the country I came forth▪ and did love the pleasures, delights and flesh pots of Egyp which I am called from I might have had opportunitie to have returned thither but in obedience to the Lord I had rather suffer affliction with the people of God, then enjoy the pleasures of Egypt, and you who say I have no lawfull calling, I doe wit∣nesse the same Word of God the true prophets of the Lord was commanded by to declare against all sin and ungodlinesse, by the same Word doe I declare against it where I am command∣ed of the Lord and am called out of the same calling that they were, into the same work of the Lord which they were, and so I do witnesse the testimony of my bretheren the prophets that went before me, who hath left an example in record of suffer∣ing affliction and of patience, and we count them happie which endure. Elisha was a plough-man, and when the Word of the Lord came to him, he left the plough and obeyed the Word of the Lord, and his call was lawful. Amos was a herdman, and a gatherer of Sicamore fruit, and the Lord took him as he was following the flock, and the Lord said unto him, Go Prophecy unto my people Israel, and he obeyed the Word of the Lord and Prophesied in the Kings Chappel, and in the Kings Court, and his calling was lawful,
and I do witness the same Call, who was a Husbandman and had a Vineyard and gathered fruit, till the Word of the Lord came and called me from it, and he turned my mind within, and enlightened my understanding, and opened the Creation to me, and let me see the Vineyard without was but a figure, and that I must come into his Vineyard to labor in his Work: and gathering fruit without was but a figure; for there is fruit within to be gathered; a possession without was but a figure, there was a Possession and an Inheritance to be enjoyed with∣in, and that figures must pass away to come to the Everlasting Inheritance, which is within, which never fades away: out of time, into that which is Eternal: and for this cause, and by this Word did I forsake Father, and Mother, Lands, and Livings, House and Vineyard, to follow Jesus Christ and do what so ever he commands me, and this Call I witness to be Lawful, and the Word of the Lord is gone forth to command Sons and Daughters to Prophesie in his Name, and they have no other Call, and they go as they are commanded, as ever the true Prophets of the Lord did, if it be to the Kings Chappel, or to the Kings Pallace, or to the Synagogues, or into the Cities or the Markets to declare against sin and iniquity, and where they see the people given to Idolatry and prophaneness, their spirit being raised up by the power of the Lord, and by the Word of the Lord do they declare against it, and they have no other Call but the Word of the Lord, and they have a Cloud of Witnesses, for all the Prophets of the Lord spoke from this Word, and for speaking the Word of the Lord as they were commanded were persecuted, imprisoned, and put in dungeons, and were made a derision dayly to all that were about them, as Jeremiah was, and was smitten and put in the stocks, Jer. 20. 2. and Daniel was cast into the Lions den for declaring the Word of the Lord, Dan. 6. 16. Amos was commanded not to prophecy any more in the Kings Chappel, Amos 7. 13. and the Apostles were imprisoned, beaten, scourged and persecuted from City to City, and straitly commanded to speak no more in that Name; and for declaring this Word of the Lord did all the Prophets, Apo∣stles, and holy men of God suffer; and the Word of the Lord
is the same now, and the Persecutors the same; and those who are sent of the Lord now, and called out of their own Country, as they were then, to declare his Word against your sin and un∣godliness which you live in, Magistrates, Priests and people, you call them wanderers and vagrant persons, who have no lawful Calling: What would you say by him who said, The Foxes have holes, and the birds of the ayre have nests, but the Son of man hath no where to lay his head, Luke 9. 58. and the Jews sayd, This fellow we know not from whence he is, Ioh. 9. 29. you may say Paul was a wandring person, who had no certain dwelling place, 1 Cor. 4. 11. and those who wandered about in Sheep skins, and Goat skins, being afflicted and tormented, of whom the world was not worthy: they had tryals of cruel mockings, scourgings and Imprison∣ments: they were stoned, hewn asunder and dispightfully used, Heb. 11. 36. 37. and you shew your selves to be in the same generation, mocking, scourging those whom ye are not worthy to receive▪ but all you dear ones, Servants of the living God, Blessed are you when men shall revile you and speak all manner of evil against you falsly for my sake, re∣joyce and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in Hea∣ven; for so persecuted they the Prophets that were before you, Mat. 5. 11. 12. you are in the same nature and genera∣tion of those who said unto Christ, depart out of our coasts, and saith Christ, As they have done unto me, so shall they do unto you: and now I witness the same things to be fulfilled: do not you say as they did, Depart out of our Citty, and teach in thy own Country, and the same generation called Paul a pestulous fellow, a mover of sedition: and the Apostles would turn the world up-side down, and the Jews said they had a Law, That if any confest that he was the Son of God he should dye: and they said, Christ was a Blasphemer; and Christ was crucified and the Apostles persecuted by them, and all under pretence of Blasphemy, Heresie and Sedition: and as it was then, so it is now, for they who come to witness Jesus Christ come in the flesh, and both sons and daughters, who come to witness the promise of the Father
fulfilled in them, as he hath said, I will pour Out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sIns and your daughters shall prophecy; and they who come to witness this fulfilled, you say they are Blas∣phemers, and not worthy to live in the Nation; and all those who will not lye and swear, and use deceit, but yea and nay, such a one cannot have trading in your Markets; for none can buy nor sell who hath not the mark of the Beast upon him; but he who loveth and telleth a lye hath the most priviledg and advantage among you: O wicked and adulterous generaton, thy wo and misery is coming upon thee, for the Lord is appear∣ing, who is come and coming to cleanse the Land of evil doers. This I was moved to declare from the Spirit of my Father dwelling in me as a testimony of his eternal Love and Power made manifest in me; and all who come to know the Power of God which is but one, do witness me; and all who despise the Power of the Lord, this is for a testimony against them from the Lord by his servant, who is a Prisoner for the Truths sake, whose earthly name is Richard Hubberthorn. Chester, the 12 day of the 12 Month, called Februa. FINIS.
