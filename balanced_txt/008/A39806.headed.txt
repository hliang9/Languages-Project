THE NIGHT-VVALKER, OR THE LITTLE THIEF. A COMEDY, As it was presented by her Majesties Servants, at the Private House in DRURY-LANE. Written by John Fletcher, Gent. LONDON, Printed for Andrew Crook, 1661.
THE NIGHT-WALKER: OR, THE LITTLE THIEF. Actus primus, Scena prima. Enter Tom Lurcher and Iack Wildbrain. Lurc. IAcke. Wild. What winde brought thee hither? In what hollow tree, or rotten wall Hast thou been like a Swallow all this Winter, Where hast thou been man? Lur. Following the Plow. Wild. What plow? Thou hast no Land, Stealing is thy own purchase. Lur. The best inheritance. Wild. Not in my opinion, Thou hadst five hundred pound a year. Lur. 'Tis gone, Prethee no more on't, have I not told thee, And oftentimes, nature made all men equal, Her distribution to each child alike; Till labour came and thst a new Will in, Which I allow not: till men won a priviledge By that they call endeavour, which indeed Is nothing but a lawful Cosenage,
An allowed way to cheat, why should my neighbour That hath no more soul than his Horse-keeper, Nor bounteous faculties above a Broom-man, Have fourty thousand pound, and I four groats; Why should he keep it? Will. Thy old opinion still. Lur. Why should that Scrivener That ne're writ reason in his life, nor any thing That time ere gloried in, that never knew How to keep any curtesie conceal'd, But Noverint universi must proclaim it, Purchase perpetually, and I a rascal: Consider this, why should that mouldy Cobler Marry his daughter to a wealthy Merchant, And give five thousand pound, is this good justice? Because he has a tougher constitution; Can feed upon old songs, and save his money, Therefore must I go beg? Wil. What's this to thee? Thou canst not mend, if thou beest determin'd To rob all like a tyrant, yet take heed A keener justice do not overtake thee, And catch you in a Nooze. Lur. I am no Wood-cock, He that shall sit down frighted with that foolery Is not worth pity, let me alone to shuffle, Thou art for wenching. Wil. For beauty I, a safe course, No halter hangs in the way, I defie it. Lur. But a worse fate, a wilful poverty, For where thou gainst by one that indeed loves thee, A thousand will draw from thee, 'tis thy destiny; One is a kind of weeping cross Iack, A gentle purgatory, do not fling at all, You'le pay the Box so often, till you perish. Wil. Take you no care for that sir, 'tis my pleasure, I will imploy my wits a great deal faster Then you shall do your singers, and my Loves, If I mistake not, shall prove riper harvest And handsomer, and come within less danger. Where's thy young sister? Lur. I Know not where she is, she is not worth caring for, She has no wit.
Oh you'd be nibling with her, She's far enough I hope, I know not where, She's not worth caring for, a fullen thing, She wo'd not take my counsel Iack, And so I parted from her. Wil. Leave her to her wants? Lur. I gave her a little money what I could spare, She had a mind to th' Countrey, she is turn'd By this some Farriers dairy maid, I may meet her Riding from market one day 'twixt her Dorsers, If I do, by this hand I wo' not spare Her butter pence. Wil. Thou wilt not rob thy sister. Lur. She shall account me for her Egges and Cheeses. Wil. A pretty Girle, did not old Algript love her? A very pretty Girle she was. Lur. Some such thing, But he was too wise to fasten; let her pass. Wil. Then where's thy Mistress? Lur. Where you sha'not find her, Nor know what stuffe she is made on, no indeed sir, I chose her not for your use. Wil. Sure she is handsome. Lur. Yes indeed is she, she is very handsome, but that's all one. Wil. You'le come toth' marriage. Lur. Is it to day. Wil. Now, now, they are come from Church now. Lur. Any great preparation, Does Justice Algripe shew his power. Wil. Very glorious, and glorious people there. Lur. I may meet with him yet e're I dye as cunning as he is. Wil. You may do good Tom at the marriage, We have plate and dainty things. Lur. Do you no harm sir; For yet me thinks the marriage should be mar'd If thou maist have thy will, farewel, say nothing. Exit. Enter Gentlemen. Wil. You are welcome noble friends. 1. I thank you sir, Wil. Nephew to the old Lady, his name is Wildbrain, And wild his best condition. 2. I have heard of him, Wil. I pray ye tell me sir, is young Maria merry After her marriage rites? does she look lively?
How does she like her man? Wil. Very scurvely, And as untowardly she prepares her self, But 'tis mine Aunts will, that this dull mettal Must be mixt with her to allay her handsomeness. 1. Had Heartlove no fast friends? Wil. His means are little, And where those littles are, as little comforts Ever keep company: I know she loves him, His memory beyond the hopes ofâ€” Beyond the Indies in his mouldy Cabinets, But 'tis her unhandsome fate. Enter Heartlove. 1. I am sorry for't, Here comes poor Frank, nay we are friends, start not Sir, We see you'r willow and are sorry for't, And though it be a wedding we are half mourners. Fr. Good Gentlemen remember not my fortunes, They are not to be help'd by words. Wil. Look up man, A proper sensible fellow and shrink for a Wench, Are there no more? or is she all the handsomeness? Fr. Prethee leave fooling. Wil. Prethee leave thou whining, Have maids forgot to love? Fr. You are injurious. Wil. Let 'em alone a while, thei'le follow thee. 1, Come good Frank. Forget now, since there is no remedy, And shew a merry face, as wise men would do. 2. Be a free guest, and think not of those passages. Wil. Think how to nick him home, thou knowest she dotes on thee; Graff me a dainty medler on his crabstocke; Pay me the dreaming puppy. Fr. Well, make your mirth, the whilst I bear my misery: Honest minds would have better thoughts. Wil. I am her kinsman, And love her well, am tender of her youth, Yet honest Frank, before I would have that stinkard, That walking rotten tombe, enjoy her maidenhead. Fr. Prethee leave mocking. Wil. Prethee Frank believe me, Go to consider, harke, they knck to dinner. Knck within. Come wo't thou go?
2. I preethee Frank go with us, And laugh and dance as we do. Fr. You are light Gentlemen, Nothing to weigh your hearts, pray give me leave, Ile come and see, and take my leave. Wil. Wee'le look for you, Do not despair, I have a trick yet. Exit. Fr. Yes, When I am mischievous I will believe your projects: She is gone, for ever gone, I cannot help it, My hopes and all my happiness gone with her. Gone like a pleasing dream: what mirth and jollity Raignes round about this house? how every office Sweats with new joyes, can she be merry too? Is all this pleasure set by her appointment? Sure she hath a false heart then; still they grow lowder, The old mans God, his gold, has won upon her (Light hearted Cordial gold) and all my services That offered naked truth, are clean forgotten: Yet if she were compel'd, but it cannot be, If I could but imagine her will mine, Enter Lady and Wildbrain. Although he had her body. La. He shall come in. Walk without doors o' this day, though an enemy, It must not be. Wil. You must compel him Madam, La. No she shall fetch him in, Nephew it shall be so. Wil. It will be fittest. Exit. Fr. Can fair Maria look agen upon me? Can there be so much impudence in sweetness? Enter Maria. Or has she got a strong heart to defie me? She comes her self: how rich she is in Jewels! Me thinks they show like frozen Isicles, Cold winter had hung on her, how the Roses That kept continual spring within her cheeks Are witheered with old mans dull imbraces? She would speak to me. I can sigh too Lady But from a sounder heart: yes, and can weep too But 'tis for you, that ever I believ'd you,
Tears of more pious value than your marriage; You would encase your self, and I must credit you, So much my old obedience compels from me; Go, and forget me, and my poverty, I need not bid you, you are too perfect that way: But still remember that I lov'd Maria, Lov'd with a loyal love, nay turn not from me, I will not ask a treare more, you are bountiful, Go and rejoyce, and I will wait upon you That little of my life left. Mar. Good sir hear me, What has been done, was the act of my obedience And not my will: forc'd from me by my parents, Now 'tis done, do as I do, bear it handsomly And if there can be more society Without dishonour to my tye of marriage Or place for noble love, I shall love you still, You had the first, the last, had my will prosper'd; You talk of little time of life: dear Franke, Certain I am not married for eternity, The joy my marriage brings tells me I am mortal. And shorter liv'd then you, else I were miserable; Nor can the gold and ease his age hath brought me Adde what I coveted, content, go with me, They seek a day of joy, prethce let's show it, Though it be forc'd, and by this kiss believe me However, I must live at his command now, Ile dye at yours. Fr. I have enough, Ile honour ye. Exeunt. Enter Lurcher. Lur. Here are my trinkets, and this lusty marriage I mean to visit, I have shift of all sorts, And here are a thousand wheeles to set'em working, I am very merry, for I know this wedding Will yield me lusty pillage, if mad VVildgoose That debosh'd rogue keep but his antient revells, And breed a hubbub in the house I am happy. Enter Boy. Now what are you? Boy. A poor distressed Boy Sir,
Friendless and comfortless, that would entreat Some charity and kindness from your worship, I would fain serve Sir, and as fain indeavour With dutious labour to deserve the love Of that good Gentleman shall entertain me. Lur. A pretty boy, but of too milde a breeding, Too tender and too bashfull a behaviour, What canst thou do? Boy I can learn any thing, That's good and honest, and shall please Master. Lur. He blushes as he speaks, and that I like not, I love a bold and secure confidence, An impudence that one may trust, this boy now Had I instructed him had been a Jewel, A treasure for my use, thou canst not lye. Boy. I would not willingly. Lur. Nor thou hast not wit To dissemble neatly. Boy. Do you love such boyes, Sir? Lur. Oh mainly, mainly, I would have my boy impudent, Out-face all truth, yet do it piously: Like Proteus, cast himself into all forms, As sudden and as nimble as his thoughts, Blanch at no danger, though it be the Gallowes, Nor make no conscience of a cosonage Though it be ith' Church; your soft, demure, still childrenâ€” Are good for nothing, but to get long gracesâ€” And sing songs to dull tunes; I would keep thee And cherish thee, hadst thou any active quality, And be a tender Master to thy knavery, But thou art not for my use. Boy. Do you speak this seriously? Lur. Yes indeed do I. Boy. Would you have your boy Sir Read in these moral mischiefs? Lur. Now thou mov'st me. Boy. And be a well train'd youth in all activities? Lur. By any means. Boy. Or do you this to try me, Fearing a proneness. Lur. I speake this to make thee. Boy. Then take me Sir, and cherish me, and love me, You have me what you would: believe me Sir I can do any thing for your advantage,
I guess at what you mean; I can can lie naturally, As easily, as I can sleep Sir, and securely: As naturally I can steal too. Lur. That I am glad on, Right heartily glad on, hold thee there, thou art excellent. Boy. Steal any thing from any body living. Lur. Not from thy Master. Bo. That's mine own body: And must not be. Lur. The Boy mends mightily. Bo. A rich man, that like snow, heaps up his moneys, I have a kind of pious zeal to meet still; A fool that not deserves 'em, I take pitty on, For fear he should run mad, and so I ease him. Lur. Excellent boy, and able to instruct me, Of my own nature just. Boy. I scorn all hazard, And on the edge of danger I do best sir, I hve a thousand faces to deceive, And to those twice so many tongues to flatter, An impudence, no brass was ever tougher, And for my conscience. Lur. Peace, I have found a Jewel, A Jewel all the Indies cannot match, And thou sha't feelâ€” Boy. This title, and I ha'done sir; I never can confess, I ha' that spell on me; And such rare modesties before a Magistrate, Such Innocence to catch a Judge, such ignorance. Lur. Ile learn of thee, thou art mine own, come Boy, Ile give thee action presently. Boy. Have at you. Lur. What must I call thee? Boy. Snap sir. Lur. 'Tis most natural, A name born to thee, sure thou art a Fairie, Shew but thy skill, and I shall make thee happie. Enter Lady, Nurse, Mistress, Newlove, Tobie. La. Where be these Knaves? who strues up all the liveries. Is the brides bed made? Tob. Yes Madam and a bell Hung under it artificially. La. Out knave out, Must we have larums now? Tob. A little warning

The dairie mayd, And she'le put that in, will make him caper: Well Madam, well, you might ha'chose another, A handsomer for your years. La. Peace, he is rich Nurse, He is rich, and that's beauty. Nur. I am sure he is rotten, Would he had been hang'd when he first saw her. Termagant! La. What an angry quean is this, where, Who looks to him? Tob. He is very merry Madam, M. Wildbrain, has him in hand, ith' bottom oth' Sellar He sighes and tipples. Nur. Alas good Gentleman, My heart's sore for thee. La. Sorrow must have his course, sirra, Give him some Sack to dry up his remembrance, How does the Bridegroom, I am afraid of him. Nur. He is a trim youth to be tender of, hemp take him. Must my sweet new blown Rose find such a winter Before her spring be near. La. Peace, peace, thou art foolish. Nur. And dances like a Town-top: and reels, and hobbles. La. Alas, good Gentleman, give him not much wine, Tob. He shall ha' none by my consent. La. Are the women comforting my daughter? New. Yes, yes, Madam, And reading to her a pattern of true patience, They read and pray for her too. Nur. They had need, Ye had better marry her to her grave a great deal: There will be peace and rest, alas poor Gentlewoman, Must she become a Nurse now in her tenderness? Well Madam, well my heart bleeds.
La. Thou art a fool still. Nur. Pray heaven I be. La. And an old fool to be vext thus. Tis late she must to bed, go knave be merry, Drinke for a boy, away to all your charges. Exit. Enter Wildbrain, and Franke Heartlove. Wil. Do as thou wo't, but if thou dost refuse it Thou art the stupid'st asse, there's no long arguing, Time is too precious Franke. Fr. I am hot with wine, And apt now to believe, but if thou dost this. Out of a villany, to make me wrong her, As thou art prone enough. Wil. Does she not love thee? Did she not cry down-right e'en now to part with thee? Had she not swounded if I had not caught her? Canst thou have more? Fr. I must confess all this. Wil. Do not stand prating, and misdoubting, casting, If she go from thee now, she's lost for ever; Now now she's going, she that loves thee going, She whom thou lov'st. Fr. Pray let me think a little: Wil. There is no leisure; think when thou hast imbrace'd her. Can she imagine thou didst ever honour her? Ever believe thy oathes, that tamely suffer'st An old dry ham of horse-flesh to enjoy her? Enjoy her Maiden head; take but that from her That we may tell posterity a man had it, A handsome man, a gentleman, a young man, To save the honour of our house, the credit, Tis no great matter I desire. Fr. I hear you. Wil. Free us both from the fear of breeding fools And ophs, got by this shadow: we talke too long. Fr. She is going to bed, among the women, What opportunity can I have to meet her? Wil. Let me alone, hast thou a will? speak soundly, Speak discreetly, speak home and handsomely, Ist not pitty, nay misery, nay insamy to leave So rare a pie to be cut up by a raskall. Fr. I will go presently, now, now, I stay thee.
Wil. Such a dainty Doe, to be taken By one that knows not necke-beefe from a Phesant, Nor cannot rellish Braggat from Ambrosia. Is it not conscience? Fr. Yes, yes, now I feel it. Wil. A meritorious thing. Fr. Good Father Wildgoose, I do confess it. Wil. Come then follow me. And pluck a mans heart up, Ile locke thee privately, Where she alone shall presently pass by, None near to interupt thee but be sure; Fr. I shall be sure enough, lead on, and crown me. Wil. No wringings in your mind now as you love me. Ex. Enter Lady, Maria, Iustice, Gent. Nurse, Newlove. La. Tis time you were a bed. Iu. I prethee sweet-heart Consider my necessity, why art sad?

Enter Frank Hartlove. Fra. She stayes long, sure young Wildgoose has abus'd me, He has made sport wi'me, I may yet get out again, And I may see his face once more, I ha foul intentions, But they are drawn on by a fouler dealing. Enter Maria. Hark, hark, it was the door, Something comes this way, wondrous still, and stealing May be some walking spirit to affright me. Ma. Oh heaven my fortune. Fr. 'Tis her voice, stay. Ma.

Actus Secundus. Enter Tom Lurch. and his Boy. Lur. What hast thou done? Boy. I have walked through all the lodgings. A silence as if death dwelt there inhabits. Lur. What hast thou seen? Boy. Nought but a sad confusion Every thing left in such a loose disorder That were there twenty theeves, they would be laden. Lu. 'Tis very Well, I like thy care, but 'tis strange
A wedding night should be so solitary Boy. Certainly there is some cause, some death or sickness Is falne suddenly upon some friend, Or some strange news is come. Lu. Are they all a bed? Boy. I think so, and sound a sleep, unless it be Some women that keep watch in a low parlour, And drink, and weep, I know not to what end. Lur. Where's all the plate? Boy. Why lockt up in that room. I saw the old Lady, re she went to bed Put up her plate, and some of the rich hangings In a smal long chest, her chains and rings are there too, It stands close by the Table on a form. Lur. 'Twas a good notice, didst thou see the men. Boy. I saw them sad too, and all take their leaves, But what they said I was too far to her sir. Lur. 'Tis daintily discover'd, we shall certainly Have a most prosperous night, which way. Boy. A close one, A back door, that the women have left open, To go in and out to fetch necessaries, Close on the Garden side. Lur. I love diligence, Wert thou not fearful. Boy. Fearful? Ile be hang'd first. Lur. Say they had spied thee. Boy. I was then determin'd To have cry'd down right too, and have kept 'em company, As one that had an interest in their sadness, Or made an errand to I know not whom sir. Lur. My dainty Boy, let us discharge, that plate Makes a perpetual motion in my fingers, Till I have fast hold of it. Boy. Pray be wise sir, doe't handsomly, be not greedy, Lets handle it with such an excellence As if we would bring theeving into honour: We must disguise, to fright these reverend watches.
Lur. Still my blest Boy. Boy. And clear the Room of drunken jealousies, The chest is of some weight, and we may make Such noise ith' the carriage we may be snap'd. Lur. Come open, here's a Devils face. Boy. No, no, sir, weele have no shape so terrible, We will not do the Devil so much pleasure, To have him face our plot. Lur. A winding shet then. Boy. Thats too cold a shift, I would not wear the reward of my wickedness, I wonder you are an old thief, and no cunninger, Where's the long Cloak? Lur. Here, here. Boy. Give me the Turbant And the false beard, I hear some coming this way, Stoop, stoop, and let me sit upon your shoulders, And now as I direct: stay let'em enter, And when I touch move forward, make no noise. Enter Nurse and Tobie. Nur. Oh 'its a sad time, all the burnt wine is burnt Nick. Tob. We may thank your dry chaps for't, the Canaries gone too No substance for a sorrowful mind to work upon, I cannot mourn in beer, if she should walk now As discontented spirits are wont to do. Nur. And meet us in the Cellar. Tob. What fence have we with single beer against her? VVhat heart can we defie the Devil with? Nur. The March beer's open. Tob. A fortification of March beer will do well, I must cofess 'tis a most mighty Armour, For I presume I cannot pray. Nur. VVhy Nicholas? Tob. VVe Coachmen have such tumbling faiths, no pray'rs Can go an even pace. Nur. Hold up your candle. Tob. Verly Nurse, I have cry'd so much For my young Mstress, that is mortified,
That if I have not more sack to support me; I shall even sleep, heiho, for another flagon; These Burials and Christnings are the mournful matters, And they ask more drink. Nur. Drink to a sad heart's needful. To. Mine's ever sad, for I am ever dry Nurse. Nur. Me thinks the light burns blew, I prethee snuffe it, There's a thief in't I think. To. There may be one near it. Nur. Whats that that moves there, ith' name ofâ€”Nicholas? That thing that walks. To. Would I had a ladder to behold it, Mercy upon me, the Ghost of one oth' Guard sure, 'Tis the devil by his clawes, he smalls of Brimstone, Sure he farts fire, what an Earth-quake I have in me; Out with thy Prayer-book Nurse. Nur. It self ith' the frying-pan, and the Cat's eat it. Tob. I have no power to pray, it grows still longer, 'Tis Steeple high now, and it sails away Nurse. Lets call the Butler up, for he speaks Latine, And that will daunt the devil: I am blasted, My belly's grown to nothing. Nu. Fye, fye, Tobi. Exit. Bo. So let them go, and whilst they are astonish'd. Let us presently upon the rest now suddenly. Lur. Off, off, and up agen, when we are near the Parlour, Art sure thou knowst the Chest? Boy. Though it were ith' dark sir, I can go to't. Lur. On then and be happy. Exit. Enter Tobie. Tob. How my haunches quake, is the thing here still? Now can I out-do any Button-maker, at his own trade, I have fifteen fits of an Ague, Nurse, 'tis gone I hope, The hard-hearted woman has left me alone. Nurseâ€” And she knows too I ha but a lean conscience to keep me comâˆ£pany. Noise within. The devil's among 'em in the Parlour sure,
The Ghost three stories high, he has the Nurse sure, He is boyling of her bones now, hark how she whistles: There's Gentlewomen within too, how will they do? Ile to the Cook, for he was drunk last night, And now he is valiant, he is a kin to th' devil too, And fears no fire, Enter Lurcher and Boy. Lur. No light? Boy. None left sir, They are gone, and carried all the candles with 'em, Their fright is infinite, let's make good use on't, We must be quick sir, quick, or the house will rise else. Lu. VVas this the Chest? Boy. Yes, yes. Lur. There was two of 'em. Or I mistake. Boy. I know the right, no stay sir, Nor no discourse, but to our labour lustily, Put to your strength and make as little noise, Then presently out at the back door. Lur. Come Boy. Come happy child and let me hug thy excellence. Exit. Enter Wildbrain. Wil. VVhat thousand noises pass through all the rooms? VVhat cryes and hurries? sure the devil's drunk. And tumbles through the house, my villanies That never made me apprehend before Danger or fear, a little now molest me; My Cosens death sits heavy o'my conscience, VVould I had been half hang'd when I hammer'd it. I aim'd at a living divorce, not a burial That Frank might have had some hope: hark still In every room confusion, they are all mad, Most certain all stark mad within the house, A punishment inflicted for my lewdness, That I might have the more sense of my mischief, And run the more mad too, my Aunt is hang'd sure, Sure hang'd her self, or else the fiend has fetc'd her;
I heard a hundred cryes, the Devil, the Devil, Then roaring and then tumbling, all the chambers Are a meer Babel, or another Bedlam. VVhat should I think? I shake my self too: Can the Devil find no time, but when we are merry, Here's something comes. Enter Newlove. New. Oh that I had some company, I care not what they were, to ease my misery, To comfort me, Wil. VVhose that? New. Again? noy then receiveâ€” Wil. Hold, hold I am no fury. The Merchants wife, New. Are ye a man? pray heaven you be. Wil. I am. New. Alas I have met sir The strangest things to night. Wil. VVhy do you stare. New. Pray comfort me, and put your candle out, For if I see the spirit again I dye for't. And hold me fast, for I shall shake to pieces else. Wil. Ile warrant you, Ile hold ye, Hold ye as tenderly; I have put the light out, Retire into my Chamber, there Ile watch we'ye, Ile keep you from all frights. New. And will ye keep me. Wil. Keep you as secure Lady. New. You must not wrong me then, the devil will have us. Wil. No, no, Ile love you, then the devil will fear us. For he fears all that love, pray come in quickly, For this is the malicious house he walks in, The hour he blasts sweet faces, lames the limbs in, Depraves the senses, now within this half hour He will have power to turn all Citizens wives Into strange creatures, Owles, and long-taild Monkeys, Jayes, Pies, and Parrots, quickly, I smell his brimstone. New. It comes agen I am gone shift for your self sir. Exit. VVil. Sure this whole night is nothing but llusion,
Here's nothing comes, all they are mad, damd devil To drive her back agen, 't had been thy policy To have let us alone, we might have done some fine thing To have made thy hel-hood laugh, tis a dainty wench, If I had her again, not all your fellow goblins Nor all their clawes should scratch her hence, Ile stay still, May be her fright will bring her back a gen, Yet I will hope. Enter Toby. Tob. I can find no bed, no body, nor no chamber, Sure they are all ith' Cellar, and I cannot find that neither, I am led up and down like a tame ass, my light's out And I grope up and down like lind-man buffe, And break my face, and break y pae. VVil. It comes again sure I see the shadow, Ile have faster hold now, Sure she is mad, I long to lye with a mad-woman, She must needs have rare new tricks. Tob. I hear one whisper If it be the devil now to allure me into his clutches, For devils have a kind of tone like crickets, I have a glimpse of her guise, 'tis she would steal me, But Ile stand sure. Tob. I have but a dram of wit left, And that's even ready to run, oh for my bed now. VVil. She nam'd a bed, I like that, she repents sure, Where is she now? Tob. Who's that? VVil. Are you there, In, In, In presently. Tob. I feel his talents through me, 'Tis an old haggard devil, what will he do with me? VVil. Let me kiss thee first, quick, quick. Tob. A leacherous Devil. VVil. What a hairy whore 'tis, sure she has a muffler. Tob. If I should have a young Satan by him, tor I dare not deâˆ£ny him, In what case were I? who durst deliver me? VVil. 'Tis but my fancy, she is the same, in quickly, gently my

Money and wealth got thus are as full venture, And carry in their nature as much merit As his, that digs 'em out 'oth mine, they last too Season'd with doubts and dangers most delitiously, Riches that fall upon us are too ripe, And dull our appetites.

But where o'th sudden, or with what providence, That no eyes watch us. Mi. Take a Spade and follow me, The next fair ground we meet, make the Church-yard; As I live, Ile see her lodg'd. Exit. Lu. It must be so, How heavy my heart is, I ha no life left. Boy. I am past thinking too, no understanding, That I should misse the right Chest. Lu. The happy Chest. Boy. That, which I saw and markt too. Lu. Well passion wo'not help us, Had I twenty fals for this? Boy, Twas my fault sir. And twenty thousand fears for this, oth'devil, Now could I curse, well, we have her now, And must dispose her. Enter Mistresse. Mi. Hang both for two blind buzzards, here's a Spade Quickly or Ile call the neighbours. There's no remedy, Would the poor hungy prisoners had this pastie. Exeunt. Enter Iustice, and a Servant with a light. Ser. Twas a strange mischance sir. Iu. Mischance, saist? No twas happinesse to me, There's so much charge sav'd, I have her portion, Ile marry twenty more on such conditions. Ser. Did it not trouble you sir, To see her dead?
Iu. Not much, I thank my conscience; I was tormented till that happen'd, furies Were in my brain to think my self a Cuckold At that time of the night: When I come home, I charge you shut my doors, Locks, bolts, and barres, are little enough to secure me. Ser. Why, and please you? Iu. Fool to ask that question; To keep out women, I expect her mother Will visit me with her clamors, oh I hate Their noise, and do abhorre the whole sex heartily; They are all walking Devils, Harpyes, I will study A week together how to raile sufficiently, Upon e'm all, and that I may be furnish'd, Thou shalt buy all the railing Books and Ballads, That Malice hath invented against women, I will read nothing else, and practise 'em, Till I grow fat with curses. Ser. If youle go To th'charge, let me alone to find you Books. Iu. They come neer us. Ser. Whats that? Iu. Where? hold up the Torch Knave. Ser. Did you hear nothing, 'tis aâ€” Iu. Why dost make a stand? Ser. Whats that? Iu. Where, where, dost see any thing? We are hard by the Church-yard, and I was never Valiant at midnight in sch iksome places; They say Ghosts walk sometimes, hark, de'e hear nothing? Enter Lurcher, Boy and Mistresse. Mi. No further, dig here, and lay her in quickly. Lur. VVhat light is that Boy, we shall be discover'd; Set the Coffin up an end, and get behind me, There's no avoiding. Boy. Oh! Iu. VVhere's that groan? I begin to be afraid. Ser. VVhat shall we do sir? Iu. VVe are almost at home now, thou must go forward; Perhaps 'twas my imagination. Lur. Tis he? Boy. I know him too, let me alone. Ser. Oh sir, a Ghost, the very Ghost of Mistresse Bide,
I have no power to runne away. Iu. Cursed Ghost, blesse me, preserve me, I doe command thee what so ere thou art, I doe conjure thee leave me; doe not fright me; If thou beest a divell vexe me not so soone, If thou beest The spirit of my wife. Boy Thy wife. Iu. I shall be tormented. Boy. Thy abus'd wife, that cannot peaceably Enjoy her death, thou hast an evill conscience. Ju. Ikow it Boy. Among thy other sinnes which blacke thy soule, Call to thy minde thy vow made to another, Whom thou hast wrong'd, and make her satisfaction Now I am dead, thou perjur'd man, or else A thousand black tormentors shall pursue thee, Vntill thou leape into eternall flames; Where gold which thou adorest here on earth Melted, the Fiends shall powre into thy throate; For this time passe; goe home and thinke upon me. Lur. Away. Ser. There are more spirits. Iu. Thanke you deare wife, Ile bestow twentie nobles of a Tombe for thee, Thou shalt not walke and catch cold after death. They goe Backward in. Lu. So, so, they'r gone, twas my ingenious rascal: But how dost know he made vowes to another? Boy. I over-heard the women talke to night on't; But now lets lose no time sir, pray lets bury This Gen lewoman, where's my Mistresse? Enter Mistresse. Mi. Here I durst not tarry. Lu. we ha so cosen'd the old forty i'h hundred, And the devill hinder him not, hee'le goe a pilgrimage; But come, about our businesse, set her downe agen. Mar. Oh! Lur. Shee groanes, ha. Mar Oh! Lur. Agen, she stirres. Mi. Lets fly, or else we shall be torne in peeces. Lur. And you be good at that, bury your selfe, Or let the Sexton take ye for his fee,
Away boy. Exit. Mar. I am very cold, dead cold; Where am I? What's this? a Coffin? where have I been? Mercy defend me: Ha, I doe remember I was betrai'd, and swounded; my heart akes, I am wondrous hungry too, dead bodies eate not; Sure I was meant for buriall, I am frozen; Death, 'like a cake of Ice dwells round about me, Darknesse spreads o're the world too, where? what path? Best providence direct me. Exit. Actus Tertius. Enter Lady, Wildbraine, Women, Toby, La. THou art the most unfortunate fellow; Wil. Why Aunt what have I done? La. The most malicious varlet, Thy wicked head never at rest, but hammering, And haching hllish things, and to no purpose, So thou maist have thy base will. Wi. Why doe you raile thus? Cannot a scurvy accident fall out, But I must be at one end on't? La. Thou art at both ends. Wi. Cannot young sullen wenches play the fools, And marry, and die, but I must be the agent? All that I did (and if that be an injury, Let the world judge it) was but to perswade her, (And as I take it) I was bound to it too, To make the reverend coxecombe her husband Cuckold: What else could I advise her, was there harme i' this? You are of yeares, and have runne through experience, Would you be content if you were young agen, To have a continuall cough grow to your pillow, A rottennesse, that vaults are perfumes to Hang in youre roofe, and like a fogge infect you; Anointed hammes to keepe his hinges turning
Reck ever in your nose, and twenty night caps, With twenty several sweats. To. Some Jew, some Justice, A thousand heathen smels to say truth Madam, And would you mellow my young pretty Mistresse In such a mis-ken? La. Sirra, Where's the body of my Girle? Wi. I know not, I am no Conjurer, you may look the body, I was like to be stoln away my self, the Spirit Had like to ha surpris'd me in the shape of a woman, Of a young woman, and you know those are dangerous. To. So had I Madam, simply though I stand here, I had been ravish'd too: I had twenty Spirits In every corner of the house a Fiend met me. La. You lie like raskals, Was Mistresse Newlove such a Spirit sir To fright your worship; Well, I discharge you sir, ye'are now at libertie, Live where you please, and do what pranks you fancy, You know your substance, though you are my Nephew, I am no way bound sir to protect your mischief; So fare you well. Wi. Farewell good Aunt, I thank you, Adiw honest Nick, the devil if he have power, Will persecute your old bones, for this marriage, Farewel Mistresse Win. To. And shall we part with dry lips; Shall we that have been fellow devils together Flench for an old womans fart? Wi. Tis a fine time a night too, but we must part Nick. To. Shall we never ring again? ne're tosse the tenor, And roul the changes in a Cup of Claret? You shall not want what ere I lay my hands on, As I am sure Automedon the Coachman, Shall be distributed; bear up, I say, hang sorrow, Give me that bird abroad that lives at pleasure, Sam the Butles true, the Cook a reverend Trojan,
The Faulkner shall sell his Hawkes, and swear they were rotten, There be some wandring spoons, that may be met with, Ile pawn a Coach horse, peace, utter no sentences. The harnesse shall be us'd in our warres also; Or shall I drive her) tell me but your will now, Say but the word) over some rotten bridg, Or by a Marle pit side, she may slip in daintily, Let me alone for my self. Wi. No, no, farewel Toby, Farewel spinie Nicholas, no such thing, There be wayes i'the world, if you see me A day or two hence, may be weel'le crack a quart yet, And pull a bell, commend to the houshold; Nay, cry not Toby 'twill make thy head giddy. To. Sweet Master Wildbrain. Wi. No more Toby, go, the times may alterâ€” But where's the coarse of my dead cosen, (If she be dead) I hop'd 'thad but dissembled That sits heavy here: Toby, honest Toby, Lend me thy Lanthorn, I forgot 'twas dark, I had need look to my wayes now. To. Take a lodging with me to night in the Stable, And ride away to morrow with one of the horses Next your heart, pray do. Wi. No, good night good neighbour Toby, I will wander, I scorn to submit my self, ere I have rambled, But whether, or with what, that's more material; No matter, and the worst come it is but stealing, And my Aunt won'ot see me hang'd for her own credit, And farewel in a halter costs me nothing. Exit. Enter Hartlove. Fran. The night, and all the evils the night covers, The Goblins, Hagges, and the black spawne of darknesse, Cannot fright me, no death, I dare thy cruelty. For I am weary both of life and light too; Keep my wits heaven, they say spirits appear To melancholly minds, and the graves open, I would fain see the fair Maria's shadow, But speak unto her spirit ere I dyed,
But ask upon my knees a mercy from her; I was a villain, but her wretched Kinsman, That set his plot, shall with his heart blood satisfie Her injur'd life and honor, what lights this? Enter Wildbrain with a Lanthorn. Wil. It is but melancholy walking thus; The Tavern doors are baracado'd too, Where I might drink till morn in expectation; I cannot meet the Watch neither; nothing in The likenesse of Constable, whom I might In my distresse abuse, and so be carried, For want of other lodging, to the Counter. Fra. Tis his voyce, Fate, I thanke thee. Wi. Ha, who's that, and thou beest a man speak? Franke Heartlove, then I bear my destinies, Thou art the man of all the world I wish'd for; My Aunt has turn'd me out a doores, she has, At this unchristian houre, and I doe walke, Me thinks, like Guido Faux with my darke Lanthorn, Stealing to set the towne a fire; ith' country I should be tane for William o' the Wispe, Or Robin Good fellow, and how dost Frank? Ha. The worse for you. Wi. Come, thar' a foole, art going to thy lodging? Ile lie with thee to night, and tell thee stories, How many devills we ha met withal; Our house is haunted Franke, whole legions, I saw fiftie for my share. Fr. Didst not fright e'm? Wi. How, fright e'm? no they frighted me fufficiently. Fr. Thou hadst wickednesse enough to make them stare, And be afraid o'thee, malicious devil; And draw thy sword, for by Marias soule; I will not let thee scape to do more mischiefe. Wi. Thou art mad, what dost meane? Fr. To kill thee, nothing else will ease my anger, The injury is fresh, I bleede with all, Nor can that word expresse it, there's no peace in't, Nor must it be forgiven but in death;
Therefore call up thy valour if thou'st any, And summon up thy spirits to defend thee; Thy heart must suffer for thy damn'd practises, Against thy noble cosen, and my innocence. Wi. Hold, heare a word; did I doe any thing But for your good, that you might have her, That in that desperate time I might redeeme her, Although with shew of losse. Fr. Out ugly villaine, Fling on her the most hated name of Whore To the worlds eye, and face it out in courtesie, Bring him to see't and make me drunke to attempt it. Enter Maria. Ma. I heare some voyces this way. Fr. No more, if you can pray, doe it as you fight. Ma. What new frights oppose me? I have heard that tongue. Wi. Tis my fortune, You could not take me in a better time sir, I ha nothing to lose, but the love I lent thee, My life my sword protect. Ma. I know'em both, but to prevent their ruines, Must not discoverâ€”stay men most desperate; The mischiefe you are forward to commit Will keepe me from my grave, and tie my spirit To endlesse troubles else. Wi. Ha, tis her Ghost. Fr. Maria. Ma. Heare me both, each wound you make Runnes through my soule, and is a new death to me, Each threatning danger will affright my rest; Looke on me Hartlove, and my kinsman view me; Was I not late in my unhappy marriage, Sufficient miserable? full of all misfortunes? But you must adde with your most impious angers Unto my sleeping dust this insolence? Would you teach time to speake eternally Of my disgraces; make Records to eep'em, Keep them in brass? fight then, and kill my honor; Fight deadly both, and let your bloody swords, Through my reviv'd, and reeking infamy (That never shall be purg'd) finde your owne ruines:
Hartlove, I lov'd thee once, and hop'd again In a more blessed love to meet thy spirit, If thou kil'st him, thou art a murtherer, And murther shall never inherit heaven: My time is come, my concealed grave expects me, Farewel, and follow not, your feet are bloody, And will pollute my peace: I hope they are melted, This is my way sure. Exit. Fr. Stay blessed soul. Wi. VVould she had come sooner, and ha sav'd some blood. Fr. Dost bleed? Wi. Yes certainly, I can both see and feel it. Fr. Now I well hope it is not dangerous; Give me thy hand, as honor guides me, Ile know thee again. Exit. Wi. I thank thee heartily; I know not where to get a Surgeon; This vision troubles me, sure she is living, And I was foolish blind, I could not find it; I bleed apace still, and my heart grows heavy, If I go far I faint, Ile knock at this house, They may be charitable, would t'were perfect day. Enter Mistresse. Mi. Tis not he? What would you sir? Wi. I would crave a little rest Lady, And for my hurts some Surgerie, I am a Gentleman That Fortune of a fightâ€” Mi. A handsome Gentleman, Alas he bleeds, a very handsome Gentleman, Wil. A sweet young wench, beshrow my heart a fair one; Fortune has made me some recompence, Mi. Pray come in; the air is hurtful for you Pray let me lead you, Ile have a bed for you presently, Ile be your Surgeon too, alas sweet Gentleman. Wi. I feel no hurts, the morning comes too fast now. Mi. Sostly I beseech you. Exit. Enter Lady and Toby. To. He is not up yet Madam, what mean't you To come forth so early? La. You block head; Yor eyes are sow'd up still, they cannot see When it is day: oh my poor Maria;

Some new fortifications, look to my doors, Put double barres, I will not have her enter, Nor any of her Tribe, they come to terrefie me: Keep out her tongue too if you can. La. I hear you,
And I will send my tongue up to your worship, The Eccho of it shall flye o're the streete; My Daughter, that thou killedst with kindnesse (Jew) That thou betrayedst to death, thou double Jew, And after stol'st her body. To. Iew's too good for him. Iu. I defie you both; Thy daughter plaid the villaine and betray'd me: Betray'd my honor. La. Honor, Rascal, And let that bear an action, Ile try it with thee, Honor? To.

Ile buy his Works for't, And consute Horace with a Water Poet: What hast there a ballad too?

I works already. Iu. Is there never a chair, I was wearier than I thought,
But who shall we have to take 'em Mr. Constable? Lur. Let me alone, when I but give the watch-word We will have men enough to surprise an Army. Ju. I begin to be sleepy; what, hast a chair? Enter another with a chair. Lur. They do not dream of us, 'tis early rising; Care, care, and early rising, common-wealths men Are ever subjects to the nods; sitdown sir, A short nap is not much amiss; so, so, he's fast; Fast as a fish ith' net, he has winking powder Shall work upon him to our wish, remove him, Nay, we may cut him into collops now And he n're feel; have you prepar'd the vault sirra?

I come sir from a Gentleman, and neighbour hard by, One that loves your musick well. To. He may have more on't, Handle a bell, as you were haling timber; Gross, gross, and base, absurd, Rin.

His whole case sir; I felt it out, and by the guards This should be the Coachmans, another suite too. Lur. Away Boy, quickly now to the Usurer, His hour to wake approaches. Boy.

A cuffe? give me the candle, Cuffes wo'not cover meâ€”I smell the knavery. To. Ist come to a cuffe? my whole suit turned to a button? Wi. Now am I as cold again as though 'twere Christmas; Cold with my fear, Ile never ring by the ear more. To. My new cloaths vanish'd? Wi. My all cloaths Toby. Rin. Here's none. To. Not one of my dragons wings left to adorn me, Have I muted all my feathers?
Wi. Cheated by the ear; a plot to put out the candle; I could be mad; my chain, my rings, the gold, the gold. To. The cold, the cold I cry, and I cry truly, Not one sleeve, nor a cape of a cloak to warm me. Wi. What miserable fools were we? To. We had e'en best, gentlemen, Every man chuse his rope again, and fasten it, And take a short turn to a better fortune To be bawds to our miseries, and put our own lights out? Wi. Prethee Sexton lets have a fire at thy house, A good fire, weele pay thee some way for't, I am stone cold. Sex. Alas I pitty you, come quickly Gentlemen. Wi. Sure I ha been in a dream, I had no Mistress, Nor gold, nor cloaths, but am a ringing rascal. To. Fellows in affliction, let's take hands all, Now are we fit for tumblers. Enter Lurcher and others, bringing in Algripe. Lur. So, so, presently his sleep will leave him. And wonder seize upon him, Bid 'em within be ready. Ju. What sound's this? What horrid dinne? what dismal place is this? I never saw before, and now behold it; But by the half light of a lamp, that burns here: My spirits shake, tremble through my body; Help, help, Enter two Furies with black tapers. Mercy, protect me, my soul quakes, What dreadful apparitions! how I shudder! 1. 2. Fu. Algripe. Ju. What are you? 1. We are helhounds, helhounds, that have commission From the Prince of darkness, To fetch thy black soul to him. Ju. Am I not alive still? 1. Thou art, but we have brought thee instruments Will quickly rid thy miserable life, Stabbe, 2. Poyson. 1. Hang thy self, this choise is offer'd, 2. Thou canst not hope for heaven; thy base soul is Lost to all hope of mercy. 2. Quickly, quickly, The torments cool. 1. And all the Fiends expect thee.
Come with us to that pit of endless horrour, Or we will force thee. Ju. Oh, oh, oh. 1. Groans are too late, sooner the ravisher, Whose soul is hurl'd into eternal frost, Stung with the force of twenty thousand Winters, To punish the distempers of his blood, Shall hope to get from thence, then thou avoid The certainty of meeting hell where he is. Shall murderers be there for ever dying, Their souls shot through with adders, torn on Engines, Dying as many deaths for killing one, Could any imagination number them, As there be moments in eternity: And shall that Justice spare thee, that hast slain, Murdered by thy extortion so many? Ju. Oh, oh. 2. Do execution quickly, or we'le carry thee alive to hell. Ju. Gently, gentle devils, do not force me To kill my self, nor do not you do't for me; O let me live, Ile make amends for all. 1. Tell us of thy repentance? perjur'd villain, Pinch off his flesh, he must be whipt, salted and whipt. Ju. Oh misery of miseries! Recorders 1. 2. Tear his accursed limbs, to hell with him, ha. A mischief on that innocent face, away. Creeps in Enter Boy like an Angel. Boy. Malicious furies hence, choak not the seeds Of holy penitence. Ju. This must be an Angel, How at his presence the fiends crawle away? Here is some light of mercy. Boy. Be thou wise, And entertain it, wretched, wretched man; What poor defence hath all thy wealth been to thee? What sayes thy conscience now? Iu. Be my good Angel, here I promise thee, To become honest, and renounce all villany; Enjoyn me any pennance, Ile build Churches;
A whole City of Hospitals. Boy. Take heed, There is no dallying, nor are these impos'd. Iu. Name any thing within my power, sweet Angel; And if I do not faithfully perform it, Then whip me every day, burn me each minute, Whole years together let me freeze to Isicles. Boy. Ith' number of thy foul oppressions; Thou hast undone a faithful Gentleman, By taking forfeit of his land. Iu. Young Lurcher, I do confess. Boy. He lives most miserable, And in despair may hang or drown himself; Prevent his ruine, or his blood will be More sin in thy account: hast thou forgotten He had a sister? Iu. I do well remember it. Boy. Couldst thou for Mammon break thy solemn vow, Made once to that unhappy maid, that weeps A thousands tears a day for thy unkindness, Was not thy faith contracted, and thy heart? And couldst thou marry another? Iu. But she is dead, And I will make true satisfaction. Boy. What do instance these, that hast been false To all the world. Iu. I know it, and will henceforth Practise repentance, do not srown sweet Angel; I will restore all morgages, forswear Abominable Usury, live chaste; For I have been wanton in my shroud, my age; And if that poor innocent maid, I so abus'd, Be living, I will marry her, and spend My dayes to come religiously. Boy. I was commanded but a Messenger To tell thee this, and rescue thee from those, Whose malice would have drag'd thee quick to hell, If thou abuse this mercy and repent nor,
Double damnation will expect thee for it; But if thy life be vertuous hereafter, A blessedness shall reward thy good example, Thy fright hath much distracted thy weak senses, Dink of this viol, and renew thy spirits, I ha done my office, think on't and be happy. Lur. So, so, he gapes already, now he's fast; Thou hast acted rarely; but this is not all; First, help to convey him out o'th vault. Boy. You will dispense with me now, as you promis'd sir, Lur. We will make shift without thee, tha'st done well, By our device this bondage may scape hell. Exit. Enter Lady, Nurse, Maria. La. Didst think Maria, this poor outside, and Dissembling of thy voice could hide thee from A mothers searching eye, though too much fear, Lest thou wert not the same, might blind a lover That thought thee dead too; oh my dear Maria, I hardly Kept my joyes in from betraying thee: VVelcome again to life, we shall find out The mystery of thy absence; conceale Thy person still, for Algripe must not know thee: And exercise this pretty dialect; If there be any course in Law to free thee, Thou shalt not be so miserable; be silent Good Nurse. Nur. You shall not need to fear me Madam, I do not love the usuring Jew so well; Beside, 'twas my trick to disguise her so. La. Be not dejected Mall. Ma. Your care may comfort me; But I despair of happiness: Hartlove, I dare not see him. Nur. VVeele withdraw. La. I shall but grieve to see his passions too, Since there's no possibility to relieve him. Enter Hartlove. Ha. The world's a Labyrinth, where unguided men
Walk up and down to find their weariness; No sooner have we measured with much toil One crooked path, with hope to gain our freedom, But it betrays us to a new affliction; What a strange mockery will man become Shortly to all the creatures? Oh Mariah! If thou beest dead, why does thy shadow fright me? Sure 'tis because I live; were I but certain To meet thee in one grave, and that our dust Might have the priuiledge to mix in silence, How quickly should my soul shake off this burthen! Enter Boy. Thus far my wishes have success, Ile lose No time: Sir, are not you call'd Mr. Hartlove? Pardon my rudeness. Ha. What does that concern Thee Boy, 'tis a name cannot advantage thee, And I am weary on't. Boy. Had you conceal'd, Or I forgot it sir, so large were my Directions, that you could not speak this language, But I should know you by your sorrow. Ha. Thou Wert well inform'd, it seems; well, what's your businese? Boy. I come to bring you comfort. Ha. Is Maria Alive agen? that's somewhat, and yet not Enough to make my expectation rise, to Past half a blessing, since we cannot meet To make it up a full one; th'art misaken. Boy. VVhen you have heard me, you'le think otherwise: In vain I should report Maria living: The comfort that I bring you must depend Upon her death. Ha. T'art a dissembling boy, Some one has sent thee to mk me, though my anger Stoop  to punish thy green years, unripe For malice did I know what person sent thee To tempt my sorrow thus, I should revenge it.
Boy. Indeed I have no thought so uncharitable, Nor am I sent to grieve you, let me suffer More punishment than ever boy deserv'd, If you do find me false; I serve a Mistress VVould rather dye than play with your misfortunes; Then good sir hear me out. Ha. VVho is your Mistress? Boy. Before I name her, give me some incouragement, That you receive her message, she is one That is full acquainted with your misery, And can bring such a portion of her sorrow In every circumstance so like your own, You'le love and pity her, and wish your griefs Might marry one anothers. Ha. Thou art wild? Canst thou bring comfort from so sad a creature? Her miserable story can at best, But swell my Volume, large enough already. Boy. She was late belov'd, as you were, promis'd faith, And marriage, and was worthy of a better Than he, that stole Maria's heart. Ha. How's that? Boy. Just as Maria dealt with your affection, Did he that married her, deal with my Mistress, VVhen careless both of honour and Religion; They cruelly gave away their hearts to strangers, Ha. Part of this truth I Know, but prethee boy Proceed to that thou cam'st for; thou didst promise Something, thy language cannot hitherto Encourage me to hope for. Boy. That I come to: My mistress thus unkindly dealt with all, You may imagine, wanted no affliction; And had ere this, Wept her self drye as marble, Had not your fortune come to her relief, And twinne to her own sorrow brought her comfort. Ha. Could the condition of my fate so equal, Lessen her sufferings?
Boy. I know not how Companions in grief sometimes diminish And make the pressure easie, by degrees: She threw her troubles off, remembring yours, And from her pity of your wrongs, there grew Affection to your person thus increas'd, And with it, confidence, that those whom Nature Had made so even in their weight of sorrow, Could not but love as equally one another, Were things but well prepar'd, this gave her boldness To employ me thus far. Ha. A strange message boy. Boy. If you incline to meet my Mistress love, It may beget your comforts; besides that, 'Tis some revenge, that you above their scorn And pride, can laugh at them, whose perjury Hath made you happy, and undone themselves. Ha. Have you done boy. Boy. Onely this little more: When you but see, and know my Mistress well, You will forgive my tediousness, she's fair, Fair as Maria was. Ha. Ile hear no more, Go foolish Boy, and tell thy fonder Mistress She has no scond Faith to give away; And mine, was given to Maria, though her death Allow me freedom, see the Picture of her. Enter Maria, Nurse. I would give ten thousand Empires for the substance; Yet for Maria's sake, whose divine Figure That rude frame carries, I will love this counterfeit Above all the world, and had had thy Mistress all The grace and blossom of her sex; now she Is gone, that was walking a Spring of beauty, I would not look upon her. Boy. Sir, your pardon, I have but done a message, as becomes A servant, nor did she on whose commands I gladly waited, bid me urge her love
To your disquiet, she wouldchide my diligence If I should make you angry. Ha. Bretty Boy. Boy. Indeed I fear I have offended you: Pray if I have, enjoyn me any pennance for it; I have perform'd one duty, and could as willingly To purge my fault, and shew I suffer with you, Plead your cause to another. Ha. And Ile take thee At thy word boy, thou hast a moving language, That pretty innocent, Copie of Maria Is all I love, I know not how to speak, Winne her to think well of me, and I will. Reward thee to thy wishes. Boy. I undertake Nothing for gain, but since you have resolv'd. To love no other, Ile be faithful to you, And my propheticke thoughts bid me already Say I shall prosper. Ha. Thou wert sent to bless me. Boy. Pray give us opportunity. Ha. Be happy. Exit: Nur. He's gone. Boy. With your fair leave Mistress. Ma. Have you business with her pray you? Boy. I have a message from a gentleman, Please you vouchsafe your ear more private. Nur. You shall have my absence Neece. Exit. Ma. Was the sentleman afeard to declare his matters openly, here was no bodies was not very honest, if her like not her erâˆ£rands the petter, was wist to keep her preathes to coole her porâˆ£ridges, can tell her that now for aule her private hearings and tawgings. Boy. You may, if please you, find another language, And with less pains be understood. Ma. What is her meaning? Boy. Come, pray speak your own English. Ma. Have boyes lost her itts and memories? bless us aule. Boy. I must be plain then, come, I know you are Maria, this thinne vail cannot obscure you:
Ile tell the world you live, I have not lost yee, Since first with griefe and shame to be surpris'd, A violent trance took away shew of life; I could discover by what accident You were convey'd away at midnight, in Your coffin, could declare the place, and minute, When you reviv'd, and what you have done since as perfectlyâ€” Ma. Alas, I am betraid to new misfortunes. Boy. You are not for my knowledge, Ile be dumbe For ever, rather than be such a traytor; Indeed I pity you, and bring no thoughts, But full of peace, call home your modest blood, Pale hath too long usurp'd upon your face; Think upon love agen, and the possession Of full blown joyes, now ready to salute you. Ma. These words undo me more than my own griefes. Boy. I see how fear would play the tyrant with you, But Ile remove suspition; have you in Your heart an entertainment for his love, To whom your Virgin faith made the first promise? Ma. If thou mean'st Hartlove, thou dost wound me still, I have no life without his memory, Nor with it any hope to keep it long, Thou seest I walk in darkness like a theef, That fears to see the world in his own shape, My very shadow frights me, tis a death To live thus, and not look day in the face, Away, I know thee not. Boy. You shall hereafter Know, and thank me Lady, Ile bring you a discharge at my next visit, Of all your fears, be content fair Maria, Tis worth your wonder. Ma. Impossible. Boy. Be wise and silent, Dress your self, you shall be what you wish. Ma. Do this, and be My better Angell. Boy. All your cares on me. Exeunt.
Actus Quintus. Enter Lurch. and Boy. Lur. I Must applaud thy diligence. Boy. It had been nothing To have left him in the Porch; I cal'd his servants, With wonders they acknowledg'd him, I pretended It was some spice, sure of the falling sickness, And that was charity to bring him home; They rub'd and chaf'd him, ply'd him with strong water, Still he was senseless, clamors could not wake him; I wished 'em then get him to bed, they did so, And almost fmothr'd him with rugges and pillows; And 'cause they should have no cause to suspect me, I watch'd them till he wak'd. Lur. 'Twas excellent: Boy. When his time came to yawn, and stretch himself, I bid 'em not to be hasty to discover How he was brought home; his eyes fully open, With trembling he began to call his servants, And told 'em he had seen strange visions, That should convert him from his Heathen courses; They wondred, and were silent, there he preach'd How sweet the air of a contended conscience Smelt in his nose now, ask'd 'em all forgiveness For their hard pasture since they liv'd with him; Bid 'em believe, and fetch out the cold sur-loin: Pierce the strong beer, and let the neighbours joy in't: The conceal'd Muskadine should now lye open To every mouth; that he would give toth' poor, And mend their wages; that his doors should be Open to every miserable sutor. Lur. What said his servants then? Boy, They durst not speak, But blest themselves, and the strange means that had Made him a Christian in this over-joy, I took my leave, and bad 'em say their prayers,
And humor him, lest he turned Jew agen. Lur. Enough, enough. Whose this? Enter Toby. 'Tis one of my ringers; stand close, my Ladies Coachman. To.

Lur. How the raskal shakes? To. Here are company: Buy a mat for a bed, buy a mat, A hassocke for your feet, or a Piss clean and sweet; Buy a mat for a bed, buy a mat: Ringing, I renounce thee, Ile never come to Church more. Lur. You with a mat? To. I am call'd. If any one should osffer to buy my mat, what a case were I in? Oh that I were in my Oat-tub with a horse loaf, Something to hearten me: I dare not hear 'em; Buy a mat for a bed, Buy a mat. Lur. He's deaf. To. I am glad, I am: buy a mat for a bed. Lur. How the raskal sweats? What a pickle he is in? Every street he goes through will be a new torment. To. If ever I meet at midnight more a jangling: I am cold, and yet I drop; buy a mat for a bed, buy a mat. Exit. Lur. He has punishment enough. Enter Wildbrain.

Besides, I am so full of these young bell ringers; If I get in adoors, not the power oth' countrey, Nor all my Aunts curses shall disembogue me. Lur. Bid her come hither presently,â€”hum; tis he.

Fie, fie, Iacke, Marry a watchmans widdow in thy young dayes, VVith a revennew of old Iron, and a rugge: Is this the Paragon, the dainty Piece, The delicate divine Rogue? Wi. Tis enough I am undone, Mark'd for a misery, and so leave prating; Give me my bill. Lur. You eed not aske your Taylors, Vnless you had better linings; it may be To avoid suspition you are going thus Disguis'd to your fair Mistress. Wi. Mocke no further, Or as I live Ile lay my bill o'thy pate, Ile take a watchmans fury into my fingers, To ha no judgement to distinguish persons And knocke thee down. Lu. Come, I ha done, and now VVill speake some comfort to thee, I will lead thee Now to my Mistress hitherto conceal'd; She shall take pity on thee too, she loves A hasome man; thy misery invites me To do thee good, Ile not be jealous lacke; Her beauty shall commend it self; but do not VVhen I have brought you into grace supplant me.

Now that I have my counsel ready, and my cause ripe; The Judges all inform'd of the abuses; Now that he should be gone. Nur. No man knows whether,
And yet they talk he went forth with a Constable That told him of strange business, that would bring him Money and lands, and heaven knows what; but they Have search'd, and cannot find out such an Officer: And as a secret, Madam, they told your man Nicholas, whom you sent thither as a spie; They had a shrewd suspition 'twas the devil Ith' likeness of a Constable, that has tempted him By this time to strange things; there have been men As rich as he, have met convenient rivers, And so forth; many trees have born strange fruits: De'e think he has not hang'd himself? La. If he be hang'd, who has his goods? Nur. They are forfeited, they say. La. He has hang'd himself for certain then, Onely to cosen me of my Girles portion. Nu. Very likely. La. Or not did the Constable carry him to some prison? Nu. They thought on that too, and search'd every where. La. He may be close for treason, perhaps executed. Nu. Nay, they did look among the quarters too, And mustered all the bridge-house for his night-cap. Enter Servant. Ser. Madam, here is the gentleman agen. La. What gentleman? Ser. He that lov'd my young Mistress. La. Alas, 'tis Hartlove, 'twill but feed his melancholly, To let him see Maria, since we dare not Yet tell the world she lives; and certainly, Did not the violence of his passion blind him. He would see past her borrowed tongue and habit. Nis. Please you entertain him a while Madam, Ile cast about for something with your daughter. La. Do what thou wor, pray Mr. Hartlove enter. Enter Hartlove. Exit Ser. & Nurse severally. Ha. Madam, I come to ask your gentle pardon. La. Pardon, for what? you ne're offended me. Ha. Yes, if ye be the mother of Maria. La. I was her mother, but that word is cancel'd,
And buried with her in that very minute Her soul fled from her, We lost both our names Of mother and of daughter. Ha. Alas, Madam, If your relation did consist but in Those naked terms, I had a title nearer, Since love unites more than the tie of blood; No matter for the empty voice of mother; Your nature still is left, which in her absence Must love Maria, and not see her ashes And memory polluted. La. You amaze me, by whom? Ha. By me, I am the vile profaner. La. Why do you speak thus indiscreetly sir? You ever honour'd her. Ha. I did alive, But since she died, I ha been a villain to her. La. I do beseech you say not so; all this Is but to make me know, how much I sinn'd In forcing her to marryâ€” Ha. Do not mocke me, I charge you by the Virgin you have wept for; For I have done an impious act against her, A deed able to fright her from her sleep, And through her marble, oft to be reveng'd; A wickedness, that if I should be silent, You as a witness must accuse me for't. La. Was I a witness? Ha. Yes, you knew I lov'd: Maria once; or grant, you did but think so, By what I ha profest, or she has told you, Was't not a fault unpardonable in me, VVhen I should drop my tears upon her grave, Yes, and proof sufficient. La. To what? Ha. That I forgetfull of my fame and vowes. To fair Maria, ere the Worm could pierce Her tender shroud, had chang'd her for another; Did you not blush to see me turne a Rebell? So soon to court a shadow, a strange thing, VVithout a name? Did you not curse my levity, Or think upon her death with the less sorrow Thatshe had scap'd a punishment more killing,
Oh how I shame to think on't. La. Sir in my Opinion, 'twas an argument of love To your Maria, for whose sake you could Affect one that but carried her small likeness. Ha. No more, you are too charitable, but I know my guilt, and will from henceforth never Change words with that strange maid, whose innocent face: Like your Maria's won so late upon me, My passions are corrected, and I can Look on her now, and woman kind, without Love in a thought; 'tis thus, I came to tell you, If after this acknowledgement, you'le be So kind to shew me in what silent grave You have dispos'd your daughter, I will ask Forgiveness of all her dust, and never leave, Till with a loud confession of my shame I wake her ghost, and that pronounce my pardon: Will you deny this favour? then farewell, Ile never see you more: ha! Enter Nurse, Maria in her own apparel, after some shew of wonder he goes toward her. La. Be not deluded sir, upon my life This is the soul whom you but thought Maria In my daughters habit; what did you mean Nurse? I knew she would but cozen you, is she not like now? One dew unto another is not nearer. Nu. She thinks she is a gentlewoman; And that imagination has so taken her, She scorns to speak, how handsomly she carries it, As if she were a well bred thing, her body? And I warrant you, what looks? La. Pray be not foolish. Ha. I diturb no body, speak but half a word And I am satisfied, but what needs that? Ile swear 'tis she. La. But do not, I beseech you, For trust me sir, you know not what I know. Ha. Peace then,
And let me pray, she holds up her hands with me. La. This will betray all. Ha. Love ever honor'd, And ever young, thou Soveraign of all hearts, Of all our sorrows, the sweet ease, She weeps now. Does she still cosen me? Nu. You will see anon, 'Twas her desire, expect the issue Madam. Ha. My soul's so bigge, I cannot pray; 'tis she, I will go nearer. Enter Algripe, Lurcher, Boy. Nur. Here's Mr. Algripe, and other strangers Madam. Al. Here good Lady, Upon my knees I ask thy worships pardon; Here's the whole summe I had with thy fair daughter; Would she were living, I might have her peace too, And yield her up again to her old liberty: I had a wife before, and could not marry; My pennance shall be on that man that honor'd her, To conferre some land. La. This is incredible. Al. 'Tis truth. Lu. Do you know me sir? Al. Ha, the gentleman I deceiv'd. Lur. My name is Lurcher. Al. 'Shat have thy morgage. Lur. I ha that already, no matter for the deed If you release it. Al. Ile do't before thy witness; But Where's thy sister? if she live I am happy, though I conceal our contract, which was Stoln from me with the evidence of this land. The Boy goes to Maria and gives her a paper; she wonders, and smiles upon Hartlove, he amaz'd approaches her: afterward she shews it her mother, and then givis it to Hartlove. Nur. Your daughter smiles. Lur. I hope she lives, but where, I cannot tell sir. Boy. Even here, and please you sir. Al. How? Boy. Nay, 'tis she; To work thy fair way, I preserved you brother, That would have lost me willingly, and serv'd ye Thus like a boy; I served you faithfully, And cast your plots to preserve your credit; Your foul ones I diverted to fair uses; So far as you would hearken to my counsel;
That all the world may know how much you owe me. Al. Welcome entirely, welcome my dear Alathe, And when I lose thee agen, blessing forsake me: Nay, let me kiss thee in these cloaths. Lur. And I too, And bless the time I had so wise a sister, wer't thou the little thief? Boy. I stole the contract, I must confess, And kept it to my self, it most concern'd me. Ha. Contracted? this distroyes his after marriage. Ma. Dare you give this hand To this young gentleman, my heart goes with it. Al. Maria alive! how my heart's exalted, 'tis my duty; Take her Frank Hartlove, take her; and all joyes With her; besides some lands to advance her Joynture: La. What I have is your own, and blessings crown ye. Ha. Give me room, And fresh air to consider, gentlemen, My hopes are too high. Ma. Be more temperate, Or Ile be Welsh again. Al. A day of wonder. Lur. Lady, your love, I ha kept my word; there was A time, when my much suffering made me hate you, And to that end I did my best to cross you: And fearing you were dead I stole your Coffin, That you might never more usurp my office: Many more knacks I did, which at the Weddings Shall be told of as harmless tales. Enter Wildbrain. Shout within. Wi. Hollow your throats a pieces, I am at home; If you can roar me out againâ€” La. What thing is this? Lur. A continent of fleas: room for the Pageant; Make room afore there; your kinsman Madam. La. My kinsman? let me wonder! Wi. Do, and Ile wonder too, to see this company At peace one with another; 'tis not worth Your admiration, I was never dead yet; Ye'are merry Aunt, I see, and all your company: If ye be not, Ile fool up, and provoke ye?
I will do any thing to get your love again: Ile forswear midnight, Taverns and temptations; Give good example to your Grooms, the maids Shall go to bed and take their rest this year; None shall appear with blisters in their bellies. Lur. And when you will fool again, you may go ring. Wi. Madam, have mercy. La. Your submission sir, I gladly take, we will Enquire the reason of this habit afterwards; Now you are soundly sham'd, well we restore you: Where's Toby? Where's the Coachman? Nur. He's a bed, Madam.
