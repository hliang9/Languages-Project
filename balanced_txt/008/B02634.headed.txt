The Debtford Frollick; OR, A Hue and Cry after the Shag-Breeches. Young VVomen all, both great and small, That handleth Pot or Pail, For some I hear, and greatly fear, Do oft play with their Tayl. Tune of, The fair One let me in. ONe night when blustering winds blew and dusky was the Sky Tho' I was feeble weak and old, a watching then went I: But cruel fate did prove unkind. my grief did then begin; And quite contrary to my mind, a stranger he got in. Two Keys unto my door I had, as I did think it fit. But now it makes me almost mad I had so little wit; For when a watching I was gone my sorrow did begin; A wanton and a lascivious man unknown to me got in. Into the bed straightway he went, and hugg'd my loving Wife, Who us'd to give me hearts content, I lov'd her as my life, And grieve to think she should commit so foul and grosse a sin, And let him do what was not fit, when she had let him in. As they in sweet imbraces lay I chanced to return, And spoil'd the Game which they did play, for which my wife did mourn She told me she was wondrous ill, and thus she did begin With shrieks & groans she made her moans cause she had let him in. I willing was to go to bed and off my breeches threw She told me she was almost dead, and knew not what to do: Dear love (quoth she) a Cordial get, my pains, my pains afresh begin: I little thought she was so naught to let another in. Away went I most willingly for my dear Spouses sake, A pair of breeches on put I which proved a mistake; I to the Apothecaries went thinking her love to win. A Cordial brave I ask'd to have, not thinking who got in. A Cordial was prepar'd for me then thus I did reply: At present I cannot pay thee, but yet assuredly To morrow I will come and pay; my Pocket I felt in, And there behold was store of Gold the youngster had brought in. The Apothecary he did view the Breeches I had on, And them he said full well he knew then him I star'd upon How I by these Shag-Breeches came to pause then did begin At last thought I assuredly she let some Gallant in. Away went I most furiously this trick to think upon, But when I came with grief and sham the youngster he was gone I had his Watch and money too, and I the horns did win; But I am mad and monstruous sad that she had let him in. Take warning, all both great and small in women ne'r confide, For some pretend to their lives end they constant will abide Past all relief unto my grief, I know they are prone to sin And when you'r gone some other men sometimes may happen in.
