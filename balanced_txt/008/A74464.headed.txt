AN ACT FOR REVIVING of a former ACT, Entituled, An Act against Ʋnlicensed and Scandalous Books and Pamphlets, and for better Regulating of Printing; With some ADDITIONS and EXPLANATIONS. WHereas a late Act, Entituled, An Act against Unlicensed and Scandalous Books and Pamphlets, and for better Regulating of Printing, hath ap∣peared by experience to be a good and profitable Law for the ends therein expressed; and that the discontinuance thereof hath occasioned some lewd Pens and presses to reassume their former boldness, in Writing, Printing and Dispersing Vnwar∣rantable, Seditious and Scandalous Pa∣pers, Books and Pamphlets, to the great dis∣honor of God and offence of the Parliament, and insufferable contempt of all good Order and Government: And whereas many of the Evils and Exorbitances complained of in that Act, appear to have been much occasioned through the multiplying of Printing-houses, without any Warrant or Authority, and by reason of the Artifice and Subtilty of restless Spirits, unwilling to be confined within the limits of orderly Government; The Parlia∣ment of England taking the premises into their
serious consideration, sinde it requisite to re∣vive and explain the said Law, and to supply the further Remedies following; Be it there∣fore by the Authority of this present Parlia∣ment Enacted, Ordained and Declared, That the said Act, Entituled as aforesaid, and all the Clauses therein contained, Saving for so much thereof wherein alteration shall be made by this present Act, be from henceforth Revi∣ved, and remain in full force and vertue. And be it by the Authority aforesaid Enact∣ed and Ordained, That the Councel of State for the time being, be Impowred to inquire how many, and which of the said Printing-houses now in being shall be continued; and how such others of them, as shall be by the said Councel judged meet to be suppressed, shall be disposed of; and what number of Apprentices and Presses every Master-printer (to be allow∣ed by the said Councel of State) shall have at one time; and to have full Power to take such Order therein, as to them shall appear just and convenient. And forasmuch as the Life and Growth of all Arts and Mysteries consisteth in a due Re∣gulation thereof, Be it therefore Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That the Government and Regulation of the said Mystery of Printing and Printers, shall from henceforth be and remain in the Councel of State for the time being; and that the Ma∣ster, Wardens and Assistants of the Company of Stationers London, shall follow and ob∣serve such Rules, Orders and Directions con∣cerning the Regulating of Printing, as they shall from time to time have and receive from the said Councel successively: And the said
Councel of State for the time being, and Master, Wardens and Assistants of the said Company, according to such Rules and Di∣rections as they shall receive from the said Councel, are hereby Authorized and Required to use all good means with care and diligence, for the preventing and punishing of Offences and Misdemeanors against this Act, and the Laws, Statutes and Ordinances heretofore made and now in force, against Vnlicensed and Scandalous Books and Pamphlets, and for the better Regulating of Printing. And be it further Enacted and Ordained by the Authority aforesaid, That no person or persons shall or may at any time or times here∣after, Excepting such as shall be Licensed and Authorized by the Parliament or Councel of State, or may claim a Priviledge thereunto by Patrimonial Right, Vse or Exercise the Art, Trade or Mystery of a Printer of Books, unless he or they heretofore have, or hereafter shall have served as an Apprentice by the space of Seven Years in the said Art, Mystery and Science of Printing, with some Lawful Master-Printer of this Commonwealth of England; and that every such person and per∣sons who shall be so Qualified and Enabled to be a Printer, and shall take upon him the Trade or Mystery of Printing as a Master-Printer, shall Vse and Exercise the same in his and their respective Dwelling Houses, and not elswhere, Any Law, Statute, Priviledge, Vsage or Custom to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding, under the Penalty of Forty pounds for every Moneth, and so proportionably for any shorter or longer time, to be Forfeited by every person offending a∣gainst

And be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That what Books or other things prohibited by this or the said Recited Act, the said Master and Wardens, or such as they shall appoint, shall finde and seize upon their Search and View as aforesaid, they are here∣by Authorized and Réquired to bring them, or cause them to be brought to Stationers-Hall London, there to remain and to be disposed of as by the said Act is directed: And to the end that the said Searches and Views may be made without Spoil or Damage to the Owners of the Goods so Imported, Be it further Enacted by the Authority aforesaid, That the said Master and Wardens, or any of them, shall have Power to appoint some con∣venient place where the said Search shall be made; and that no Merchant or Owner of any such Books Imported, shall open their
