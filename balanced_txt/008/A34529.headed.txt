Whereunto is annexed a Postscript containing Reasons and Motives to his Highness and the present power in being, to grant us sch a Committee which hath been long promised, and much longer desired and sought for. Composed for the view of his Highness, and all the People of England, by Jeffrey Corbet, Citizen and Gro∣cer o London. London, printed in the Yer, 1654.
ENGLANDS Warning-Piece. AWake, awake O England, and if thou art of the horns that must hate the whore, and make her desolate! do it now or never: or else she will do it to thee, and make thee desolate! Oh what a Lithergie hath seized upon thee▪ sure thou hast forgoten thy name, and art become a stran∣ger to thy self! thy dangers, thy deliverances, thy vows, victories are buried in oblivion! the Councels of Rome was at first thine E∣nemies, but now thy chiefest friends in Councel; the plots of Je∣suites were then thy fears, but now thy favors and delights. As soon as the Lord had pluckt out the sword out of thine own bow∣els, thou didest sheath it in the heart of thine ancient friends of Holland: and no sooner is that over, but thou ragest against thy friends at home. Awake and stand upon thy guard, for thou art allmost druk with the abominations of the whore; How is the aire infected with Oaths, and cursings, and perjuries? How are the streets thronged with pride and drunkenness? How are thy Chambers infected with ryoting, wantenness and gluttony? thou hast not heard the voice that bad thee vex the Midianites which vex the with their wiles? Thou hast not heard the voice that bad thee render unto them double? Yet the Lord hath compassion on thee, and ceaseth not to give thee warning upon warnings. Surely Rome is the Mother of harlots, and is drunk with the blood of the Saints, and the souls under the Alter cy aloud; A Religion delighting in, and laden with blood: a Religion unsarible and unparalel'd, not endring any but it self; yet agreeing with hell it self, so the Pope be the head, making the word it self to come, and lay down at his feet the Sword, an the Keys, and then he opens, and cuts off what Scriptures he pleases, he arogating to himself more power than the Devil, who promised but the King∣doms
of the world, and the glory thereof; but he will promise. Heaven also with Hell, and a new created place, which was never mentioned by God, men or Divils, even his own vast Territories of Purgatory; therefore it is a small thing for him to dispose of Kingdoms and Empires of the Earth. Are not there great animo∣sies against England till it return to be disposed of by him? Look abut and ee the slughters he hath made in our neighbor Coun∣tries about us, wiss the Micre of above 100000 Protestants a Paris, and the bloody Spanish Inquisiion, and the like; but to come nearer home, let us remember the Spanish Armado in 88. which came with I strmen of cruelty to Mssacre all the Prote∣stns of England: and let us no forget he helli Powaer plot, & the Spanish Fle about 1639 laden also with Instruments of cruel∣ty  Mass-c, wch were vaquished by the Holland Fleet in the Down; and after tha n the year 1640. when the Popes fire∣brand the Queens Mother was in England, she brought over an I∣rish Pest who baed that he was the chief contriver of the Mas∣sac, in ended to cut off  the Protestants in England! & Ireland, and that he was by the Ppe employed to all Catholick Princes, for their contribution towards that bloody Massacre, and he gave it under his hand about August 1640▪ that their were 7000. men And when the Massac was dis∣covered they put another face upon it by making a breacls between the King & Par liament thereby to decide the Po estnts. in private pay for the Massacre here: and that there were 500 Irish Souldiers sent out of Flanders to guard the Tow̄er under the Po∣pish Lord Cottington, and that the Queen would pawn the Jewels of the Crown, to supply them with ny for that bloody work, whereupon William O Conner was apprehended, and committed to the Gate-house, 3. of September. 1640. which was many Months before the Irish Rebellion brake forth, and was kept prisoner a∣bove 5 years without any prosecution, and then released by the old Parliaments connivance, & so the blood of above 100000 Pro∣testants that were murhered in Ireland in cold blood, is brought upon your Highness and this Common-wealth, for justice nor be∣ing speedily executed upon William O Conner, that others might hear, and fear, and do no more so wickedly; therefore the hearts of his confederates were fully set in them to do evil, so as they went on with that bloody design, and carried it on wih an unna∣tural war. And when they saw the hand of God against them in the war, they have ever since endeavored to carry on their long in∣tended
Massacre, still deluding the Protestant Cavalier to strength▪ en their hands, in carrying on the Popes design under colour of the Kings Interest, when as the Popes design is to destroy all Pro∣testants whatsoever: and all the benefit which they could possible gain by it, was to be last destroyed; and that will more clearly appear in their intended Musscre in London, where all sorts of Pro∣testants do live, and for the greater number of them were their own friends. For first they contrived some years since to Land forreign Forces at a distance from London, to draw ou Army to∣wards them; and then they were to cut off such of the State as stood most in their way, and to surprise our Guards, and then to fire the City in many places at once, and whilest the people were a quenching the fire, then they would fall upon the cutting of all which will be proved by sufficient testimony. their throats. And for the more easie effecting thereof, the Spa nish Embassdor is, and hath been for many years their endered friend, and hath entertained William O Conner, and Patrick Car an Irish Priest who was taken in Arms against this Common wealth, and was appited their Captain General: and also many other Priests and J suites, who do continually plot the carrying on the intended Massacre, and do contrive from time to time the carrying on of whatsoever may tend thereunto: as when the two Irish Traytors were in the Toer, the Engines that were made for their escape, was contrived at the Spanish Embassadors house; and there they were sometime secured till the search was over. And when the Apprentices did make a umult in the City upon the Sabboth day at night, then was his Gate open all night, and men in Arms passed in and out; and divers in Scarlet cloaks cme  guire & Mac Mahone. to those of them that were put into Newgate, and afterwards boasted that the Spanish Embassador got them released: which sheweth what trecherous men were in the old Parliament, that would thus gratifie the peoples sworn enemies, & hold continual familiarity with th; for Car hath boasted, that he could daily speak with them at the Parliamen door. And when Garret Dillon another Irish Priest was appoined to dispose of the Arms, & Am∣munition which the King of Spi had sent ovr to the Catholicks in England & Ireland, in the year 1640 he was secured at the Spa∣nish Embassadors house, and from thence sent out to the Kings Ar∣my, where he was sain. Therefore let all unerstanding Prote∣stanis
judge, whether he be fit to have liberty of residence within the City of London or no? And for many in the old Parliament▪ who carried on the same design, as may appear by their familiarity with the sworn enemies of the Common-wealth; Which will be apparent∣ly proved. and by their relea∣sing of them frequently, and protecting of them to go between the King and his Queen all the time of the Wars; and when they were appehended at any time, did suffer them to escape, and pu∣nished the discoveres; and from time to time have used all their art and power to stifle all intelligence, and destroy all faithful in∣telligencers, and protecte Sies and Agents for the King, to fire the City of London: and suffered above six score thousand pounds worth of Malignants goods to be conveyed away, to preserve it from the fire when the City was to be burned: and likewise suf∣fered threescore thousand pounds to be conveyed to the King, which was in the hands of a Popish Treasurer: and also concealed a List of about 60 considerable persons in the City, who with their confederates, did constantly contribute to the Kings Army consi∣derable sums of mony; All which with many other things, doth make it clearly appear, that they were resolved to uphold the wars between the King and Parliament, until the Protestants were so destroyed that the Papists might have their wills of both; And I hope by this time all the rational part of our bretren the Ca∣valiers, and also all under all diffrent forms whatsoever, are clearly convinced of their error, in taking up Arms for the Pope instead of a King; And therefore I do humbly entreat them, as they do tender their own lives, liberties, estates, postereties, the good of their Native Countrey and the Protestant Religion that they do never offer to stir upon any pretence whatsoever, to tk up Arms against the higher powers; for if they do, they will but destroy themselves, and make the wound of the Nation the deeper. And I am confident, that there were thousands of them if they had known of the Papists esign, they would as soon have torn their own flesh off their bones, as ever have taken up Arms against their Countrey; And truly I am sorry for those that have a hand in this cursed design, which is in part discovered, and for those of them that are undiscovered, if they shall out of conscience come in and submit, and make discovery of what they do know. I dare engage my life that a hair of their head shall not perish.
But some may Query why I do write in this manner? My an∣swer is: That for almost 10. years after my return from Ireland, my em∣ployment was as little, as my Estate: so that I had nothing to hinder me from observing the current of the times; amongst which I could not but take notice of the policy of the Priests, Jesuites, and all the popish faction, and there accomplices in playing their game on this manner. So long as the people are oppressed, they will be discontented: and so long as they are disconteuted, they will fall into Divisions, and so long as they are devided, the easier destroyed. And to this end was the reins cast upon the neck of all corrupt Committee men to cheat by thousands, and hundreds of thousands, and then hire Clarks to Coppy out their Books, to co∣ver over their cheating, but these were of the better sort of them; for they had some fear in them: but the rest of them hath gone on with as little fear as they had honesty. And so for ur corrupt Though many of them will be pro∣ved faul∣ty. Treasurers, which of them hath ever been called to account? And so for our unjust Judges who have judged for a Reward, are they not yet unquestioned? And for our Long-winded Lawyers, who can run races of 7. 10. 20. nay 40. or 50. years long; and make the people dance after their long tayls, until they were run so quite out of breath, that they had not a groat left in their purse, d many of them gone with sorrow to their graves; but I hope to see God making inqusition after the blood of these poor souls, which were so mercilesly murthered. And for the corrupt Mem∣bers of the first House, how did they sit hacking and hewing at the two leggs upon which this Common wealth did stand? I do mean Men and Money; For Men, how have they been betrayed both by Sea and Land? And how have they been discouraged some of them, by keeping back their just and dearly earned wages? and o∣thers by long attendance, to receive considerable sums which were And yet hath ob∣tained nothing. by them disbrsed, until some had well high perished, if not alto∣gether, and many of them languish in prison, while unworthy lets can have good rewards for there pretended good services: though indeed, they deserved to have their heads taken ff for their unfaithfulness. And for Money, how hath it been consum∣ed not only by the Monsters formerly mentioned, and many more of the like nature; but I do believe it will be proved, that some
of the Members hath sent out of the Land divers millions at seve∣ral times, bsides the vast Estates that some of them hath scrued into their own hands by unjust practises; but to add t this, when I do consider the frequent recourse that the Irish Priests and Jesuites had to some of them; and how frequently the Priests, Jesuites & Irish bloody Rebbels were released from time to time, though their crimes were never so hainous; and knowing how they boasted of their great friends that they had in the House and Councel, by which they were extreamly encouraged; and upon which their confidence was builded of carrying on of their cursed design of the bloody Massacre, and clearly escerning that they had more friends there than the Common-Wealth had; for when they attempted to make a discovery of it, they were betrayed into their hands; I could not but conclude, that the desolation of the everlasting Parliament, was one of the greatest mercies that ever this Nation received from God this many years; for if they had sitten a little longer in all probability, they had accomplished their desires: which if they had accomplished, then all mercies which God had ouchsafed us since these troubles, had been drowned in a Sea of b And now my Lord, I beseech you consider how many parties hath God overthrown since these troubles fell upon us, as the Bishops, the corrupt House of Lords, the late oppressing King and his potent partie; yet notwithstanding all this mighty work of God, our everlasting Parliament would not learn righteousness, but went on in the same oppressing courses, if not greater, until they by walking in the same paths with their Predicessors, come to the same shameful downfal which befel them; for did not God cause their Sun to set at noon day: and did not they go out like the snuff of a candle, and have left a foul stink behind them? And how contemptible hath God made them in the eyes of the people? and although the action was so unheard of, and so contrary to the letter of the Law; yet I did never hear one so much as mutter against it; for the people were sensible of their peidiousness in breaking of their trust, by neglecting to seek the publick good of the Nation, and seeking of their own particular advancement, by unjust practises and bribery, and acting of seve∣ral Treasons against the Nation: as endeavoring to cut your
Highnes, and our Army, by assisting of the late King, and endea∣voring the destruction of this City, with many other horrid villa∣nies, e releasing of the Priests and Jesuites, and many bloody Irish Rebels: the countenancing of the sworn enemies of the Na∣tion, and discountenancing of the most cordial friends thereof, e∣ven to the distruction of some of them; their ocking to Gold∣smiths Hall by 5, 8. or 10 at a time, to help delinquents to come of  an easie rate, which to me, did then speak thus much, that they would have their Estates preserved, that so they might be still able to carry on their wicked and hellish design against this Nation. But my Lord, this is that which doth stick upon the spirits of the people, that these men were never questioned for all their villa∣nies committed by them, that so there might have been a diffe∣rence between the precious and the vild: that those few that were found faithful amongst them might have been had in singular ho∣nour; for God had a small handful amongst them of faithful ones, who did spend their spirits to keep the Common walh from uter desolation, and did precue some good things for their Country: which I think did exceed all that went before them. But my Lord, I know not what to say to these things more than this, that God doth suffer it to be so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, in saying, Let God be tre and all men lyars; and hath not the Spirit told us, That because Justice is not speedily exe∣cuted  an evil work, the hearts of the sus of men are set in them to do evil, and that continually; for if Justice had been executed up∣on Wi iam O Couner and his accomplices, all the villanies that were committed by our perfidions Parliament, Committes and others, ha been preveed: and if Justice  been done upon them, then the enemies dust not have contiived this destinction against you, and this Nation. And I beseech you, give me leave by the way, to tell you, that it is impossible to reconcile Christ and Antichrist together, and that you cannot with safety put Spents in your bsom, and not be destroyed by them, until their stings be pluck out; For can you remove that enmity which God hath put between the seed of the woman, and the seed of the Serpent: then you may with safety close with them; but if you cannot, as I am sure you can∣not, for it is not in the power of men and Angels to do it: then
take heed what you do; for if you have any further to do with them it will be your destruction. Oh I beseech you, call to mind the great and unparralel'd mercies which God hath vouchiased to you in England, Ireland and Scotland! for I dare say, you dare not think, that you did atchieve them by your own strength or policie, or by the power of your own arm; and if not, than it must need be by the power of the Lamb: and if so, than certain∣ly he hath merited somthing at your hands by it; Therefore, why do you so evily requite him, and suffer all those mercies to be bu∣rie in oblivion? Do you think that he did exalt you to the throne, for you to leave him still sitting upon the Dunghi? and suff h Members, and the friends of the Common-wealth, to be still rampled upon, and destroyed by unjust Judges, and Antichri∣stion Lawyers, and such base varlets as dare without ground impri∣son en at their pleasure, and constrain others to confine them∣selves to their own houses, to the utter undoing of them, and their families, chusing that rather than to be destroyed by mercy∣less blood-sucking Jylors in stinking prisons. My Lord, I beseech you remember that you are sworn to main∣tain the Law; and I am sure that all the jugling Antichristan Law∣yers in England, are not able to produce any Law for these things: neither can there be any Law made to destroy the people, seeing that the safety of the people is above all Law: And now I beseech you in the Bowels of Jesus Christ, not to suffer this unspeakable deliverance, which doth bring in the bowels of it all our former mercies; for if the enemy had now prevailed, all the former mer∣cies had been destroyed as if they had never been Oh let it not be passed over as all the former hath been! but let it awaken you to works of justice and mercy, and to break off your sins by repen∣tance, and your iniquities by showing merey to the por, for God hath shewed thee what is good; naely, to do justice, to love mercy, and to walk humble with thy Gd. And my Lord, you have born the name of a religious man for many years; and the Apostle James doth tell us, that pure Religion, and  filed before God and the Father, is to visite the fatherless and the window in their adversity, and to keep our selves unspotted from the world. Now if God be pleased to give this mercy such a setting on upon your heart, by the power of his eternal Spirit, that it doth awaken thee
to hearken to the voice of the Lord, then thou shalt stand in de∣spite of men and devils; but if thou dost refuse to hearken unto the word of the Lord, and walk perversly towards thy God: I do then tell thee from the mind of God in Scriptures, that thou shalt fall and not stand, though all the Nations of the Earth should combine together to prevent it; For I am sure that all the Ni∣ons of the earth are not able to rescue one man out of the ands of Jesus Christ, when he shall seize upon him to call him to an ac∣count for his perfidious dealing with him; Therefore be wise O Princes and larned, O Rulers of the earth: Kiss the Son least he be angry with you, and you perish in the mid way; For the Stone which is cut out of the Mountain without hands shall break down all Powers, and shall be exalted above the top of all Mountains. And I beseech you all consider, that God is about his overturning work, and he will overturn, and overturn until the Government be put into Christs hands, and then we shall have justice; for the Prophet saith that he is just: We have had many overturns, but there is a grea∣ter behind then any of the former; and I hope it will be but the overthrow of all the corrupt powers of the Nation, with the over∣throw of the corrupt practice of the Law also. Man was happy so long as he acted the will of God; but when he sell to acting of his own will, he made himself and ostity miserable. And I can∣not but admire at men, that think to make themselves happy by seeking of their own wills: Oh! when I do consider the actings of many of the Magistrates of this Nation, who are men of great Estates, and yet do daily break down the hedg of the Law, which God hath set about them to preserve them, and their Estates from the Sons of violence. I say, when I do consider their frequent pra∣ctice therein, it doth make me trmble to think of the fearful e∣vent which might ensue, if others should take example by them; therefore I do earnestly beseech them all both for their own good, and the good of the whole Nation, that they do now begin to act in the will of God; for in so doing, they shall be blamless both in the eyes of God and man; for I am sure that man can rever be happy, until he doth return into that coition wherein be was first happy; and when our wills are boud up wholly in the will of our God, then all controsie ceaseth, between the Crea∣tor and his creatures, without which we cannot be happy. And
truly, when the new overturn shall come, I think the wisest man alive cannot say what party shall be undermost. but this I am con∣fident of, that Christ will be uppermost; for Antichrist hath had his day, and the Sun thereof is a setting, and the day of Christ is a dawning; therefore let all the Agents of Antichrist know, that they will suddenly know that all their labor is in vain, although they have digged deep to hide their Councel, from the Lord, yea even to the bottom of Hell it self; yet let them know that God is there, and that nothing can he hid from his All-seeing eye: and the woe that God hath denounced against them, shall assuredly o∣vertake them speedily: and I cannot but wonder at their blindnes that they do not see the hand of the Lord stretched forth against them, and how he hath made good his promise, that no weapon formed against him shall prosper; for if it could, certainly we had been swallowed up long since. Oh that this Nation from the highest to the lowest would hearken what this speaking provi∣dence of late years doth say! and that they would have their ey in their heads, to see how by a mighty and an out stretched arm he hath wrought salvation to his people, both in England, Ireland and Scotland! Could any hand but the hand of Jehovah have done it? When they had 20. nay, I am confident they had 40. for one; and yet God hath carried it against them, notwithstanding all the falsness of those at seemed to stand for us. What treachery and perfideousness hath, and may be discovered in some that sat at the Helm? Is the Popes Emissaries, would seriously consider the mighty wonders that God hath wrought since these troubles began, it would make them cease to indanger themselves, and to perplex us; for though they have an excellent faculty in fomenting, and continuing divisions amongst us: yet I must tell them, that they do begin their work at the wrong end, for their divisions reacheth but to the creature: and so long as the Creator is not devided, the Trinity is still in unity; for the Father is not against the Son, nor the Son against the Spirit, nor the Spirit against the Father: but they are all one, and do set themselves to carry on one design, which is to advance the Son; therefore until they can work a de∣vision in the Deitie, it is impossible that they should ever accom∣plish their design, and Iam sure God can never be devided in him∣selfe
and I do beleeve that a great part of them are convinced of it, and consequently of the impossibility of their prevailing against the Members of Christ, but they must shew of what house they doe come of, for they are like to their Father the Devill, who know∣eth he cannot prevaile, yet he will do as much mischief as he can, for he knoweth his time is short, and therefore he rageth, and would not have this Nation have a being, neither in England nor Ireland, and therefore hath he stirred up nustruments of cruely to raise such mercilesse taxes in Ireland, as I thinke the like was ne∣ver known in the world, but they that have eyes to ee may see, that God is a consuming of Antichrist with the spirit of his outh, and will shortly abolish him utterly with the brightnesse of his coming. Therefore my cunsell to all the Governors and Magistrates of this Nation, is to close hands with Christ, in doing the will of the Father, for he saith, If hee seeketh his own will, his judgement is not just, how then can they thinke that they doe justice whilst they doe seek their own wils, but let them take heed for Christ will prevaile, and he will have the will and the Law of his Father established; therefore I beseech you close with him in it, fo all power in Heaven and Earth is committed into his hands, and he will prove a burthensome stone to crush in pieces all those that shall be found to oppose him, for he will make all his ene∣mies his Foot-stoole. I could wish that the Governors of the City of London had in time thought of these things, and then some of them would not have acted as they have done, in binding over to the Sessions and good behaviours, and afterwards commit him to prison, that did discover to him the designe of the Irish Priests and Iesuits, to burne the Citty, and to massacre the people thereof; I thinke that God hath bereaved them the use of common reason, for could they think to escape any better then other men, but there was more in it then I will commit to publick view at this time, yet I hope God will stir up the Inhabitants of this City to importune our Grandees not to suffer those to have Government in this City, who have brought off and acquitted the Plotter of the most de∣desperate bloody designe that ever was set on foot in the world, and stiffled the treachery of a dangerous Enemy of this Common∣wealth, and have punished those that did discover them: My
Lord, I doe once againe intreat you, as you tender your own safe∣ty to take heed of atteres, who cry peace and safety, even when that destruction which they have plotted is ready to seize upon you, to the destruction both of your person, this City and the whole Common-wealth; but blessed be the God of mrcies, that hath carried you on to so deep a discovery of their damnable de∣signe (and blessed be his name for ever) for regiving us all his former mercies an deliverancis, for the wombe of this mercy were all his fo merces pped up: But my Lord you are not yet come to the bottom of it; therefore I besech you doe not thinke that the danger is pst, and theupon grow secure, but rather strenghen vour Guards, and your Army also for I am confident that their des doth still go on, and I  I am a∣ble to shew undeiable reasons for it; but I will beae to do it publickly, the great God of Heaven and Earth  his mercy such a seuing on upon your spirit, that it may awaken you, and make you to see wherein you have det unfaithfully with your God, in not performing those ingagements and ovenants which you have made unto him in the time of your distresse, can you thinke that he hath given you so many victor and deliverances both in the field, and upon your sick bed, and that he doth ex∣pect no returnes from you againe: And truly my Lord untill you doe establish Iustice and mercy in this Not on, I date say that you have done nothing for Go, no nor for your Country, For God hath shewed thee Oh max what is good, and what he reqh of thee, and if we will beleeve either the New or the . Testament. Re∣ligion doth consist in actions of this nature, and  in preaching, Heating, Reading, and Praying, though these are not to be neg∣lected; nay I could wish that they were uch mor used, not∣withstanding our Saviour calleth verball pra bu baling; and for this Common-wealth. I beseech you consider what benefit we are like to receive by all that which is done. whilst you receive in∣to your bosome those that have all along endeavoured to destoy both you and this Common-wealth to the desperate hazzarding of both, and so long as you doe suffer our estates and lives also lie at the mercy of mercilesse Lawyers and Judges, who  Knights of the Post o requently in the Courts, and that bons of considerable summes may be forged, and then proved by false
aths. Oh my Lord it would make you trmble, if you did know but the o halfe of the villaes of ths kind, how can any mans life or estate be in safety, so long as these are suffered, I am sure that our Consellors of the Law can shew no Law for these things, neither can they shew any Law for keeping a widow in their Courts, which fued for 80. l. untill they have gotten above 200, l. in Fees, and yet the money unrecovered, truly my soule can not but mourn for these things, and also to think of the wo∣full misery which will assuredly fall upon that Generation of men, for the woe was denounced by God himselfe, for binding hea∣vy burdens, and laying them upon other mens shoulders, and that strook that hath been so many hundreth years in comming, must needs be dreadfull when it cometh. My Lord, Solomon was a wise man, and he could see nothing in any thing under the Sun but vaity and vexation, and he saith, that he that cometh after him shall do nothing but what he hath done before him, & certainly the more our hearts are let forth after any thing under the Sun, the further we shall be from being satisfied therewith, but experience telleth me, that God can satisfie the soule to the full without any aboundance of outward things, and that it is greater riches to in∣joy him without carnall greatnesse or honour in the world, then it can be to injoy more of them then our hearts can desire without him, For what doth it advantage a man to win the whole world, and loose his own soule Every building that is not founded upon a Rocke shall fall, and I know no Rock of stability, but the Rock of ages, therefore if you mean to stand make God your stability by esta∣blishing Justice and Righteousnesse, and My in this Nation, make Justice the Foundation, and Mercy the corner stone, and then your building shall stand, and you shall have the prayse and h∣nour of a wise Builder, and give me leave with Jethro, to say that the thing which thou dost is not good, the worke is too great for you, and your Couell, It will weary out both you and the people therefore I beseech you let us have a Committee to examine, and, redresse the grievances of the Nation, and leave the weighty mat∣ters to you, and your Counsell, of such men as wee shall , and such as there can be no exception against, and then you shall see all the secret enemies of your person and this Nation, discover the debts of the Nation p, the minds of the people queted
and their hearts united together to the great astonisment of all Christendome, and you shall have such a bank of treasure, and publick revenue, as shall make all the enemies of this Nation af∣fraid ever to attempt any thing against it, for what doth or hath in former ages incouraged the Enemy, but our divisions, and the treacherous plos of the popish Emisaries: therefore I thinke it unpossible for England to be in afety, untill they be transplanted, for are they not sworne to hazard lives, and all that is dear to them to destroy those which they call Hereticks; and hath not this Na∣tion in past ages sound it to be their constant indeavour, and France can likewise manifest their unsatiable thirst which they have after Protestant blood, it is time for thee O Lord to work, for men have destroyed thy Law, and unstead thereof hath brought in a  Antichristiall Jugell which destroyeth the people, only to in∣rich themselves. My Lord, what would you have of this Nati∣on? if Honour, then you shall have as much as you can stand un∣der, it Wealth, then you shall have more then you can tell what to doe withall. only gratifie this Nation in this one thing of ju∣stice, and they will serve you for ever, and that with fredome and checifulresse, you will not need to conraine them, for they will be more carefull of you then of their own lives, then will the prayers of the poor continually ascend unto the Thion of , untill as I may speak with holy Rrrce that they have surped the Almighty n your behalfe. And my Lord if you w grant us this Committee, and give them full power to poced accord∣ing to the righteous Law of God, an of th Nation, then I will ingage my life to pay all the Publick Faith B of the Nati∣on, with one moyetie of what wll be brought in by them, ar the discoverer hath had his fifth part, and the other oyiety shall goe in to the publick Treasury to pay the Army, and to prevent the selling of the prise of the poor Sld ers blood for nought, that so in time the taxes may be taken off, only we shall desire li∣berty to attend the Committies, with liberty to speak on behalfe of the Common-wealth, and that you doe afford us a speedy and an effectuall assistance, to remove any upon Just Cause, and to put in others that shall be Judged faithfull in their rooms, and that any three or more of them to take any examination, and five or more of them to Judge any matter, only leaving the weighty
matters to bee judged by you and your Councill; this you will quickly finde will give such content to all sorts of people, that there will not long bee need of an Army in England, and after that, send an Army where you please, onely take the Word for your rule, and you shal see such a presence of the Almighty going along with them, that they shal not meet with any great opposition; but my Lord, if you shal refuse to hearken to the counsel of thy God, then I could wish that God would provide me a place in the wilderness, and feed me by a Raven as hee did the Prophet, that so I might not see the wofl desol∣tion that God wil bring upon you, and your family, and the misery which is likely will come upon this Nation; yet I am confident that God will finde out a way to lay you aside, and yet preserve his people, for hee hath a peo∣ple in this nation which hee will not sell for nought: I beseech you consider, what is it that maketh any A∣ction lawfull or unlawfull? is it not Gods willing, or nulling of it? if so, then (I hope) you wil say to us as Pope Elutherius said to lutius King of Brittain, when hee wrote to him to send him the Imperial Laws to govern Brittain by, he wrote this answer, The Roman Emperial Laws were made by men, and might be excepted against: But saith he. I have sent you the Old and New Testament, out of which you may gather sufficient Lawes to govern by: And (I hope) that none in this Nation dareth to bee so blasphemous, as to say, that there may bee found out a juster or a more righteous rule to walke by than that, if so, then what have wee any longer to doe with that Antichristian Juggle, which hath destroyed so many thousands of this nation: but let Christ bee our King and our Law-giver, Oh! that I did know what Argument to use that might prevaile with you herein! For, I am ssured, that so great will bee the happiness that will come to this nation by it, that for the obtaining of it, I could wish, that it were written with my heart blood, rather than it should not bee obtained. For the Spirit saith, justice and righteous∣ness exaleth a nation, and the fruit thereof shal bee peace,
and I am confident, that if you had more wisdom than Solomon, and could speak with the tongue of Angels, you shal never re∣concile this Nation without justice; for I do see that God hath set it upon the spirits of the people of this Nation to have Christ exalted by establishing justice: My Lord, you have strong guards about you, and they are no stronger then need requireth, and I could wish they were stronger, yet my Lord remember, that except the Lord doth keep the City, the watchman waketh : Now my Lord, if justice be an Attribute of God, G  be divided, if injustice bee found with you, assure y that God is not present with y, and if any thing or per can stand without God, judgye. I beseech you consider whs the downfal of your predecessor, and do you think that God is changeable? would he destroy a King for the inju∣stice  was acted under him, and wil he not destroy you for  far greater injustice, especially considering that it is com∣mitted against far greater light, and stronger engagements, and more publike promises made before God and man? I beseech you remember, that all that have fallen before you, when they came once to live in the hatr of the people, they were short , and how you do stand in the hearts of the people, I wil not gratifie your and the Commonwealth enemies, so much as to commit it to publike view; but I must tel you, that those that have your ears at command, and stoppeth them from your friends, those with the Gentlemen of the long robe, and others, with a religious cloak upon their backs to cover their knaverie with all, wil very shortly render you far more odiou in the peo∣ples eyes than ever were any of those that fel before you. My Lord, it is not the Governor that the people kicketh against, but the manner of governing; for if the people be governed justly and righteously, they care not whether it be by OLIVER, Lord Protector, or by a CHARLS, by the Grace of God, or Parliament: but if they cannot have it from neither ofthem, then they will cease from them all, and lift up their eys to the Hils from whence their help cometh, and give the God of Justice no rest until the Government be put into the hands of Christ; therefore I beseech you consider what you do, lest you be found a Fighter against him; for though God hath given you many victories, yet my life
for it, he wil not give you the victory over his Son, but wil exa him in despight of a the Kings, Emperors, and Protectors in the world, and wil suddenly call them all to a strict account for their oppressing of his members; therefore remember what God hath promised, that if you ays please him, he wil mae your enemies at peace with thee, therefore take no care to please this party, nor that party, but let thy care be to please thy God, by do∣ing of justice and she wing mercy to the poor, & then never heed what this man saith, or what other men say, for it is not the say∣ings of men, but the counsel of the Lord that must stand; therfore take heed of making Christ thy enemy by quarrelling aganist his members, for he taketh any thing don't to them as done to him∣self: And my Lord, I beseech you consider, that though a Guard is good to preserve you against a sible enemy, yet remember, that when that impartial ejnt Death sh come to arrest thee, I tel thee it is not an Army no Guard, nor Life, guard that can keep him out, and then to whom wilt thou she for help? The creature cannot help thee, and if thou shalt think to go God, thy conssience cannot but tel thee, that thou hast not rendred to God according to what thou hast received from h; or he hath done thee many favours, and such as made the whole earth ring of them; but thy conscience and all this ation wil witness a∣gainst thee, that thou hast done nothing for him until thou hast freed the nation from the tyranny of the Gentlemen of the long Robe, notwithstanding that God calleth for it, his people hath prayed and sught it at thy hands both by writing and by word of muth: Oh my Lor▪ beech you consider what a cloud of witnesses wl come in against you, consider i, (I say) before it be too late; for ssredly, if you wil not do that work for which hee hath brought thee unto this place, ssuredly he wil suddenly lay thee side; I beseech you consider that God hath put power in∣to your hands to establish I stice and righteousness in this nati∣on, and if there be a principle within you why is it not don, I do profess it maketh me to tremble to think how unanswerable it is, both before God and man. And the late King did think himself, as far from being questioned by man, as you can, yet you see what is become of him. I beseech you remember that it is God that ordreth the spirits of men, it is he that subdueth the hears of the people unto Kings and Governors, and it is he that raiseth
the spirits of the people against them when they do not govern▪ in and for the Lord; and I do not know any ty or rule in all the Scriptures, no not in the neerest relations that requireth obedi∣ence, but in the Lord, then if magistrates and governors wil cast aside the wil and law of God, and act in and for their own wils, and by the corrupt Antichristian laws which were divised by co∣vetous men, with the help of the Devil, to inrich themselves by the ruin of many thousand families, widows, and fatherless; I say if they do act, and command, and govern in their own wils and by a Law which is so directly opposie to the wil and law of God, than no wonder though there be so much murmurring and complaining in our streets, so much plotting & contriving the ruin and destruction of our governors, for the thing is of God, though the evil and bloody intention in them is from the devil and their own lusts, because they cannot set up Antichrist and establish in∣iquity and all ungodliness by a law, that so they might live accor∣ding to their own lusts; this I say is of the devil, yet I say the thing is of god, and that for most righteous ends, to make go∣vernors afraid to act in their own wils, and by corrupt Anti∣christian laws; for hath not god promised that if our ways plea∣seth him he wil make our enemies at peace with us; then my lord, what conclusion can be drawn, when not only our enemies but our frends are at variance with us, and have sought our destruc∣tions? the Lord sayd to one, if thou dost wel, shalt thou not be excepted? yes, thou shal be excepted with god, and excepted with man; then my lord, who can hurt thee? who will plot any evil against the? nay, wil not all bless thee, and bless god for thee that ever he brought such a man to rule over us? but my Lord, if thou doest evil, sin lieth at thy dore, and certainly if sin once lye there, Judgment wil not be long absent, I mean judgment h a witness, for it is a Iudgment to have the people ready to rebel and to rise up against thee, but when it cometh with a wit∣ness, it wil take effect to the sweeping of thee and thine off from the land of the living, therefore my Lord, I beseech thee, lay it to heart; what wil neither real mercies bestowed upon thee nor iudgments threatned and shaken over thee, awake thee, though timely discovered to preserve thee? whereby god showeth thee how he could have cut thee off, but this he doth to make fur∣ther trial of thee, to see if thou wil be awakened and driven
out of thy own wil, to Act in the wil and Law of thy god that so he might be a shield and a buckler unto thee, and unite the hearts of the people unto thee: Oh my Lord' I beseech the re∣turn to thy god and be safe, make him thy stability by establish∣ing iustice, iudgment, and righteousness in this Nation: Oh! that thou woludst thus try God, and once in thy life keep a true fast by breaking the bands of wickedness, by taking off every bur∣then, and letting the oppressed go free: Oh' I say, that thou wouldest thus try god, and see if he wil not open the windows of heaven, and power down abundantly blessings of all sorts, both upon thee and thine, & this whole nation, then wil the peo∣ple bless thee, and when ever they do see thy face, they wil make the heavens to ring with their acclamations and strong cries, which they wil send up to heaven for thee, it wil make the hearts of the widows and fatherless to sig in them for ioy, I beseech you con∣sider of the greatness of the good which wil come by it, for it wil discover much more evil than I have, or is fit to mention in a pub∣like way, it wil procure far greater good to this nation then my pen is able to express, for it wil do the greatest part of your work to your hands, and it wil be done on free-cost, for they wil act without any sallery, so that the work will be done without any trouble to you, or charge to the people, Oh, how wil this unite the hearts of the people unto you! and it wil remove your des∣perate enemies far from you, which now are in your bosom. I be∣seech you be no longer deluded by the Lawyers, to think that they wil regulate the Law, & see justice done to the oppressed of the nation, for is it not their trade to oppress by their delatory proceedings, & putting fair glosses upon foul causes, making good seem to be evil, and evil seem to be good? whereby they do bring more detriment to the nation than all the cheaters, pick-pockets, Highway-robbers, or all the charge of the whole Army; is it possi∣ble that any which do live by the corrupt practise of the Law, should see the evil thereof, so long as the gain thereof is as a gift, which the Spirit saith doth blind the eys of the wife? and these are wise men, they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no heart, I speak for the generality of them, I include not all, for I do know a few, and but very few of them of whom I have better hopes, but it i an easier work to make ten  Laws out of the Scriptures, than to reforme the old,
which is so ful frought with corrupt juggles and deceitful tricks to make one shut beget ten others; but ethinks I do see the lawyers, the traytors and the tyrants. floking about my Lord,  him, that these men cannot deermin things according to Jce, because they are ignorant of the Law; to which  answer, that they are men that are very wel instructed in the Law of rightusness, which is the Law that must do us and hi Nation good, my Lord, I beseech you observe those that are most olici∣ous against i, and you shall see them discovered to be no friends to , nor to this Commonwealth; and now my dear country∣me all, as I ave earnestly intreated some of you never to stir  by way of hostility, for truly they do destroy themselves and families, and indanger the whole Nion, for the sworn ene∣mies thereof have made themselves as strong as possible they can waiting an opportunity to destroy us all; therefore it bveth every man to have his eye about them, and to watch the mo∣vings or these vipers, who do seek to eat out the belly of their mother, and so I do as earnestly intreat you all to stir from every several County and City by impounate peitions to move the Protector to grant us this committee, and then we shal see more good done in one quarter of a year, then ev all the Lawyers did since they were first created: And I beseech you give him no rest, for I know that his melting heart cannot deny nor with hold so great a good from this nation, for he cannot but see that it is a thing most acceptable, both to God and man. And now a word to the poor scatteced Saints, who goeth sighing and mourning after their God, and thirsting after a more fll eve∣lation and manifestation of the unchangeable love of the father unto or in them, I do say to these, life up your heads, fr your rdmption draweth near, the Lord whom you seek wl come suddaily into h Temple: Christ is even at the doors to make himself glorious in his Saints, and admired in them that believe, and no wonder though they do admire their God, to think that notwithstanding all their wretched sinful courses, whereby they have provoked God to his fa, and done as much as in them y to ungod him; yet not ithstanding, his love is continued stil un∣to us, and all that he doth to us, either for matter of prosperity, or adversiy, all is out of his love to wins back again unto him∣self
though he be inforced somtimes to strip us of all our lovers, that so we may at the last, he arken to the voice of our first love, and then when he hath allured us to hearken to him, and that he hath spoken comfortable unto us, he then procedeth to batter and break us all to pieces in our parts, nay and in our graces also and maketh us to know that we do not only stand in need of the grace of God, but even of the god of grace, to binde us up, and to cure us of all our incurable diseases; as pride, hardness of heart, and unbelief; for it requireth no less power to work faith in an unbelieving soul, then it did to raise Christ from the dead; and if once we have found god to be a faith working god, what cannot that soul trust god with? he can trust him with al his graces and his righteousness, and be content to seek a righteosness in him, who is the Lord our righteousness; and then when he leveth in us, we shall act righteously, and Iustly: And yet not wee but the grace of god in us, or rather the god of grace in us, these has fellowship both with the father, and with the son. And they do go to the father, in the same unction with the son, and can say, father, we know that thou hearest us alwaies; to these I speak desiring to stir up their pure minds to be carefull that when the father draweth them, they do run unto him, and by his own power surprise him, and let him not go til he doth bless this nation with the establishing of justice, Judgment, and Righteousness, hold him fast I say and press him to it, for god cannot refuse to grant his own desires, which he hath stird up in us by his spirit, for Father, Son, and Spirit are one, and all of one mind, and desireth in us of god, nothin but what is the mind of god, both Father and Son, then why should we doubt but that Christ is at the very dores, for how strongly doth the spirit cry in his poor despised ones? and Christ saith, when the son of man commeth shall he finde faith on the earth, truly there is almost none that can believe that Christ is so near his coming as he is, but do we not se almost, all the scripture fufilled, which are to be fulfilled before his coming, as the great abounding of inquity and the like Oh! let us not doubt but believe, for if we can believe, all things are possible, and truly I am confident that for this work I shall stir up all the corrupt Lawyers, the Papists, Priests, and Iesuits, and all the Traitors and Tyrants of
this nation to combine together to destroy me, and then will pursue me even as so many eagles purfueth a partridg upon the mountains, but my god who is my father and husband, can pre∣serve me from them all, and receive me as hee did the dove into the Ark with the olive branch in her mouth; but whether he wil or not, yet let them know that I fear them not in the least, for the worst hurt they can do to me is to break in pieces this vail of flsh which keepeth me absent from my God, but I am sure so long as my father hath any work for me to do, they shall have no power over me, and when I have finished his work, I shall be ready to surrender that life which I have carried in my hands these five yeers, ready to resign it into the hands of whom soever hee shall end for it; for then I shall enjoy the full fruiti∣on of that which he hath given me but an earnest of; & then I shal remain with him for ever, and see him as he is, Christ was obedi∣ent to the wil of the father even unto death, and therefore sin, hel▪ and death were to weak to hold him, but was by the eter∣nal spirit raised unto glory, and he hath given the same glory unto his members, and if thou wil immate our head, in doing the wil of the Father, by establishing justice and mercy, then all the bands of wickedness and snares of death wherewith thy ft∣tring enemies have incompassed thee withall, whereby ine ears are stopped fom heaing the cries of the poor, I say they shall all be broken, and be too weak to hold thee, and thou shalt be a∣sed to a higher degree of glory then ever any meer man that went before thee; for assurely the neighbor nations d bgin to trem∣ble at thee already, and if God shall once appear n England in iustice, iudgment, and mercy, the I cell thee, they shall all fall before thee, and the good that shall come to this nation, by Iustice, wil make all the commons of other nations rather invite thee then oppose thee. Oh! therefore, do the wil of thy God, be faithful in a little, for what thou hast yet is very little, to what thou shalt have, for he wil make thee ruler over much, and over and above thou shalt enter into thy masters ioy, which is greater happiness and treasure then to possess the whole earth, My Lord, Christ in the 5 of John maketh it a thing of impossibi∣lity for us to believe while we receive honor one of onother, and seek not the honour that cometh of God only, and plentiful
experience doth tel me, that when we do believe that God can and wil give us and cast upon us far greater honour for doing of his wil, then all the great Monarks of the earth can give us; then we wil scorn to step forth to the creature for any addi∣tion, for what is all the honour that all the great ones of the earth can bestow upon thee? it is but titulary, and a meer shad∣dow as nothing and endeth in trouble and horror; then much more that which thou didst receive from thy inferiors, and some of them did stand in more need of thy protection to keep them from Iustice, then thou didst of that honor which they did put upon thee, for thou wast much more honourable before, for assuredly they have given the but a meer bubble. But now my Lord, I beseech you be awaked to act in the wil of thy God, and thou canst not want true and lasting honour, which shall remain with thee, and thy name shall be honourable to the ends of the earth, when thou art dead and gone; the work which God hath been about these many years past, is to draw all good into himself, and to leave the creature empty, that so we may see that all men, even the best of men are a meer lye, for we can no sooner receive any good by the creature, but presently we cry out, good master! whereas he telleth us, that there is none good but God, for all good cometh from him, and is but handed to us by the creature, as the water through the conduit- pipe, and yet we do rob God of his honour by ascribing that to the crea∣ture which is only due to the Creator, but when God hath taught us to cease from man and to make God to be all in all, by ascribing the glory of all the good we do receive unto God, who is the fountain of all good, then I doubt not but God will recover many of those eminent professors of religion, who have by their corrupt covetous and carnal actings, brought so great a blot upon the profession of Religion, by making them to see how they have been catching after the shaddow, and lost the substance; and as I may say, have pierced the Lord of life, I doubt not I say, but God wil recover them, but it wil cost them deer, they must pass through the fire, nay even through hel it self, and the fire of the spirit must burn up and consume in them the flesh∣ly principle, that Dalilah which hath betray'd them into the hands of the uncircumcised: My Lord I beseech you take care that
none of the traytors of the old house, nor none of the lawyers do creep into this house, for if they do, it is impossible that any good can come to the Commonwealth. My Lord, the hearts of the people are much rejoyced, to see that greatness could not prevail with you to stifle Iustice for the blood of one innocent man, and doth fil them with hope that you wil not suffer the blood of an hundred thousand men to go unexpiated. The Spirit of God never spake any thing but truth, and that hath told us, that oppression maketh wise men mad, and some of this generation who is so mad as to act to their own destruction, did for a time cease, and would have ceased totally, if they could have seen justice established, but for want thereof did fall to their mad actings again, and were cut off. I do not read throughout the Scriptures, where there are greater promises made to any thing then to works of Justice and Mercy, nor greater Iudgments denounced against any thing than iniustice and oppression: Oh! that thou wouldst hearken to the Com∣mandments of thy God! then shal thy peace be as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the Sea, and thy name shal not be cut off, nor destroyed from before the Lord, but the Lord wil do his pleasure upon Babylon, and his arm shal be upon the Caldeans, and although the oppressor or the oppressing Ci∣ty Babylon should mount up to heaven, and fortifie her self in the heighth thereof, yet from me shal spoylers come unto her, saith the Lord, and the violence which she hath done to Sion, and the blood of Jerusalem shal be upon the inhabitants of the Caldeans, and God wil plead Sions cause, and Babylon shal become heaps, &c. Oh therefore I beseech you slee out of Babylon, and deliver thine own soul, and be not cut off in her iniquity, for the time of the Lords vengeance is at hand, and he wil render unto her a recompence; therefore get thee into thine own countrey, for her Iudgment reacheth unto heaven, and is lifted up even to the kies, and the Lords device is against Babylon, to destroy it. Oh my Lord! I beseech you consider that I desire nothing of you, but what God and this Nation calleth for at your hands, the doing whereof wil so indeer the hearts of the Nation to you, that it wil secure you for the future, the neglect thereof wil set
both God and the Nation at a distance from you, but the grant∣ing thereof will not onely procure all the good formerly menti∣oned, but it will make such plentiful provision for the poor, that there shall not be a beggar in our Israel. A POSTSCRIPT, containing Reasons and Motives to move the present powers to grant us such a Committee. 1. Reason. THis, and this onely, is the means to ease the peo∣ples burthens, and to satisfie their mindes, whereby their hearts may be united in love one to another, and to the present Government; for how can the people think that you do fulfill the end for which God hath set you over them, whilest they do see themselves so abominably cheated in every corner of the Commonwealth, and vast sums of money conveyed out of the Common-wealth, and can have no redress for it? 2. Reas. How can you think the wrath of God can bee ap∣peased towards this nation, whilest the blood of above a hun∣dred thousand protestants, who were masscred in cool blood, is unexpiated, and those that had a hand in bringing it upon us, were advanced for their so doing, and are in Government amongst us, though it was discovered time enough to have had it prevented, and so to have prevented all the wars and miseries that hath since fallen upon these three Nations? In this lyeth the core of Englands sore, and untill it be drawn out, it is im∣possible that this Nation can be cured. 3. Reas. How do you think that God can bless you, by making the people to love and honor you, whilst you do suffer them to be destroyed by that abominable cheat of the corrupt practice of the Law, and suffer them to be arrested and laid in prison for ma∣ny thousands, when there is not one penny due, and the greatest part of the burthen o doth light upon the cordil friends of the Commonwealth, and suffer thousands of widows and father∣less to be destroyed in their Estates by the Gentlemen of the long Robe, and by unjust sentences in the Courts, and no mans car is open to hear their cries: Assuredly, if the Scriptures be true, and if God be just, (as he cannot be otherwise) then he will con∣tinue shaking and overturning all the power of this Nation, un∣till these things be remedied; therefore  beseech your Highness o take these things into your serious consideration, & give your
soul no rest until these things be reformed, for God hath pi∣sed that for the sighing of the poor and needy,  wil arise, ad I am confident that there never was so much sighing and crying of the poor and needy unto the Almighty in any age in the world, as there is at this day. Some may object and say, that I am mis∣takes, & that there can be no such discoveries made out, because there hath been several Committees appointed, and little or no∣thing could be made to appear. To which I answer. 1. That the Popish Anichristian party had so interwoven them∣selves into the powers of this Nation, that they would not have any to be impowerd that would suffer any such thing to be done, for fear left they themselves (or their friends) should tast of the lash, and it is a thing impossible to perswade blinde men to see, and who is so blinde as they that will not see? 2. I answer, that I have held correspondency with many intelli∣gible persons from all corners of this Commonwealth, who will make it good, and I am confident that I can have hundreds of thousands that will ingage in it, and if it be not performed, let me die the death. 3. I do conceive that some in Authority may have some guilt of this kinde upon their cousciences, which may make them unwilling to grant us this power. To which I answer, that the granting of this power will be so acceptable to the people, that it will be look' upon as a sufficient means for whatsoever can be objected against any of them. 4. My Lord, either you or the corrupt practice of the Law must of necessity fall; therefore down with that abominable thing, and establish the Righteous and Mercifull LAW of our GOD, and then thou wilt be established in Righ∣teousness. And now honored Senators, if there be any love unto Jesus Christ in you, or any longing for his glorious appearing, then put on bowels of compassion towards the poor and miserable oppressed of this Nation; for whatsoever is done unto any of the Members of CHRIST, he taketh it as done unto him∣self: And I beseech you remember, that your own Posterities are concerned in it, and must ta of the Cup which you do provide. FINIS,
