His MAJESTIES Declaration To all His loving Subjects, of His true Inten∣tions in advancing lately to Brainford. THough Our Reputation be most dear to Us, and especially in those cases where∣in the truth of Our most solemn Profes∣sions (and by consequence of Our Chri∣stianity) is questioned, yet it is not onely for the Vindication of that, and to clear Our Self from such Aspersions, but withall to preserve Our Subjects in their just Esteem of, and Duty to Us, and from being engaged into Crimes and Dangers by those malicious reports, so spitefully framed and cunningly spread against Us concerning Our late ad∣vancing to Brainford, That We have resolved to publish this Our following Declaration. AT Colebrook, on Friday the 11th of November, We received a Petition from both Our Houses of Parliament, by the Earl of Northumberland, the Earl of Pembrooke and
Montgomerie, the Lord Wenman, Master Perpoint, and Sir John Hippisly:And indeed We were well pleased to see it so much liker to a Petition, then the other Papers We had of∣ten of late received under that Name, and returned to it the next day so gracious an Answer, that We assure Our selves could not but be very satisfactory to all that were truly lovers of Peace. The copies of both do here follow. To the Kings most Excellent Majestie, The humble Petition of the Lords and Commons now assembled in Parliament. WE Your Majesties most loyall Subjects the Lords and Commons in Parliament assembled, being affected with a deep and piercing sense of the miseries of this Kingdom, and of the dangers to Your Majesties Person, as the present Affairs now stand, and much quickned therein with the sad consideration of the great effusion of Blood at the late Battell, and of the losse of so many eminent Persons: And further, weighing the addition of losse, misery, and danger to Your Majestie and Your Kingdom, which must ensue, if both Armies should again joyn in another Battell, as without Gods especiall Blessing, and Your Majesties concurrence with Your Houses of Parlia∣ment, will not probably be avoided.
We cannot but beleeve, that a sutable Impression of ten∣dernesse and compassion is wrought in Your Majesties Royall Heart; being Your Self an eye-witnesse of the bloody and sorrowfull destruction of so many of YourSubjects; And that Your Majestie doth apprehend what diminution of Your own Power and Greatnesse will fol∣low, and that all Your Kingdoms will thereby be so weak∣ned, as to become subject to the attempts of any ill-affe∣cted to this State. In all which respects, we assure our selves that Your Majestie will be inclined graciously to accept this our humble Petition, that the misery and deso∣lation of this Kingdom may be speedily removed and pre∣vented. For the effecting whereof, we most humbly be∣seech Your Majestie to appoint some convenient place, not far from the City of London, where Your Majestie will be pleased to reside, untill Committees of both Houses of Parliament may attend Your Majestie with some Propo∣sitions for the removall of these bloody Distempers and Distractions, and setling the State of the Kingdom, in such a manner, as may conduce to The preservation of Gods true Religion; Your Majesties Honour, Safety and Prosperity; and to The Peace, Comfort, and Security of all Your People. His Majesties Answer to the aforesaid Petition.
WE take God to witnesse how deeply We are af∣fected with the miseries of this Kingdom, which heretofore We have stroven, as much as in Us lay, to prevent; it being sufficiently known to all the world, That as We were not the first that took up Arms, so We have shewed Our rea∣dinesse of Composing all things in a fair way by Our seve∣rall offers of Treaty, and shall be glad now at length to finde any such inclinations in others: The same tender∣nesse to avoid the Destruction of Our Subjects (whom We know to be Our greatest strength) which would al∣wayesmake Our greatest Victories bitter to Us, shall make Us willingly hearken to such Propositions whereby these bloody distempers may be stopped, and the great distra∣ctions of this Kingdom setled, to Gods glory, Our Ho∣nour, and the welfare and flourishing of Our People; And to that end shall reside at Our own Castle at VVindsore (if the Forces there shall be removed) till Committees may have time to attend Us with the same (which, to pre∣vent the Inconveniencies that will intervene, We wish may be hastned) and shall be ready there (or if that be refu∣sed Us) at any place where We shall be, to receive such Propositions as aforesaid, from both Our Houses of Par∣liament. Do you your duty; We will not be wanting to Ours; God of his mercy give a Blessing. BUt the same night after the Messengers were gone, certain information was brought unto Vs, That the same day the Earl of Essex had drawn his forces with great store of Ordnance out of London towards Vs, upon which a Councell of War being present, and We having there considered, upon debate, Our present Condition, That being already almost surrounded by his forces, some at Windsore, some at Kingstone, and some at Acton, If We
ered the re∣mainder to possesse Brainford, We should be totally hemmed in, and Our Army deprived of all conveni∣ence of either moving or subsisting. Yet how necessary soever it appeared, We could not obtain Our own consent to advance towards Brainford, and either pre∣possesse it, or dispossesse them of it, till We had satisfied Our selves that it was as lawfull as necessary, and fully weighed all, that not onely reason, but malice itself (which We knew to be very watchfull upon Our Actions) could object against it. We considered first that it could not reasonably be esteemed an aversion from Peace, and an intention to interrupt the Trea∣ty then in expectation; Since on the other side We had cause to beleeve by the former rejection of Our offers of Treaty, when We were supposed to be in no condition of strength, That if We would not thus preserve Our Selves from being so encompassed as to come into their Powers, the very possibility of a Treaty would immediately vanish. We considered next, that much lesse could it be interpreted any breach of Faith, since willingnesse to receive Propo∣sitions of Treaty was never held to amount to a suspension of Arms; Since otherwise We must (be∣cause mention of a Treaty had been once made) by the same Logick have been bound not to hinder them to encompasse Vs on all parts to Colebrook Towns end; Since no word to that purpose (of any suspensi∣on) was in Our Answer; Nay, since in that (by wish∣ing their Propositions might be hastned, to prevent the inconveniences which would intervene) We im∣plyed, that by this Arms were not suspended; And since their own Votes of proceeding vigorously, not∣withstanding the Petition, and their own actions, in sending after their Messengers great store of forces with Ordnance so neer to Vs (having before girt Vs in on all other parts, and sent men and Ordnance to Kingstone after the safe conduct asked of Vs) implied the same.
Being resolved upon these Reasons, That this ad∣vancing was necessary and just, We were not yet sa∣tisfiedtill We had endeavoured the same day (though the interruptions of shooting stopt up the way till the next) to satisfie Our Parliament and People of the same, and that Peace was still Our desire, We to that end directed a Message by John White Esquire, which was so received, that his danger of being put to death for bringing it, and the imprisonment of him and the Trumpeter that went with him in the Gatehouse, shewed that the very Law of Nations was by some no more considered then all other Laws had been before. A Copy of which Message hereafter follows, to shew how little temptation the matter of that gave them for such an usage. His MAJESTIES Message of the 12. of NOVEMBER.
WHereas the last night, being the eleventh of November, after the departure of the Com∣mittee of both Our Houses, with Our graci∣ous Answer to their Petition, We received certain Information, (having till then heard nothing of it, either from the Houses Committee or otherwise) That the Lord of Essex had drawn his Forces out of London towards Us, which hath necessita∣ted Our sudden Resolution to march with Our Forces to Brainford; We have thought hereby fit to signifie to both Our Houses of Parliament, That We are no lesse-desirous of the Peace of the Kingdom, then We exprest in Our aforesaid Answer; The Propositions for which We shall willingly receive where ever We are, And desire (ifit may be) to receive them at Brainford this night, or ear∣ly to morrow morning; That all possible speed may be made in so good a work, and all inconveniencies, other∣wise likely to intervene, may be avoided. ANd to justifie yet further, that Our intention was no other then was here profest, assoon as We were informed that the Earl of Essex his Forces were departed from Kingstone, before any appearance or notice of further Forces from London, (Our end of not being inclosed being obtained) We gave or∣ders to quit Brainford, and to march away, and pos∣sesse that place.
We cannot but make one Argument more of the truth of Our Profession, that this was all Our end, and that We had not the least thought, by so ad∣vancing, to surprise and sack London, (which the ma∣lignant Party would infuse into that Our City) And that is, That probably God Almighty would not have given such a Blessing to Our journey, as to have assisted Vs so both by Land and Water, as with lesse then a third part of Our Foot, and with the losse but of ten men, to beat two of their best Regiments out of both Brainfords, for all the great advantage of their works in them, to kill him who commanded in chief, and kill and drown many others, To take five hundred Prisoners, more Arms, eleven Colours, and good store of Ammunition, fifteen pieces of Ord∣nance, (whereof We sunk most that We brought not away) and then unfought with, and unoffered at, neerer then by Ordnance, to march away, notwith∣standing the great disadvantage of Our Forces bythe difficulties of the Passages, if He, who is the Searcher of all hearts, and Truth it self, had not known the truth of Our Professions, and the inno∣cencie of Our heart, and how far We were from de∣serving those horrid Accusations of Falshood, and Treachery cast so point blank upon Our own Per∣son, that it would amase any man to see them suffer∣ed to be printed in Our City of London, if any thing of that kinde could be a wonder, after so many of the same, and how really they desire Accommodation, who upon this have Voted they will have none. These Our Reasons for this Action, This Our satisfaction sent for it, and this Blessing of Gods up∣on it, will (We doubt not) cleer Vs to all indifferent persons both of the Iesuiticall Counsells, and the personall Treachery to which some have presumed so impudently to impute it; And God so blesse Our future Actions, as We have deli∣vered the truth of this.
The Answer of both HOUSES of PARLIAMENT, To His MAjESTIES Message of the twelfth of November. TO Your Majesties Message of the twelfth of this Moneth of November, We the Lords and Commons in Parliament do make this humble Answer; That this Message was not delivered to us till Monday the 14th. We thought it a strange Introduction to Peace, that Your Majesty should send Your Army to beat us out of our Quarters at Brainford, and then appoint that place to receive our Propositions, which, yet it plainly appears, Your Majestie intended not to receive, till You had first tryed, whether You could break thorow the Ar∣my raised for the defence of this Kingdome and Parlia∣ment, and take the City being unprovided and secure in expectation of a fair Treaty made to secure the City. If herein Your Majesty had prevailed, after You had de∣stroyed the Army, and mastered the City, it is easie to imagine what a miserable Peace we should have had, and whether those courses be sutable to the expressions Your Majestie is pleased to make in Your Answer to our Pe∣tition, of Your earnestnesse to avoid any further effusion of blood, let God and the world judge.
As for our Proceedings, they have in all things been an∣swerable to our Professions: we gave directions to the Earl of Essex to draw the Army under his Command out of the City and Suburbs, before we sent any Message to Your Majesty: So that part of it was inquartered at Brain∣ford before the Committee returned with Your Answer. And immediatly upon the receit thereof, that very mor∣ning Order was taken that the Souldiers should exercise no act of hostility against any of Your Majesties people. We sent a letter by Sir Peter Killigrew to know Your Ma∣jesties pleasure whether you intended the like forbear∣ance of hostility. But the fury of Your Souldiers, thir∣sting after blood and spoil, prevented the delive∣ry of the letter. For coming upon Saturday in his way towards Your Majestie as far as Brainford, he found them in fight there, and could passe no further. God who sees our innocencie, and that we have no aims, but at his glory, and the publike good, will (we hope) free Your Majestie from those destructive Counsels who labour to maintain their own power by blood and rapine, and blesse our endeavours, who seek nothing, but to procure and establish the Honour, Peace and Safety of Your Ma∣jestie and Kingdoms, upon the sure foundation of Reli∣gion and Justice.
To the Answer of both HOUSES of Parliament to His MAjESTIES Message of the twelfth of November, His MAjESTIE makes this REPLY. THat His Message of the twelfth, though not received by them till the 14th, was sent to them first upon the same day upon which it was dated, and, meeting with stops by the way, was again sent upon the thirteenth, and taken upon that day at ten in the morning by the Earl of
Essex, and though not to him directed, was by him opened, so the slownesse of the Delivery is not so strange as the stop of the Letter said to be sent by Sir Peter Killigrew, which His Majestie hath not yet received, but concludes from the matter expressed to have been contained in that Letter (to wit, to know His Pleasure, whether He in∣tended the forbearance of Hostility) and by the Com∣mand of such forbearance said to be sent to the Lord of Essex his Army, that no such forbearance was already concluded, and consequently neither had His Majestie cause to suppose, that He should take any of their Forces unprovided and secure in expe∣ctation of a fair Treaty, neither could any HostileAct of His Majesties Forces have been a course un∣sutable to His expressions, much lesse could an endea∣vour to prepossesse (for so He hoped He might have done) that Place, which might have stopt the fur∣ther March of those Forces towards Him (which, for ought appeared to Him, might as well have been intended to Colebrook as to Brainford) and by that the further effusion of blood, deserve that style. His Majestie further conceives, That the printing so out of time of such a Declaration, as their Re∣ply to His Answer to theirs of the sir and twentieth of May, but the day before they Voted the delivery of their Petition, and the March of the Earl of Es∣sex his Forces to Brainford so neer to His Majestie, when the Committee at the same time attended Him with a Petition for a Treaty, the Earle of Essex be∣ing before possest of all the other Avenues to his Army, by his Forces at Windsore, Acton, and Kingstone, was a more strange introduction to Peace, then for His Majestie not to suffer Himself to be coopt up on all sides, because a Treaty had been mention∣ed, which was so really and so much desired by His Majestie, that this Proceeding seems to Him pur∣posely by some intended to divert (which it could not do) that His Inclination. That His Majestie had no intention to master the City by so advancing, besides His Profession, which (how meanly soever they seem to value it) He con∣ceives a sufficient Argument (especially being on∣ly opposed by Suspicions and Surmises) may ap∣pear by His not pursuing His Victory at Brainford, but giving Orders to His Army to march away to
Kingstone as soon as He heard that place was quitted, before any notice or appearance of further Forces from London; Nor could He finde a better way to satisfie them before hand, that He had no such inten∣tion, but that His desire of Peace, and of Propositi∣ons that might conduce to it, still continued, then by that Message of the twelfth, for which care of His He was requited by such a Reception of His Message and Messenger, as was contrary at once both to Du∣tie, Civilitie, and the very Customs, and Law of War, and Nations, and such as theirs (though after this Provocation) hath not found from Him.
His Majestie wonders that His Souldiers should be charged with thirsting after Blood, who took above five hundred Prisoners in the very heat of the fight, His Majestie having since dismissed all the common Souldiers, and entertained such as were willing to serve Him, and required onely from the rest an Oath not to serve against Him: And His Majestie supposes such most apt and likely to main∣tain their Power by Blood and Rapine, who have onely got it by Oppression and Injustice; That His is vested in Him by the Law, and by that onely (if the destructive Counsels of others would not hinder such a Peace, in which that might once again be the Vni∣versall Rule, and in which Religion and Iustice can onely flourish) He desires to maintain it. And if Peace were equally desired by them, as it is by His Majestie, He conceives it would have been proper to have sent him such a Paper as should have con∣tained just Propositions of Peace, and not an unjust Accusation of His Counsels, Proceedings and Per∣son.And His Majestie intends to march to such a distance from His City of London, as may take away all pretence of apprehension from His Army, that might hinder them in all security from yet preparing them to present to Him, and there will be ready ei∣ther to receive them, or to end the pressures, and miseries, which His Subjects to His great grief suffer through this War, by a present Battell. FINIS.
