The Royal Recreation; Or, A Second Part, Containing the Passages between the Farmer and his Wife at their Return home, where they found the King with his noble Retinue. Tune of Let Caesar live long. Licensed according to Order. THe most Royal Frollick of William our King, Is put into Metre for Subjects to sing, Concerning his feasting at the Farmer's, where He fed upon honest good Country Fare; Now the Second Part here is Printed to show, What past when the Farmer he home ward did go. He then having been at a Country Town, To see Great K. William, of Fame and Renown; But finding at length that he came not that way, The Farmer resolved no longer to stay, Yet with his kind Wife he did home ward repair; But little he thought that K. William was there. As soon as the King with his Nobles had din'd, The Farmer returning, and happen'd to find Three Gallant fine Coaches before his own door, The like which he never had seen there before; As soon as this Wonderful sight he beheld, Good Man he was streight with astonishment fill'd. The Farmer was troubled and trembled for fear, He knew not what Course in the World for to Stear; Concluding some Robbers had rifled his Farm: 'Tush, quoth the good Woman, I fear no such harm; Sweet Husband then be of good Courage, said she, I'll tell you in short what I think it may be. that our Daughter is youthful and fair, her for sweet Beauty there's few can compare; Some Gallant is come for to Court her this day, As knowing that we were both out of the way, And if he should come with an honest intent I hope, my good Man, you will give your consent. Alas! my sweet Honey, the Farmer reply'd, If any young Noble would make her his Bride, And I were unwilling to yield to the same, The World would conclude I were highly to blame; My Heart would be joyfu that Wedding to see, Which makes her a Lady in e'ery degree. While they were disputing a Neighbour came by, Who unto the Farmer did presently cry, You have Royal Guest at your Table this day, K. William with Nobles both Gallant and Gay: This daunted the Farmer and his Wife also, That into the House they were fearful to go. Then come forth K. William and his Royal Train, In order to pass on their Journey again; And the Farmer's Daughter did wait on their side, Oh! here is my Father and Mother she cry'd: Our Monarch then smiling, commanded that they Should both be brought into his Presence, straightway. He did them he chearful and void of all fear, Rewarding them too for their Country chear, Which pleased his Nobles, as Fame do's report, Beyond all the dainty choice Dishes at Court; And taking his leave of the Farmer that day K. William for London straight posted away. The jolly old Farmer was pleas'd at the Heart. That Fortune to him would such Favours impart, While he went to meet the King seven long mile, His Majesty came for to see him the while And likewise was pleased to dine at his Board, VVith such wholsome Food as his Farm would afford.
