Question. What learne you in the second part? Answere. First, in that hee is called Iesus, I learne, that he is theMath. 1.21. sauiour, to saue his people from their sinnes. Second∣ly, in that he is called Christ which is annoynted, he is aDan. 7.14. luk. 1.33. king to raigne o∣uer
his Church for euer, and aDeu. 18.15. act 3.22. Pro∣phet to teach his fathers will perfectly. And a Priest to offer him selfePsa. 110.4. heb. 1.3. & 9 14. in sacrifice, for the sinnes of the people. The which were figured by the an∣noynting of Kinges, Prophetes and Priestes vnder the law. Thirdly, when I acknowledge him to be the onely sonne of God: I learn that hee isEsay. 9.6. rom. 9.5. phil. 2.6. God equall with the father from euerlasting: and therefore ableIohn. 3.16. heb. 9.14.28 & 10.12.13. to beare what so euer was due for our sinnes, and of power to saue those that trust in him.

Sixtly, when it is said, he suffered vnder Poncious Pilate, was crucifi∣ed, deade and buried, and descended in∣to hell: I learne that our Lorde and sauiour, willingly, tooke vpon himselfe our sinnes and became aGalat. 3.13. cursse for vs, that we by him might be deliuered from the cursse due to vs for sin. He also suffered a most shameful death and condemnation before men: to de∣liuerRom. 4.25. & 5.6.10. & 8.1. vs from death and condemna∣tion before God. He hath bene made a2. Cor. 5.21. sacrifice for sin: that through him we might bee made righteous before God. And hath by vertue of his death destroyed theRom. 6.11. 1. Pet. 4.1. power of sinne in his members. And he was buried for a confirma∣tion of the trueth of his death.

saluation. In that Christ rose againe the third day from the dead. First I learne that he hath1. Cor. 15.57. rom. 4.25. ouercome death and hell for my iustification. Secondly, I learne to rise from sin,Rom. 6.4. col. 3.1. to follow righteousnesse. Thirdly, by the resurrection of christ we haue a gage and testimony of our resurrection, that we shal1. Cor. 15.16 rise again at the last day. In that he is ascended, into heauen: I learne that his ascention is a pledge to vs, that we shal ascendIohn. 14.3. after him thither where he is. And in that he sitteth at the right hand of God. I learne that al power is giuen vnto him in heaueu and earth, and that he alMat. 28.18. ephe. 1.20. creatures subiect vnto him, & that heRom. 8.32. maketh intercession for vs. In that which he sayde: that Christ shal come to iudge the quicke and dead. First, I learn, that he whichIob. 19.25. math. 19.28. shal be iudge is our sauiour: and therefore his comming shal be for our saluation. Secondly, to the2.

Cor. 12. eph. 4.13. communion and fellowship of Saintes, and true faithful people: all which the Lord2. Tim. 2.19. knoweth to be his,
of which number, I beleeue my selfe to be one. Question. What difference is there betweene the inuisible Church and the visible? Answere. The inuisible Church comprehen∣deth all the electe of God from the be∣ginning of the worlds vnto the ende thereof.

Now the markes to know the visible Church are, the trueMath. 28.19. preaching of the Gospel or worde of God, the right administration of the1. Cor. 11.23. sacraments,2. Cor. .5. and discipline. In these wordes the forgiuenesse of sinnes: I learne, that both I my selfe,1. Iohn. 1.7. reui. 1.6. and al that truely beleeue in Iesus Christ, are so washed and clensed from their sinnes, and haue them so forgi∣uen in Christ, that they shallIete. 31.31. heb. 8.12. neuer be layd vnto their charge.
