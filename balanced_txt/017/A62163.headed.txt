THE EPISTLE TO THE READER. Reader, I Shall here present you with a mournful Account of the afflicted State of Hungaria, Austria, and other Christian Countries, now groaning under the Oppression of the Turkish Sword, for at this time (as it has been always observed, and indeed the only Policy by which the Ottoman Empire has arrived to its Extent and Greatness) the present Emperour Ma∣homet Han, the Fourteenth Monarch of the Turks, moved thereto for vain∣glory,
and to get him a Name equal to that of his Ancestors; an Ambition much sought by the Turkish Monarchs) taking the advantage of the Christians Divisions amongst themselves, (a thing alwayes fatal to Christendom, and a furtherance to the Ottoman Affairs, as giving their Arms a more easie pro∣gress, which Division the Turks im∣pute to proceed from the Effects of their Prayers to their Impostor Mahomet, whom they stile their Intercessor) has for some years past wounded deep the Roman Empire, now grown weak by the many streams of Blood drawn by Civil Broils, and bandying against its powerful Christian Neighbours; in∣somuch that at this day those barbarous Infidels triumph and revel, not only in the Cities of Hungary and Crotia, but even in the chief Cities of Austria, the only Bulwark of the Empire; to defend which, in former times, some Millions of Lives have been lost. And
thus far have they advanced without any colour or warrant for their pro∣ceedings, more than a pretence of Pie∣ty, to assist the rebellious Hungars, un∣der the Leading of their obstinate and turbulent General, Count Tecke∣ly, a man whom no Favours, Con∣cessions, or Indulgences of his Law∣ful and Natural Prince can prevail upon, or work to a Submission or Re∣conciliation; but desirous of that pe∣stilent Bain, Greatness, rather than go without it, he, with an unrelenting heart, dares wade to it through the Bowels of his bleeding Countrey, and help the Infidels in their Cruelty; though most are of opinion, and not without good grounds, that the Turk, having obtained his Ends, and glut∣ted himself with the Treason, the Traytor will be of no farther use, and if suffered to live, it will be past doubt in Confinement: for 'tis a true Max∣im in Potentates, They love the Trea∣son,
but the Traytor they hate. And now, since upon the great Events of this War the Eyes of all men are fix∣ed, (for indeed it concerns the whole Christian World) I have thought fit, for the better Information and Sa∣tisfaction of my Countrey-men, to give an impartial account of the Trans∣actions and Events of the disastrous War, whose End is yet uncertain; for if the Infidels, now powerful in the Field, and strongly ingarrisoned in many commanding Cities, have not a stop put to their Incroachment by the speedy uniting and combination of the Christian Princes, or from the imme∣diate hand of Heaven, the German Empire will run a hazard to be great∣ly shattered and disinembred, if not totally lost, which Heaven prevent. And certainly, the miserable slaugh∣ters and captivities already made, ought to incline the most ambitious Prince, if not for his Neighbour's
sake, yet for his own, and his Coun∣treys Preservation, and by timely op∣posing the Torrent, damm up that Stream, that with impetuous Vio∣lence seeks to overflow all before it, and be a warning to other Christi∣an Nations, of what they must ex∣pect, if the Infidels are permitted to proceed, and uncontrouled, in a man∣ner, wade through Blood and Slaugh∣ter, destroying with Fire and Sword all pleasant Places as they pass, glory∣ing in nothing more than to trample under foot, and tread upon the Necks of the distressed Christians; whom, like a Flock of Sheep, they drive be∣fore them like Wretches destined for slaughter, or perpetual Bondage, at the pleasure of the Tyrant. But to come nearer to my purpose; Reader, I shall in this Tract pre∣sent you with the Series of the War, as it has been transacted, either in
Battels, Skirmishes, burning of Towns and Villages, Sieges, Ravages, taking of Prisoners, Contributions, and Ex∣actions, the numbers of the slain, as they occur, and divers other Matters, but more especially the Siege of the great City of Vienna, so long the Im∣perial Seat of the German Empire, and chief City of Austria, relating ex∣actly, as it has come to my hand, the divers passages happening during the said Siege. Lastly, I shall present you with a brief Compendium of Turkish Cruel∣ties both in Peace and War, to such Christians as they carry into misera∣ble Bondage; and many other things which I here for brevities sake omit to mention; but shall at large in the following History expose to view. And so with my hearty Prayers to Al∣mighty God to put a stop to the pro∣gress of this Tyrant, by sending a
Spirit of Ʋnity and Concord amongst the Christian Princes, that all as one man, they may unite their Forces for the preservation of what yet remains free in Christendom. Reader, I remain Yours to serve You, J. S.
The Cittie of Vienna Beseiged by the turkes with the forme of the battle between the Christian And turkes
THE STATE OF THE Present War Between the Turks and Imperials IN HƲNGARIA, AƲSTRIA, &c. THE Grand Seignior, having a long time sought for an opportunity to incroach upon Christendom, he, in order to effect the same, by sundry means tempted the Hungarian Male-contents, prone enough of them∣selves to take up Arms against their Law∣ful Sovereign, under the specious preten∣ces of Liberty of Conscience, free Exer∣cise in Religion, and casting off the Im∣perial
Jurisdiction, in renouncing Obe∣dience to the Emperour. And to carry on that Design, allured Teckely, their Ring-leader, with many specious Pre∣mises, to rise in Rebellion; who, ambi∣tious of Preferment and Advancement to the Title of Prince of Transylvania, or King of Hungaria, more than any motive to promote, preserve, or pro∣pagate the Reformed Religion, drawing after him a great number of his Follow∣ers, seized upon many Villages, and by Surprize, took some Fortresses in Crotia, and the Borders of Hungary on that side, which drew a great number of the dis∣affected to take part with him: So that he came formidable e're the News of the Rebellion had reached the Emperours Ears, being all along assisted under-hand by the Turks with Money and Muniti∣on, notwithstanding there was peace be∣tween the two Empires. But certain it is that, then acient saying is most apparent, viz. That the Turks never kept any League longer than it tends to their Ad∣vantage. To heighten the Design, whilst the Turks on the one part were casting in
Thoughts the future War, the Christi∣an Princes were as earnestly involved in a War amongst themselves, rather seek∣ing to destroy each other then mindful of the common Enemy, who all the while was undermining the Roman Empire; till at length his Imperial Majesty per∣ceiving the drift of the Ottoman Sultan, used his Diligence to frustrate his Design, first by immediately dispatching Orders to his Ambassador at the Port to complain of the Bassa's of Buda and Effen, for assist∣ing his Rebel-Subjects, and to desire that a right Understanding might be conti∣nued between the two Empires, and the Peace inviolably observed; and at the same time published divers Edicts or De∣clarations, expressing his Willingness to pardon the Rebeis if they would return to their former Obedience; as likewise, how ready he was to satisfie his Subjects of that his Hereditary Country of Hun∣garia in all their reasonable Demands, and would alow them a competent num∣ber of Churches, wherein they should have the free exercise of their Religion, with such Privileges as his Roman Catholick Subjects of that Kingdon injoyed. In
answer to the first he received many fair Promises, and from the Grand Visier, an assurance of an amicable Correspon∣dence, right Understanding, and an in∣violable League between the two Em∣pires; with a Promise, that no farther Assistance should be given to the Hunga∣rian Rebels; but, that if upon inquiry the Bassas, Sanzacks, or Governours of any Garrison in Hungaria, or on the Frontires, should understand or openly assist the Rebels, he or they should incur the Grand Seigniors high Displeasure, and consequently, be punished with Death; though at the same time the Bassa of Bu∣da had private orders from the Port to countenance the Rebels, and keep them in Heart till matters were Ripe for the Turkish Sword to put in. The effects of the second device, or intention of the Emperour to counter∣mine the Turk, succeeded no better, or in∣deed rather worse; for although some ho∣nest Persons, and many of the Hungarian Gentry, who had been unadvisedly drawn into the Rebellion, did embrace the Imperial Grace and Favour, laying down their Arms, and retiring to their
respective Habitations, yet Teckely and his followers, who had absolutely, as most imagine, determined to have no Peace (had the Emperour granted more than themselves demanded) held out to oppose, whom divers Troops were sent under the command of Count Caprara, and other Captains, to repress them, and another Edict published, to oblige them to come in, promising them a Pala∣tine of their own Nation; and that in case of Offices and Places of Trust, no di∣stinction should be made between his Subjects of either Religion. Upon these Proposals, the Turks fear∣ing the Male contents might come to the Emperours Propositions, and that by their disserting their Leaders, and laying down their Arms, might hinder their Designs, they resolved to be fishing whilst the Water was troubled; and thereupon began to take off the vizard and appear more openly to countenance the Rebelli∣on, the great Bassa sending Supplies of Men and Money to the Rebels frequent∣ly: and when a second complaint was made at the Port, by the Count Capra∣ra, the Imperial Ambassador there resi∣ding,
he found the face of Things chan∣ged, and War silently threatned. The Grand Seignior having throughout his Asian and African Territories caused Men to be raised, and summoned such as held Land of him to serve in the War, to repair with Horse and Arms to the gene∣ral Randezvous near Constantinople, hang∣ing out the Horse taile, thereby signify∣ing himself intended to take the Field. The Emperour, advised of these Pre∣parations, drew several Detachments out of his Army, incamped near the Rhine to have an Eye upon the French, who had possessed themselves of Strasburg, an Im∣perial free City: the Forces were sent un∣der the leading of the Count Staremberg to joyn Count Caprara; who with a Body of 7000 had secured the Passes of the Waag, and a Commission directed to the Pala∣tine to raise the Ban, and the Arrear Ban of the Kingdom, whilst the electoral Princes met at Oldenburg, to consult what measures were to be taken in order to the preservation of Hungaria, and quieting the Rebellion, being earnestly pressed thereto by his Imperial Majesty.
Things being at this pass, divers Skir∣mishes passed between Parties in Hun∣garia, with various Success, when as to strengthen himself, and the better to In∣gratiate with the Hungarians, he having married the Princess Ragozki, and recei∣ved a new supply from the Bassa or Offen, which Bassa with 15000 Turks had like∣wise took the Field; he drew down before Chaschaw, and, after six or seven days battering it, had it surrendred; the Gar∣rison being permitted to depart with Bag and Bagage; heightned with this Success, he brayed the Imperial General, being by his own Faction saluted King of Hun∣gary, and to secure his Wives Patrimo∣ny, put a strong Garrison into Mongasa, summoning the Hungarian Nobility and Gentry to attend him in Arms at a gene∣ral Randesvouz near Levents; but, they weighing their Duty & Allegiance to their Sovereign, few of them came; whereup∣on Parties were sent out to burn and plun∣der the Houses of divers of them, one of which Parties Count Strasoldo meeting with, utterly defeated them, killing six∣ty on the Place and taking 100 Prisoners.
During these Transactions, the Vizier Bassa having drawn 20000 Horse and Foot into the Field, besieged Zathmar; and Count Tekely sat down before Espe∣ries, which he upon the first Summons had surrendered into his Hands; and after that besieged Lewents: the Rumour of which did not a little alarm the Im∣perialists, when, the better to stay the Pro∣gress of the Enemy, and to prevent the Transylvanian Princes joyning with Tec∣kely, who for that purpose had muster∣ed 11000 Horse and Foot, the greatest part of them Tartars, who had a little be∣fore passed the Neister. The Imperial Troops in Moravia, Silesia, and Behemia, together with the Troops in the other Hereditary Countries of the Empire, mar∣ched to Wang to reinforce the Imperial Camp, upon which Teckely, doubting the Success of their Arms, sent his Depu∣ties to Count Caprara, to desire that he might send to the Emperour to treat about a Truce, and that in order thereto he might have Pasports of safe Conduct allowed him whom he should imploy in that Affair, the which, after some diffi∣culty, he obtained, and a Cessation for six
weeks was concluded; but, Teckely find∣ing the Power of the Turks increase, and having 1000 Janizaries allow'd him for the Guard of his Person, though at the same time there was an evil Understand∣ing between him and the Prince of Tran∣sylvania, the latter being jealous that the former would be by the Grand Seignior invested in his Principality. He, I say, notwithstanding, adventured to break the Truce e're it was half expir'd, by commit∣ting divers Hostilities, burning and de∣stroying many Villages; Then fetching a Compass about, he covered with his Army Villecke, whilst the Bassa of Buda besieged it with 25000 Turks and Tartars, which City made a long and brave Re∣sistance, but in the end, perceiving no releif at hand, and most of their Pro∣vision and Ammunition spent, they capi∣tulated with the besieged; the Souldiers and Townsmen doing it without the con∣sent of the Governour, and on the six∣teenth of September 1682 surrendred it into the hands of the Bassa, and all but the Governour suffered to March out with Bag and Bagage, the Governour by reason of his not consenting to sign the
Capitulation he was made a Prisoner of War. To this Town Teckely layed claim, alledging that the Grand Seignior had promised that such Places as were taken in Hungary during the War, should be furnished with Hungarian Garisons, which occasioned a sharp Contest between them; when, after divers considerations and de∣bates, wherein they appeared to be jea∣lous of each other, it was concluded, to end the debate, that the Place should be demolished, which with fire and blowing up was accordingly done, and all the Walls levelled with the Ground; at what time Lewents, a Place not tenable, being much consternated upon the near∣ness of so formidable an Army, was both by its Inhabitants and the Imperial Gari∣son abandoned, and thereupon possessed by the Enemy; and Count Caprara finding himself far inferiour in strength and number, raised his Camp near Atsol, and retired towards St. Croix, to joyn the Hungarian Palatine, who had drawn a considerable Body into the Field, and incamped near Torney. About which time advice came from the Count Ca∣prara,
to inform his Imperial Majesty, that in consideration Warradine and Rabb two of the strongest Pieces in Hun∣gary might be surrendered, the Grand Seignior would renew the League for the space of twenty Years, but this being look'd upon only as an Artifice to gain time, and that if the Turks possessed those important Places all the rest would be ea∣sily gotten, there was nothing farther ne∣gotiated as to that affair. Winter growing on, the Turks and Hungarian Rebels having seized themselvs of the Fortresses of Atsol, Neusol, Schmi∣nitz and Cremnitz, by a Command from the Vizier of Buda, abandoned them, as either not thinking them tenable, or that the charge in maintaining them would be greater then the advantage; yet e're they left them, they blew up the Works, broke down the Walls, and dismant∣led most of the Houses, carrying away divers Persons Prisoners to Buda, Grand Novagrade and other Garrisons adjacent. This being in general the State of Affairs, and of this War, Anno 1680, 1681 and 1682, I shall for the time en∣suing take a more exact Survey of par∣ticular Transactions.
The Emperour, finding by this time that there was no Faith amongst the In∣fidels, and little or none to be given to the fair pretences of his Rebels, who still pretended they took up Arms for the pre∣serving and maintaining their Religion and Liberties, which the Turksh Sultan assured them by his Bassas, should be both enjoy'd, if his and their Arms prevailed, and finding his own Forces too weak to oppose so great a Torrent as was flowing from all Parts of the Turkish Empire, against the Spring, he negotiated by his Ministers an offensive and defensive League with the King of Poland; which upon the first motion, found great oppo∣sition by the perverse Party, assembled in the Diet, who are ever desirous to keep peace with the Turks, by reason their Hereditary Estates lye on the Fron∣tiers, and are subject to be spoyl'd by the Turks Garrisons: but upon the arri∣val of Count Walstain, his Imperial Ma∣jesties Ambassador in that great Affair; they seemed more pliable, and gave or∣der for the Ambassador's reception in the most splendid manner, passing a Decree that 20000 Men should be instantly rais∣ed,
for the defence of the Kingdom; and that although the Diet should break up abruptly by reason of the Protestation of any of the Deputies, (which often happens, for if any of them protest against the proceedings, the Diet is dissolved, unless his Assent can within 24 hours be procur'd,) the said Decree should stand good. The Negotiation in the Polish Court going on succesfully, Count Teckely fell to his former Artifices, feigning himself desirous of nothing more than to come to a Peace with the Emperour, signifying by his Secretary to the Imperial Mini∣sters, that it had for some time past been his chiefest care and business to prolong the Truce, and perswade the Turks to a Compliance, and that in order thereto, he had written to the Grand Signior, insomuch that he hoped an Honourable Peace toight be on the part of the Em∣perour obtain'd. These overtures made many hope that himself would at least come in and accept the offered Grace, Pardon, and Favour of his Imperial Majesty, but such hopes soon after vanished, for Teckely perceiv∣ing
that a League would be concluded between the Emperour and King of Po∣land, having daily notice of the Advan∣ces towards it from such of his Faction as resided at the Polonian Court, he caused the Estates of Hungary, as many as were under the Jurisdiction of his Arms, to assemble at Caschaw, where they, to the number of six, met; and the end for which they were assembled openly decla∣red, which was in these or the like Words delivered by the Adjutant or Speaker; viz. Forasmuch as the said Count had, to the hazard of his Life and Fortune, adventured in all Dangers to maintain the War for the Protection and Preservation of their Religion and Li∣berties, and was ready at all times to spend his Life on that occasion, it there∣fore behoved them in Gratitude to con∣sider his Services past, and have in mind the prospect of what he might farther ad∣vantage them in, and that it was no time now to look back, seeing they had all so highly incurred the Emperour's Displea∣sure; or if they should, then they would break their Words with the Grand Seig∣nior, whose powerful Army would sud∣denly
be upon them, and that without a Head they could not subsist without Faction and Division amongst themselves; therefore if they made choice of one, they could not better do than to chuse the Count, a Man, as he said, not only of approved Valour and Conduct, but a Man approved of by the Grand Seignior, and beloved by the neighbouring Bassa's; insomuch that they need not fear the Emperour's Indignation, for that they should always have a power at hand able to repell his Forces; and as for their Liberties, Religion, and an easie Tri∣bute, they might assure themselves; the Grand Seignior, having solemnly vow∣ed not to alter any thing in the former two, nor suppress or be exacting in the latter, designing no more than a bare Acknowledgment of his Sovereignty for the two first Years. This Oration ended, many were sur∣prized, as not expecting any such matter, though divers of his Faction highly appro∣ved it; saying he ought and should be their Prince, and by Threats and Cla∣mors carried it, using divers Ceremonies to confirm him therein, and soon after,
he was saluted as such by the Bassa's, who sent to congratulate him: when proud of his unjust Title, he sent out Parties into divers part of the Kingdom to spoil and plunder such as were not consenting to his Promotion, or refus'd to acknowledg him in that capacity. By this time the Emperour had con∣cluded an Offensive and Defensive League with his Electoral Highness of Bavaria, by which the latter was to raise 10000 Men for the Service of the Em∣pire, the Charges after they are raised to be defrayed by the Emperour; and his Electoral Highness at his own Charge to maintain 3000 more in the Emperour's Service against the Turk in Hungary. Whilst Teckely and the Turks domi∣neer'd in Hungary, an Express arrived at Vienna, sent by the Count Caprara, the Emperours Ambassador, then residing at Adrianople, to aquaint his Majesty that he had held a Conference with the A∣ga of the Janizaries, the said Aga had demanded of him, whether the Empe∣rour his Master did accept of the Propo∣sals, that some time since had been made by the Grand Seignior, viz. That his Im∣perial
Majesty should yield to the Grand Seignior the Fortresses of Commo∣ra and Rabb, with the Islands of Schuts, Rabaw, and Setin, and that in considera∣tion thereof, the Grand Seignior would re∣new the Peace with his Imperial Majesty, and that He the said Count Caprara had returned for answer, that he had not re∣ceived any Instructions from his Impe∣rial Majesty relating to these Proposals, much less, Orders to agree to them. To which the proud Aga replied, That see∣ing these things could not be obtained by Treaty, nor they grant the Grand Seignior's Demands, he would proceed to obtain them by Fire and Sword; and thereupon ordering the Count to return to his Lodging, he went directly to the Grand Vizier, and inform'd him what an∣swer he had received to his Proposals, saying, that there were no hopes of ob∣taining their desires by Treaty. This ad∣vice being transmitted by the Vizier to the Grand Seignior, he in a great rage commanded the same afternoon the Horse tail to be hung out upon a Pole, which is an infallible token that the Grand Seig∣nior or the Grand Vizier intend to take the
Field, and, as it were, a tacit denuncia∣tion of War, being a memorandum of the Turks rudeness in their original. He like∣wise dispatched away Orders to the Tar∣tarian Kam, commanding him thereby to draw together his dispersed Forces, and with all the celerity imaginable march towards Hungaria, there to meet him up∣on his arrival. The like Orders he cau∣sed to be dispatched to the Vavods, or Princes of Valachia, Moldavia, and Tran∣sylvania, enjoyning also Count Teckely to be ready early in the Spring, with the greatest Power he could draw together; appointing the Aga of the Janizaries to march with the Avaunt guard of the Ar∣my, on the 28th of March, himself in∣tending with the Gross of his Army, by this time assembled out of Asia, Anatolia, Egypt the greater and lesser, out of Pelo∣ponnesus, Bosna, Bulgaria, Servia, Epirus, and other Countries under his subjecti∣on, to the number of 180000 Horse and Foot; and for his reception gave order for erecting a stately House at Belgrade. And the better to expose himself in his proper Colours, and appear a Turk, he caused this denuntiation of War, boast∣ing
and Biasphemous: A Copy of which I shall give you verbatim, as 'tis credibly related to be faithfully translated out of High Dutch, and intitled, A Declaration, or Denunciation of WAR; Which Sultan Mahomet the 4th; pre∣sent Emperour of the Turks, sent to the Emperour of Germany, dated March 25. 1683. from Adrianople, just as the Baron Saphonara, his Imperial Majestie's Mini∣ster, had his last Audience of the Prince Vizier, wherein the said Minister could not comply with the unreasonable De∣mands of the Turk; which caused the Grand Seignior to transmit the same to his Imperial Majesty. The Denunciation, &c. MAhomer the 4th. Son of Empe∣rours, and of the Famous and Renowned God, Emperour of the Turks, King of Greece, Macedonia, Molda∣via, Samaria, and Hegha, King of the
great and lesser Egypt, King of all the Inhabitants of the Earth, and Prince of the Earthly Paradice, ac∣knowledged Prince, and Son of Maho∣met, Preserver of the Cities of Hunga∣ria, Possessor of the Sepulchre of your God, Lord of all the Emperours of the World, from the rising of the Sun to the going down thereof, King of all Kings, Lord of the Tree of Life, Con∣querour of the Melonian Hegeley and the City of Prolenix, great Persecutor of the Christians, and all wicked Peo∣ple, Joy of the flourishing World, Com∣mander and Guardian of your cruci∣fied God, Lord of the Multitude of Heathens: We command you to greet the Emperour Leopold, in case he desire it, and you are a Friend to our Majesty, whose Power we will extend very far: You have for some time past acted to our prejudice, and viola∣ted Our Friendship, though We have not offended you by War or otherwise; You have taken Counsel and Advice with other Kings
and Princes how to shake off your yoak, in which you have proceeded very indis∣creetly, and thereby have exposed your Peo∣ple to fear and danger, who have nothing now to expect but Death, which you have brought upon your selves; for I declare I will make my self your Master, and pursue you from East to West, and extend my Ma∣jesty to the End of the World. In the pro∣cedure of all which, you shall find my Pow∣er exerted to your extreme Prejudice, and shall feel the dreadful Effects of my wrath. And since you have put your hopes and trust in the strength of some Towns and Ca∣stles, I have given command to overthrow them, and trample under my Horses Feet all that is delightful in your Eyes, leaving you no room hereafter to make Friendship with me, nor suffer you to keep any fortified Place wherein to put your trust, for I have resolved forthwith to destroy you and all your People, and to despoil you of the Ger∣man Empire, after my Will and Pleasure, leaving in the Empire a sad remembrance of my dreadful Sword; that it may pub∣lickly appear that I have established my Religion therein, and pursued your cruci∣fied God, whose wrath I fear not, nor his
coming to defend and deliver you out of my hands; but will condemn your Sacred Priests to the Plow, and suffer the Breasts of your Wives and Matrons to be sucked by Dogs and other Beasts. You will do well to forsake your Religion, or I will give order to consume you with Fire. This is enough to let you understand my Will, if you will be so wise as to know it. This vain-glorious and blasphemous belching against Heaven and Earth, did not at all terrifie his Imperial Majesty, as to his own particular, being a Prince of un∣daunted Courage, and unshaken Resolu∣tion, yet grieved, as indeed all Christi∣ans ought, and highly concerned to hear the Worlds Redeemer, in whose hands are all the corners of the Earth, who holds the Winds in the hollow of his Hands, and restrains the deep as with a Bridle, in whose Power is all the Breath of Life, and who can with a word dissolve all things into Chaos, reviled and blas∣phemed by this River Leviathan, this peice of dust and ashes, but man at most, and subject to all Infirmities; but when the Almighty designs to punish his peo∣ple,
it has been frequently observed that he raises up such like Instruments, yet when he has scourged them sufficiently casts the rod into the fire, as in this case may be expected, and is by Prophecies both sacred and moral foretold. His Imperial Majesty following the precedent of Hezekia King of Juda when Rabsheka in the like manner with blas∣phemies upbraided him with the want of Power in the God whom he served to deliver him out of the hands of his ma∣ster the King of Assyria, he first com∣mitted his cause to God and relied upon him for protection, causing publick Pray∣ers and Fasting to be observed, and then communicated the matter to the Electo∣ral Princes at Ratisbone, requiring them not to be wanting in their duty, to de∣fend the Empire; and above the rest pressed his Electoral Highness of Branden∣burg, as the best able, to send a consider∣able force into the field, sending to the Vice-roy of Crotia and Palatine of Hun∣gary to draw together what forces they could; from whom he received an an∣swer, that the Estates and Gentry of ei∣ther Countrey would raise so great a
Summ of money as should maintain 10000 in his Imperial service, with which the Emperor seemed highly plea∣sed; and having notice that Count Tec∣kely began to draw his Troops out of their Winter quarters, he dispatched three new raised Regiments of foot and one of Horse to joyn with his forces in Hungary, resolving to carry on the War on that side with all imaginable vigour. About this time notice was given that the Turks were building 50 Boats and small Vessels near Buda, and an 100 at Belgrade and Fffeck, to bridge over the Danube, and transport Provision and Am∣munition as occasion should require, and the Seignior Hossinon who was sent by his Imperial Majesty to treat with Count Teckly about a Cessation in order to a Peace, returned without being able to ef∣fect any thing, declaring that the said Count, upon an order received from the Grand Seignior, had not only broken off the Treaty, but was with all diligence rais∣ing what forces he could to prosecute the War, so that all hopes of accommo∣dation vanished, he expecting daily a great power of Turks and Tartars to joyn
him; to prevent which, Orders were given to break down the great Bridges over the Danube, and in their stead to bridge it with boats. Notwithstanding the preparations of Teckely to take the field, yet the better to excuse himself of his acting against the Emperor after so many Concessions and so much Grace offered, he, before the break∣ing up of the Diet at Caschaw made this Oration, viz. That what he had done was for the maintaining of their Liberties and Religions, and that he had under∣gone many dangers which he could not have borne out against so potent a Prince had he not been assisted by the Otta∣man forces, yet with the knowledge and approbation of the Vizier of Buda he had some time past made a Cessation with the Emperor, and ever since used his utmost endeavours to continue a Peace between him and the Grand Seignior. And that therein the Grand Seignior on his part had accepted his mediation, and that for compleating it he intended nothing more than to send Deputies to treat with such as his Imperial Majesty should ap∣point, as also to the Port to dispose the
Grand Seignior to a more ready compli∣ance, but that the Protestants ought to be restored to the Churches they have been dispossessed of, and the Estates must think of a way to raise 40000 Crowns, which according to a late treaty with the Grand Seignior are to be paid him annual∣ly by way of tribute; and to make pro∣vision for the Troops he should be ob∣liged to keep on foot, for the service of that Kingdom and do homage to him∣self as Prince of the upper Hungary, and for such as refused to submit thereto, it was best for them for their own Safety to retire out of the Countrey. Upon which most of the Nobility acknowledged him as Prince of upper Hungary; and to make himself the more absolute, he caused mony with his Effiges and Inscription to be coined, and pass as current through∣out that Territory, to which he lays claim, by the approbation and confirmation of the Bassa of Offen. Upon his acknowledgment Teckely sent his Ambassador to the Port, as he had be∣fore determined, and to accompany him the Estates chose for their Deputy the Seiur Szirmai, who had in his instru∣ctions
given him by the Estates, these words, viz That the Kingdom of Hunga∣ry, which had been reduced to a low and miserable Estate, was now, by the Blessing of God upon the Indefatigable endea∣vours of Count Teckely and by the favour and protection of the Port, happily re∣established; and withall commanded him to make a due acknowledgment thereof to the Grand Seignior and his Ministers. These proceedings greatly holding all men in suspence, the Swiss Cantons sent to the Emperor to offer him two thou∣sand men at their own charge, and upon his request gave him leave to levy forces at his own charge within their Territo∣ries, whilst frequent councils were held at Vienna, where the Emperor for the most part was present, for the management of the Summers War, all hopes of Cessation or Accomodation being laid aside; for by this time the Turks began to be abroad in considerable Bodies, a Party of which made a descent upon the Isle of Schuts, where they burnt a Village, killed about 30 persons, and carryed into miserable captivity about 100 more. The Turk resolved upon the war; yet
fearing the Emperour's conjunction with Poland, used many indeavours to avert the Diet of that Kingdom from consent∣ing thereto; and finding fair means would not work upon them, he sent a Chians, who on the 26 of March 1683, demanded passage through that King∣dom for 50000 Tartars, who, as he said, were on their march to attend the Grand Seignior upon his arrival in Hungary, threatning them both if they refuse or enter into Alliance with his Imperial Ma∣jesty, though the Diet gave small regard to what he delivered, resolving to pro∣ceed in complying with the demands of the Emperor, and to conclude the treaty with Count Walstin the Imperial Am∣bassador. Affairs thus standing, a misunder∣standing happened between Count Tecke∣ly and the Bassa of Buda, the latter in∣sisting to have a Gate of Caschaw de∣livered to such Jamzaries as he should send thither, as likewise to have the Go∣vernour of Villeck, whom the Count held prisoner since the taking of that place; both which Teckely refused: but in the end the difference was concluded,
which else might have redounded to the advantage of the Imperialists. The long expected Alliance with the Crown of Poland being fully agreed and concluded, the League offensive and de∣fensive was signed on the first of April 1683. by Count Walstin his Imperial Ma∣jesties Ambassador on the one part, and by the Commissioners of the Kingdom of Poland on the other; by which treaty the Emperor obliges himself to act with an Army of 60000 Horse and Foot a∣gainst the Turks, and the King of Poland is thereby obliged to have 40000 men in the field to assist the Emperor in the War, of which the Diet have approved, notwithstanding the Threats of the Chi∣ans, that the Tartars with a Body of 70000 men will fall into that King∣dom, and use there all manner of Ho∣stilities. The further particulars of this treaty are these, besides the forces aforesaid, either Potentare is obliged to have in the field, the Emperor is to pay the Polonian King in present Money Twelve Thousand Flor∣rins, and that his Imperial Majesty and the Queen Dowager of Poland,
do relinquish all pretensions of right they have or might have to the Crown of Poland, and that neither the Emperor nor King of Poland do enter into a treaty or conclude a Peace with the Grand Seignior without each others Approbation and Consent. The time for Action drawing nigh, a great Council of war was held at Vienna on the 9th of April 1683, in order to take such measures as might be advanta∣geous to the Empire in this Summers Campaign; upon whose sitting, the Mar∣grave of Baden, whom the Emperor had sent to take a view of Commora, Raab, the Isle of Schuts, and other places of impor∣tance, arrived and made his report, de∣claring in what condition the fortifica∣tions were, and in how good a posture of defence; after which the Council pro∣ceeded to appoint the place of Rendezvous for the Army to be at Presburg, and to ap∣prove of the Emperors choice in nomi∣nating the Duke of Lorrain Command∣er in chief of his Army, to be imploy∣ed against the Turks, and resolved that it was convenient and altogether neces∣sary that a Body of men should be kept in
pay in Crotia, under the command of the Viceroy, the better to secure those Coun∣tries, from the incursion of the Turks and Tartars, who were rallying on that side to burn and plunder. They further con∣cluded, that it was convenient that Ge∣neral Schuts should immediatly march with 7000 men to joyn with the Prince Lubomirski, who was advanced with 6000 Polish Horse for the service of the Emperor, and that the Hungarian Troops consisting of a body of 2500 Horse and Foot Joyning with them, should Act upon the Waag, to prevent the Turks and Rebels from joyning, and to hinder any Incursion that otherwise might be made. That another body of 6000 men should incamp on the Waag near Leopolstat, and in case they perceive the Turks to have a design up∣on that place, to put themselves into it: and besides this, it was further ordered, that ten or twelve thousand men should be posted upon the Frontiers of Morovia and Silesia to secure those Countries a∣gainst the incursion of the Turks. The Spring being now far advanced, Count Teckely impatient of longer lying
still, having drawn his Troops under the Walls of Caschaw, dispatcht a Messen∣ger to the Bassa of Buda for a supply of 5000 horse, that so he might invade the Country of Silecia; with which num∣ber he was supplied, and at the same time he sent his Mandates to the Nobility of the upper Hungary, to attend him in Armes as their Prince; but most of them sent their excuses, desiring him not to involve them in such Danger and Ha∣zard, but rather accept a Sum of Money in Lieu of their service, the which, of some he accepted, but of others refused, saying, they secretly envied his Advan∣tage, and held correspondency with the Imperialists, therefore he thought it not good to trust them out of his sight, threat∣ning them with Military Execution if they did not instantly repair to his Stan∣dard. The King of Poland being hastened by the Imperial Minister residing at his Court, upon the conclusion of the Of∣fensive and Defensive League, used such diligence in raising men for the Service of the War, and summoning the Ban and Arrear-ban of that Kingdom to at∣tend
him on the 20th of May, he mu∣stered an Army of 35000 men near Leo∣pol, with a design immediately to in∣vade Caminice, a strong Place taken from the Turks, who about two Years since surprized it, but at this time was diverted, upon notice that the Fore-run∣ners of the Turks Army were arrived at Belgrade, and that the Grand Vizier was but four days march behind, with a Bo∣dy of 60000 Men, and that 25000 Tar∣tars had passed the Neister; yet he sent to Count Teckely to acquaint him that he had made an Offensive and Defensive League with the Emperor, and to let him know, that unless he immediatly made his Peace with his Imperial Majesty, he should be obliged to treat him as his Ene∣my, to which the Count returned Answer, that he had used his endeavour at the Port for an Accommodation, but found the Grand Seignior altogether averse thereto; and that without his Consent he could not, neither would, enter upon any fur∣ther Treaty, or conclude a Peace, he having plighted his Faith to the contra∣ry: therefore if his Majesty of Poland did invade his Territories, he would do
his utmost to defend them, and oppose the Invader with all his Power; and thereupon gave Order for the passing six thousand Horse and Foot over the Da∣nube, to joyn a Body of Turks that wer eco∣ming down, who in Conjunction are to have an Eye upon that part of the upper Hungary, bordering on the Territories of the King of Poland, and sent out di∣vers Convoys to fetch in Corn and other Provision into his Camp, resolving to expect the coming of the Grand Vizier, whilst in the mean time the Palatine of Hungary and Vice-roy of Crotia, were drawing the Forces of those Countries in∣to a Body to joyn the Imperialists, who daily repaired to the place of Rendez vouz. These things passing, the Treaty be∣tween the Emperour and the Elector of Brandenburg, was pressed by the Impe∣rial Minister residing at that Court, with all earnestness, to which his Electoral Highness appeared no way averse, but desired time to consider what Methods he should take in order to his raising and maintaining such Forces as was on the part of the Emperour required, to
assist him in his Wars against the Turk, which gave all men hopes of what after ensued, viz. That an offensive and de∣fensie League would be the consequence of that Treaty. The 6th of May being come, his Im∣perial Majesty, accompanied with the Duke of Lorrain, the Elector of Bavaria, and other Princes of the Empire, came to Presburg, to take a view of the Army, and to see them drawn up into Battalia, and exercise in warlike Discipline: the List of which Forces, as it was published, running thus. According to the List taken by the Command of the Duke of Lorrain, the Emperour has in Pay twenty seven Re∣giments of Foot, making together 55700 Men whereof 25296 were at the general Rendezvouse near Presburg, 4692 in the upper Hungar, 2040 in Jabulunca on the Frontier of Hungary, 2040 at Leopolstade on the Waag, 364 in Austria, 2040 at Vienna, 13912 in the Empire, and 2040 in Bohemia. In the Emperour's Pay is likewise seventeen Regiments of Horse, amounting to 13600 Men, seven Regi∣ments of Dragoons, consisting of 5600
Men, and four Regiments of Croats consisting of 3200 Men, whereof 15200 are at the General Rendezvouz, 800 in the upper Hungary, 400 in Jabulunca, 2400 at Leopalstadt, 800 in Austria, and 2800 in the Empire. So that the ge∣neral List of Horse and Foot appears to be thus, at the gencral Rendezvouz 39696, in the Empire 16712, in the up∣per Hungary 7532, &c. in all making 78540 Men, Horse and Foot, not ac∣counting the Troops under the Com∣mand of the Palatine of Hungary, nor those commanded by the Vice-Roy of Crotia, nor the 600 Polish horse brought into the service of the Emperour by the Prince Lubomirski, over the Army in Hungary, or to Act there against the Turks, Tartars, and Rebells. The Emperour appointed the Duke of Lorrain Generalissimo, impowering him to Act as he saw occasion, for the ad∣vantage of the Empire, without expect∣ing any orders from Court, unless upon special occasion, declaring his resolution to carry on the War with all imagi∣nable vigout, hoping the Princes of the Empire and other Christian Princes,
would freely imbarque themselves in the Action, seeing it not only concerned the Empire, but indeed all Christendom; For that the Grand Seignior aided not his Rebels for pity sake, as he gave out, but took hold of the opportunity to in∣croach upon the Christian Princes, and if possible, to over-run all Christendom; which he hoped God would never per∣mit to fall into the hands of so cruel and unmerciful an Infidel. This discourse ended, the Emperour ad∣monished such chief Commanders as were present to play the man, saying, that he would be always ready to re∣ward the Valiant, and with the same Willingness punish the Coward. Aster which he rode about the Camp to take a view of the Order of his Men, and con∣fessed himself highly satisfied in their Promptness and Aptness to handle their Arms and manage them at all Points; and then having taken leave of the Duke, he returned to Vienna. About the latter end of April, the Grand Seignior set forth from Adrianople, in order to his being present at the Ran∣dezvouz to be holden for the Summers
Campaign near Belgrade; the manner of his setting forward and Attendance being thus First, his Tents or rich Pavillions were carried to the Place, where, the in∣suing Night, he designed to lodge, then went the Carriages with other Tents, for the Commanders and Souldiers; for note, that the Turks have always dou∣ble Tents, or twice so many as is needful to lodge in, the Reason being this; when the Tents are pitched in which they intend to incamp, the other Tents are carried and pitched a days Journey before; so that when they rise again, they, upon their Arrival at the place where they are to lodge, find their Tents ready, which is one great help to them in their swift Marches; but in case they are in an Enemies Country, and march but slowly, this Order is not obser∣ved. The first Day, the Army consisting of 180000 Men marched twenty five Tur∣kish miles, and at Night pitching their Tents, seemed rather a City than a Field Provision; for about the Tents of the Grand Seignior were those of the Bas∣sas
and great Commanders; next them, more outward, those of lesser rank, and so by degrees, according to their Quality or Merit in Arms. As for the Order of the Grand Seignior's March, it was thus; Before the Body of the Army went the Yeomen, a kind of Foot-men, much in the nature of Pioniers, who cleared the way, and levelled the ground for the bet∣ter and more convenient Passage of the Carriages, setting up heaps of Stones and other signs as marks, and setting Fire to divers Piles of Wood at the beginning of the Match; for observe, the Turks al∣ways (unless something extraordinary prevent it) begin their March at Mid∣night, and so continue to march till the Noon of the ensuing Day. Between two Bassas of his Council rode the Grand Seignior, with a short Turlipant, his Turbant set with Diamonds, and his Tunick or Vest studded o're with Ru∣bies, Emeralds, and Saphires, his Hor∣ses Bridle of Gold, and in his Fore-head a blazing Carbuncle, his Bridle bit Gold, and Stirrops of the same Mettal: before him marched the Janizaries, as likewise on either side, the foremost being on
Horseback bearing lighted torches, and the rest on Foot armed with Harquibusses and Pole-axes with very short Handles; but between them and the Grand Seig∣nior marched divers Captains, with Horsemens Maces to keep the Vulgar from gazing on the Emperour; and nearer to his Person marched a thousand of his Guards, called the Ich Oglians, or young Gentlemen brought up in the Se∣raglio, till such time they are fit for Ser∣vice, being before-hand instructed in all manner of Feats of War, as shooting the Harquibuss, casting Darts, using the Long-bow, tossing the Launce or Pike, using the Mace, and the like; and im∣mediately after him, within this Circle, marched divers of the Officers of the Seraglio, being for the most part Eunuchs, and in the midst of them a Chariot or close Litter, in which were the Women for the Grand Seignior's Use; and in each Wing of the Army, or Points of the Crescent, were divers other Chariots or Litters filled with Women, appertaining to the Bassas, or great Captains, not exceed∣ing twenty; for the most part their Wives, tho formerly no such thing was permitted.
These were inclosed with the divers Orders, as the Tamaru, which are Men on horseback, bearing Lances and Scemyters, who are at all times bound to serve in the Wars in lieu of certain Lands they hold of the Grand Seig∣nior throughout his dominion. The Accanzi, another sort of Horsemen, who are kept in continual Pay, and are reckoned, for horse, the chiefest strength of the Turkish Empire, as the Janizaries, who are composed of Chri∣stian tributary Children, are account∣ed its strength for Foot; and the As∣sapi, who are of small account, being the Refuse of the Empire, who serve only for Plunder, Marching on Foot, and are, for the most part, in Battels, thrust sorward as the forlorn hope, on no other account than to blunt the Enemies Swords; or in Seiges, driven upon the mouth of the murthering Cannons, to no other end than to fill up the Trenches and Ditches with their dead bodies, that so the Impe∣rious Janizaries may mount the ea∣sier on the Ramparts, or Walls of
the Place besieged: and these, for the most part, are the Sons of Turks. Af∣ter these marched the Camels, Mules, Dromedaries, and Sumpters, with all manner of provisions; as likewise, Taylors, Bakers, Butchers, Sutlers, and indeed, all men of Trades that can possibly depend upon an Army, or who by labour, or procuring Pro∣vision can be any ways serviceable: so that where ever the Tents are pitched all Trades pitch round about them; In so much that the Camp seems ra∣ther like a Mart or Fair than an ar∣med Host, with Banners. All the way they marched in the posture a∣foresaid, they kept deep silence, even to admiration, not offering to break Ranks, or, as little as possible, to in∣damage the Orchards, Fields, or Gardens, as they passed: and when they came to pitch as aforesaid, all of them, with a loud yell or singing tone, cryed, Allali, Allah, Allahu, which is thrice repeating, O God, &c. Thus the Army continued in its march till it came to the General
Rendesvouz, therefore the particulars of each days march I shall wave for brevities sake, and again by following the Turkish Army, return into Hunga∣ry, where great preparations, on all sides, were made for a vigorous prosecution of the War. The Tartars barbarous Troops beginning to ravage the Country near Caminice, Plundring, Burning, and ta∣king Captive all that came in their way, driving before them the wretched peo∣ple naked, and bound together with Cords in great droves: to oppose whom the Poloman King drew down fifteen thousand Horse and Foot, sending to the Cossacks to take the Field, and joyn him, promising them large Pay, and at the same time strictly com∣manding his Subjects not to have any intercourse with the Hungarian Re∣bells upon severe Penalties; and with∣all sent an Envoy to Count Teckely to move him with many pregnant rea∣sons and perswasive Arguments to a complyance and a submission to the proposals of his Imperial Majesty: but the said Envoy prevailed not with his perverse nature, but as it were rendred
him more haughty and obstinate, by supposing his Cessation would be pur∣chased at any rate; since Emperours and Kings, as it were, became so desirous of his Friendship. Things being brought to this pass, his Imperial Majesty continued to chear his Commanders and Souldiers with his Presence, and to give Orders for their taking the Field; where∣upon he, accompanied with the Arch Dutchess, and Elector of Bava∣ria, took another view of the Camp, lying near the Walls of Presburg, and was received with all Joy imaginable: the Army against his coming being drawn up into Batalia in two lines, at least an Hungarian Mile in length, and eighty peices of Cannon, Demy Can∣non, and Culvering placed at the Head of it, whereas about eleven of the Clock the Bishop of Strigonia sung Mass in a Tent for that purpose prepared, in which for the Emperour and Empress was a seat set, Canopied over with Cloath of Gold, another for the Arch Dutchess, and a third for the Elector of Bavaria and Duke of Lorain
the Mass ended, the Bishop came from under the Tent, and blessed the Army, whenas the Emperour mount∣ing on Horse-back, and being follow∣ed by the Empress, Arch-Dutchess, Elector of Bavaria, and divers others of the Nobility, he visited the Ranks, still encouraging, with his Presence and Speeches, the Souldiers and Com∣manders, to do their utmost against the common Enemy, and then return∣ed to a stately Tent, prepared by the Duke of Lorrain, in which the Empe∣rour, Empress, Arch-Duchess, Elector of Bavaria, Duke of Saxe Lawenburg, and Prince Louis of Baden, were splen∣didly entertained at Dinner: divers other Tables in Tents, spread for that purpose, being furnished for the other Nobility attending them; and in the mean time the whole tire of Artille∣ry was thrice discharged, and the whole Army, to which his Imperial Majesty, for the better encouragement of the Officers and Souldiers, gave a Months Pay, upon free gist, gave three Salvo's of small shot, and so his Impe∣rial
Majesty, with the rest of the Court, returned to Presburg, and from thence to Vienna, having given what neces∣sary Orders he conceived convenient; and amongst other things, that twelve half Cannon and eight great Mortar∣pieces should be taken out of the Arse∣nal, and sent to the Army, which had received a Command to march and oppose the Proceedings of Teckely, who by this time was very active on this side the Waag: the Imperial Army upon muster was found to a∣mount to 47000 men. Upon the remove of the Army, News came that a Croatian Souldier, having insinuated himself into great credit and confidence with the Turkish Governour of Ziget, had watched his opportunity to fire the Magazine of the Garrison, which was capable of main∣taining 30000 men for the space of two Years, and that being made Store∣house-keeper, in one part of the said Magazine he had set fire to it by a train, and blown up all, making his escape into Croatia whilst the consterna∣tion
lasted; and that by the fall of tim∣ber, and blow of Powder, not only most of the Houses were demolished, but Five Hundred Turks killed. The Turks by this time having drawn a Body of twenty five thousand men under the Walls of New-Husel, Major General Schutz, with a strong Party of Imperials, Hungarians, and Bohemians, was sent out to observe their motion: who, upon notice from the Countrey People thereabout, that a Party of Turkish forragers belonging to the said Garrison, were abroad, and had done great Mischief by burning Houses, driving away Cattel, and ta∣king Prisoners, and that they were up∣on their return with a considerable Booty, he taking Guides, marched cross the Countrey with a thousand Foot and five hundred Horse, found them encamped upon a great Plain near Tranchin, who little suspecting any of the Imperial Troops had pas∣sed the Waag, lay carelesly dispersed; insomuch that being furiously en∣countred, though they could not be
less in number than two thousand five hundred, yet they were put to flight and exceeding great slaughter; inso∣much that seven hundred fell by the Sword, and two hundred were drown∣ed in the River, divers Prisoners of note taken, and all the Booty recover∣ed, with the loss only of fifty Imperi∣als, twelve Hungarians, and amongst them one Captain, two Ensign-bearers, and a Major of Horse. The King of Poland perceiving the Tartarian Forces to increase, and upon his Frontiers commit divers Outrages, the better to inforce himself, thought not only fit at his proper Charge to raise two Regiments, one for the Queen, and the other for Prince Alexander, his eldest Son, but delivered out of the Treasury of his hereditary Estate a hundred thousand Crowns, towards the providing a greater Train of Artillery, and defraying the Charges of the War; with part of which he raised eight hun∣dred Hussars armed with Launces, and strictly to guard the Confines of Silesia, on which the Tartar Cham had a De∣sign
to make Descent, giving it out that he designed nothing more than to take the Spoil of that Province. By this time the Imperial Army was arrived at Ketser, and rising from thence, marched towards Raab, under the command of the Duke of Lorram, as Generalissimus, the Right Wing of Horse commanded by the Duke of Saxe-Lawenburg, and the Left by Count Caprara, Count Staremberg being Ge∣neral of the Foot, and so Marching along the Banks of the Waag, came and incamped between Raab and Com∣mora, to expect the motion of the Ene∣my; and there it was that the Duke had the first notice of the Grand Visi∣ers advancing with the gross of the Ot∣toman Army, as far as Greicks Wissen∣berg, and that the Grand Seignior with a greater Power followed by slow Marches, having vowed not to turn his back till he had besieged with his Army the City of Vienna, the principal Im∣perial Seat of Austria; upon notice of which the Duke of Lorrain again decamped, after he had sent the Count
Palfie to give the Emperour an ac∣count of the State of the War, re∣solving to be in Action, and there∣upon marched towards Gran, a strong Garrison of the Turks in Hungaria, with a design to besiege it; for that purpose having sent for divers other Mortars, Granadoes Bombes, and the like; they were sent up the River in Boats and arrived safely at the Camp. The Emperour finding the per∣verseness of the Hungarian Rebels, sent an express to the Palatine of that King∣dom, immediately to march with the Forces under his Command, not a∣mounting to above five thousand, with which he had been posted in the Isle of Schuts, to joyn Major General Schuts and the Prince Lubomirski, on the Waag, and there to act against Count Teckely, and such Forces as he had in the Field; who at that time besieged the Castle of Donowitz, but before they could draw together strong enough to raise the Siege, the said Castle was, after five weeks Siege, ta∣ken,
and the Baron Joannel, Go∣vernour thereof, made Prisoner; yet Teckely began to grow jealous of the Turks; who now having, by his Rebel∣lion, made way for their Arms, did not regard him as before; therefore, although the Bassa of Offen sent divers Summons to command him to joyn his Forces with the Body of Turks, in∣camped near new Husel, yet he de∣clined it, making divers excuses and desiring that he might act separate. That nothing might be wanting in the Emperour to prevent the mi∣series of War in the so long distract∣ed Kingdom of Hungary, but that those that had taken up Rebellious Arms against him might easily per∣ceive how willing he was for the sa∣ving the effusion of Christian Blood, to forget and forgive what was past, he again published a General Decla∣ration, promising thereby, as well to the Hungarians, as Germans, who had been or are in Rebellion against him, restitution of, Goods and Estates, if they lay down their Arms, and re∣turn
to their Obedience: upon which several Germans and some Hunga∣rians, who had deserted the Emperours Service, and taken part with Rebels, came in and submitted, who there∣upon were restored in Person, Goods and Estates; which did not a little alarm Count Teckely, by possessing him with a Fear that many of his Fol∣lowers might do the like; and there∣upon to prevent it, he again began a feigned Treaty with the Emperour; and the rather, for that he had no∣tice that the Czar of Muscovy earnestly desired to enter into the Treaty be∣tween the Emperour and King of Po∣land: yet he put a strong Garrison in∣to the Fortress of Donowitz, which is a Place of great Importance, and ca∣pable of puting all the Country under Contribution as far as Cracow. The Duke of Lorrain with the Impe∣rial Army being advanced within four Leagues of Gran, incamped there, to expect an Account in what posture the Enemies were; as not thinking it safe to besiege so Important a Place as
Gran, without good assurance: and there he received advice, that the Grand Visier and Aga of the Janiza∣ries were with all diligence forming the Body of their Army near Belgrave, whereupon he sent out two Parties, each consisting of four thousand Men, to observe their motion, he also re∣ceived advice that the Count Caprara, his Imperial Majesties Ambassador, who so long negotiated at the Port, was brought to Belgrave, under the charge of the Aga of Janizaries, and strictly guarded, not permitted to go abroad without especial Licence from the Grand Visier, and then not with∣out fifty Janizaries to attend him, to whom he is obliged to pay a daily Stipend. The Duke of Lorrain having learn∣ed the State of the Turkish Army, and sent out a Party who defeated eight hundred Turkish Horse that were ad∣vanced near his Camp to discover what they could, raised his Camp, and marched directly towards New∣husel, not thinking it safe to attempt
Gran, in which Garrison there was not computed to be less than eight thou∣sand Turks, and Hungarians: but re∣solving to be in action before the Bo∣dy of the Turkish Army could take the Field, although he had frequent advice that the Grand Visier sent out daily Detachments, and amongst the rest one very considerable, consisting of twenty thousand Men, to joyn the Bassa of Buda; he sat down before New-husel, the greatest part of whose Suburbs the Garrison had demolished and burnt, as not being Tenable, and retired into the City or upper Town, at what time the Country-People in the Turkish Territories near Commora and Raab, fearing the advance of the Turkish Army, retired with their Substance into those Impe∣rial Garrisons, to prevent the severe Treatments which they are wont to receive from the, Turks in times of War, and with all possible diligence the great Ordnance were conveyed to the Camp, whilst a Body of Men was forming at Presburg to re∣cruit
the Emperours Army if occasion required it, being composed of Mora∣vians, Bohemians, and Hungarians, and to prevent any Party that might be sent from the Enemies Camp falling upon his Out-guards, he sent a Detach∣ment of sour thousand Horse in two Parties to burn the Bridge of Essek; where, upon their Arrival, they found seven hundred Turks advantagiously posted, who at first made great shews to defend the said Bridge; but upon the first Discharge of four Field-pieces the Imperialists brought with them, the Turks in great Disorder retired, as al∣together despairing to defend it, yet not so swiftly, but being pursued, about a hundred of them were killed, and as many taken Prisoners; when after the Dispute, the Prisoners, to the number of two hundred, who for that purpose brought Saws, Axes, Sleds, and the like, broke the Bridge in pieces, and af∣terward burnt the greatest part, setting the rest a float down the River. By this time the Duke having in∣trenched and raised his Battery, play∣ed
furiously upon the Town with eight piece of Canon, carrying thirty six and forty pound Balls, and was answered in the same Language by the besieged, who made diverse Sal∣lies to hinder the advancement of the Lines and Works, wherein divers were killed on either side: for in the Town were, amongst others, a thousand Ja∣nizaries, two or three hundred of which were in every Sally that was made, for the space of four days, in which space six Sallies were made, though with the greatest disadvantage to the Turks, for the Imperialists keep∣ing in their Trenches, cut divers of the Enemies in pieces as they came to at∣tacque them. Upon notice of this Siege, the Bassa of Offen sent to the Duke to inform him, that the Grand Seignior and Count Teckely were resol∣ved to observe the Truce till it expi∣red; but he returned answer, that they had by divers Hostilities, as well the Turks as the Hungarian Rebells, broke the Truce, and that this offer he could conceive to no other end thn to pro∣tract
time till they could draw their Army into the field: therefore he found it absolutely necessary, since they had been the Aggressors, to make the best use of the present Juncture, to employ the Arms of the Empire to the best advantage, and that he could not hearken to the observing a Truce that the Enemy had so manifestly violated, but if he had any thing to offer in that Case, he must apply himself to the Emperour, and the Council of War, assembled to debate the reasonableness of such Matters: and with this An∣swer the Messenger being dispatched, he caused two pieces of Cannon, new∣ly arrived in the Camp, carrying Balls of fifty and sixty pound, to be bent against the Gate, looking towards Gran, and battering it with sixteen shot, beat in pieces the Iron Port-cullices and Ribs of Copper, but the besieged had countermured, or rather dammed it up, yet a furious assault was given, but without success; for the Imperialists were capable of entring, but with some loss obliged to retire, though divers
fresh Parties were commanded on: For the Turks from a Sally-Port, un∣discerned by the Christians, came down upon them in great numbers, yet they made good their ground with a bloody and doubtful Fight, till the Turks were beaten into the Town, and the Retreat sounded by command to call off the Imperials. But leaving this Siege a while, I shall return to Count Teckely, who, continuing near Tokay, drew together such Forces as he could to oppose the Joynt-Forces under the Leading of the Prince Lubomirski, the Palatine of Hungary, and Major General Schutz, who had seized the important Posts on the Waag, and by that means hinder∣ed him from joyning with the Turks, at which, as most suppose, he was no whit sorry, but rather rejoyced at such an excuse; for had he been embodied with the Turkish Army, his Grandeur, by which he allured the ignorant, and such as sought for Prey, to take Arms against their Emperour, would have been ecclipsed and impaired, especially
if they had been commanded by a Turkish Bassa; for such is the Insolen∣cy of those men, that although they, for the most part, are in their Original but Slaves or Tribute Children, that when they come to this Preferment they make no Scruple to Lord it over Kings and Princes, though their Lives and Fortunes depend upon the Breath and Pleasure of their Master, who fre∣quently, upon the least Capricio, dis∣seises them both of Life and Honour, sending the meanest of his Slaves for the Heads of his greatest Captains; nor dare any other oppose it upon Forfei∣ture of their own. This being a good excuse for Tecke∣ly, the better to keep up his Reputa∣tion with his Faction, he again pre∣tended to treat with the Emperour a∣bout a truce; but this Artifice so often used to protract time would not take, he thinking by another stratagem to pacifie the Turk, gave out he would joyn with a Body of Tartars, consist∣ing of nine thousand, in order to be∣siege Zathmor, as knowing that he
could at pleasure Lord it over those rude People who came to Wars only for Prey, and if so be they can get Booty, they matter not who Com∣mands or whom they Spoil, be he Friend or Enemy. Having joyned a Par∣ty of these barbarous Infidels, more in hu∣mane than the Turks, he passed a Breach of the Danube, & burnt divers Villages, Plundring and taking Prisoners many of the Boors, who had not time to re∣tire, by reason of his suddain and un∣expected arrival, many of those mi∣serable people fell likewise into the hands of the Tartars, who tying them together in cords drove them before them into miserable boudage, con∣veying them thither (without any hark∣ening to Ransoms proposed by their Friends) by such Merchants, as they call them, as the Soldiers sold them to, who for that purpose always attend the Turkish Camp, bring Loads of Cords and Iron shackles to Bind and secure them, without respect either to Sex or Age, nay the Aged fare worse than those in the strength of their Age;
middle Age, or extraordinary Young; for they being looked upon as unser∣viceable, seldom escape the Sword. To requite the outrage of Teckely and the Tartars, the Vice-roy of Cro∣tia having notice that a Party of the Rebels, Turks and Tartars, to the num∣ber of twelve or thirteen thousand, were advahcing upon the Frontiers, he by stopping the strait Pass of Jabulunk not only impeded their advancement, but, with a party of a thousand horse, fell into them, and after two hours dis∣pute put them to the rout, killing three hundred upon the place, and taking a hundred Prisoners, thereby redeem∣ing or rescuing divers miserable Chri∣stians, whom they dragged after them in Ropes and Chains, having surprised them in their Houses, most of whose Houses they had plundred and laid in Ashes. The Siege of New-Husel, whist these things were doing, was carryed on by the Imperialists with all imagi∣nable Vigor, and the Besieged prepa∣red as resolutly to defend it, being in∣couraged
thereto by the approach of the Turks Army, a part of which by this time was lodged upon an Emi∣nence near Gran, and waited for an additional force to fall upon the forces appointed to Guard the River Nitera under the command of the Palatine of Hungary, who undertook, with a select power of the Militia of that Kingdom, to defend both that and the Waag: yet such was the resolution of the Imperial Leagers that they advanced their trenches within an hundred paces of the Wall, running them under ground, in order to fix a Mine under the chief Bull-work of that Garrison, playing at the same time furiously a∣gainst the Wall: insomuch that, for the space of two hundred yards, all the Battlements were beaten down; which the Turks in the Counter∣scarp perceiving, sallied furiously upon the Pioneers; but being encountered by a Regiment of Austrians command∣ed on to their assistance, they were forced to retire with the loss of sixty eight of their companions, and a∣mongst
them a Zangiack, two Cap∣tains and an Ensign-bearer, when following that success, the Imperialists pressing on, entred one of their Re∣doubts, and for a while maintained it, but a great party sallying, and the Can∣non of the Town playing incessantly upon them, they were forced to retire with some loss. These things passing, divers Coun∣cels where held at Vienna and Pres∣burg, in order to the management of the War, the Electoral Princes being daily sollicited to send such Troops as they could raise into the Field; for that by frequent Courriers it was advised, that the body of the Turks Army, under the leading of the Grand Visier, had mustered, and was drawing from Bell-grade in order to besiege some Important place, thereby to raise the Seige of New-husel: whereupon it was resolved that three new Regiments should be raised, and that four Regi∣ments one of Horse and an other of Foot should be detached from the forces of the Empire, under the com∣mand
of Count Waldeck, as likewise it was agreed, that the Quota's and Ar∣rears of the Electoral Princes, and all other Princes depending upon the Em∣pire, should be immediately perform∣ed, for defraying the Charges, and for the better management of the War. Upon which Resolves, the Marquess of Baden Dourlach presented his Deputy a memorial, setting forth the great dama∣ges he had sustained by the War be∣tween the Empire and the Crown of France, as well by the last as the prece∣dent: & therefore desired that he might be freed from the Taxes of the Empire, as not being in a capacity to pay them; upon which the Estates assembled in Council, wrote a favourable letter to the Emperour in his behalf, but the affairs of the Empire requiring great Summs of Mony to defray the charges of a wide wasting War, it could not be wholly dispenced with, though part was remitted.
Teckely having taken breath for a long time without being urged to action, as∣sembled a great party near Zatmar, threatning to besiege it: and to that end sent for Han Kerogly, Commander of the Tartarian Troops in those parts. Whereupon the Duke of Lorrain sent a Regiment of Foot to enter it; who without any opposition effected the command of their General, which put a stop to the intention of the Rebells; yet they out of a bravery coming with∣in sight of the Walls, fire divers pie∣ces of Cannon, and were answered in the same language: The garrison at the same time appearing with Ensigns Spread, Trumpets sounding, and Drums beating, seeming thereby resolute to make a vigorous defence, in case they were besieged. Whereupon he passed on to expect the Tartars, who under the leading of Ingreni Kan, Son or Ne∣phew to the Great Tartarian Cham, was upon his march into Hungary by the way of Transylvania; where as well of the Transylvanians their Friends, as those that were their Enemies, they made spoil. Upon notice of which, and to
prevent such a conjunction, Major-General Schuts posted himself near Transchin, who there in conjunction with the Prince Lubomirski, made a body of 12000 Horse and Foot, ex∣pecting daily a reinforcement from Pres∣burg; whither the Troops from all parts were drawing, to recruit as occasion required it. The Imperial Army, the gross of whose Body lay incamped at Commora, from whence a considerable Party was sent out by the Dukes com∣mand, under the leading of Collonel Monthazon, to burn the Bridg on the River Grann, over which the Turkish Army was to march, in order to their advancing towards Newheusel: But ere their arrival, the Turks had strongly pos∣sessed it with a detached Party, sent out by the Bassa of Buda, who about a League from thence, was incamped for the security of Gran; into which he had put 2000 Foot and 1000 Horse, 1000 of the former being Janizaries, so that they could not effect their design. During these transactions, the Czar of Moscovy, by his Ambassador, had often
conferences with the Ministers of Po∣land, in order to his entring into the League agreed upon between , offering ; but  that he had or could this Summer have any conside∣rable Forces in the Field, it came at this time to no conclusion, though the Treaty continued, and still continues on Foot; that Prince being greatly desirous to regain the Towns which the Tartars, secretly encouraged thereto by the Turks, took from the Moscovian Dukedome, during the intestine broils, and clan∣destine Revolutions of that Govern∣ment; in which the Great Duke fell by Poison, and most of the Nobility by the hands of the rude Multitude, who under pretence of revenging their Princes death, committed all manner of outrages, laying Houses wast with Fire, plundering, murthering, ravishing of Women, deflowering Virgins, seizing upon the Goods of Merchants, over∣throwing Temples, and all other wick∣edness; for such was, is, and will be, the miserable condition of those King∣doms,
or States, where the rude multi∣tude turn Reformers, and pretend to do justice upon offenders. But to return. By this time, the Electoral Princes being sensible how much the great Ar∣my of the Turks conduced to the en∣couragement of the Rebels, and that if preparations were not speedily made, the Imperial Army under the command of the Duke of Lorrain, would prove too weak to keep the Field against such a multitude, used great diligence in rai∣sing fresh Troops. Nor were there Volun∣tiers of divers Nations wanting to flock to the Imperial Camp, as desirous of nothing more than to fight against the common Enemy, who appeared so formidable to Christendom, so that six new Regiments were compleated, four of which were commanded to con∣tinue at Presburg till they had orders to march further; and the other two kept on their way to the Army, encamped between Commora and Newheusel: who in their way encountred 500 Turks, that were advanced as far as Newstadt, when between the fore-runners of the
Imperialists and the said Turks, there happened a sharp encounter: for the Turks supposing the Imperialists inferior to them in number, by reason the Hills interposed between the advanced, and those that were yet to advance, and loth to lose the Booty they had got∣ten, which consisted of much Cattle; they came resolutely to the encounter, firing with their Harquebusses thrice round; when as the Vaunt-guard of the Imperialists answered them with the like salutes, whose Rear-guard perceiv∣ing them ingaged, drew off, and pas∣sing the Hill, appeared at the back of the Turks drawn up in Battalia, which they no sooner perceived, but despairing to prevail, as also of any succour, they being advanced ten Leagues from their body, they threw down their Arms for the most part, and betook themselves to flight, in which, and upon the place, 200 were killed, and the rest, or, at leastways, the greatest part of them, fell into the hands of the Imperial Par∣ties, sent out from the Camp near Commora, to observe the motion of the Enemy near Gran. The Booty reco∣vered
was 300 head of Cattle, 67 Slaves and much Houshold-stuff, which they had taken from the Villagers by the way as they had passed: amongst them was taken prisoner a Nephew to the Bassa of Buda; who upon strict exami∣nation confessed, that the Grand Signior's Army consisted of the chiefest strength of Asia and Gracia, and that by the be∣ginning of August they reckoned (ac∣counting the Tartars that were coming to their aid, and those to be sent by the Princes of Transylvania, Moldavia, and Vallachia,) to have in the Field in Hun∣gary 300000 effectual men, with part of which it was resolved to fight the Im∣perial Army, if it could be drawn to a Battle, whilst another part besieged Raab, Commora, and other Imperial For∣tresses, the Grand Signior not doubting but to make him Master of the remain∣ing part of Hungary and Austria, having sworn by the sacred Head (as he term∣ed it) of Mahomet, not to withdraw his Army, till he had possessed himself of Vienna. This advice, some supposed too Ro∣mantick, only to curry favour for his
better treatment, and that by receiving more liberty than ordinary, he might make his escape: For he moreover added, That he did not greatly favour the Mahumetan Superstition, but was greatly desirous to become a Christian, yet was he sent prisoner to Raab, there to remain till further orders. The menaces of the Grand Signior, though indeed he had a powerful Army on foot, and every day expected to be in those parts; had not such effects upon the Duke of Lorrain nor the Council of War, that daily assembled in the Camp, as to make them think of with∣drawing the Leaguer from before New∣heusel: but the rather induced them to press the siege with greater resolution and vigor, that so if it were possible to be Masters of that important place, (which so few years since cost the Turks 30000 Lives to obtain it) before the gross of the Turks Army could pass the River Gran, in order to attempt its re∣lief, or the Tartars joyn with Count Teckely, to fall into Silesia. This impor∣tant place is scituate in a fair plain, on the further bank of the River Neytra,
encompassed with a Mote and deep Trenches, Palizadoes, and divers Flan∣kers; the Battlements of the Walls, be∣ing intermixed with small Towers or Bul∣warks for playing the Cannon on, or playing with Small-Shot, in case of a Storm, for there they stand secure from the force of the Leaguerers Small-Shot, and advantagiously from all sides annoy them to the Land side: For the River making a Point or Bend, as it were, in∣closes two parts. There stands a strong Castle, though not appearing more than twenty Cubits above on the Platform or Battlements, on which are usually planted thirty pieces of great Ord∣nance. To encounter this danger, the Impe∣rialists having raised two Batteries, play so furiously, that with their Can∣non they dismounted divers Pieces of the Enemies; many of which were broken with the violence of the Shot from another Battery, that from four Mortars threw in about twenty Grana∣does in one day; which killed about 100 of the Besieged, and demolished a considerable number of Houses, and
amongst other things, beat down the Turret of their chief Mosk or Temple: and that the Garrison was in great con∣sternation, it was reported by a Chri∣stian Slave, who made his escape over the Wall, and fled to the Imperialists: adding, That the Inhabitants having their Houses demolished in great num∣ber by the Shot of Cannon, Bombs and Granadoes; did greatly murmur against the Governour, saying, That the Grand Visier neglected and delay∣ed their relief, and that it was but rea∣son they should provide for their own safeties in time, by capitulating with the Besiegers; who if things came to extremity, if they spared their lives which was doubtful whether they would or not, would certainly plunder them, and strip them out of all they had: and that this discontent of the common people, the Governour had used great diligence to quiet and calm, by many perswasions, putting them in hopes of the Visiers and Aga of the Janizaries approach with 50000 Foot and 30000 Horse, and that a greater power would follow from Belgrade, and that upon their passing
the River Gran, the Visier of Buda would joyn them with 20000 more, who were posted under his command upon an eminence near Gran Town: But some of the most turbulent seeming still dis∣satisfied, he caused six to be hanged up for a terrour to the rest, and to deter them from mutinying, which upon the Imperialists pressing the Siege they were prone to, and immediately commanded the Captains to prepare for a Sally, and especially those that were lodged on the Counterscap. Which on the tenth of June they did, advancing under shelter of the Night as far as the Bastion-trench; but being furiously charged by the Im∣perialists, they were beaten into the Town with great loss; in which action the Im∣perialists lost 33 men, and amongst them three Officers of note, but the Turks trible the number: for being pushed on by their Commanders, who seldom spare their men, they fell unawares in∣to a fortified work, where were lodged six Companies of Croats, who with their broad Swords cut in pieces all that entered.
Whilst this was doing, a Bombe fal∣ling in the Town; fired one of their Store-houses, which inraged by the Wind, drove on, consuming as near as could be computed by the continuance of the flame, twenty Houses, giving light also to the Action: For during the conflagration, all the Outworks were enlightened so far, as to see each particular, though this happened between one and two in the Morning. The Turks beaten into the Town, the better to prevent Supplies of Pro∣vision being brought up the River, or any Forces that by Night might enter the Garrison, (for it was more than suspected that the Bassa of Buda had such a design) The Duke of Lorrain com∣manded the Regiments of Halleweil, Ladrow, Khery and Castelli to reinforce the Body of Men under the command of the Palatine of Hungary, with which he had posted himself on the other side the Neytra. The news of the Siege of Newheusel, and the success of the Imperialists in advancing and carrying it on, being come to the Ears of the Prime Visier,
and that the Polonian King was advancing with a strong power, intending to pass the River Olse at Jublow, Row, or Tels∣chen, in order to his passing into Hunga∣ry: He sent a considerable supply of Mony to the Bassa of Caminietz, to in∣able him to raise a body of Cossacks, to be commanded in chief by the Cham of Tartary, to observe the motions, and oppose the proceedings of the Poles. These people called Cossacks were once united to the Kingdom of Polonia, and served them upon all occasions, yet chose Captains of their own, and did not acknowledg any King; yet proved exceeding serviceable, especially to pre∣vent the incursions of the Tartars into Lithuania, Podolia, and other Provinces of the Poles, into which they made frequent inroads, as living for the most part upon spoil. When in the Reign of Vldislayus, they separated themselves, for that the said King warred upon them, either to bring them under his subjecti∣on, or utterly to extirpate them; but his project took not, for choosing them∣selves Captains of divers Nations, be∣ing indeed a medley of people, they
joyn'd with their brethren the Moscovite Cossacks, and fought divers dreadful Battles with the Polonians with various success; till at length being wearied, they past the Ister and Boristhenus, and there had Lands assigned them by the Turk and Moscovite, they well know∣ing those men to be the Shield of Po∣land. There they continued, having divers conflicts with the Tartars and Poles till the death of Vldislayus and some years after: When as the Poles perceiv∣ing themselves for want of their guard upon the Frontiers, lye open and expo∣sed to the fury of the savage Tartars; who like so many ravenous wild beasts, made frequent inrodes, and with fire and Sword wasted the fruitfullest part of the Countrey, driving away herds of Cattle, and carrying Men, Women and Children into miserable captivity. It was in the Dyet at Leopol agreed, That Deputies should be sent to the Cossacks, to invite them in the name of the Estates of Poland, to return to their antient Habitations: Which some of them did, but others being settled with their Families refused it: so that
at this day they indifferently serve the Turks or Christians in their Wars, liv∣ing for the most part by the Sword, being always ready to espouse the quar∣rel of him that will bid most, be it right or wrong. The Turks Army by this time being upon its march, and the besieged in Newheusel continuing to make a vigo∣rous defence, continually repairing by Night what the Cannon beat down off the Walls in the Day; and that in the opinion of the Engineers, they could not run their Mines to the Wall, by such means to become masters of the place in less than a Fortnight: A Council was held in the Camp, in order to come to a result, Whether the siege should be raised or continued? On one hand it was urged, That the suddain raising the Siege would imply a fear in the Imperialists, and prove advantagi∣ous to the Turks, and heighten their courage, and redound to the dishonour of the Empire; and that in considera∣tion thereof it was rather convenient to hazzard a battle with the advanced part of the Turks Army, that was sent to
relieve the Besieged: or give a furious assault to the Town on all parts, in which it might probably fall out, that they should carry it by storm. But these Councils were on the other hand not thought convenient at such a juncture, it being alledged, That the Army was not yet compleat, and that in unadvisedly hazzarding a Battle without the conjunction of all the For∣ces, or at least those the King of Po∣land was bringing into the Field, was to hazzard at one Cast all the hereditary Countries of the Empire. As for at∣tempting the place by Storm, experi∣ence had already made it apparent, that it was a matter of great difficulty, and more men must necessarily be lost than the place was worth; That it was no policy (if the attempt should prove successful, as it was greatly to be questi∣oned whether it would or not) to pur∣chase a Town at the price of so much blood. But something must be resol∣ved before the Ottoman Forces advanced so near as either to oblige the Army to Battle, or a dishonourable Retreat. The Duke of Lorrain was of the former opini∣on,
being desirous of nothing more than to give the Infidels Battle, if it was possible to oblige them thereto. But whilst these debates were undeter∣mined, the Emperor being sensible of the state of affairs, and not willing to hazzard the strength of his Empire at a Cast, sent an express order from Vienna to the Duke, to quit the siege, and re∣turn to his former Camp near Com∣mora: which he accordingly did. And immediately after his departure, the be∣sieged sallied out, and set their Pioneers on work to fill up the Trenches, and demolish the battery the Imperialists had raised, for fear that they upon se∣cond thought, or a new reinforcement, might return to the Siege. In this enterprize the Imperialists made four attacks upon the Counter∣scarps, Half-Moon and Ravelin; in which, and at the seven sallies the Turks made, they lost 500 men: And the Turks are supposed to lose double the number, 100 at once being killed and spoiled in a Bulwark, which was blown up by a Granado, containing fifty pound of Powder.
Whilst Newheusel was besieged, the Palatine of Hungary taking the advan∣take of the Turks consternation, drew out a detatchment of 100 Foot, and 500 Horse, and marching cross the Countrey, laid siege to the Fortress of Scarone, summoning it to surrender; but the Governour refusing, he from a small rising battered it with four Demi-Culverings for the space of six Hours, in which time he laid open a breach so wide that six might march abreast: which the besieged perceiving, sounded a Par∣ly, but could get no other Conditions than to be made Prisoners of War, the whole Garrison not consisting of more than 68 Turks, of which eight were killed with the Cannon-shot, and the remainder carried Prisoners to No∣vigrade. After which, the Palatine hav∣ing put 150 men into the place, and furnished them with all things necessary, returned to his Post; where he had notice, that the Count Palsi had joyned the Imperial Army with 3000 of the new Levies.
Count Teckely being all this while bu∣sy in the upper Hungary, to get himself effectually acknowledged Prince of that Province, and finding cold returns of such messages as he sent to divers of the Nobility upon that occasion, and especially of the Governours of the Berg Towns, whom he pressed more than any other: He resolved to compel them by Force to do what by words he could not oblige them to, and thereupon sent a Body of 3000 Hungarians, and 1000 Tartarian Light-Horse-men, in his name, to take possession of those Towns; as likewise to possess the Silver Mines, not far distant from them. Not so seeming satisfied, as well knowing the Turks were at hand to back him, he sent forth his Summons to injoyn the Inhabitants of the Counties of Neutra, Trenchin and Taroz, to supply him with Proyision for the subsistence of his Ar∣my; threatning upon failure thereof to plunder and burn their Towns; which forc'd divers of the Countrey people, and such as lived in places subject to the incursions of the Rebels, to remove with their substance into Towns of
strength: by reason at the same time, the Governours of the Fortresses had sent an Express, under pain of being treated as enemies to the Empire. So that between both, the wretched peo∣ple were in great perplexity: but upon certain notice, That the Turks Army consisting of 80000 Horse and Foot were marching with all speed into those parts; a great number of Villages have complyed to Teckely's demands, and amongst other, Papa, Vesprin, and Totis, have put themselves under his pro∣tection. The Duke of Lorrain, upon his quit∣ting the siege of Newheusel, having no∣tice, That the Bassa of Buda had a design to fall into Moravia and Silesia with the body of men under his com∣mand, and for that intent was upon his march; he with the Imperial Army In∣camped upon the bank of the Danube to hinder his passage, as likewise to se∣cure the conveyance of Provision to the Imperial Garrisons scituate upon the banks of that River, and to prevent any design the Turks might have upon the Isle of Schutz. And at the same time
the Palatine of Hungary is posted on the Waag near Trenchin, daily expecting the King of Poland, who with his Forces lay at that time incamped near Cracaw; as also orders from the Emperor how to proceed in the juncture of affairs, which he received upon the return of the Duke of Saxe Lewenburg, who was sent to Vienna to give his Imperial Majesty an account of the State of affairs; and whilst he lay incamped on the Danube, he caused the Fortifications of Raab to be repaired, putting a reinforcement in∣to it, and furnishing it with all things ne∣cessary to hold a long siege, and make a resolute defence, in case it should be besieged. And now great was the expectation of all men; for the Visier with his Ar∣my, having passed divers small Rivers, by Plashing of Trees, or bridging them over with Boats, by swift marches ad∣vanced as far as Stat Weissemberg, within six hours march of the Imperial Camp; his Forces, Horse and Foot, consisting of 80000 effectual men. And thither he sent for Count Teckely, who immediate∣ly went to attend him: When to pre∣vent
the Fortifications on the Neytra from falling into the Turks hands, the Em∣peror sent orders to Count Chackey, who commands on that side, to demolish them: Which was accordingly perform∣ed. And now so near were the ap∣proaches of the two Armies, that divers Skirmishes with various success hap∣pened between parties. The Turks im∣patiently expecting 12000 Tartars, who were upon their march through Molda∣via, to joyn them. And the Imperia∣lists, as earnestly expected the Prince of Transylvania; (who envying Count Teck∣ley's advancement, and mistrusting the Grand Signior has a design to deprive him of his Principality) promised, as the rumour went, to take the Field with 18 or 20000 men, at arrival of the Polonian Forces, and to act offensively against the Turks. On the 2 of July 1683. the Duke of Lorrain having received advice, That a Body of Turks and Tartars had passed the Raab at Segine, and exercised all manner of cruelties upon the people where they came, burning their Houses, deflowring their Daughters, ravishing
and ripping up their Wives dashing their young Children against the Pment and haling such as were of ability of bo∣dy into miserable bondage, with a thousand the like cruelties, and bestia∣lities: He detached a considerable party to oppose their further proceedings, and oblige them to repass the River; which they accordingly did, and after that, having made a shew, as if they intend∣ed to lay siege either to Leopolstadt or Raab: The Imperial Horse posted them∣selves near Altenburg, and the Foot in the Isle of Schutz, to be in a readiness as occasion should serve to assist either of the places. But this stratagem being in a short time discovered, and that the Turks real intentions were to get be∣tween the Horse and Foot, to hinder their acting joyntly: The Imperial Horse sent their Baggage towards Al∣tenburg; which the Turks attacked with 3000 men, but being fought withal, and for a long time couragiously repulsed by the Convoy, which exceeded not 600 Horse, they retired, leaving 100 of their men dead upon the place: But in their retreat meeting a party of 800
Turks, they again rallied, Whereupon the Duke of Lorrain from the main Bo∣dy, made what speed he could with 4000 Light-Horse, insomuch that there happened a sharp and obstinate Skirmish between both parties; in which the Imperialists lost 1200 men, and all their baggage, valued at 40000 Guilders. The Turks are said to have lost in this skirmish 1700 men, and a∣mongst them divers of note. The Duke of Lorrain was ingaged in the midst of the Enemies, and near unto him were wounded, the Prince of Sa∣voy, General Rubatta, and the Count d' Lamberg, and the Prince of Aremberg: The Princes of Savoy and Aremberg soon after dying of their wounds. After which the Imperial Horse making good the retreat, passed the Bridge, and joyn∣ed the Foot, who during the Action, being divided by the River, could not come to their assistance. The Turks heightned by this success, and being recruited by 8000 more of their accomplices, laid siege to Raah, from whose Walls the Guns played up∣on them so furiously, that they perceiv∣ed
that siege too hot for them, they after having burnt an adjacent Village called Petronello, quitted it, and march∣ing outwards joyned the gross body of the Ottoman Army, under the leading of the Grand Visier, who marched directly towards Vienna, the chief City of Au∣stria, and Bulwark of the Empire, spoil∣ing and ravaging the Countrey after so dreadful a manner, that the Inhabitants fled before them, with such things as were portable, like droves of Sheep; and divers Towns to avoid such cruel treat∣ment, put themselves under their pro∣tection, the Countrey all about them being in a flame. There might one be∣hold the hellish Tartars, like so many fiends, dragging and haling the Christians fast bound in Ropes; and the barbarous Turks carrying the Heads of such as they had slain in triumph, as it were, upon the points of their Lances, still blaspheem∣ing the Redeemer of the World, and threatning destruction to all Christen∣dom. Whilst before the torrent, the Imperial Army retired under the Walls of Vienna, into which City to get en∣trance, the Count Staremburg, Governour
thereof, was obliged with much brave∣ry to fight his way through the Enemy, with a Body of Foot, with which he had been abroad to observe their moti∣ons: and immediately entring, gave orders for firing the Suburbs, and pla∣cing the Guns upon the Wall, resolving to make a resolute and brave de∣fence. Whilst the transaction happened, Ma∣jor General Schutz had better success, for upon notice that a strong party of the Rebels were about to pass the Da∣nube about six Leagues from his Post, he drew off, and marched immediately to impede their passage: And finding them making provision for their trans∣portation, he fell upon them with such courage and bravery, that after a hot dispute, he put them to the rout, kil∣ling 200 upon the place, taking 106 Pri∣soners, with seven Ensigns, and a great Booty, which they had gotten in their Progress. Their intent-was to have fallen into Silesia, there to expect a body of Tartars, who were on their march to joyn them.
The Turks Camp increasing before Vienna, and furiously pressing the siege, though the besieged made a brave and resolute defence: Yet knowing they could not subsist without relief from abroad, the Bishop of Aichstadt, the Im∣perial Commissioner, by a Memorial re∣presents unto the Diet for that purpose assembled, the imminent danger wherein the City was; as likewise the whole Circle of Austria, which must of ne∣cessity fall into the hands of the unmer∣ciful Infidels, if a speedy course were not taken to relieve it; and under what mi∣series the Countries about the besieged City groaned, they were not igno∣rant: Therefore in the name of his Imperial Majesty, he prayed them to lay aside all other business and debates, and come to a quick resolution about raising Men and Money, sufficient to enable the Imperial Army, if not to raise the Siege, yet to keep the Field, and prevent the farther progress of the Turkish Arms: which they promised to do. And immediately thereupon, the respective Deputies Dispatched away Letters to their Principals, to acquaint
them with the Resolves of the Dyet. Whereupon the Duke of Bavaria drew his Forces together with all imaginable expedition; and as the Vaunt-guard of his Troops, dispatched a Regiment of Foot, and another of Horse, to joyn the Duke of Lorrain; whom they found posted about ten Leagues on this side Vienna, his Camp strongly fortified, and in good order; his Army consisting in Horse, Foot and Dragoons, of no less than 35000 effectual men, with the which he intended, as soon as the Troops joyned him, to fight the Grand Visier, or oblige him to draw off from before the City, and raise the siege. During these transactions, his Impe∣rial Majesty remained at Passaw, solici∣ting the Christian Princes to draw to∣gether their Forces with all expedition, to oppose the Infidels; who with great labour and diligence advanced their Trenches, as knowing that if they linger the siege, the Christian Forces would be upon them, and oblige them to rise from before it: Therefore with their Batteries they fired incessantly, ruining a great part of the Wall near the Carin∣thian
Gate; notwithstanding the besieg∣ed made a gallant and resolute defence, being in want neither of Ammunition nor Provision: Yet that all the Countrey round about was in a consternation inex∣pressible; the people through fear and amazement, flying every where through∣out the Circle. The Rebels taking advantage of the retreat of the Imperialists, desisted not to commit many and great outrages, burning and plundering all before them; when coming near Budekim, in the upper Silesia, the Governour of that Garrison sallied out upon them, and gave them a brisk incounter, but being overpowered with numbers, was obliged to retire with some loss. This so inraged the Rebels, that they resolved to attack that Fortress; and did it so succesfully, that notwithstanding the resolute de∣fence of the besieged, they carried it at the third assault, putting most of the Garrison to the Sword, and plundring without exception, all the Inhabitants. At which siege, there ran a report, that Count Teckely was mortally wounded, and soon after, that he was dead; though
it proved altogether a mistake, for he was not personally there, but acted by his Lieutenant. The loss of this place, greatly alarmed the neighbouring Gar∣risons, and obliged them to put them∣selves in an extraordinary posture of de∣fence; especially, upon notice that 10 thousand Tartars were marching with∣in twelve Leagues, to joyn the Re∣bels. The Grand Visier, at the siege of Vienna did not at all spare his men, think∣ing by such resoluteness to daunt the besieged, and bring them the sooner to a Capitulation: To come to which, he has not only by Letters shot in upon Ar∣rows; but by other means, as fending his Letters by captive Austrians, made large Promises, and large Threats; on the one hand, assuring them of Liberty, free exercise of Religion, and indemp∣nity of their Persons and Estates: On the other, he magnified the Force, Power, and Resolution of his Master, swearing by Mahumet, if they stood out to extremity, and obliged him to take it by storm, which he was resolved to do, for that no relief was to be hoped
for on their part; he would put all to the Sword, without exception, and that the most obstinate in opposing his de∣mands, should expire by the most ex∣quisite torments. But these threats or promises were too low and mean to have any effects, or make any impressi∣on on the minds of men of bravery and resolution, who had devoted their lives to the defence of that City, and the pre∣servation of the Emperours honour; though indeed some of the pusillani∣mous Burghers, looking back upon their Wives and Children, were for yielding up the place; for which, and for muti∣nying upon that occasion, as a terrour to the rest, five or six of them were exe∣cuted, and an Order published, That under severe penalties, no man should be so hardy, as once to name or men∣tion any thing tending to a Sur∣render. The Visier, thus frustrated in his hopes and expectation, gave order to raise another Battery against the new Bulwark, from which he battered it incessantly for 16 hours with great fury; but in the end had most of his Cannon
disinounted by the besieged, and a sally made upon the Trenches; in which 300 Turks were killed, and of the Imperi∣alists fifty; amongst whom was a Cap∣tain of Horse and an Ensign bearer: But what more conduced to the advantage of the Imperialists, under the favour of this action the Pioneers filled up divers of their Works, and broke into their Mines in divers places, which they discovered by sounding them. The Count Staremberg Govern∣our of the place, omitted no labour nor industry to defend it, giving most re∣markable proofs of his conduct and cou∣rage, to the great incouragement of those that served under him; for where-ever the Walls were most rent and shattered, and the Cannon played most furiously, there would he be, labouring at the Works sometimes with his own hands, and at other times incouraging his Soul∣diers with words and rewards. By this time, the Turks having fi∣nished three new Batteries, began to throw their Bombs, which ruined divers houses; to prevent which, many of those that were nearest to the Wall,
the Besieged covered with Earth, espe∣cially the flat roofed ones, which most in that City are: which strategem hin∣dered frequently the Bombs from doing their desired execution. When in the mean time, the German Engineers ha∣ving from the Bulwarks levelled their Cannon against the Turkish Batteries, broke and dismounted most of their Cannon, ruining, and for the most part demolishing the Batteries, killing a great number of the Infidels: Insomuch that the Visier sent to the Count, to de∣mand a cessation for some hours, to bu∣ry the dead; but indeed to repair the Batteries, though it was not conjectu∣red that less than 300 slain lay scattered up and down, whose noysome smell greatly infected the Turkish Camp: not was the imperious Turk contented to make this demand only, but according to the wonted pride of the Ottomans, he by the same Messenger gave him a se∣cond time to understand, That in case he did not in time surrender the place, but obstinately held out, till it should be taken by storm, he would put Men, Women, and Children to the Sword.
To which the Count as boldly, and souldier-like, returned answer: That his menaces might be spared; that for his part, he knew better how to de∣fend the place, than ever to think of surrendring it, of which by his actions he would convince him; nor would he consent to any cessation. This answer made the Turk fume and chase exceed∣ingly, but in vain; for although he commanded all the Cannon to play in∣cessantly all the 1 and 22 of July, yet they did little execution; or if they did, the Citizens and others, who la∣boured therein, repaired it, and where ever the fiercest battery happened, there they countermured and raised Rampiers of earth to hinder the shaking of the Wall: Nor did he only batter, but commanded his men to give an at∣tack upon the Ravelin in three places, their Officers thrusting and beating such on as lagged or seemed unwilling to press forward; but in this they were altogether unsuccesful; for what by the Cannon from the Work, and the Town, and volleys of small shot from the Palizadoes and Brest-works, they
were forced to retire 2000 less than they came on. The war remaining at this point, the Duke of Lorrain having received a sup∣ply of 5000 men, the better to en∣courage the besieged, drew near the City, incamping with his whole Army at Krembs on the Danube about three Lea∣gues and a half from Vienna, within hear∣ing of the Cannon, and sight of the Leaguer; and there received advice from the King of Poland, That he was upon his march with an Army of 40000 effectual men, and that by the 20 of August, he would be before Vienna, and oblige the Turks to rise, or come to a general Battle; which advice he caused to be conveyed to the besieged by a Fisherman, who adventured to swim over the River; and thereby so incou∣raged them, that the next morning they made another sally upon the Turks, and finding them altogether unprepared, made a great slaughter, beating them out of their Trenches, and throwing down their Works; which so much alarmed the Camp, that the Visier suspected the Imperial Army was at hand, and there∣fore
immediately drew up into Battalia, commanding 1000 Janizaries, and 2000 Spahies to succour the Leaguers that maintained the Works; upon whose arrival, the Imperialists returned into the City, having killed between 3 or 400 of the enemies, and taken eight Ensigns: Which negligence of duty in the Turks, the Visier punished by the death of the Zangiack, that command∣ed in chief on part of the Works. This action was no sooner over, but the Duke of Lorrain had notice by his Scouts, that a great convoy of Provi∣sion and Ammunition was on its way to the Turks Camp before Vienna: He commanded out a strong party to at∣tack it, who accordingly did; but find∣ing the Turks that guarded it, obstinate, and not willing to surrender it without blows, a sharp dispute happened, and continued hot for the space of two hours, in which time 600 Turks being killed upon the place, the rest fled, some to the Camp, and others to Count Teckely, who lyes on the frontiers of Silesia; lea∣ving the Baggage to the Imperialists, who lost 58 men in this action; but in
the end brought their booty to the Camp, computed worth 40000 Dol∣lars: for it consisted of 1000 Waggons all well laden. The Imperial Ministers in the name of his Imperial Majesty, having motioned to the Count d' Crecy, the French Mini∣ster, That the Troops of that Crown might not molest the Empire, nor any of its dependences during his Imperial Majesties being involved in war with the Turk: The said Count sent to ac∣quaint the King his Master with what had been proposed; and having received Instruction, on that affair, He on the 26 of July presented a memorial, where∣in he acquainted them, That the King his Master would not take advantage of the condition the Empire is in, by rea∣son of the war with the Turks; but would make a truce with his Imperial Majesty for the space of thirty years, provided it be consented to before the end of August: Upon which Proposal, the Bishop of Aichstadt, the Imperial Minister, sent to acquaint his Imperial Majesty therewith; and to receive in∣structions in that affair: the Electoral
Colledge being of opinion. That it is absolutely necessary to conclude a peace with the Crown of France upon the Conditions proposed; and that there∣upon they shall be the better able to assist his Imperial Majesty with men and money to maintain the war against the Turk; for that they are at present obli∣ged to keep Forces upon the frontiers to prevent the incursions of the French, who are roving abroad in parties: But the result of this affair, at this juncture of great importance to the Empire, as yet remains undetermined and doubt∣ful. During the Treaty between the Em∣pire and Crown of France, the action grew warm at the siege of Vienna; for the Turks continuing their Batteries, and pressing on the siege, by running their Trenches, and covering with Bavins and Planks, to defend them from the small shot out of the Palizadoes and Flankers. The Imperialists on the 24 of July, made another brisk sallie, with 3000 Foot and 2000 Horse, who charged the Turks with such fury in their Trenches, that they drove them out of
divers works, which they had advanced near the Ravelin, and filled them up, setting fire to the Planks, and what else was combustible; and following their advantage, beat them to their main Works, and there disputed it at push of Pike, and But-end for half an hour: du∣ring which space, 7000 Turks advanced from the Camp to the relief of their fellows; when the Imperialists tired with the slaughter of the Infidels, of which (as some that were taken Pri∣soners since, say no less than) 4 or 5000 perished in the action, they retired into the Town, carrying Turks heads upon their Lances; which they afterwards planted upon stakes on the Bastions. This and the former carnages did so in∣fect the air, that the smell and noy∣somness caused a mortal sickness in the Turks Camp, and thereby obliged the Visier to remove with the greatest part of his Army 3 or 4 miles distant from the Walls: And moreover it was re∣lated by a Christian slave, who in the action made his escape, That the Turks in running their Trenches, did happen upon a great number of dead bodies,
full of putrefaction and contagious smells, who had been buried during the raging of the late Plague at Vienna; in∣somuch, that not being able to endure the scent, they were often obliged to discontinue the work, many of them thereupon falling mortally sick, and dying shortly after: So that here, as well the dead as the living contributed to the defence of the City. In the last sally the Imperialists lost 160 men. The Elector of Bavaria, by this time having drawn forth an Army of 13 or 14000 men, brought them to Passaw; where he drew them up, and exercised them in the presence of the Emperor, where they for the most part appeared wonderful dextrous in handling their Arms, swift and ready in their advan∣ces, and indeed expert in all military exercise, to the no small delight of the beholders. Scarcely was this over, but News came, That General Dunwalt having notice that 7 or 8000 Tartars were fallen into the upper Austria, he with such forces as he had under his com∣mand, and a considerable Band of the Peasants, fell upon them as they were
plundering, and so consequently divided, and not in any reasonable posture of de∣fence, and aster some dispute, put a great number of them to the Sword, took divers of them prisoners, and de∣livered 2000 poor Christian Captives, which they were dragging after them in chains, as likewise recovered a consi∣derable Booty, part of which he deli∣vered to the owners, and the rest he di∣stributed amongst his Souldiers. These successes of the Imperialists, as they greatly dismayed the Turks and Rebels, so they animated the Imperia∣lists, and the Princes of the Circles, in∣ducing them to hasten out their Troops, insomuch, that in a Conference held at Hasford the 27 of July, between the Bishop of Bamberg and Wirtsbourg, and the Deputies of the Elector of Branden∣burg, the Princes of Hanspach, Bareith, &c. it was resolved, That the Troops of Franconia designed for the assistance of the Emperour should begin their march on the 2 of August; it being con∣ditioned, That the Bishop and Chapter of Wirtsbourg, should for this service furnish out two Regiments of Foot, and
four Companies of Guards; and the Elector of Brandenburg, not reckoning his Quota, should assist the Emperour with a body of men under the command of the Velt Marshal Borfling: All which were immediately to be raised and sent to the Imperial camp, incamped be∣tween Krembs and Vienna, impatiently expecting those Auxiliary Troops. But from hence let us again return to the Siege of Vienna. The Turks still pressing the siege in hopes to carry the Town by Storm, or oblige the besieged to surrender upon reasonable proposals, raised divers new Batteries in the stead of those the besieg∣ed's Cannon had ruined: Which Batte∣ries they chiefly manage by Renegadoes of all Nations, to whom they give dou∣ble pay. They on the 30 of July made three attacks near Scotenburg-Gate and the Red Tower, in which they were bravely repulsed by the besieged, who came to handy blows with them with great resolution; whilst the Can∣non from the Flankers cut off the Turks in great numbers, and spared not to kill some of the Imperialists, who were
mixed, and fighting with the enemy. In these three attacks the Turks lost near 8000 men: Whereupon, the Grand Visier sent to demand a Cessation to fetch off the slain and wounded; but Count Staremberg returned answer, That he had no need of Truce, his Garrison being all in good order. The Turks scarce had time to breath, before the Imperialists making another sally, entred the Suburb called Leopolstadt; some time since possessed by the Turks; they beat them out, and put a conside∣rable number of men into it to defend it, it serving as a Flanker to the Town, and playing furiously against the Batte∣ry the Turks had raised against the Scotch-Gate, dismounting all the Cannon, and ruining the Battery, though not with∣out loss on their own part, the most stout and resolute Souldiers still keeping the Walls; the Garrison consisting of 18000 fighting men, besides a great number of the Burghers, Scholars and religious persons of all Orders, who up∣on occasion are assisting. Nor is any thing of Ammunition or Provision want∣ing, but a plenty sufficient for several
Months, according to the computation of those that by the Count's order took a narrow survey of the Magazines: Money being the thing most wanting, the Governour borrowed a considerable summ of the Religious Orders, promi∣sing to restore it with addition, if the City escape falling into the hands of the enemy; and if it should so happen, yet to make reparation, if his life and liberty were preserved; the which mo∣ney he freely and cheerfully at divers times distributed amongst his Souldiers: As likewise was so exact as to see the Provision fairly divided, that one has not more than another; thereby to prevent murmurs, animosities and mu∣tinies: Causing the whole Garrison, as well Burghers as Souldiers, to take an Oath, To defend the place to the last extremity, and never to hearken to any proposals or overtures from the enemy, how advantagious soever they may be. These resolutions, equity and bravery in the Governour, contributed not a little to the resolution and courage of the Souldiers and Citizens, the very Women appearing every where coura∣gious,
heartning and exciting their Hus∣bands to maintain and defend the City against the common Enemy without weariness or fainting. This great City, when the Turks first sat down before it, had no more than 15 or 1600 men in it, and not greatly provided with Ammu∣nition and other necessaries; but as Pro∣vidence had ordered it, just as it was in∣vested, viz. on the 14 of July, four great Vessels came up the River laden with all manner of Necessaries, and within sight of the enemy, recovered the Port: Though few expected the day before, that the Turks would have attempted a siege, in which they have always been unfortunate. For before this very City, much weaker than at present, Solyman the Magnificent lost 80000, or as some say, 100000 men; and after all that he could do, being there in person, he was obliged to raise his siege with shame and disgrace. The Duke of Lor∣rain likewise had the good luck to thrust in 13000 Foot, and 1000 Horse, be∣sides which upon occasion, the Inhabi∣tants can make 20000 fighting men; and happy was it for the City, that the
Garrison and Provision so luckily en∣tered: for the next day the Ottoman Ar∣my so closely invested it, that it was a work of great difficulty for a single per∣son to get in or out. The Country round about Vienna is destroyed and laid waft: for upon the Turks first arrival, from the Walls and Towers of the City, might be seen 40 Villages in a flame at once; and daily for a week together, were brought into the Camp, droves of such miserable Christians as the Barbarians had surpri∣zed or taken in the Castles and small Fortresses adjacent, which were not capable of standing out, but to save their lives surrendered; though they had better have dyed like Souldiers and men of courage, than fallen into the hands of so barbarous an enemy, from whom they can expect nothing but slavery: so that great are the cryes and wailing of Wo∣men and Children; which when the Wind sat on the back of the Camp, could be distinctly heard by the Be∣sieged. The King of Poland having left Cra∣caw, with the Army under his com∣mand,
marched with all dilligence to joyn the Imperial Army, and in joynt confederacy to relieve the besieged City, or to give the enemy battle. When in the mean while, the Duke of Lorrain having advice, that Count Teckely march∣ed towards Presburg with a strong pow∣er of the Hungarian Rebels and Turks, the latter being sent him by the Bassa of Buda; and taking the advantage of the juncture of affairs, he intended to be∣siege it: He detached a strong party of Horse and Foot, and marched towards them with a resolution to give them battle; which Teckely little suspected, by reason the day before he had receiv∣ed advice, that he durst not come forth of his Camp, for fear of the Ottoman Ar∣my, but too late finding his intelligence false, and that the Duke from the Walls of Presburg advanced towards him, he with his whole body of Turks and Hun∣garians, consisting of 25000 men, retired in the best order the small time would permit; but not so swift∣ly but that the Imperialists fell in with his Rear, making of them great slaughter, cutting off about 6
or 700 of them, and seizing upon most of their Baggage, Ammunition and Pro∣vision, taking in all 1000 Waggons: After which the Duke reinforced the Garrison, causing all the Boats that Teckely had brought thither, to bridge over the Danube, to be burnt; sending after him the Prince Lubomirskie, with the Polish Horse under his command; who for the space of eight miles, had the execution of the Rear-guard, which made a kind of a running fight, the Duke with the whole Army following close after. In this action the Imperi∣alists and Poles lost 100 men, and the enemy 1500. After which, Count Teckely in great confusion repassed the Waag, and the Turks separating from him, returned to Newbeusel, out of which Garrison most of them were drawn. The Duke stay'd upon the bank of the River Marck, two miles from Presburg, to have notice of their moti∣on, as fearing they might wheel about and fall into Moravia; sending after them General Dunwald with 1000 Light-Horse, continually to give him an ac∣count of what he could learn in re∣lation
to their inclination to action; and so rising with the part of the Army he had brought, he returned to his Camp near Krembs, upon the Danube, there to expect the Elector of Bavaria and the King of Poland, both which were near at hand, with a resolution to joyn him; these two Princes marching in person at the head of their Armies, both which Armies amount to 45000 fighting men, the flower of those Countrys. Upon whose approach, the Grand Vi∣sier sent orders to the Bassa of Buda, to draw up a body of 2000 men, out of the neighbouring Garrisons, and dispatch them immediately to the Army, as likewise Ammunition and Provision with all speed; the Army, by reason of the late Convoys falling into the hands of the Imperialists, being much distressed for want of Provision: He likewise dispatched a Chiaus to the Grand Signior, to give him a relation of what had happened since the siege; wherein, as some fugitives report, he gave the Chians a strict command, to assure him, that he would suddenly send him the Keys of Vienna: And as soon as
he was departed, that he might inform the Grand Signior he left the Camp in action, he furiously battered, the Red Tower, thundring incessantly against it with 12 pieces of Cannon and Culver∣ing flinging Bullets of 52 and 58 pound weight; yet through the vigilance of the Defendants, did small damage be∣sides renting the Battlements and Cur∣tain of the Wall. The Viceroy of Croatia, whilst these transactions were on foot, having drawn together 13000 men for the defence of that Countrey; having notice that a bo∣dy of Tartars and Turks, the Refuse of the Garrisonupon the Frontiers, were rov∣ing abroad, and had done great mischief in firing Villages, burning the Hay and Corn, ravishing the Women, putting the men to the Sword that were unable for service, and drowning the Children in the Rivers: to put a stop to this barbarous torrent, and to repay the in∣humane Rake-Hells in their own coin, he drew out 1700 Horse and 5000 Foot, with which crossing the Country the nearest way, he on the 9 of August found them triumphing in all manner of rapine
and cruelty, when leaving 3000 Foot, and 1000 Horse under the covert of a woody Grove, he advanced with the rest towards the enemy; who being 6 or 7000 strong, after some consultation, threw themselves into a posture of de∣sence, and prepared to give him Battle, with whom he as resolutely joyned, having first wheeled about, and taken the advantage of the Ground, so that he might train them into the Ambush∣ment, and by that means inclose them; which fell out so to his expectation, that after a furious charge, the Ambus∣cade burst out at their back with loud shouts, which they seconded with so many messengers of death; the enemies being as it were taken in a toil, were killed on all sides, without making further resistance, all the Plain being strewed with their ruins and miserable slaughter, of which not above 2000 escaped, the rest being killed and taken Prisoners: Of the Croats in the first charge, 30 were killed, and as many wounded, and in all they lost but 120. By this action 700 Christians were deli∣vered from miserable captivity, and 1000
head of Cattle recovered, with much Baggage, and store of Proivision, which they had gathered up in the Countries through which they had passed; and certain it is, had not a timely stop been put to this torrent, before it had swelled great, as it would soon have done by the conjunction of 8000 more of the same Tribe, who were advancing; but upon notice of evil success, retired: It would have put he whole Country into a great consternation and confusion. Count Leslie being sent to secure Mo∣ravia from the incursions of the enemy, with a Body of 4 or 5000 men, took a Convoy of 78 Waggons loaden with Ammunition and Provision, on its way to Teckely's Camp on the banks of the Waag, putting those that kept it, to flight, though without any more slaughter than of one man; for the Convoyers being aware of his coming, left the Waggons, and shifted for themselves in the Woods. To know the state of the besieged, the Duke of Lorrain on the 8 of August sent an Ingineer disguised in Country habit, who under the favour of the Night pas∣sed the Leaguers, and the next night
had the good success to return in safety to the Imperial Camp; bringing an ac∣count, That the besieged were reso∣lute in the defence of the City, full of courage and vigor, not having lost above 3000 men since the siege began; and that on the other hand, the Turks ap∣peared less vigorous in their attempts than at first they did, and that they were in a manner distressed for want of Provision; a mortal sickness at the same time raging in the Camp, of which ma∣ny dyed, they not being computed to have lost less than 20000 men in the divers attacks they have made in the sal∣lies made by the besieged, and those that have perished by the Pestilence, besides several Boats full of sick and wounded men, that have been sent up the Danube; whilst all the Troops of the Circles are on their march, and daily arrive at the Imperial Camp, so that the Duke of Lorrain is 38000 strong, and will be 59000 strong, when the Brandenburg and Bavarian Troops have joyned him, who are daily expected; so that in conjun∣ction with the King of Poland, the Army will consist of 88 or 90000 fighting men,
so that a mortal battle must of necessity insue, if the Visier raise not his Siege before the latter end of this Month of August, 1683. The Rebells having intelligence of the Duke of Lorrains being retired from the Walls of Presburg, with a body of 3000 Horse and Foot, fell into Moravia, of which the Duke had no sooner notice, but he commanded out a party of Polo∣nian Horse to stay their advancing fur∣ther into that fruitful Country, which party had the success they desired; for overtaking the Rebells as they were ravaging and plundering the Countrey, and a little before strengthened, by joyn∣ing a party before in those parts, un∣der the command of the Prince of Lich∣tensteyne, they charged them with such fury, that although they were inferior to them in number, they killed 5 or 600 upon the place, and took a like number Prisoners: Upon notice of which the Duke of Lorrain drew nearer to Vienna, incamping with the gross of his Army at Enzesdorf, not far from Fienna, to be ready to succour the besieged, if oc∣casion require it. To whom daily re∣sorted
the Troops of the Princes in mo∣tion, as the Electors of Bavaria, Bran∣denburg, Saxony; the Princes of Newburg, Hanault, and other Territories depen∣dant on the Empire, coming different ways for their better convenience, bringing with them great store of Provi∣sion: Which obliged the Turks to press on the siege, battering the Town with∣out intermission, and springing divers Mines, the Bassa not sparing the lives of his Men, but thrust them as it were into the mouth of Slaughter, so that after the springing the Mines, which ru∣ined a part of the besiegeds Out-works, they lodged upon the Counterscarp, and possessed it for the space of an Hour; when the besieged sallying, beat them out with great slaughter, insomuch that the Bodyes of the slain did not a little annoy the Imperialists, who used great diligence to countermine the Turks; which they did so succesfully, that they met them in one of their Mines, and not only frustrated their design, but drove them out with great slaughter, seising on the Powder they had brought to overthrow the Palizadoes, so that
maugre the Ottoman stratagems, they prevailed little or nothing. For the be∣sieged incouraged by the Count d' Starem∣berg their Governour, fought like Lyons, even in the Works and Breaches, made by the Turkish Cannon, where the Shot falls thickest; when to encourage the Souldiers the more, the Townsmen bring out their Stores of Provision. Yet the Turks continuing their Mines, lodg∣ed themselves under the advantage of a fifth or sixth Mine, sprung in the Ditch; but were soon sent thence with a showre of Shot shot from the Wall: Whereupon the Duke of Lorrain sent a man into the City, to know the state thereof, who by a certain sign given, assu∣red the Duke, that he was got safe into it, which signal was by hanging out a long blue Streamer upon the White-Tower of that City; he also received orders, to injoyn the Governour, if he perceived the Turks to advance so far, as to indan∣ger the place, he should hang out divers Flags, as signals of the danger, and that rather than it should fall into the hands of the Enemy, he would attempt to raise the siege without any further delay;
but the besieged, though they lost a great many resolute Souldiers, and some Commanders of note, declined to hang out any such signal of danger, but brave∣ly defended their Works, though the Turks made frequent Assaults, as not expecting long to continue the siege, whether it came to a Battle or not, by reason of the great scarcity in their Camp: which was occasioned by the Imperialists taking divers Convoys of Provision, insomuch that they fed upon Horse-flesh as dainty fare, and an Am∣munition bread sold at five Dollars; all their Forrage for their Horses being so little, that 300 were starved to death in one Week. Yet the Bassa sent again to summon the City, making larger offers than formerly, with many pro∣mises of Liberty, free exercise of Re∣ligion, and other immunities; which were rejected with disdain: Whereupon he commanded a general assault to be made, which on the 5 and 6 of August was continued, almost without intermis∣sion, thinking so to tire out the besieg∣ed, and by that means oblige them to a surrender; but so far were they from
acquiring what they aimed at, that after they had possessed themselves of one point of the Counterscarp, the besieged sprung a mine before the Work, blow∣ing about 100 of the Infidels into the Air, and following the advantage, sal∣lied at two or three Ports, upon which a sharp conflict began, coming at length to handy-blows, in which it was not supposed, that less than 2000 of the Be∣siegers fell, though at the same time they played against the wall from 7 Batteries. The City making a brave defence, a party of Imperial Horse passing the Da∣nube, fell upon 300 Turks, who had po∣sted themselves in a small Island of what River, and put most of them to the Sword, bringing away 200 Camels la∣den with provision, as also a great deal of rich Furniture: Of which success the Duke of Lorrain had no sooner received advice, but another Messenger brought him a Letter from the King of Poland to give his Highness an account, that he with his Army, consisting of between 30 and 40000 men, would be within sight of Vienna by the 20 of August, and that he marched in three bodies for the
better conveniency and speed, desiring the Duke not to hazzard any thing till his arrival; upon notice of which, the Em∣perour nominated the Count Schafgates to go and complement that King at his arrival on the Frontiers. Price Lubo∣mirski being the mean while abroad, in∣countered a party of the Hungarian Re∣bels, as they were plundering on the Borders of Silesia, and put them to the rout, killing 300 of them upon the place, and took 31 Prisoners, and 8 Ensigns, with the loss of eight of his men, and ten wounded. Yet had not the Pala∣tine of Hungary the like success, for du∣ring his march towards Croatia, to joyn the Viceroy, most of his Souldiers be∣ing Hungarians, deserted him by night, the greater part of them joyning with the Rebells. The Turks being earnest to subdue Vienna before the arrival of the Poles, on the 16 of August made a terrible assault, which they continued for the space of eight hours, springing several Mines, by which means they became masters of a Ravelin, and lodged themselves upon the Counterscarp; which caused the be∣sieged
to make a brisk sally, and come to dint of Sword, so that a bloody and doubtful fight insued: at what time the Christians being reinforced, the Turks were beaten out of the Works they had taken, with the loss of 5000 men, besides those that were wounded: Nor was the loss inconsiderable on the part of the Imperialists, for in this action they lost 150 resolute Souldiers, and had near as many wounded; amongst the which, were Count Staremberg and the General Souches, who adventuring too far in pursuit of the enemy, re∣ceived slight hurts, one being shot into the Legg with a Turkish Arrow, and the other by the springing a Mine. This assault over, News was brought to the Imperial Camp, that Count Ca∣prara was upon his way to the Imperial Court, and in his company a Turkish Aga, who had in charge to treat about raising the Siege of Vienna, which the Grand Signior was content to do in con∣sideration that Commorra and Raab might be put into his hands, but these demands seemed so unreasonable and extravagant, that they took not effect.
And thus Reader have I give you an account of the state of this War, so dangerous to Christendom, from its first breaking out, to this day, viz. the 16 of August, 1683. according to the best and most credible advice that could be procured, and to Heaven remit the success of the great event of the acti∣on at hand; the which may it happen prosperous to the Christians ought to by the Prayer of every good Christian: And so I shall proceed to give you a tast of Turkish Cruelties used towards their Slaves, and such as they be force or fraud carry into miserable bondage.
A brief relation of the Turkish Cru∣elties towards such Christians as they take Captives, with their man∣ner of felling and disposing them, the Labours they put them to, and their several Orders; together with the bestiality used upon youths, Fe∣male Children and Women, by the Turks; most lamentable and detest∣able to be told or thought. REader, having given you an account of the state of the War between the two Empires of Germany and Turky, I shall now proceed to a more particular relation of the Turkish cruelties towards such Ill-stared Christians, as have the misfortune to fall into their hands, whose barbarity is such, that they know not how to shew mercy, nor have compas∣sion upon poor suffering wretches, who continually groan under thrice worse than Aegyptian bondage, having none
on Earth to appeal to for mitigation of their miseries; yet such is the courage of most of them, that they will rather chuse to undergo their almost insupport∣able yoke under the tyranny of cruel Task-masters, than by base and unchristi∣an cowardice deny the Lord, that bought them at the price of his precious blood, all their hopes upon earth being the expe∣ctation of the Christian Sword, under the leading of the Christian Princes. But to the purpose. When at any time the Grand Signior has raised an Army for the invasion of any Christian Country, then like so many Vulturs or beasts of prey, a sort of Merchants, called by the Turks, Men-Scorcers, hover about it in great num∣bers, to buy such Captives of the rude Souldiers as they shall take, either in War or by surprize; and for that pur∣pose bring upon Camels, Mules, Drome∣daries, all manner of Provision, Cloaths and other Merchandise to truck, as like∣wise great bundles of Cords, and Chests full of Chains, to tye or bind them to∣gether, in one of which they fasten about 50 or 60 together. These sort of the De∣vils
Brokers, purchase of the Souldiers or Free-Booters, all the Captives that escape the Sword, with a proviso, That the tenth fall to the share of the Grand-Signior, or to the value, for they have liberty to purchase his Prisoners of the Tefftardar or chief Treasurer, or his De∣puties; nor have they any Merchandize so profitable or such sure money as Slaves, whom they hale along like dogs, or drive before them like flocks of Sheep, for the most part naked, exposed to heat, cold and hunger: when if at any time they faint or are not able to go, they lay them cross a Horse, Mule, Camel or Dromedary, upon their Bellies, ty∣ing their Hands and Legs under the Bel∣ly of the Beast, as they use in England to carry Calves; but if they find them sick and not likely to recover, they cast them into the next ditch, and leave them to be devoured of Wolves and other voracious Beasts. Those that are aged, being accounted unprofitable, seldom escape the Sword, unless they are of such Eminency, that they expect a great ran∣some for his restauration: And these mi∣serable Christians they send all over the
Empire, driving them from Market to Market like beasts, so that sometimes they carry 2 or 300 in a drove, bound in several parcels, feeding them for the most part with Bread and Water, or Rice Cakes. When they are newly captivated or bought, the first thing the Devil prompts their Patron or Masters to, is by sharp threats, mixed with fair promises to in∣duce them to renounce their Christiani∣ty, and perswade them to admit of Circumcision; the which if they yield to, they find somewhat more civil treatment, but are for ever debared of returning to their own Country, or gaining their liberty: all hope, which is sometimes a comfort to the miserable, is taken away till death set them free; and if, after they become Turks, they endeavour to escape, or return to the profession of the Christian Religion, the Law is, That they shall be thrust into a hot Furnace. Such as are thought firm, and not subject to fly or desert their Pa∣trons, are admitted to their Masters mili∣tary imployments, and can only be made free when age renders them useless, and
that upon courtesie, for their extraordi∣nary service in their Youth, or some notable exploit, or when the Master up∣on being hurt in the war, or in great danger of death, bequeaths him liberty. They permit them to marry, but it is to make their posterity as well as them∣selves miserable: for their Children, when they come to maturity, are made slave as well as themselves; therefore those that consider the fatal consequences that attend such Matrimony, decline it. Those that refuse to be circumcised, or to renounce their Faith in Christ, are miserable, unless skilled in some extra∣ordinary art, whereby they can greatly profit their Masters. Learned Men, Priests, and Gentlemen, not inured to hardship, or capable of any Mechanick art, are miserably dealt with; and the worse, that they by making known their miserable condition, by Letter, to their Friends in Christendom, if they have any, may thereby be moved to ransome them: They cause them to walk with naked Legs, Feet, Head, and Backs, feeding them with the bread of affliction; no new Cloaths ever suc∣ceeding
their old ones, unless a little course Linnen to hide their Privities. And in this miserable condition they hurry them over Rocks and Mountains, though never so rough and irksome to their gall'd bleeding Feet; so that many times one or other dyes for loss of blood issuing from his Feet, cut by Flints or sharp Marble, and so ends his wretched Life: Those that faulter or lag, they whip along with Scourges; and if they cannot, then they fasten them on horse∣back as aforesaid, and often torture them to make them confess what craft or han∣dy labour they are skilled in. Upon buying these miserable wretches, they always feel their Joynts, to observe if they are strong set, well knit, and free from imperfection; they feel likewise their Hands, by the hardness or softness of which, they know whether they have been inured to labour or not; they have also especial regard to their Mouth, to observe if they Teeth be strong, firm set, and sound, that so they be capable of eating Rice, Bisket, or any other course and hard Diet: And lastly, they take great notice of their Eyes, to see if
there be no dulness nor blemish in them tending to blindness. From these obser∣vations, much the same as we use in buying Cattle, they conclude the good∣ness or badness of Captives. As for their Lodging, it is in an Out-shed, upon stalks, Leaves of trees, or course Mats, not being permitted to come with∣in doors, unless upon extraordinary occa∣sion, let the weather be never so ex∣tream cold. As for the Women they are continually exposed to the horrid lusts of their Merchants or Buyers, locked up in strong places, and kept at hard labour, where you may hear con∣tinual howlings and wailings: Nor does the age of six years protect female chil∣dren from the horrid lust of these Infi∣dels, nor the youths escape their filthy Sodomy, to which they are almost all of them addicted. These poor wretches, viz. the men, some are yoked like Oxen, and forced to draw the plough, others keep Sheep upon the bleak Mountains, and some again till the Ground with Spades, dig up Trees, saw Timber, grind in Mills, wash Cloth, fetch Water, drain Fish∣ponds,
make Bricks, or the like servile Labours, to which they are hurried by day-light, and till night, continue at it without Meat or Drink, seldom being allowed any unless at night, unless they have some way to get money to pur∣chase it. Maids are severally forced to perpetual labour, excluded both from the compa∣ny and sight of Men, unless at such times as they attend their Mistresses to their Country Houses, to the Bath, or the Graves of their departed Friends. If any Man be taken Prisoner, toge∣ther with his Wife and Children, he is commonly disposed of to some Gentle∣man Turk, to be imployed in his Coun∣try house, there to labour in his Vineyard, till his Meadows, and plant Trees, look after his Cattle, and the like: all their Children being likewise made slaves; but if they persevere in the Chri∣stian Faith, there is a time allotted fre∣quently for their delivery; but that is always in the choice of the Master, and at his courtesie. If after their making free, they are desirous to return into their own Coun∣trey,
they have Letter Patents given them for their Journey; but this is only to such as persevere in Christianity, for those that abjure it, are never suffered to return, though some do now and then, by making escape; yet some∣times they are made free, but in lieu thereof pay a certain annual stipend to their Master, and the tenth of all they possess to the Grand Signior. But most miserable of all are those that are sold to Husbandmen, who for the most part make them draw the Plough or keep Sheep as aforesaid; those that are made Shepherds, seldom throughout the year come into any House, but wander from Mountain to Mountain according as they can find Pasture; yet have the Master and Dame a Tent and a Curtain, one to lye and reside in, the other to carry all their Furniture and Provision: As for the Priests and Clergymen, they do not only lay heavy tasks upon them, but expose them to all ignominy and scorn possibly, yet greatly rejoyce when by perswasion or compulsion, they can oblige any one of them to renounce their faith.
Some Turks have more humanity, and abate something of this rigorous usage, giving their Slaves now and then a small Stipend, which they most∣ly keep to defray their charges into Chri∣stendom, if ever they obtain their liberty; yet in this donation they have politick ends, which are to ob∣lige them not to run away, or to in∣duce them to imbrace the Mahumetan su∣perstition. For seldom it is that they give any thing to such as are already turned Mahumetans, knowing that at the peril of their lives, they attempt their flight. Their beating is unmerci∣ful, insomuch that some of them lye by it 6 or 7 Weeks, and many there are that never recover, which the Turk no otherways regardeth than for his profit: for could he make as much of a Christian dead as alive, they would suffer few or none within their power to live. Thus is the usage of the Slaves that fall into the hands of common Turks: And now I shall, Reader, give you an account of the treatments of such as fall to the Grand Signior by decimation, and are reserved for his use,
The old in years, he sells for Hus∣band men, to be sure if any such hap∣pen amongst his share of Prisoners, but rarely do they; for for the most part, the Sword devours them; these yield him but a small and inconsiderable price, yet will they not permit them to be ran∣somed for thrice the value they yield. The young Men and Maids, they con∣fine in the Seraglios, there to be taught and instructed in useful Arts, as making Bows, Arrows, Carpets, and the like; but first they oblige them to a renuntiati∣on of their Faith, and to be Circumcised, diligently observing their Lineaments, Features, and the like; as also their prompt Wit and aptness, and accordingly they bring them up, some to Artifices, others to learn the Mahumetan Law, o∣thers to exercise Arms, and allow them a stipend of two or three Aspers a day, to provide them with Cloaths and Diet, till they are perfected, 60 of which As∣pers make a Crown English. Over them they have severe Task-masters, to ex∣act a daily account of their Exercise; and if they perform it not, then are they unmercifully beaten with Rods, Staves,
or other things of more cruel invention. When they begin to grow perfect, they are inrolled, some in the order of the Bowmen, other some in the order of the Janizaries, and those that have lovely Faces are exposed to the horrid and so∣domitical lust of their abominable lords; and for that purpose the Genitals are cut away: so that when they have been used as long as the Turk things convenient, then are they put to the offices of Eunuchs, to attend on the La∣dy-Concubines Horses, Mules, or some Kitchen imploy. Virgins, such as are of extraordinary beauty, comeliness or composition of Body, are chosen out for Concubines, and thrust into a more narrow retire∣ment. Those that are but indifferent handsome, they put to attend upon others, and to wash the privy parts of the Turkish Women after they have eva∣cuated, which is a thing always observed amongst them. Others they imploy at spinning, winding Silk, weaving Car∣pets, carding Wooll, and the like, ha∣ving first obliged them to renounce the Christian Faith; for no Christian may
be suffered to inhabit within the Wall of the Seraglio; and from these are cut off all hopes of returning into their own Countrey, being obliged in a strong and barbarous Land, to bewail their hard fates and wretched Captivity, wishing that they had fallen by the Sword amongst their Friends, rather than to be excluded from all humane society, unless such as is more detestable and hateful to them than Cimmerian dark∣ness it self, which frequently drives them into such despair, that they lay vi∣olent hands upon themselves, chusing strangling rather than life, others pine away, and some starve themselves to death on purpose, others are beaten till of the blows and bruises they expire, and thus miserable wretches is their state un∣der the triumphing tyranny of the barba∣rous Infidels, who know not how to shew mercy. The manner of making Christians Turks, and to renounce their Christi∣an Religion is thus: The Mufti, or Chief Priest, or some of his Agents, after the Circumcision, which is done by cutting off their Foreskin with a
sharp Knife, obliges them to say these words in the Turkish Language after them, viz. Law illawheh illaw Allawh Muhammed resoul Allawh: that rendred into English is thus, There is no God but one alone, and Mahumet is his Messenger or Prophet. The Women and Virgins on∣ly say the words, as not being capable of the former part of the Ceremony. Another way the Grand Signior has to get Slaves than by War, viz. All the Christian Provinces, his tributaries, or such Christians as live in his dominions, pay tribute-Children, having their Chil∣dren snatched from them at the age of three or four years, and these are taught the Mahumetan Superstition, and put under the tutorage of divers severe Ma∣sters, to be instructed and educated in all manner of Arts, but especially in feats of Arms, and out of these they chuse the Janizaries and Spahi, which are for Horse and Foot, the support of the Ottoman Empire, being more dead∣ly enemies to the Christians than natu∣ral born Turks.
From these and the like miseries poor wretches divers times attempt making their escape, which they cannot do without great danger and hazzard of their lives, especially such as are in Asia, for they have no way to get into Europe, but by swimming over the Hellespont into Europe. which cannot be effected with∣out great danger, and frequent loss of Lives. But because many may imagine that in so large a dominion, these poor wretches may easily shift from their cru∣el Masters, especially such as are imploy∣ed abroad, I shall to convince that, speak something of that matter, and so pro∣ceed to give a more particular account of the present miseries of Hungary and Au∣stria, than in the series of this History has occurred. European Slaves indeed with more fa∣cility make their escapes than those that are sold into Asia, Aegypt, and the Islands of the Sea, by reason they have only Rivers to pass, which for the most part, at some place or another are fordable, or so narrow that they may easily be swum over; but such as are in Asia, must of necessity pass the Hellespont, as is afore∣said,
and such as design it, for the most part, attempt it in Harvest time, by that means sheltering themselves in fields of Corn all day, and by night travel; Corn and Herbs being their only Food, the greatest part of their Journey, they car∣rying no other Provision than Salt, to season them; and in this manner their lives are exposed to ravening Wolves, Bears and Lyons, choosing rather to be devoured, if it should happen so, then to return to their Currish Masters, whose mercies are cruelty. When they come to the Hellespont, be∣tween Callipolis and the Towns of Sestos and Abydos, which guard the Straight, called by the Turks, Begaz Asser, they cut down Timber, and make Floats or Rafts, upon which they get, sometimes to the number of 20 or 30, carrying no∣thing with them but Salt and Herbs, when if the Wind prove favourable, they are wasted to the European Shoar, in five or six Hours, which they con∣clude a fortunate sign, or presage of their escaping out of miserable thraldom; but if the wind prove contrary, or the Sea rage high, they are carryed away with
the stream into the main Ocean, where they inevitably perish, unless some Ship happen in time to take them up, or some∣times being forced back upon the Asian Shore, they fall into the hands of their pursuers; but if they can attain the wished Shoar, they betake themselves to the Mountains, and by the guidance of the Stars, pass North and North∣west, living upon Roots, Acorns and Herbs; unless now and then they can plunder a Shepherds Tent of Provision, in attempting of which some of them are frequently killed, and sometimes they kill the Turks; but if they chance to be taken and returned to their old Masters, then woe is them, their con∣dition is more miserable than before, and better it had been for them, if they had dyed ere they had been born; for then they are not only load∣ed with chains of Iron about their Wastes and Necks, of an extraordi∣nary weight, which bend them al∣most double, and obliged to wear them during the pleasure of their cruel Pa∣tron, and in the mean time work and labour not only like Horses, but
hung up by the Heels, and scourged till deep furrows are made in their Backs and Sides, and in that bleed∣ing and wretched posture, rubbed o∣ver with Gunpowder, Salt-Peter or powder of Glass; and there suffered to hang in miserable torment, till or∣der is given for their taking down, which sometimes is not the pleasure of the imperious Turk under eight or ten Hours; so that in vain they wish for death that frees them. Others have the Soals of their Feet gashed or ripped, and Salt rammed into the wounds with Sticks or Irons made for that purpose. Some again they confine in dark and dismal Dunge∣ons full of Toads, Mice, and all manner of noisome and offensive Ver∣mine; where they many times suf∣fer them to perish through Hunger, Thirst, Cold or noysomeness of the place; or sometimes to rid them∣selves of a miserable life, they rash∣ly and unadvisedly dash their own Brains out against the Walls. And thus, Reader, is the miserable state of such as fall into the hands of the
merciless barbarians, though in their flight they are often assisted by the Greeks, who are Christians, these men hazzarding their Lives and confiscation of all their Goods frequently to preserve them; for such is the Law, that if any under the Grand Signiors protection shall be aiding or concealing, maintain∣ing or comforting Slaves in their flight. These good men, often, notwithstand∣ing do harbour them in their Houses, and procure Shipping for their passage into Italy, or other Christian Countreys; but in these attempts more lose their Lives by the dangers of Travelling, Shipwrack, Enemies, wild-Beasts, and starving, than escape, or possibly can escape. The Turks have an incantation, which they hold effectual to prevent the flight of their Slaves, which thus they perform: The name of the Slave they write in parchment, and hang it up in the House or Tent, according as they are furnished; for some of them have no Houses, but wander after their Flocks in Tents, the which having done with horrible Curses and Imprecations, they
charge the Slave, if ever he attempt to escape, swearing by Mahumet, that all the curse that can be invented will befal him, if he do; conceiving that this by the help of the Devil, will afright the fugitive, with the fear of meeting Ly∣ons, Bears, Dragons, Tigers, and Wolves, in his way, that he shall pe∣rish by hunger, be swallowed up by the Rivers, or be intombed in the depth of the Sea, or that the Heavens will grow dismal and black, and tempestuous storms arise, insomuch that these asto∣nishments will bring him back, and indeed they have their wished effects upon the Mahumetan Slaves: but those that believe in Christ, and revere his name, cannot be Bug-beared with things altogether ridiculous and insignificant; and therefore after such they look more narrowly, having spies in divers parts to give notice of their flight, and to pursue them, between whom and the Fugitives happen sharp incounters, inso∣much, that some on either side are fre∣quently killed, the Slaves chusing ra∣ther to dye fighting like men, than to be brought back, to be tortured and
used worse than Dogs; if those that are returned have killed any person, al∣though in their own defence, then are they dipped over Head and Ears in a Cauldron of boyling Oyl; then taken out, being alive, and cast into a deep Dungeon, and there suffered to perish, or else have their flesh launced, and be∣ing rubbed over with Honey, or some sweet liquor, are hanged up alive for the Bees, Hornets, Wasps, and such In∣fects to prey upon: and in that miserable condition, frequently do the Vulturs and other rapacious Fowl feed upon and tear them, whilst living, and in this condi∣tion some hang 4 or 5, nay sometimes 6 or 7 dayes, before they dye: Others they wrap up in Bears Skins, or Swines Skins, and expose them to the fury of Dogs, with which they bait them to Death. These and many more are the Torments these poor Creatures indure, under their cruel Masters, Those that are taken by the Tartars are worse used, if worse can possible be, for they having little or no imployment, for them, (as being a roving, thievish, and uncivilized people, living altoge∣ther
upon theft and rapine, especially that part adjoyning to Christendom) they keep them in dark places, cruelly beating and torturing them, thereby to oblige them to send their lamentable stories to their Friends in Christendom, (which indeed are such as might move hearts of Flint) thereby to incite and stir them up to purchase them at great Ransoms: for to that end do the Tartars carry them away, and if they find with∣in one year, that no enquiry is made af∣ter them, nor any ransome likely to be obtained, then do they fell them to the Turks; of which vicissitude divers of them are glad, although the change is most miserable, for as the old Pro∣verb amongst us is, They, as it were, leap out of the Frying-pan into the Fire. And thus Reader, are the miseries of poor afflicted Captives, whose part, during their being in service, none dare take but Heaven, to whom they sigh and cry aloud for deliverance, filling the Air with plaints, lamentations and woes still groaning under the oppressing ty∣ranny of their cruel Task-masters, who exceed those of Aegypt, for they not
only oblige them to make Brick with∣out Straw, but feed them continually with Bread of Affliction, stripes, and daily menaces, tempting them hourly to deny the Lord that bought them with his precious blood, thereby ever∣lastingly to damn their precious and im∣mortal Souls; whose name, they to their grief, are obliged to hear blas∣pheemed, reproached, and his God∣head reviled and contemned.
