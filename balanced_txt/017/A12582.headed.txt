¶ A forme howe we shal know God. THe effecte of holy scripture cō∣sistyth chefly yn two partis / That is. In knowlege of God & owre selues. We shall kno∣we God fowre mannere of ways. Fyrst yf we pryntyt yn owre hertes by a certen fayth / God to be ynfynitte wys∣bdam / rightwysnes / goodnes / verite / vertw and lyffe / & whā soeuere thes vertws er sene or don yn ony place / to be only of hym / and of none othere / as all myracles / and preser∣uacyons of mene and of al thynges that is good. We must only ascrybe to God and to no saynte / othere yn heuen or erthe / as me∣ny do. ygnorātly for lake of thys knowlege.Baruch. 3. Iacob. 1. The secunde way to knouwe God / is to beleue all thyngis.Prouer. 1 Psal. 148. Danie. 3. Roma. 1. Whych er yn heuyne and yn erthe / to be creatyde yn hys glory / & that eche creature owghte to serue hym by ryght. by the reson of theyr creacion / and nature / also they must ynspecte hys cōmaundment / obay hys mayeste / and knowlege hym yn obayunge / to be theyere lorde and kynge. Thurdly we must confesse hym to be a ryghtuse youge / and therfore shall reuengePsalm. 7. Roma. 2.
strayghtly in them which declyne from his cōmaūdimētis / Which do nott obay his will by all thingis / which shall thinke / specke / or do ony thinge else then thos which pertayne to his glory / and honore.Roma. 2. Forthly we must cōsydere / that he is mercyfull and meke / and to resayue mercy fully synneres & wreches / which do drawe to his mercy / and apprehen¦de his fayth / always redy to forgeue if ony do are forgenesse / to suckure if ony do instā∣ly deseyre his helpe / to saue if ony wyl retur∣ne and fyre theyre holl trust in him.Psal. 103. Iesa. 55. Psalm. 25 &. 85. ¶ A forme to knowe owre selues. WE shall knowe owre one persons thus / We owght to cōsydere owr fyrste fathere Adam / to be created to the ymage and simylitude of God / that is in wysdam / rightwysnes / indude wyth holy¦nes / & so cleuynge to God by thes geftis of grace / shulde euere lyue in him / if he had per¦seuerid & stande suerly in this clernes of na∣ture / which he toke of God. But after he was corrupte in synne / this ymage and simy¦litude of God was seducte & blottyd.Gene. 1. he lo∣ste all goodnes of godly grace / by which heGene. 3.
might aperseueryd (if he hade willyd) in the way of trute / and lyffe. By syne he is deuy∣dyd fare from God & made a nothere mane / robbyd and spowilide of all wyssdam / right∣wysnes / vertwe & lyffe / Which he cāne not haue but only of God.Roma. 5. Wherfore nothynge else is lefte to man / but ygnoraūce / iniquite / wekenes / dethe / and yougmente / which aer the fruttis of synne / Which calamyte did not fal only in him but is shede also in them that cum of his seede / Therfor all men which er¦borne of Adam terrestrial / aer ygnoraunte & voyd of God / peruers / corrupte / & destitute of all goodnes / Owre thowght worde and ded euer a genste godis wyll / although we showe sum goodnes in forme / neuerthelesse thesame inwerde affectiō of the mende aby∣dith in his fylthynes / and blynde peruersite / The yougmente of whiche mende or herte / partayn only to God / which letyll regarde the owght werde shynynge / but only be hol∣de the secretes of the herte.Iere. 17. Therfor lett a man haue of him selffe neuer so bowtyfull a face consernyng holynes / it is nothinge els but hypocrisy / and before God also abomy∣nacion / by cause lyuynge inflesse peruers co¦gitacions of mynde and corruptible deseyrs be euer in man.1. Reg. 16. Iere. 17.
ALthowgh truly we be so borne / that there is nothinge lefte in vs to do ony thinge which is accepte or cane be to God / nor is not lefte in owre vertwe to pacyfy or to make acceptable to him / neuer the lesse / we do not sesse to be detters in that thinge / which we cane not geue / or restore / In as muche we be the creaturs of God / & he beyn¦ge all mighty do not sesse to creat / and conser¦ue vs most wrechyd & synfull / therfor er we euer bownde to serue his honor and glory in knowlegyng his goodnes / and owr one in∣firmyte in obseruyge his cōmaundmentes. Nor it is not lawful to prēetde an excusaciō / by cause faculte or abilyte is absente or lake / and as wast full detters which aer not abyll to pay. Truly it is owre fawt & synne which hold vs bownde that we can nethere wyll or may do good.Ioan. 8. Roma. 7. But whan God is the yousie reuēgere of syns / it be houythe that we kno∣welege owre selues worthy maledictiō / & to deserue yougmente of eternall dethe. Truly there is nō that wyllith / or may do thos thin¦gis which partayne to owre offece / duty or iustificacion. Wherfor in scripture we er cal∣lyd the childrene of yre / and condempnacion and youge vs all hedlyngis in to dethe andEphe. 2. Roma. 3.
perdicion / Therfore there is nothinge lefte to man / wherin he shuld seeke his rightwys∣nes / vertw / lyff / & helth in him selffe / which all thingis aer but in one God / from whom man sett a parte & deuidide / before him selffe shall not fynde / but infelicite / vnabilite / ini∣quite / deth / and the same hells / that is / the vttermoste malediction for synne / which is the returninge in to erthe / and in to the obli∣uyusnes of godes blissyngis and geftis.Osee. 13. LEft man shuld be ygnorante of thes thyngis / the lorde dyd geue / and in mā¦nere prynte in the hertis of all men a lawe / which is callyd the lawe of nature / This la∣we truly is nō othere thynge thene mans cō¦schyens / or for knowlege / which is inwerde∣ly a recorde to vs of thos thyngis which we owe dwely to God / and do showe vs that which is good and yll / and therfore shall ac∣cuse and hold vs gilty / whils we er knowne to owre selues / not to be (as we owght) of abilite to make satisfaccion for owre offencis and mysdedes / that is by owre workis can neuere satisfy or purches agen the rightwys∣nes / vertw / and lyffe / which aer loste by owr one freewyll.Roma. 2. The caus of the nat∣rall lawe.
The cause of the lawe of Moyses ANd by cause man after werdes was & is swolne by arrogaunce & pryde / and so blyndide by his one loue / that he can not be holde his one selffe / and descende in him selffe / and to knowlege his one wrechidnes and mysery / the lorde dyd put to vs a lawe writtyn / by which we er leruyd of the parfe∣cie rightwysnes which the lorde require / and what mānere a rightwysnes it is / and howe we shall fulfyl it / and that is if we fyxe owr selues growndly and holly in God / & whan in all thingis that we thinke / deseyre / speke or do we intende and square it to his honore and glory. And this lawe writtine do showe to vs howe fare we be absente from the right way. And for this caus / all promissis & ma∣lediccions er putt in the same lawe / there tru¦ly the lorde do promisse / if ony shall fulfyll it perfectly & eractly by word & dede / what so euer he cōmaūde / that he wyll geue the re∣warde of eternal helth.Leuit. 18. Wherby he showe the same {per}fectnes of lyffe to be the very right∣wysnes / which is towght in the lawe / & so to be hade before him / and that this parfection of lyffe were worthy suche a rewarde / if by ony mens it might befownde a monge men.Deut. 27. Agen he promisse malediction in all men /
and pronowsyth an eternal iougment of de∣the / which do not obserue plentyusly & with owt ony exception the hole rightwysnes / of the lawe / the which payn / malediction / and cōdempnaciō do beynde and subdue all men truly which euer hathe byne / is / or shalbe / to confesse them selues synneres and trans∣gressers of the lawe / and thes thingis truly we know by the lawe of Gode.Gala. 1. Wherfore the lawe whyls it do showe and teche vs the wyll of God the which wil to be fulfyllyd we er bowde / and whylis it showe that we do very lytyll of thos thingis / which we aer bownde to do pwrly and syncerly / it is tru∣ly a spectacle to vs in which we may se the goodnesse of God and beholde wystly owre synne / and malediction as in a classe of stele we be holde the fyllthynes & spottis of owre mouth / And this lawe is nothinge but the testimony of the naturall lawe which stere and moue ofte tymys owre memory inwer∣dly / whos monischiōs nowe by te lawe writ∣tyn is incowlkyd and dreuyne into owr her∣tis / which before we dyd not kype faythful∣ly whene the lawe of nature dyd teche vs in∣werdly.Ro. 3. &. . Nowe it is redy to vnderstāde what we ought to lerne of the lawe / truly God to
be owre creatore / almighty / lord and fathere. wherfore we owgt to geue him all dwe ho∣nor / glory and loue. Also ye must notte / by cause we be all the chyldren of yre / therfor as conseruynge owre syn̄fulnes / to be all wor∣thy malediction / iougmēt / ye at the last eter∣nall dethe. ¶ Whan we haue thus lernid owr one infirmyte then we muste not dispy∣re vtterlly / but seke remidy by his mar∣ty / & note by workis / & so he is redy to helpe for Christis sak which is his only marcy and remission of synne. THerfore if we wylle optayn helth it ys to by sowght sum othere ways then be the rightwysnes of workis / which helt is remission of synne. Furthermore whan it is not in owre selues / that is / in owr vertw and faculte to pay that we owe to the lawe / we owt to dispayrs in owronselues / & to are & lokefore helpe sum othere whare.Iacob. 4. 1. Petri. 5. And whan we thus humbyll and meke owre selues in knowleginge owr one infirmyte and wekenesse / then the lorde do a pere to vs / and extēd him selffe aesy / me¦ke / and forgeuinge / of whom it is wrytten /
that he resistyth prowde men / and geue gra∣ce to meke. If we deseyre fyrst his yre wyth faythfullnes / & axe forgeuenesse / wyth owt dowght he do remitt his yre to vs / what so mener owre synnes dyd deserue he remytt & take vs in grace / by whos grace we shall re∣sayue a owe herte / by which we wyll / and a we vertw by which we may execute his vertws.Ezech. 3. And all this truly he largly imparte  distribute vnto vs / for Iesu Christ / owre lorde / Which whan he was on God wyth te fathere / he dyd do on owre flesh / wharby he myght begyn a cūnaūte with vs / and drawe vs nere to God / from whom owre syns dyd make vs fare distaunte.Ioan. 1. Iesa. 53. Ephe. 2. Colos. 1. Which by meryth of his dethe dyd pay owre dettis to the right∣senes of God / and pacifyde his yre / rede∣ynge vs from malediction and yougmen∣t / to which we wore bownde / and bore the payne of syn̄ in his body that we myght be absoylyd by thesam. He descēdyd from heuen and brought with him all plentuusnes of he¦uynly blissyngis / which he shede in vs by a large hande / in sendynge his holy goost / by whō we er regenerate / & deliueryde from the nowre & snaris of the deuell / we ere optay∣yd by godly grace ynto the children of GodIod. 1. &. 7 Roma. 8.
and er sanctifyde to euery good worlte by whom also howe longe we aer in this mor∣tall body / all peruers couyttusues / flessly de¦seyrs and what else so euer / the crokyd / and corrupte peruersyte of nature do generate aer mortifide in vs / by whō from day to day we ere regenerate / that we myght walke in nouite of lyffe / and lyue to rightwysnes. All thes thingis eroffryd and geuen in Chryst owre lorde / truly remissiō of synne / by grace only / pece & recōsyliaciō with god / the geftis of the holy goste / if we do amplecte and take them by a certen fayth / and therby cleue to the goodnes of God / and as men restynge and nothynge doughtinge / but that the wor¦de of God is veryte and truth / which do pro¦mysese to vs all thos thingis / & thus yowyn¦nyde to him do possesse all heuenly blyssin∣gis / tresurs / and gestis goostly / which shall lede vs in to lyffe and helth / which we shall neuer optayn but by a lyuely & a true fayth whyllis we confesse all owre goodnes to be in him / we truly to be nothynge but in him / and for certente we must asucre / & promysse to owre selues / in him to be made the chyl∣dren of God / and partakers of the kyngdam of God.Ro. 3. &. 5. Ioan. 1. Roma. 8. Agen they which haue not the fa∣e
in Christe / of what degre so euer they be / what so meuer they do or go a bought / is to theyre perdicion and confusion / and iou∣gment of eternall deth abiecte from God / & excludyd from the acceptacion of all helth.Ioan. 3. 1. Ioū. 5. And whā this cognyschiō of owre selues (by which we er tought to humbyll & caste downde owre selues before God āde to seke his marcy / also this sayth which geue vs the taste of the godli goodnes / & mercy / bi which he worket wyth vs in his Chryst) is not of vs / or put in owre faculte / god is to be prayd that he do bringe vs by a trwe repentaunce / in thesame knowlege of owre selues / & with a feruēte fayth in this knowlege of his mer∣cyfulnesse / and swettnes / which he showe in his Christe / that he beynge gyde / we may be le vnto the eternall beatitude / which christ i the vnical way / wherby we cum to the fa∣there.Iere. 3. And that men which ere symple may the better knowe the cūmyunge in to this way of truth / we shall declare the cōmaund∣mētis of the lawe / which (as I showde befo∣re) do dreue vs to Chryst / in knowlegynge the goodnes of God and owre one naught∣tynes / and hewe all grace / marcy / & remissiō of synne is only optaynyd by a suerfayth in Christis blude.
¶ Here begynnyth the tenne com∣maundmentis. THere aer ten preceptis of the lawe / fowre partayn to Godis honore / &. vi. to the loue of owre nayghbore / Wherfore the Lorde (as the Euāgelyst testi∣fyth) dyd cōclude brefly the laue in two pre∣ceptis / That we shuld loue God with all owr hertis / all owre mendes / and all owre stren∣kyth / owre nayghbore as owre selues / But althowgh the vnyuersall lawe is concludyd in thos too chappiters / neuer the lesse owre Lorde wherby he myght take a way the pre∣tence of excusacion / it plesyd him to showe more largly & playnly by ten preceptis both thos thyngis which partayne to his honore fare / and loue / as those whych he cōmand vs for his sake to bere to owre nayghbores.Exo. 32. & 34. Deut. 10. The fyrst is this.Leuit. 10 ¶ The fyrst cōmaundment. Thow shalt not haue straunge Godis before me. BY which we ere cōmaundyde to haue a stedfaste fayth / and tho seke all ways remydy of him that we do not geue the lau∣de of ony goodnes and vertw / to a nothereIesa. 30. &. 31. 1. Tim. 1.

reature / which belongyth only to hym / It be houe vs also to loue and fere him a boue all thyng / that we knowledge hym only for owre God / fyxynge all owre hope and trust in hym / thynkynge what so euer goodnes chaūse to vs to be of him / admittynge at no∣time ony thinge but that in which he is wor¦shyppyd / & honoryde.1. Cor. 10 Nor we owt not to de∣clare him thus by tonge / gesture of body & y euery owtworde singnyficacion / that is o be owre God / but also we must geue owr selffe lyke by mende / herte & all owre stody.1. Pat. 28 For not only owr wordis & externall dedes aer before him / but also the workis of the de¦pe herte & cogitaciōs of the inwerde mende / er mor better & clerely opinyde to him thene owre selues. And ye shall not that ther was euer / is / or shalbe ony man (Christe ony cepte which is bothe God and man) that er fulfillyd this cōmaundimēte / which lo∣we God with all his mynd / herte and sowle. Nottywtstandynge he do geue vs this com∣maundment vnpossibyl for vs to fulfyll in this mortall body / by cause he wold dreue vs to Christe / that is (as I tolde you before) to confesse owre one infirmyte / and remission of synne to be had only by his marcy & gra∣te.
This cōmaundment teche vs whylis we walke in this corrupte flesse that we er not {per}feyt / & willyth that we streche owre selues forwerdis to the marke and gole by a true fayth / where we shall resayue all parfectues / and se God face to face / owre sauyore Christ Iesu beynge owre mene and gyde. This cō∣maundmēt stope the mowghte of bosters & crakers reioysyng in workis / and dreue all men to seke owre sauyre Christ Iesu. ❧ By this cōmaundmēte we er forby∣dyne to prefere ony worldly goodis or pro∣mocions / as rychese / honor / dingnyte & sych othere aboue God / we may not sett owre mend so on them that we shal forgytte God. But froz tyme to tyme we must euer know¦lege him / as is sayd before. ¶ The secund cōmaundment. Thow shall make no grauene y∣mage / or similytude of thos thyn¦gis whych aer aboue in heuyne or in erthe benethe / or in waters which ere vnder the erthe / thow shalte not honore ne worshope them.
BY which is syngnifyde all honore and worshope to be lōge to on God / which whan he can not be cōprehēdyd by nomens of mans capacyte or wytt / in as mych he is incorporall inuysyble / so spirytall that he ca∣ne be excludyde from no place / lett not vs flowmbere that we can comprehēde him by owre one wyttis and ymaginaciōs.Deut. 6.10. 3. Reg. 8. Ioan. 1. 1. Timo. 1. Ioan. 4. Nor lett not vs worshope an ydol▪ as it were the simi¦lytude of God which is a spryte / and wylbe worshippyd in spryte and truth. Therfor the rst cōmaundement do showe one Gode to be / be syde whom ther is non othere God to be thougt or hade. This cōmaundmente do teche what maner a God he is / and by what kynde or māner of worshype he wylbe ho∣noryde / lest we shuldebe bolde to fayne ony carnall thynge lyke to hym / or to caste hym vnder owre wyttis & braynes / or to be repre¦hendyde by ony forme / or symilytude. A gēst ydolis of the trinyte & sayntes. LLett them respecte hethere which inten¦de to defende by a miserabyll pretēce ex¦ecrabyll ydolitre / by which meny yers be for this tyme / true relygion haue bynue ouer∣throwne / and submersyde. They say ymagis aer not reputyd as Godis. Nor the Iuys
were not so obliuyus but that they remem∣bryd God to be / by wose hand they were le∣de owt of Egypte / befor they made the claf∣fe. Nor Turkis er not to be though so dul∣wyttyd / but that they do beleue God to be a nothere thynge then stone & wodde. They do chonge allways ymagys after theyre on fancy / but they hold all ways in mend theyre God / and dedycatt meny ydolis in the name of on false God / but do not beleue to haue so meny Godis / as they haue ydolis / Also they do make uwe euery day / but they do not thynke to make nwe Godis. What nowe? All ydolyters of Iuys or gentelis / had a be∣leue God to be such a wone as the vanyte of theyre brayn dyd cōsayue. Therfor the men∣de dyd generate an ydolle / & a hand brought it forthe / neuerthelesse the Iuys dyd thyn∣ke them selues to worshope vnder such yma¦gys God eternall / on and very Lorde in he∣uen and erthe / Also gentyls dyd so repute theyre godis (altough fallis) which also they fayned to be in heuene. To this they dyd not beleue God to be presente to them / excepte they dyd showe hym by a carnall presence / And that they myght obay this blind desey∣re / they dyd erecte signys / & ydolis / by which
they dyd beleue to haue God presente be∣for theyr corporall eyes / Whan truly they though them selues to be hold God in them / then they worshoppyd him in them. And so beholdyng ydolis wyth mende and eyes as meny christyans do noweadays / they bege∣ne to be more bestly then holy / inthinkynge holy that which is a ydoll. He that wyl de∣ny this to be done before owre days and al∣so nowe he denyth the truth onshamfastly. Why do they ly prostrate before them: Why do they turne themselues to them intendyn∣ge to pray as to the aerys of God: Why aer they redy for such popyttis and ydollis to stryues / debatis / brawlyngis and chyding is as gentels be for theyr māmyttis? Meny nowe a days wylsoffere more wyllynge on God to be takyne a way then theyr ydolis & poppetis hauynge besydis thys meny othe∣re grosse accors wyth owt nūbere / by which God grettly is dysplesyd / but shulbe grettly plesyde if they purifyde themselues / from ydolytre and such yllis. They say we do not call them Godis / no more dyd the Iuys or gentyls call them but only singnys and yma¦gis of Godis.Iesa. 40. Iere. 2. Ezech. 6. And truly all prophetis and holy scripture do not selfe to forbyd fornica∣tions
wyth wode and ston / where all Chri∣styans (which er the true Iuys) er in excusa∣byll as cōcernynge the carnall worshyppyn∣ge of God in wode and stone / or ony othere erthely thynge.Haba. 2. Deut. 32. And ye shall not that the vt∣termoste effuge & scape that all papistis haue to vpholde theyre ydolis / is to affirme them the bokis of ydiotis and lay man. And that we grante this (although it be a thinge most folysh and vayn whan they er sett vpe wyth owt dowte for non othere cause then to be worshypyde) hyt neuer the lesse I can not se what fcuttis they brynge to ydiotis and on∣lernyd persons / chefly when God is caruyd to them / but to make them heritykes in bele¦uynge to haue God present all hole by men∣bers / as they carue & paynte him.The car∣nynge of God ma¦ke herety kis. The car∣nynge of fayntis make bawdis. And such ymagis as presente fayntis / what er they but examples of grett superfluyte / costloste and a tityll of an yll name: Fore harlottis do showe more shamfastly & moderattly / theyr horly a ray and owtwerd ostencions / then tempils do theyr picturs which they wyll to represente the ymagis of virgyns. Therfore lett them decke theyre ymagis att the lest ways / with sū shamfastnes / that they might represente sum what mor shamfastly to be
bokis of sum holynes. As they be mad no∣we a days / they shal prouoke a man mor to syne them vertwe. But as towchynge they re opynion ymagis to be bokis of ydiotis is not the way and reson to teche the pepell of God / whom God wyll to be instructe by a nothere techynge & by a nothere boke / then by the bockis of blockis and stokis and fo∣lysh lyes / and fabyllis.To make ymagis bo∣kis is nott the true w∣ay teche y∣diottis. He hath showde the prechynge of hys worde to be a cōmyn doc∣teyn to all men / to be a bocke whych shall te∣che vs only the way of truthe. Therfor to what ende do it perteyn to sett vp so meny crossis of wode / ston / if that thynge be oft ty¦mes betynne in owre aeris / Christ to be be∣trayd for owre syn̄s / & that he sofferyd owre malediction a pon the cros / and dyd wash a way owre syns / of which on worde they may lerne more then of a thowsante crossis of wode or stonne / much lesse then nede cros¦sis of gold and syluer / which shall make a co∣uyttus mend more to remenber Mammon then Christe.Not the gret ydolie of the worl¦de. Othere Idolis there be in the worlde which er mor grette mor abomyna∣byll then thes forsayd / which ascende into the trone of God / and boste themselues to be lyke the all mighty. Agenst which who so
specke the ypocritys and popysche sorte se them condempnyd to deth / which euer haue byne a geuste Gode / both in old and nowe Testament in sleynge profyttis & true disci∣pyls which spake the true worde of God / in∣tendyng to plucke downe them wyth theyr ydolis restynge in godis place / as men vtter¦ly intendyng to expulsse God / ye and theyre malesse was so grett that they dyd not spare the sonne of God / whom the tēporall yugis wold haue deliueryd.Truth de∣seruith eue¦re hath. Wherfore though in spekinge the trothe deth must nedis folowe by the hādis of thes blowde suckers / hyt the truth must be prechede yet Christ must be extollyd of them that knowythe the truthe / For he that deny him (as he wyttnes him selffe) before men / he wyll deny him before his heuenly fathere / Wherfore cheryte com∣pellyth ☞ me to tell truthe as consernynge ydo¦lis contrary to this cōmaundment. And ye shall not that a monge all ydollis whiche er in this worlde wyth tryumphe in the sette & trōue of God allmighty. that is / which reste by a falsse fayth in the herte of man which herte is the sett of God / is popysche presto∣de / and his grett Gode / For popysche presto¦de what by hypocrisy / and by the falsse pre∣senceThe ydoll of prestode popysch.
of mastershyue which he holde vnder theyre venōmus Gode / hath so infecte by theyr desaytfull promyssis / the hertis of pe∣pyll / that whare Christ was wonte to rayne with his swett promyssis / by theyre poppy∣tres they haue clerely erpulsyd him / and ex∣tollyde Antychriste with his marchantis ba∣bylonicalle / And whan prestode popysche with his falsse god thus supplyth the place of God / what er they but ydollis: ye and so meny as beleue to be ydolaters: Lett vs sherch what an ydolle is and we shall fynde the thinge clerly verifyde of them.The defy∣nischion of an ydole.

Nor lett no man say (as meny do no∣we a days) to haue powre to do all thyngis helpyd by the hāde of God / For the helpe of God is not present but only to them which walke in his ways / that is / in his vocacion / from which thes hypocritis do indeuer to drawe themselues / agenst the wyll of God / In this peuysnes and presumpcion lett not them loke for God to be a helper / but lett them rethere remembere / his saynge / thow shalte not tempte they lorde God. This tru∣ly is to tempte God / to indeuer and ercersys agenst nature / which is geuen to vs of him / ye & so to dispysse his presente geftes.Math. 3. Nott what it is to tem¦pte Gode. Thys godly gefte of nature the popysche sorte do not only dispyse / in misusynge themselues agaynste all nature abominabyll to specke / but also the losels er bowlde to call matri∣mony a polucion which God whas worthy to institute / which he dyd pronownse hono∣rabyll to all men / which owr sauyure Christ dyd sanctify by his presence / garnissyng the same with his fyrste miracle / but with most sotell statutis / rulis / and decrese / they do ex∣toll

As thowgh theyr scalde vowe wor not one / and virginyte a nothere / They call theyre stald vows / agelicall vertws / doynge great ingery to the angellis of God / to the which they compare lassiuyous parsons / adulteres and sum thynge moreworsse and stinkynge.Men  more the pes ordi¦cis then ¦des. And truly we nede not to rehersse more to∣kyns / where the thynge selffe is manifeste / we shall se truly by what grett and horribyll payns the lord shall reuenge thys arrogans and contempte of his gyftis. By this com∣maundemēt also euery man is bownd to ha∣ue and vse his wyffe soberly / and gentilly / & the wyffe lykewyce the man / further mor to that they shall admytt nothyng contrary to the honeste and temperance of matrimo∣ny / & so doyng / they shall knowe at the laste to mary in the Lorde. ¶ The .viij. cōmaundement. Thow shalt do no thefte. Whych must thus be vnderstāde / whan truly we owte to fare and loue Gode / lett vs desayue no man othere be crafte or

But if the fare and loue of God be in vs / we wyll indeuer more with all owr powre to helpe both owr fryndis and foes / as much as ly in vs bothe by counsell and helpe in vpholdynge & may∣tynnynge theyre bodys and goodis / ye and rethere to minysch owr on goodis then to ta¦ke a way a nothere mans / not only that / but if they were opprest by the misfortune of thyngis / we were bownd to cōmunicat & im¦parte owre goodis to the sustentaciō of theyr necessytes / and to the alleuyacion of theyre nede by owre plentuusnes. Lett all christene men respecte to this cōmaundement in hel∣pynge the powre membris of Christis body to the powre threshers of the Lordis corne / to the powre creaturs which lake theyr natu¦rall lymbys / and no more to vphold by obla∣cions the grett ydolis of this worlde / that is Antichrist with his prestode / and all theyrMath. 10.

Thou shalte not couyt they ney∣ghbours house / thou shalt not deseyre his wyfe / nor seruaunt / nor handmayd / nor oxe / nor asse nor nothynge that is his.

But if ther be ony loue and fare of God in vs we owt more to no∣risch the loue of the man and wyfe / cōsellin∣ge euery man to kepe his one wyfe and the

By this reason also the pepyll owt to ha∣ue in mende theyre kyngis & princis / maye∣stis & othere rulers / and to suffere theyre do minacion by a quiette mend / to obay theyre laws and cōmaundementis and to slake in nothynge which is not contrary to God is cō¦maundement.The office of duckis & lord is.

Byshops and ministers of cherches lyue∣ly
lett them labore and ply faythfully in thē ministracion of the worde / nor lett them not defyle the doctryne of helthe / but lett them geue the pure and syncere doctryn of God / and instructe men not only by doctryne but also by exampel of lyfe / & so to geue inspectiō to theyer shype / as good shypers to theyre shype / Agene the pepyll must knowe them for massengers and apostels of God / and to geue them that honore that the lord wyl thez to haue / and geue them thos thyngis which er necessary to the sustentacion of theyr lyfe.The office of byshops.

To this maner lett euery mane repute what he owthe to his neyboure in his order and place / and that he owe lett hym geue. We haue the holle lawe explicatt in .x. cō∣maundementes / by the whych we er suffi∣ciently instructe of all thos thyngis / which the lorde do othere require of vs / or forbyde to be done / as well towerdis him selfe / as owre nayghbours. Truly it is esy to persay∣ue to what ende all thyngis do intende / tru¦ly to teche cherite. But fyrste we er instrute that we shulde fare / loue & worshope God / and haue confi∣dence only in him / that we shuld call and se∣ke him / and shold expecte and loke for all thin¦ges of him and shuld put owr hope only in
him / shuld reste in him / which is the sum of the fyrste tabyll / by which we er instrute on¦ly to goodlynes and pyete. Fordere more we haue cheryte with owr neyghbours for godis sake / so doynge with all men as we woldbe doune to / which is the hede of the .ij. tabyll. And thuse it apere that the obseruacion of the cōmaundementis is / to loue only God and owr neyghboure / and he lyuyth most best & holyest which as mych as is possibyll do not lyue and stody to him selfe / to his proper lukere and profyth / and a gene there is non that lyuyth more worse & wrethede thē he which stody only to his pro¦per luckere / seke and thynke only is one pro¦fyth.

Al this is wel / but they brethe striues with all theyr hertis / they burne in veneriall desyrs / they spy the goodis of allmene with schoymische eyes / and dewouere all by couyt tuousnes. Nowe they lackyd the chefyste pownte of the lawe / Agaynst thes PaulleRoma. 8. d strongely try / affirmynge the lawe to be spirituall / that is / which requiryth the hole mynde / the hole sowle / and hollwyll obedien¦te / and whan we say this to be the sum of the lawe we brynge no we interpretacion / but folowe Christe the best interpreter of the la∣we / which dyd adde nothynge to the lawe but only cleryt obscuryd by the lys of phari∣sys / and corrupte by theyr sower dow.Mat. 5. Lyke yce as the vertue of his worde / the spryte of his mowthe doth nowe also reproue An∣tichrist and his secte which reyoysse onely in theyre workis / thynkynge themselues more holy thē othere by caus they haue such harde rules & orders / ceremonys wous that no chri¦sten man can ber or soffere.

Then er we well at aes if the powle shorne marchantis shuld be only the sons of God / if they shuld call God only theyr fathers? Therfor the word of God do proue them onely the sons of the deuell / which do caste a way so lightly the cōmoune youke of the chyldrē of Gode.
