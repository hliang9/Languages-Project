A VVARNING FROM THE LORD TO THE City of Oxford. TRemble, tremble, tremble, all sorts of people, who in prophaneness lives: A day of howling and bitter lamentation is comming upon you; your wicked pra∣ctises are in remembrance, before the living God of life and power brought, who is dreadful and terrible to the workers of iniquity, and the day hastens, wherein thou an account must give for all your filthy practises, and rewarded thou must be according to thy deeds: Thou Oxford who with Corazin art exalted above all other, because of thy hu∣mane wisdome; but down the dreadful God of Heaven and Earth wil bring thee, all thy Sorcerie wil not save thee in the day of the Lords fierce wrath, which is comming upon thee; all thy profession wil not cover thee, who art an enemy to the life of what thou in words professest; now all thy coverings wil not hide thee in this the day of the Lord, who wil reward thee according to thy actions; and thy stoln expressions, which thou hast stoln out of the Saints conditions, wil not avail thee in the day of thy calamity, for out of the Saints life thou art found, who giveth thy meanings to the Saints conditions, and so wrest their words, to make them sutable to thy carnall ends; but this Cloak is also too narrow, it wil not hide thee, for found thou
art, covered with a covering, but not with the Spirit of the Lord; therefore upon thee wo and misery is comming, for now is the Angels of the Lords presence ready to execute judgment upon thee for thy pride and haughtiness, and all thy filthy a∣bominations, and account thou must give; the dreadful day of the Lord draweth nigh, and in this terrible day, all thy natural Languages, & thy Logick, as Hebrew, Greek, and Latine, which thou calls the Originall Language, vvill not save thee from the judgment that is to come upon thee for the fierce Wrath of the living God is kindled against thee, the Vialls are set open, and are ready to be powred down upon thee, who art found filling up the measure of thy Fathers iniquity, the cry of the innocent is heard against thee, whom the Lord God of Heaven and Earth sent to forewarn thee of the evil which is to come upon thee, whom thou whipped and persecuted, for calling people to repentance, and exhorting them to fear the Lord, and the Lord hath since sent diver of his faithfull Servants to forewarn you of this wrath wch is to come upon you, and yet you have shut your ears against them, and have them persecuted and imprisoned, and grosly a∣bused, and so hath added to your transgression, which wil add to your Torment; you have drunk deep draughts of the Whores Cup, you are ful of filthiness and abominations; and you must now tast of the Wrath which is due unto you, you cannot fly from it, nor escape it; and the Witness for God in you (which is the Light of Iesus Christ) wil testifie against you, when the Plagues and Judgements of God, is powred forth upon you, that his Iudge∣ments are just; therefore now take Warning, and prize your time while you have it, and slight not this your day of visitation, you Inhabitants of this Town of Cambridge, for the Lord will not al∣waies strive with you, sit down in the dust, and repent, and with speed forsake the evil of your doings, lest the Dore of Mercy be for ever shut against you: Remember your Father Esau, who lived in prophaneness, who would have repented, but he slipt his time and there was no place of repentance for him found. And Judas
who betrayed the innocent; remember who  compence of reward according to his Works, and do not you think to escape the just iudgements of God, who are found acting the same things, for be assured it wil come heavie upon you, for the Lord is righteous, and with equity judgeth, and he wil reward you for you unrighteousness; yea Vengeance in Flames of Fire shall be revealed upon the ungodly, the Mouth of the Lord hath spoken it, and his words shall not go forth in vain. Therefore howle you proud, stiff-necked, rebellious ones, who wasts and devours the crea∣tures of God upon your lusts, now an Account you must give to the Creator, who heareth the cry of the oppressed, which lyeth groa∣ning under the bondage of Corruption; and the Lord wil no longer wink at the Oppressor, for he is now comming to cut down the op∣pressor, and set his Creatures free, which hath been kept long in Bondage by you who live in lust and pleasures, fulness; and glutton∣ness; yea, the Sword of the Lord God is drawn against you, you Belly-Gods, who feeds your selves withouthe fear of God; for the slaughter ye are; the edge of the sword you cannot escape, you bloody persecutors, haters and enviers of the righteous seed; against you the edge of the sword is turned, and you cannot escape; for the Lord wil cut you down; the Lord sees your plotting, and se∣cret actings against his dear servants and children, you deceitful Priests, and corrupt Magistrates, who combine together to mur∣ther the innocent; so far as your Power extends; but praised be our Lord God for ever, who hath your Power limited, so that you cannot go beyond your bounds; your snares the Lord wil break in pieces, which you make to catch the innocent; and the Pits you dig for others you into them must fall; no weapons which you form against the harmless shal prosper, the Lord hath spo∣ken it, who is our Deliverer, who wil be your Destroyer; yea, your day of Destruction draws nigh; and the God of the world whom you pray unto, which so long hath blinded your eyes, shall not be able to deliver you in the day of the Lords fierce wrath, who wil plead with you by fire, and by his sword, which
are already kindled, and drawn against you; and the enemies of the Lord and his servants, shal be consumed and utterly destroy∣ed for ever: for the Beast and the false Prophet, which now bend their forces together to make war with the Lamb, shal be taken, and into the Lake must be cast, that burneth with fire and brim∣stone, and the Lamb shal have victory over you, you bloody per∣secutors. And you Schollars, who come hither to learn naturall languages, who spend and wast your time in idleness and pro∣phaneness, many of you living in pleasures and wantonness; spor∣ting your selves in the day-time: Consider what you are doing, doth not the Lord see and know these things? And wil not he vi∣sit you for your vanities and fooleries? Do you think to escape the just judgmenns of God? Nay, your Logick and your vain Philoso∣phy wil not cover you; the Lord wil find you out, and you shall not escape unpunished; you according to your actions shall be re∣warded: Therefore to you (I say) repent, lest the Evill Day come upon you at unawares, and there bee none to deliver you. And you that keep Taverns and Alehouses, who keeps Cards Dice and Shovel boords in your Houses for to satisfie the lusts of vaine mindes, which delights in gaming and foolerie, and fills wine and strong drink to men till they be inflamed, and so are the Upholders of that filthie Thing Drunkenness, which is one of the horrible, filthiest sins in the Nation. Therefore, to You, (I say,) repent, and suffer such things no more to bee used in your Houses, (as is before mentioned,) least you partaking of their sinns, bee made partakers of their Judgements and Plagues, which ts neerer you, then yet you are aware of; for, You cannot escape the Edge of the Sword, being found TREES which cumbers the ground. And You TRADES-MEN, of what sort soever, who uses Lying and Dissembling for Gaine, and are in the m Words, out of the Doctrine of CRIST, who  Na bee Nay in
all things; for whatsoever commeth of more is Evill: What will your cheating and cozening availe You? Consider, though you may through deceitful waits and measures, & your crafty enluring speeches, heap up much of the worlds treasure, what wil it all profit you, in the day wherein you must give an account for all your dishonest gain? then the same Measure you meet withall, the same to you shall be measured again: To you I say repent, and forsake the evil of your waies, and provoke the Lord no longer, for the Lord God of Life and power sees and knows these things, and his judgments are nigh you, and his fury and indignation you cannot escape: therefore now I warn you in the name and fear of the Lord; Trades men, give over deceit and cozening, and deal plainlie and honestlie with your Brethren in your buying and selling, and give just weight and measure, and let your yea, be yea, and your nay, be nay, and use not so many vain words in your bargaining, for to the Lord an account you must give, for everie idle word; therefore now you are warned, take heed of adding to your condemnati∣on, for this is the free love of God to your souls to give you warning, therefore prize it now while you have time, lest swift destruction come upon you, for now hath the Lord left you without excuse, you cannot plead ignorance, and the Light in your own Consciences (which is the Light of Jesus Christ, wherewith he hath enlightned you) shall bear true testimony against you, and witness for the Lord, that his judgements are just, when they come to be executed upon you. And you Magi∣strates who are sword-bearers, see that you bear the sword no more in vain, but let the edge of the sword be turned against the seed of evil doers, that by it all manner of Sin and wicked∣ness may be cut down, and the RIGHTEOUS SEED preserved, that the TOWN may be set free from evil doers, that RIGHTEOUSNESSE may run down your Streets, &c.
But first, sin and wickedness see in your own selves, cut down by the sword of the Lord (which is his righteous judgements) that the righteous seed in you may be raised up to rule and reign, that true judgement and justice may be executed by you, for he that ruleth over men must be just, for he is righteous that judgeth, and according to your judgement so shall you be jud∣ged. And to the Vice-Chancèllor (so called) and to you who are the chiefe in Colledges (as you call them) who study, and teach others natural Languages (as Hebrew, Greek, and Latine) and the Arts of Lodgick and Phylosophy, which is all for the fire, for the knowledge of these things puffs up your minds, and keepes you from the true knowledge of the living God, who can be known no other way but through his Son, for none shal ever know God by studying old Authors, and learning naturall Languages (as Hebrew, Greek, and Latine, which you call the Original) for na∣tural men cannot receive the things of the Spirit of God, God is a Mysterie sealed to that nature, which studieth these things before mentioned, for proud, high-minded, selfewilled men, studie and teach these Languages, but the secrets of God are kept from such, God to his Son reveales himself, who is meek and lowlie, and those who knows God, keeps his commands, and knows him by the revelation of his Son; and we, whom the Lord hath made himself known unto, through his Son, deny, and bear witness against all such as comes not in by the dore, but climbs up another way in their own humane inventions, there∣fore to you, I say cease from your own imaginations, studies, and naturall Languages; for all you Heathenish Authors, which your Liberaries and studies are so urnished withall, are for the Fire, read Acts 19.19, many who used curious Arts (as you do) brought their Books, and burned them, when they came to own the everlasting truth, which by the Apostles was preached; and as you come to own the truth (which by the despised and per∣secuted ones is preached) your books then wil be of little value, which is now by you so highly prized, when your minds comes
to be turned out of your vain imaginations, to the Light of Jesus Christ in you, which Jesus Christ hath lightned you with, you need not to study in old authors to know what mea∣nings they gave, with their heathenish inventions upon the Saints conditions, who spoke forth the Scriptures, as they were moved by the Holy Ghost; nay, their meanings and their imaginations upon them are accursed, & your meanings which you give upon the Scriptures, and your imaginations upon them are accursed; for the Scripture which was spoke from the life of the Saints, are of no private interpretations, and til you come to own the Light of Jesus Christ, which he hath enlight∣ned you with, and live in it, and receive it to be your Teachers, and even as it teach you to abide in it, that with it you may be led into the holie life, which life gave forth the Scripture; you cannot know the mysterie of the Scripture, for it is sealed to all the Worlds Wisdome, and one of the seaven Seals you cannot open, with which the Book of life is sealed, with all your rot∣ten stuff, nay you are not found worthie, your Lodgick and Phylosophie, and all your naturall reason, and natural Langu∣ages, is shut out of the Life of the Scriptures, you have the let∣ter vvhich is the outside, the husk, and vvith that you feed people, therefore they profit nothing by you; for both you who are Teachers, and take upon you to teach others, you and they who are taught by you, are with the Prodigal feeding a∣mong Swine upon the husk, and your souls are starved for want of living food, for the Bread of Life you are strangers to, which if you once come to tast on, you wil then Witness with me, that upon the husk you have been feeding; but this is chil∣drens food, this is not to be cast unto Dogs; you who are ful of envie and bitterness, and feeds upon the Tree of Knowledge, you cannot feed with children who hungers and thirsts continu∣allie after living food; nay it is the hungrie that the Lord feeds with good things; you who are ful and rich shal emptie be sent awaie, you are they which are to be fed vvith judgement, and
judgement you shall finde before Mercy; therefore to you I say repent in dust and ashes, lest the dore of Mercy for ever be shut against you Vice-Chancéllor, and you who are chiefe in Colledges, and Chiefe Priests, who above measure are exalted; you have builded your Nests on high, but the Lord God of life and power wil you pul down, though your building be as high as Babel, yet the Lord wil bring you down; he that can receive it let him: This to you is a warning from the Lord, Oxford 14. day of the 5. month. 1655. By one of his Servants who is despised of the world, known by the name of John Harrwood. FINIS.
