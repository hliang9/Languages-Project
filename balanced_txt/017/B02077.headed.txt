His Majesties GRACIOUS SPEECH to both Houses of PARLAIMENT: Together with the L. Chancellors, In Christ-Church-Hall in Oxford, On Tuesday, October 10. 1665. C R HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE DIEV ET MON DROIT royal blazon or coat of arms Re-Printed at York by Stephen Bulkley, 1665.
HIS MAJESTIES GRACIOUS SPEECH To both HOUSES of PARLIAMENT. My Lords and Gentlemen, I Am confident you all believe, that if it had not been absolutely necessary to consult with you, I would not have called you together at this time, when the Contagion hath so spread it self over so many parts of the Kingdom. I take it for a good Omen to see so good an appearance this day, and I doubt not, every day will add to your num∣ber; and I give you all My thanks for your com∣pliance so far with My desires. The truth is, as I entred upon this War by your advice and encouragement; so I do desire, that you may as frequently as is possible, receive informati∣on of the Conduct, and Effects of it, and that I may have the continuance of your chearfull Supply for the carrying it on. I will not deny to you, that it hath proved more chargeable then I could ima∣gine it would have been: The addition they still made to their Fleets, beyond their first purpose, made it unavoidably necessary for me to make pro∣portionable Preparations, which God hath hither∣to blessed with success in all Encounters. And as the Enemy have used their utmost endevours by
Calumnies and false suggestions, to make themselves Friends, and to perswade others to assist them against Ʋs; so I have not been wanting to encourage those Princes who have been wronged by the Dutch, to recover their own by force; and in order thereunto, have assisted the Bishop of Munster with a very great sum of ready Money, and am to continue a supply to him, who is now in the bowels of their Country with a Powerfull Army. These Issues, which I may tell you, have been made with very good Conduct and Husbandry, (nor indeed doe I know that any thing hath been spent, that could have been well and fafely saved) I say, this expence will not suffer you to wonder, that the great Supply which you gave me for this War, in so bountifull a proportion, is upon the mat∣ter already spent: So that I must not onely expect an assistance from you, to carry on this War; but such an assistance, as may inable Me to defend My Self and you, against a more Powerfull Neigh∣bour, if he shall prefer the Frienaship of the Dutch before Mine. I told you, when I entred upon this War, That I had not such a Brutal appetite, as to make War for War sake. I am still of the same mind: I have been ready to receive any Propositions that France hath thought fit to offer to that end: but hitherto nothing hath been offered worthy My acceptance; nor is the Dutch less insolent, though I know no advantage they have had, but the continuance of the Contagion: God Almighty, I hope, will shortly deprive them of that encouragement. The Chancellour will inform you of all the Particulars.
The LORD CHANCELLOR'S SPEECH To both HOUSES of PARLIAMENT. My Lords, and you the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses of the House of Commons. THe King is not content, you see, to leave you to your selves to make a stare of this War, and the success that hath attended it, by your own observation, and the general Communication of all that hath fallen out, which in truth hath left few men ignorant of any thing, who have had any curiosity to inform themselves; but takes care that you be informed by Himself, that you may know all that he knows, that so you may be able to give Him your Counsel upon the clearest evidence. In order to this, it will not I hope be unseasonable or ingrateful to you, to refresh your memory, by looking some years backwards, even to the time of His Majesties happy Restauration, that we may take the better prospect of the posture we are now in, and how we have come into it. What inclinations His Majesty brought home with Him, to live in Amity with His Neighbours of Holland, though He had received In∣dignities enough from them, and in truth had been little less pro∣scribed there, than He had been in England; needs no other manife∣station, than that He chose that place to imbarque Himself in, when He was pressed by the two Neighbour Kings, from whom He had re∣ceived more civilities, to have made use of their Ports. It cannot be denied, but that His reception in Holland was with great civility and lustre, and a sufficient evidence that they had a full sense of the high Honour His Majesty had vouchsafed to them, and the departure from thence was with equal and mutual satisfaction in each other; which made many men the more to wonder, that albeit the Ambassa∣dors who were to follow, had been nominated before the King left the Hague, there was so long an Interval before their Arrival here, that the two Neighbour Kings, and many other Princes had finish∣ed their Ambassies of Congratulation, before we had heard any more from the United Provinces. You all remember how long it was before the Armies were dis∣banded, and the Fleets paid off; during which time, His Majesty li∣ved upon his Credit, and easily contracted a great Debt for the meer
support of himself and his houshold, which was not so easily dis∣charged afterwards. There was one thing that exceedingly surprized him, when he found (which will be incredible to posterity) that a Tri∣umphant Nation, uhat had made it self terrible to Christendom, by ha∣ving fought more Battels than all the Neighbour Kingdoms and States together had ever done in so few years, and seemed to be in a posture ready to fight them over again; that had so long Reigned over the Oce∣an in formidable Fleets; should at the time of his Majesties happy Re∣turn, as if on the sudden all their Arms had been turned into Plough∣shares, and their Swords into Pruning books, not have in all their Magazines, in all the Stores, Arms enough to put into the hands of five thousand men, nor Provisions enough to set out Ten new Ships to Sea. Which his Majesty did not desire should be known to his best Neighbours, how little soever he suspected their Affections; nor did indeed so much as make it known to his Parliament, but made it his first care, without the least noise, and with all imaginable shifts, to pro∣vide for the full supply of those important Magazines and Stores which have been ever since replenished as they ought to be. He had not the least imagination that any of his Neighbours would wantonly affect to interrupt the happy Calm that he and themselves enjoyed; and therefore resolved to retrench the vast expence of the Na∣vy; under which he found the Nation even to groan; and out of that good husbandry to provide for more necessary Disburs ments: Yet, that the World might not think that he had abandoned the Ocean, and that the memory of the glorious Actions the English had so lately perfor∣med upon it, might not vanish in an instant, after he had provided such a Guard as the Narrow Seas never ought to be without, in the Spring he sent a strong Fleet against the Pirates of Algiers and Tri∣poly (who had grown to that strength and boldness, that they interrupt∣ed the whole Trade of Christendom) as the only Enemies he would choose to have. It was a Design of great Glory, and equal Expence, crowned in the end by God Almighty, with the Success we could wish, and with an entire submission to the English Flag, and as great security to all His Majesties Subjects in their Trade, as the engagement and honour of Infidels can give; and this Agreement ratified with all formality (the like whereof had never been before) by the Great Turk himself. Hereupon the King again renewed his resolution for a further re∣trenchment of his Naval expence, even to the lessening of the Guard in the Narrow Seas; His Merchants in all places receiving less inter∣ruption in their Trade, then they had in any former time undergone: until he received Intelligence from the Straights, that the faithless People of Algiers, who had so lately submitted to him, had commit∣ted new Insolencies upon some of his Subjects, or rather upon Foreign persons taken by his Subjects into their possession, and which the Turks pretended they might do without violation of the Treaty: But his Majesty resolving to admit none of those Elucidations, lost no time in sending a new strong Fleet into the Mediterranean, to chastise those perfidious Pirates; and after a chargeable War made upon them for near or full twelve Months, and after having taken
several of their Ships from them, and upon the matter blocking them up in their Harbours, He received a second submission from them with better and more advantagious Conditions than the former. I must not omit one circumstance; That about this time, the Dutch, who received much more prejudice and damage from the Turks than the English had done, besought his Majesty that he would once more send a Fleet into those Seas against those Pirates, and that it might upon all occasions joyn with one they were likewise ready to send our to the same Christian end, and for the utter extirpation of those Sea-Robbers; and within a very short time after the English Fleet was gone, they likewise sent De Ruyter with a good Fleet thither, which was so far from any conjunction with us, that when our ships chased any Algier-men near them, they never offered to obstruct their flight, but quickly made it manifest, that they rather brought money with them to buy a dishonourable and disadvantagious Peace, than to make a War upon them. Matters standing thus; The Kings Fleet being gone into the Straights against the Turkish Pirates, and there remaining few ships in the Narrow Seas; we began every day to hear of Depredations by the Dutch upon our Merchants in all parts. Instead of delivering up the Island of Poleroon in the East-Indies (as by the Treaty they ought to have done) They by their Naval Power in those parts hindered us from Trading there, and would not suffer our Ships to take in their Lading of such Merchandise as the Factors had provided and made ready for their Fraight, upon pretence that those parts where the Mer∣chandise was ready to be imbarqued, were in the Dominions of some Princes whom they had declared to be their Enemies, and so they would not suffer any Traffique to be maintained with them. And they published the like Declaration, and challenged the same Sove∣raignty in Africa, and by vertue thereof would not sfr our ships to Trade upon that Coast, where we had a trade long before the Dutch had any footing in those parts. These Insolencies made that noise in the world, that the English Merchants felt the effects of it in all places, till it reached the ears of the Parliament, which in April was twelve months, presented the same to his Majesty, and besought him that he would take some spee∣dy and effectual course for the redress of those wrongs, dishonours, and Indignities, which were the greatest Obstructions of our Trade; and de∣clared that in the prosecution thereof they would with their Lives and Fortunes assist his Majesty against all oppositions whatsoever. My Lords and Gentlemen, You very well remember, that though His Majesty was very well pleased with the great Zeal you shewed for the advancement of Trade, He was far from resolving to make a War upon the warmth of that Declaration, but told you that he would examine and peruse the particular Complaints which had been represented to his Parliament, and would thereupon demand justice and reparation from the States-General; which Demand e appointed his Minister residing there, to make in a short time after. What ef∣fect that Candid way of proceeding found, is enough known to the world. Instead of other application, they declare themselves wonder∣fully offended with the Declaration of the Parliament, with many in∣soleng
expressions suitable to the manners of a Common-wealth; They gave present Orders for equipping a very great Fleet, and the raising many Land-Souldiers, making greater preparations for VVar, than they had done in many years before. They had made a complaint to his Ma∣jesty, that a Captain of one of the ships which his Majesty had lent to the Royal Company, had in his Voyage thither, taken a Fort be∣longing to them neer Cape verte, for which they demanded satisfaction. The King assured them, that he had not the least Commission or Au∣thority from him for so doing; that He expected him home very spee∣dily, and then he should be sure to undergo that punishment which the nature of his offence required, when the matter should be exami∣ned, and they should be sure to receive full reparation. This satisfied them not, but in great fury they resolve to send forthwith a strong Fleet to Guiny, and granted a Commission (which they took care to publish) to the Commander in chief, to make war upon the English in those parts, and to do them all the mischief they could. The King found himself now obliged, in what strait soever, to pro∣vide for the protection of his Subjects in those parts, and for the sup∣port of that trade, which I doubt is not enough taken to heart, and the value thereof not enough understood; and in order thereunto, with great speed caused a Fleet to be made ready for that Expedition, un∣der the Command of his Highness Prince Rupert, who was under sail for the Voyage; when his Majesty found it necessary to stop the Prince his further prosecution of it, upon good intelligence that the Dutch had appointed their Admiral with a Fleet of fifty Sail, to convey the other Fleet designed for Guiny through the Channel in contempt of his Majesty, who had a very small Fleet in readiness; and that De Ruyter was likewise sent out of the Straights from prosecuting the Turks, to make war upon the English in Guiny, when at the same time they had earnestly pressed the King upon many professions of desire to prevent a war, that Prince Rupert's Fleet might stay in Har∣bour, as theirs should do, till some means might be found for an accom∣modation of all Differences. And in truth, this very difficult Stra∣tagem of pretending one thing, and intending another; of promi∣sing with all solemnity, and never resolving to perform; of swearing this day not to do a thing, when they had served their turn by having done it yesterday, that no body could know, is the highest Pinacle of their Wisdome of State, by which they govern their affairs, and delude their Neighbours. The Winds were not favourable to this triumphant design: And now the King found the value of the Vote, and Declaration of His Parliament, it was a Rich and a Massie Vote, which in a short time He coined into Two hundred thousand pounds ready money in the Chamber of the City of London; with which he gave Order forthwith to make ready more Ships; and the Duke going Himself to the Fleet, by His indefatigable industry, with incredible Expedition added so many good Ships to those under the Command of Prince Rupert, that in November He put Himself on Board the Fleet, resol∣ving to stop the Dutch if the Wind gave them leave to pursue their for∣mer Resolution, which from the time the Duke was known to be at Sea, they fairly declined, and were content rather to be safe in their
own Harbours, than to look to the security of their Merchants; It was high time now to seiz upon as many of their ships as came in out way, to satisfie the Damages we had reason to believe we should su∣stain from De Ruyter's Expedition into Guiny with the Commission mentioned before: but there was not the Lading of one ship sold or disposed of, till His Majesty received full information of De Ruyters having begun the War upon the Coast of Africa, by seizing upon our ships, taking our Forts, and committing all the acts of Hostility, which his Commission directed him unto; His Majesty likewise at the same time receiving new Advertisement of their refusal to deliver up the Island of Poleroon to him, which they were bound to by their Trea∣ty. And will you nor wonder after all this at the confidence of these men? and more, that any Neighbour Prince should have that confi∣dence in them, as to declare, that the King our Master is the Aggres∣sor, that he first began the War? From this time the War began to be more in earnest, and to be car∣ried on at another Expence. Though his Royal Highness ventured himself in November, in a Fleet consisting of little more than fifty ships, to stop the Dutch from passing through the Channel; Yet in April (which was within few daies after your Prorogation, and the end of your last Session) he went again to Sea with a much stronger Fleet, and more proportionate to the great preparations the Enemy had made; and even after he was gone to Sea, upon great additions of strength every day made by the Dutch, more good ships were sent to reinforce the Fleet, insomuch, as upon that glorious third of June, when they had the courage to visit our Coasts, after the Duke had in vain called upon them at their own doors, and took many of their Merchants Ships in their fight, the English Fleet consisted of very few less than One hundred Sail. The Action and the Blessing of that day, hath been celebrated in all the Churches in England, and in the hearty devotions of all true English men; and therefore I shall no more of it here; save only, that whether the publick Joy then, even upon the so∣lemn Thanksgiving day, was superior to the Universal consternation that spread it self over the Nation before, I appeal to the breasts of al here pre∣sent: We who had the honour to be near the King at that time, ob∣served him to be in that agony that cannot be expressed, an agony him∣self could not have long endured, even when by all the intelligence he re∣ceived hourly from the Coast, he had reason to assure himself of the Victory. In that great Action we sunk, burned and took eighteen good ships of war, whereof half were the best they had, wih the loss of one single small ship of ours, but of many noble and gallant Per∣sons, of too much value to be ventured (if there had not been a greater Venture) against such trash: and whose memories ought ever to be preserved and extolled, and made precious to posterity. No diligence was omitted, but all imaginable Expedition used in re∣freshing, repairing, and setting out the Fleet again; In order to which; the King himself made a journey thither, and stayed till he saw all teady and fit to Sail: but then, no entreaty, no importunity, could pre∣vail with Him to venture his Brother again; though His Family and all preparations for the Voyage were still on Board. His Majesty too well remembred, and still felt the impressions he had undergone the Third of June; and having got his Brother into his arms again; he
would not return without him, committing the charge of the Fleet to the Earl of Sandwich, who had acted so good a part in it. Within few daies after, the beginning of July, the Earl of Sandwich went again to the Coast of Holland, with a Fleet in no degree inferior to the former, and Rode before the Texel to invite the Dutch to a new Engagement, they having used all the Arts at home to conceal the loss and dishonour they had undergone, and pretended to be very ready and solicitous for another Battel, when there was no appearance of their purpose to come out: And upon sure intelligence that the East-India Fleet was coming about by the North, he received Orders to go for Norway, upon such encouragement as was not made good, so that he was disappointed of the expectation he had very reasonably car∣ried with him thither, and at a season when that Climate gives little encouragement to abide in those Seas. I am not yet to enlarge upon that matter, till I hear a better account from some of our friends: however though he could not meet with their whole Fleet, as he en∣deavoured to do; yet he hath had the good Forrune in two Encounters to take Eight of their great Ships of War, two of their best East-In∣dia Ships, and about twenty of their Merchants ships, all under the protection of their Fleet, or ought to have been; and was then by Tempest, and other Reasons, which no wisdome of his could prevent, obliged to put into our own Harbours. I do not mention the great numbers of the Prisoners we have taken, an Army of Prisoners, who, in truth do us more harm at Land, than ever they did at Sea, and are a charge that never fell under our Estimate and computation: I would not be understood, that we had entred up∣on a War, and never thought of Prisoners, and sick, and wounded men; but, that the Prisoners, and wounded men should bring upon us so prodigious an Expence, and of which we can yet see no bottom; in∣somuch, as in one place, I think Colchester, that charge comes to twelve hundred pounds the week; I say, such an Expence never came into our computation. The King tells you, He hath enabled the Prince and Bishop of Mun∣ster to demand Justice from those who have so notoriously oppressed him with such outragious Circumstances of Insolence and scorn, as are enough known to the world; and he hath demanded it bravely, in such an Equipage as hath not been made for little Money, in which he can take, as well as ask, satisfaction. After all this, since there is a Justice due to the worst Enemies, We must do them this right, that they do not at all seem weary of the War, they do not discover the least inclination to Peace. It is true, the French King hath offered his Mediation: and truly if he intends no more than a Mediation, it is an Office very worthy The most Christian King; I wish with all my heart, that (as a Mediatour) he would make equal propositions, or that he would not so importunately press His Majesty to consent to those he makes, upon an Instance and Argu∣ment, that he holds himself engaged by a former Treaty (of which we never heard till since the beginning of this war, and had some reason to have presumed the contrary) to assist the Dutch with Men and Money, if His Majesty doth not consent. His Majesty tells you, that he hath not an appetite to make war for war sake, but will be alwaies ready to make such a Peace as may
be for His Honour, and the interest of his Subjects; and no doubt but it will be a great trouble and grief to him to find so great a Prince, towards whom he hath manifested so great an affection, in conjunction with his Enemies: yet even the apprehension of such a war will not terrifie him to purchase a Peace by such Concessions as he would be ashamed to make you acquainted with; of which nature you will easily believe the Propositions hitherto made to be, when you know that the release of Poleroon in the East-Indies and the demolishing the Fort of Cabo-Corso upon the Coast of Guiny, are two, which would be upon the matter to be content with a very vile Trade in the East-Indies, under their Comptroll, and with none in Guiny. And yet these are not Propositions unreasonable enough to please the Dutch, who reproach France for interposing for Peace, instead of assisting them in the War; boldly insisting upon the advantage the Contagion in London and some other parts of the Kingdome gives them, by which they confidently say, the King will be no longer able to maintain a Fleet against them at Sea; and as if God Almighty had sent this heavy visitation upon the Kingdom on their behalf, and to expose it to their malice and insolence. They load us with such re∣proaches, as the civility of no other Language will admit the Relation; the truth is, they have a Dialect of rudeness so peculiar to their Language and their People, that it is high time for all Kings and Princes to oblige them to some Reformation, if they intend to hold Correspondence or Commerce with them, My Lords and Gentlemen, You see in what posture we stand with refe∣rence to our Neighbours abroad, who are our declared Enemies; their malice and activity to make others declare themselves so too; the great preparations they make, and even Declarations that they will have another Battel, towards which they have in readiness an equal number of new, greater, and better ships to those they have lost, furnished with larger and greater Artillery; so that if they were to be manned with any other Nation then their own, they might be worthy our apprehension. What preparations are to be made on our part, you can best judge. I have fully obeyed the Command that was laid upon me, in making you this plain, clear, true narrative of what hath pas∣sed; I have no Order to make any refliction upon it, nor any deduction from it: The King himself hath told you, that the noble unparalleld Supply you have already given him, is upon the matter spent, spent with all the Animad∣versions of good Husbandry, that the nature of the affair would bear, What is more to be done, He leaves entirely to your own Generous understanding, being not more assured of any thing that is to come in this world, than that the same Noble indignation for the honour of the King and the Na∣tion, that first provoked you to enflame the King himself, will continue the same passion still boiling in your Loyal Breasts, that all the world may see, which they hoped never to have seen, that never Prince and People were so entirely united in their Affections, for their true, joynt, inseparable Honour, as the only sure infallible Expedient to preserve their distinct several Interest. My Lords and Gentlemen, you have great reason to be weary; yet having only presented you a short view of your Forreign Eremies, it may not be altogether unseasonable that you take a little prospect of those at home, those unquiet, restless Spirits in your own Bowels, upon whose Infidelity I doubt your Enemies abroad have more dependence than upon their own Fleets. I must appeal to every one of your Observations, wherher the coun∣tenances of those men have not appeared to you more crected, more insolent
in all places fince the beginning of this war, then they were before; in what readiness they were, if any misfortune had befallen the Kings Fleet (which they promised themselves) to have brought the Calamity into your Fields, and into your Houses, is notoriosly known. The horrid Murtherers of Our late Royal Master, have been received into the most secret Councels in Holland; and other infamous prostituted persons of our Nation, are admit∣ted to a share in the Conduct of their Affairs, and maintain their Corre∣spondence here upon liberal allowances and Pensions. Too many of His Ma∣jesties Subjects, who were lent by this Crown to assist and defend this in∣grateful State against their Enemies, have been miserably wrought upon for the keeping a vile, mean Subsistence, rather than Livelihood, to re∣nounce their Allegiance, and become Enemies to their Native Country: Some of whom have wantonly put themselves on Board the Enemies Fleet, without Command or Office, purely out of appetite and de∣light to rebel against their King, and to worry their Countrey: It is great pity these men should not be taught by some exemplary brand, that their Allegiance is not circumscribed within the four Seas; but that they have Obligations upon them of Duty and Loyalty towards the King, in what part of the world soever they shall inhabit. Their friends at home, impatient of longer delays for the successes they had promised themselves, and for the Succours which others had promised to send to them, made no doubt of doing the business themselves, if they could appoint but a lucky day to begin the work; and you had heard of them in all places upon the third of the last moneth, their so much celebrated Third of September, if the great vigilance and indefatigable industry of the Good General, who is alwayes watchful for the Kings Safety, and the Peace of the Kingdom, had not two days before apprehended the Seditious Lead∣ers, and given Advertisements for the securing others in most parts of the Kingdom; by the Confessions of many of whom their wicked Design is enough manifested and ready for Justice: Yet some of the Principal Per∣sons are not yet taken, and some others got themselves rescued after they were apprehended. My Lords and Gentlemen, Let it not, I beseech you, be said of us, what was heretofore said of the Senate of Rome when they were prosperous enough, and when they had ob∣tained greater Victories over their enemies abroad then we have done, Excellentibus in∣gentis citius defuit ars, qua Civem regant, quam qua hostem perdant; Let not these Scorpi∣ons be kept warm in our bosoms till they sting us to death. Let not those who hate the Government, would destroy the Government, be sheltred under the Shadow and Pro∣tection of the Government. It is possible, and God knows it is but possible, that some men who are not friends to this or that part of the Government (for you are not to be∣lieve that they always discover what they are in truth most angry with) who would not buy these Alterations they most desire, at the price of a Civill Warre; they would bring it fairly about, wait for a Godly Parliament, and do all by their consent; Yet those persons must not take it ill that we cannot desire they should ever have it in their power to bring these Alterations to pass by those means they now seem to abhor: And I do heartily wish, I am sure they will not be the worse men, nor the worse Sub∣ject for it, that they would a little reflect upon what is past, remember how much they have once done, more then they intended to have done, nay, what they did heartily ab∣hor the thought of doing; and they will then find the only way to preserve themselves innocent is to keep their minds from being vitiated by the first impressions, by Jealou∣sies, Murmurings and Repinings; and above all, by the conversation with those men, or indulgence towards them, who would sactifice the peace of the Kingdom to their own Ambition, Pride, and even to their Humour. If you carefully provide for the sup∣pressing your enemies at home, which will put you to little other expence then of Cou∣rage, Constancy and Circumspection: You will find your enemies abroad less exalted, and in a short time more inclined to live in Amity with you, then to make War upon you, especially when they see you do in bell pacis gerere negotium, and that you take the carrying on the War to heart, as the best and the only expedient to produce a happy and an honest Peace. FINIS.
