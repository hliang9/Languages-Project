To the READER. Christian Reader, and all Sober People, that have Read Roger Williams his Book, and may come to Read this Answer, THough we are sorry, we have this occasion, that R. W. hath given us, to give forth this Reply and Dispute with him of his Slanderous Proposals (we cannot look upon them otherwise, but so; and therefore for Truth's sake, as it is in JESUS, and for the Name of Christ and true Christianity have we been constrained to Answer him, as we have done both in Dispute and in this:) Yet we have so much Charity to be∣lieve, that all the Professors in New-England are not of his Iudgment; and those that are, they are like to bear their own Burthen, whether they are Priests or Magistrates. But of all the Books I ever read, I never saw so much Foul Lan∣guage and Contradictions (which would swell up a Book too much, if we should let the Reader see them all distinct) And also so many false Conclusions & Inferences, that he hath made, and Invented Words and Principles to be ours, which we never Heard of before, neither ever were in our Thoughts: and then, when he hath done, he Raileth at them and us. If a Man had sold himself to Work Wickedness, and (Inspired with a dark Power and Spirit) to invent Falshood against an Innocent and Suffering People, Roger Williams hath done it; who abuseth his Pen, abuseth the Press, abuseth his Neighbours; and he living in a Peaceable Government: Which when the People called Quakers had the Government, they never molested him. AND so 'tis not only the Quakers, but other Sorts of People, that he flies out against; which we question, whether ever he had so much Modesty, as to speak to any of their Faces: But this has been his Work, to defile Peoples Minds with his Lies, Slanders, Falshoods and Forgeries of things against us, which we do Abhor: as may be seen in his Book. And that which we desire is, That the Lord may
give him REPENTANCE, and all that join with him, if it be his Will, and it be not bid from his and his Consede∣rates Eyes. And let but the Reader read Roger Williams's former Books, and compare them with this, that he hath written now, and see, how he Contradicts himself: and see, what a great Occasion he and his Brother take against J. B. for calling him Old Man, or saying, He would not bear upon the Old Man, because of his Age, and that he pitied him, &c. when he brought his false Charges against us, and could not make them good. But let the Reader see all his foul Lan∣guage in his Book (who stiles himself an Orator to the King, and let the Reader judge, whether he is worthy of that Title, out of whose Mouth are come so many. Corrupt Words, Ac∣cusing or Blaming us for saying in pity to him, That he was an Old Man? But let the Reader see, if such Language be∣comes Gray Hairs?) together with his Forgeries, that he has Forg'd and Publish'd against an Innocent and Suffering People. And if the New England Priests and Governors have tolerated, and aided and assisted him in the Printing of his Book against us, we cannot expect any otherways, who have been our Persecutors, and some to DEATH; and so we must leave him and them to the Lord, and Vengeance is his, and he will Reward every one of them according to their Words and Works: Which certainly he will do, and none shall escape the Omnipotent Hand of God. And our Hope, and Trust and Confidence is in the LORD, the Li∣ving God, and we do not fear, what Man can do unto us: for had we, we had never stood your WHIPPING-STOCKS, your GALLOUSES to DEATH (whose BLOOD Cries to God through the Nations) and your CUTTING OFF EARS, and your HOT BRANDING-IRON, and your Cruel Mockings, and Threats, and SPOILING of GOODS, and besides all the Lies, and Slanders and Forgeries, that have been Forged against us; So that Christ's Saying is ful∣filled
among you, They shall speak ALL MANNER of EVIL for his Name's sake against his People: so it's not One Man∣ner, but ALL MANNER. But we can Triumph in the Love of God and the Lord IESUS Christ; and desire the Lord to Forgive you (if it be his Will) for all your Wickedness, that ye have done and spoken against us, and that ye may all come to see your selves, Whose Servants ye have been? and Whose Work ye have been doing? and Whom ye have fol∣lowed? And what Spirit ye are of, not to be of Christ's, who came to Save Mens Lives, and not to Destroy them. And we must further Declare, that we cannot Trust our Bo∣dies and Souls in the Hands of such, that do not know, what Spirit they are of themselves, and have not Power over their own Raging and Persecuting Spirits; who are Like unto a City, whose Walls are broken down. But our Trust is in Christ, who is the Chief Shepherd, whom we are turn'd to; who Feeds us in his Pasture of Life: Our Bishop to Oversee us, and our Prophet, that God hath raised up, like unto Moses, whom we do Hear, &c. And our Councellour and Leader, that God hath given us: our Priest, that hath Died for us, and Risen for our Justification; and at the Right Hand of God: who is our Mediator (the Man Christ Jesus) betwixt us and God; and is the Author and Finisher of our Faith: And is our High-Priest over the Household of Faith, and doth Sanctify us, and Wash us with his Precious Blood; that he may present us to God without Spot or Wrinkle, or Blemish, o any such thing: Who Rules in our Hearts by Faith, and in his Grace and Light, Power, and Spirit and Truth, that comes by him; That in the Spirit we come to sit down in him, as the Saints did of Old, our REST, yea, in Heavenly Places in Christ Jesus: And so can praise God through IESUS Christ, YEA and AMEN, the First and the Last.

A New-England Fire-brand Quenched: OR, An Answer to a Lying, Slanderous Book Printed at Boston in the Year 1676. by one Roger Williams of Providence in New-England; which he Dedi∣cateth to the KING, with Desires, That (if the most-High please) Old and New-England may flourish, when the Pope and Mahomet, Rome and Constantinople are in their Ashes, &c. R. W. ANd in his Title-Page he begins thus: George Fox digged out of his Burrowes; Or an Offer of a Skirmish upon (R. W's) 14 Proposals made this last Summer 1672. unto G. F. present on Rode-Island;Tit. p and that (G. F. slily departing) the Disputation went on as aforesaid. And in his Narration of the Conference or Dispute he again asserts, that he challenged G. F. by writing, and all his Friends then met at Rode-Island; and that then G. F. withdrew. And farther in his second Page says, he sent his Paper of Proposals unto G. F. at Newport.R W's Contra∣diction. And in the 4 and 5 pages he says, he sent his Paper to Capt. Cranston, Deputy Governour of Rode Island. And further scornfully says; The old Fox thought it best to run for it, and leave the work to his Journey-men and Chaplains, &c. And in the 22 and 23 Pages he further says, Within some few days, after the De∣puty Governour had delivered his Paper to them, the strange Quakers, (as was agreed with G. Fox) &c. Answ. How dare R. W. to Dedicate such palpable Lies to the King? For this R. W. never spoke to G. F. nor did G. F. receive any Letter from this R. W. and yet he impudently says (p. 23) As was agreed with G. F. Nor did G. F. receive any of these 14 Proposals from him, though he says, These 14 Proposals were made last Summer unto G. F. and that he digged him out of his Burroughs: Which Proposals G. F. not only never received, but never saw, nor so much as knew of them;
though R. W. scornfully and falsly says, G. F. slily departed; and that G. F. hath pluckt in his Horns, as J. T. did, &c. But in this doth R. W.'s. wickedness farther appear, in that J. T. might have received Letters from him; but G. F. never received any from him, nor knew. R. W. farther says, He sent his Proposals to G. F. to Newport; and yet pag. 4 says, He sent them to the Deputy Governour Cranston. [But G. F. never so much as received, or saw any such Proposals from the Deputy Governour, or knew of any such thing, when he went off the Island.] And yet R. W. says (page 5) That G. F. knew, he was furnisht with Artillery out of G. F.'s own writings, and that he knew the Con∣sequence that would follow; and therefore the old Fox thought, it was best to run for it, and leave his Journey-Men, &c. An. This also is untrue, for G. F. knew nothing of his Accusations, or pretended proof, which R. W. vainly calls his Artillery; nor that he ever read, much less objected any thing against G. F.'s Book. Oh! how darest thou Roger Williams, publish such false lyes to the World, when thou knowest in thy Conscience, that G. F. had never any Writing, or Letter, or Proposals from thee: neither did he ever ex∣change a word with thee. The Lord God of Heaven knowes it, and the Deputy Governour knowes, that I received none of thy Writings or Papers of Proposals by him. Behold all sober people the foundation of this mans Attempt, the beginning of his work; and since the foundation of thy Book is a notorious lye, the building upon such a foundation of lyes is not like to be otherwise: which lyes thou hast made thy refuge; as throughout thy Book may be evidently seen. For except a man had sold himself to work falshood, and make lyes; he could not have done more wickedly, and have uttered falser charges then thou hast done. But the Lord God which knows them, and sees thy evil design in them, will sweep them away with the besom of Destruction, and clear his people from thy manifest false tongue. And I doubt not but the Deputy Governour will testifie for me, that I am clear of this charge; and that I never saw, nor knew that which R. W. writ, and sent to him. But which is strange, though G. F. was several weeks at Rode-Island, and at Providence (where it seems, this old Priest R. W. dwells) and in all that time he never spoke to G. F. nor writ to him of any such thing: but sends its like, these his Papers to the Deputy Governour; what was in them (as I said) I knew not, they being delivered to him, after I was gone of the Island, as he writes himself.
For his dating of his Letter, what was that to G. F? for J.T. tells R. W. of his misdating of his Letter, as R. W. confesses himself in his 11 p. wherein he writes to J. T. Your second Letter I received misdated as well as mine. But by this all may see the wickedness, that is in the Bottle of this R. W. by what does flow out of it in his Book, to wit, A malitious spirit against G. F. who was never concern∣ed with him by word or writing, much less did G. F. ever do him wrong. And yet he says, G. F. well knew, what Artillery he was furnisht with out of his own bald writings, (as he scoffingly calls them) &c. when never a word of this is true: though he presumes to pre∣sent it to the King for Truth concerning G. F. R. W. Again he says (p. 4, 5) that it was concluded and agreed in a Juncto at Newport, that his Letter should not be delivered to the Deputy Governour, until G. F. was gone. Ans. This also is an abominable falshood, the Lord knows it, a groundless untrue imagination of his own; for there was no such Agreement or Consultation. Is this man fit to write of Religion, that lyes? a vain man! What is he, and his designs, that they should re∣quire Consultations and Junctos? So let the honest Reader Judge, from whence R. W. had all these lyes, if not from his Father the Devil, who is out of Truth: but with the Truth is both his Father and he Judged. And this is R. W.'s Landskip (as he calls it) of the Battle fought betwixt him and the Quakers. But G. F. never spoke with him, nor received any Challenge from him: and yet this man can boast, & saith G. F. slily withdrew and fled (Which untruth is more then slily suggested; for it is impudently asserted by R. W.) But it's well known by many in that Countrey, that G. F. was long enough upon Rode-Island; that if R. W. had any mind to have written to him, or spoken to him, he might have easily had an opportunity. But it was R. W. that was slily in his burroughs then, and kept in his Horns, who had nothing to say to G. F. to his face, whilst he was upon the Colony and Province of Rode-Island. And it seems but reasonable, that he should have written to G. F. as well as to the Deputy Governour, if he had a mind, that G. F. should have seen it: but the Lord, who is over all knows and sees his creeping and lying Spirit, and from whence it doth proceed. And though he may deceive some with these his lyes, and very vain boasts, as that G. F. knew what he had against him, what Artillery he had got∣ten, and what Consequences would rowl down the Mountains upon him: (these are R. W. his own expressions) yet G. F. stands in his inno∣cency
in the power of God over it all; nor can such Trash deceive any, that are of a sober and temperate Spirit, and make Conscience of what they believe. But this lying Spirit would be seen to defend the Protestant Religion; but it is his own Religion (if he has any) that is out of Truth, that he would defend: And this is like the persecuting Spirit of the professors of New-England, as will be further manifested in time. R. W. And all that read his Epistle, may see, how he goes about to flatter the King,Epistle to the King. [but the Lord knoweth his heart, and the hearts of you New-England Professors were and are manifest] And all that read his Epistle to the King, may see, what meer flattery it is, who says; That because he heard it affirmed, that the King had one of most of the Quakers Books, therefore says R. W. he will present the King the Protestant Truth more justly, then his Popish & Ar∣minian Opposites did offend his Royal Eyes with smoak out of the deep Pit. Ans. Doth not R. W. here abuse the King? and yet hopes for Pa∣tronage under him. But does R. W. think, that the King will not see through his flatteries and vain applauses? R W. And after this, Roger, thou tells the King, The Pope and the Quakers pretend to Enthusiasme and Infallibilities; and then thou boasts, that thou hast detected much of their Impostures: and then thou desirest, His Royal Spirit may he preserved from both their cheats, which is the Oracle of Hell in their mouths. Ans. Ah! R. W. dost thou think, the King will not see through thy words here again? But for the Oracle of Hell, thou shouldst have lookt at home for it, as thy following words will manifest it. But is New-England such a Glory to the Protestant Name, as thou boasts of, and wouldst have the King believe? the King knows you bet∣ter, who have Hanged, Cut off Ears, Burnt with hot Iron, Banisht, Whipt so many of the true Protestants, and King's Subjects too: did ever the Papists do worse? R. W. And yet thou sayst to the King, If the Most-High please, Old and New-England may flourish, when the Pope and Mahomet, Rome, and Constantinople are in Ashes. Ans. How now Roger, what a selfish Prayer is this? Dost thou think, that God, or Christ or the King, or any at White-Hall will hear this Prayer? is this a Loyal Subject, or an Affectionate Orator at the Throne of Grace? But why wouldst thou have Rome and Constantinople in the Ashes? why wouldst have these two Cities in the Ashes? What hurt do these Cities to thee and the New-England Priests & Professors?
And why wouldst thou have the Pope and Mahomet burnt? and not only so, but the Cities of Rome and Constantinople also? what smoak is this, that is come out of thy Pit? Wast thou not speaking but now of the Popish and Arminian Opposites, that did offend the Kings Royal Eyes? and why wouldst have Rome and Constantinople, and Mahomet, and the Pope in Ashes to smoak and offend the King's Eyes? But dost thou think that either God, or Christ, or the King, or any true Protestant will receive thy unmerciful, unnatural and wicked Prayer? Here the King and his Councel may see, what Spirit the New-England Priests are of, by Roger Williams their great Oratour. For if the Pope and Mahomet be Enemies, were not thou to love them according to Christ's Doctrine? where is thy Christianity now Roger? And if the Pope or Mahomet have destroyed any for Religion, art not thou as bad as they? nay worse, because thou professest thy∣self a better Christian: And yet thou wouldst not only have Pope and Mahomet burnt to Ashes, but their Cities also; which include hun∣dreds of thousands of People, and some Protestants too, that may be there. But here it is plain, (as in Luke 9.) that thou dost not know, what Spirit thou art of; as Christ told James and John, better men then thee, when they said, Wilt thou, that we command Fire to come down from Heaven, even as Elias did? but Christ turned him about, and rebuked them, and said, You know not, what Spirit you are of; for the Son of man is not come to destroy mens lives, but to save them. And so R. W. thou dost not know thy own Spirit; and therefore art very unfit to direct other Men's. But if R. W. had been such an Oratour, and able Minister of Christ, he had better have gone and Preach'd Re∣pentance to the Pope and Mahomet, and not to rail against them behind their backs; as he doth here against G. F. and others, who never had to do with him. And would not many people suffer besides Papists and Mahometans, if Rome and Constantinople should be burnt? would this cause Old and New-England to flourish? this is rising by the Ruins of others. Is this his Christian Practice and Doctrine, and way of Converting the Nations to God? but how short is R. W. of the Royal Law of God, To do unto all men, as he would have them do unto him. But the People of God (called Quakers) are not of R. W.'s mind; for they have the mind of Christ, and would have the Pope and Papists, and Mahometans to rpent: and do no sire to see Rome nor Constantinople in their Ashes; but in the Truth, as it is in ESVS. But all may see, what is in this New England Piest's heart (his mouth has published it, and spoken it to the King who hath not the Spirit,
nor words of a true Christian, which is, To love Enemies, and pray for them; not Persecute, and burn to Ashes them that evilly entreat them. O this wicked, envious, destroying Spirit, that would de∣populate the Earth to satisfie it's evil mind, the Lord rebuke it! But now, would New England Professors and R. W. their Oratour like it well, if the Pope and Turk should pray, that New-England, and he and them should be burnt to Ashes? And R. W. saith in his Epistle to the people called Quakers,Epistle to the Quakers. From his Childhood (now above Threescore years) the ather of Light and Mercy hath touched his soul with a love to himself; to his only begotten the true Lord Jesus, to his Holy Scriptures, &c. His infinite wisdom hath given him to se the City, Court and Country, the Schooles and Vniver∣sities of his Native Country, to converse with some Jews, Turks and Papists, and all sorts of Protestants, and by Books to know the affairs and Religions of all Countries. Ans. Roger, if thy Judgement and knowledge be no better of Jews, Turks, Papists and Protestants, and Religions, then it is of the People of God called Quakers, thy Knowledge and Judgement is little worth for all thy great boast. Thou tells us of thy Knowledge: and if ths be the end of thy Threescore-years work, it's sad, to publish so many falshoods to the world against the People of God (which thou hadst not from the Father of Lights) and at this Age to desire Pope, Turk, Rome and Constantinople were in Ashes; which thou received not from the God of Mercies, nor his only begotten the true Lord Jesus, nor from the Holy Scriptures, but from the Father of lyes, the destroyer, who appeared against the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles, and against Adam and Eve in Paradice. And Roger, we desire, that thou may'st see a day of Repentance, if it be not hid from thy eyes. R. W. Thy Conclusion is: Be of good chear, thy sins are forgiven thee, Mat. 9. and it is one of the joyfult sounds that ever came to poor sinful ears. How to obtain this sund from the mouth of the Mediator that spoke it, is the greatest Dispute betwixt the Protestants, and the bloody Whre of Rome: this is also the great point betwixt the Protestants and your selves (to wit, the Quakers.) Ans. As for the Papists we leave them to answer R, W. themselves, but we never had this Dispute before, how to obtain this sound from the mouth of the Mediator (to wit, Christ Jesus) that is to say, be of good chear, thy sins be forgiven thee. Now, if R. W. or any of his dark
Company doth not know, how to obtain this sound from the mouth of Christ the Mediator, (which he says, is the Dispute betwixt the Papists and them, and them and the Quakers, though they both hear the sound or report of it) if this be the Question, we tell him and them, by faith▪ as they did in Matth. 9. and by believing in the Light, which comes from Jesus, which Jesus hath enlightened them withall, with which they may see their sin; and by believing in it see Christ their Saviour and Mediator, and hear his Heavenly voice, saying, be of good chear, thy sins be forgiven thee. Which the Quakers have heard, and so are his Sheep, and know his voice, and follow him; who gives them Life Eternal, and would have none to perish, Joh. 10. So we are to hear him, (and not to turn away from him) that speaketh from Heaven, &c. Heb. 12, 25, 26. R. W. And further he saith: As also in Order to this to know, what man is (to the utmost) now by Nature? and what the true Lord Jesus is? and other Controversies discussed in this Book, not unworthy this your serious Weighing (as Mary did) in the Hearts and Spirits &c. Ans. He may see by the Scripture, how the Apostle hath made known, what man is now by Nature in his fallen State, to wit, dad in Sins and Trespasses, Ephe. 2. and what a Wicked mans State is? and how man is Saved? And Moses declares, how Man and Woman were before they fell; as may be seen Gen. 1. And Christ himself declares, how he and the Father is known by Revelation, wherein Christ said, I thank thee O Father, Lord of Heaven and Earth, for thou hast hid these things from the Wise and Prudent, and hast revealed them unto Babes: even so Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight. And no man knowes, who the Son is, but the Father, and who the Father is, but the Son, and to whom the Son will reveal him, Luk. 10, 21, 22. And (mark) it seems, we must weigh R. W's words, as Mary did Christs, and in our Hearts and Spirits: Nay Roger, we shall not make thy words equal with Christ's; for they are easily savour'd to come from another Spirit then Christs, as thou hast manifested in thy Book. R. W. And when thou hast told us, what the Jesuites, and the Pope do, then thou say'st, Satan pretends to exalt and deifie you, under the Name of God, and Christ, and the Spirit, &c. but his end is, as Peter tells us, to exalt himself, and fill his Hellish Paunch with Souls. Ans. This R. W. had better have kept to himself, who pretends so much of God, and Christ, and the Spirit, &c. for it suits his own Condition the best, and not the Quakers. But Roger, where doth Peter use any such Expressions in the Scripture, as, Satan to fill his
Hellish Paunch with Souls? this is the first time it was Scripture. Where doth Peter use any such Language? is not this to abuse Peter's Scripture, and that blessed Spirit, from whence the Scripture came? thou shouldst not charge such Vnsavory words upon Peter, and tell us, that Peter tells you so? Therefore do not belye Peter, a Holy A∣postle, as thou hast done us. And we charge thee to mention the Chap. and Verse, where Peter has told thee, and you New-England Priests such words, as Satan to exalt himself, to fill his Hellish Paunch with Souls? for we do not read, that ever Peter spoke these words; but they are of thy own forging. R. W. Thou say'st, I have used some sharp Scripture-Language, but not as commonly you do, passionately and unjustly. I sometimes call you Foxians, (as Nicolaitans from Nicholas, &.) because G. F. appear∣ed the greatest Writer and Speaker, &c. among you. Ans. Here, hast thou not given thyself the lye? is this Scripture-Language, to call the People of God Foxians? And how darest thou parallel the People of God in scorn called Quakers, with the Nicolai∣tans, whose Principles and Practices we do abhor? but this is thy Passion and Vnjust Dealing. But if we should tell thee, thou art a Scoffer, and a Mocker, and a Nick-namer, this is not Passionate nor Vn∣just, when we find thee so doing. And when we have told you Per∣secuting Priests of New-England, who Hanged, and Banished, and Cut off Ears, that you were in Cains Nature and Jezabels, and the Beast, and the Whore, that drunk the blood of the Saints, and killed the Lords People, this was just, and true enough to tell you, what you were, and whose work you are doing, to wit, the Murderers and not Christ's; for your works show it. R. W. And thou say'st, Sure it is, that he subtily run for it (to wit, G. F.) he ordered, that my Letters to our Deputy Governour (in which my Proposals to G. F. were) should not be delivered to the Deputy, until G. F. was some hours under Sail, that he might say, he never saw my Paper: though it is as clear as Noon-day, that he knew all matters by Copies, Letters and Relations perfectly, many days before his de∣parture. Ans. Here is the manifestation of a wicked lying Spirit. First, that he is sure, G. F. run for it: And next, that G. F. ordered, that his Letters should not be given to the Deputy Governour, till G. F. was some hours under Sail: and thirdly, that G. F. might say, he never saw his Paper: and lastly, that it is as clear as Noon-day, that G. F. knew all matters by Copies of Letters and Relations perfectly, many dayes be∣fore
his departure. These are four great Lies: for G. F. knew not, what was in thy Papers Roger, neither had G. F. seen the Copies of those Proposals; neither did G. F. hinder their being delivered to the Governour. Nor did G. F. ever receive any Letters from R. W. or go away for fear of him or them; nor was it a likely thing, that he should, when he knew nothing of them: for as I said before, when I was at Providence, where this Roger lives, he came not at me. And if he had any thing to have spoken to me, he might easily have done it, or have written to me, and have sent the same Copies to me, he sent to Captain Cranston; and not have made a clamour against me, belying of me to the world behind my back, when I was gone. But this is like the Fruits of his Spirit, but not the Spirit of Christ, and his Disciples. R. W. And whereas thou say'st; G. F. knew, that I was furnished out of his own Writings with Artillery. Ans. This is notoriously false; for G. F. never knew, that thou hadst any of his Books, as before. R. W. And thou seemest to flatter John Stubs, and John Burneyat, and rail'st against W. Edmondson, and say'st, W. E. was nothing but a bundle of Ignorance and Boysterousness; but J. S. and J. B. were In∣genuous. Ans. Yet all these three were Constantly on thee at once, as thou say'st; where was their Ingenuity then? here is thy Contradiction and Confusion. R. W. And thou say'st often over, that John Stubs said in Publick, That thou did'st not interrupt us. And thou say'st: You shall never per∣swade Souls (not bewitched) that the Holy Spirit of God should per∣swade your Women and Maidens to appear in Publick (Streets and Assem∣blies) stark Naked. Ans. We do believe thee, in that dark, persecuting, bloody Spirit, that thou and the New-England Priests are bewithed in, you cannot believe, that you are Naked from God and his Cloathing, and Blind. And therefore hath the Lord in his power moved some of his Sons and Daughters to go Naked; yea, and they did tell them in OLIVERS days, and the Long Parliament's, That God would strip them of their Church-profession, and of their Power as Naked as they were. And so they were True Prophets and Prophetesses to the Nation, as many Sober Men have confessed since; though thou and the Old Persecuting Priests in New-England remain in your Blindness and Nakedness. But it is, as it was of old, The Prophet is a Fool, and the Spiritual Man is Mad.
R. W. And whereas thou say'st, It is hard to perswade a Fox, or a Woolf, that he is so. Ans. Now this is thine and the New-England Priests and Pro∣fessors condition. For we grant you, that you have the Sheeps-Cloath∣ing; but you have shewed the Wlfs Nature in Worrying the Lambs, and sucking their blood▪ and tearing their Fleece. And are in your filthy Dreams, that thou tellest us of: and that thou art more ac∣quainted with such Dreams, that thou tells us of, then thou art with Christ Jesus; for thy words savour not of his Spirit. R. W. And then thou say'st, All that I can hope for (without Gods wonderful mercy) is, to give my Testimony in my Generation: for (as Solon on speaks of the Whore) Few or None of you will return. Ans. Nay Roger, We see, where thou and the New-England Priests and Professors are, the Lord has called us from among you, your Wolfish Nature, who feed upon the husk, like the Prodigal: and it is the Wonder∣ful Mercy of God, who hath called us by his Grace, to hear and fol∣low his Son. And so, it is not like for us To turn to you: but as the Lord saith to his Prophet, Turn not thou to them, but let them turn to thee: and therefore we cannot forsake the Living Mercies, and turn to your broken Cisterns, that cannot bold water. And as for Solomon's speaking of the Whore, apply that at home Roger. For dost not thou after all thy Lies wipe thy mouth? and did not all your Per∣secuting Priests and Professors, after they had Hanged and Cut off Ears, and Banisht the Lords Servants, wipe their mouths too? and is not this the Mark and Die of the Red Whore? But God seeth your hearts and mouths, and so doth his Holy People, which are built upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apostles, to wit, Christ Jesus: and we know what your foundation is, and your building too, they are Lyes and Bloody. R. W. And thou say'st, I have proved, and will prove (if God please) that Spiritual Pride about Spiritual matters is the Root and Branch of your whole Religion; and that the King Eternal, who did cast out proud Angels out of his Palace, will hardly open his Gates to Proud and Scornful Dust and Ashes. Ans. Roger, This is, as I said before, thy own Condition, and the New-England Priests and Professors: Oh! that your eyes were o∣pen that you might see it! And so, what thou measurest to others, it will be measured to thee again, pressed down and running over: and the God of the World will fail thee in thy proof, and hath failed thee, and deceived thee; as he did thy Mother Eve, and thy Father Adam.
For this is the Mouth of the Pit, that thou speakest of, and Lucifers boast in thee against the Children of the Lord, that are daily in Jeopardy of their Lives: and some of them have lost their Lives amongst you in New-England in Obedience to the Command of Christ, their Saviour. But now, since the Indians have risen upon them, they have con∣fessed, how greatly they have fallen; as you may see in the Declaration 1675. but it is well, if it prove better, then Pharaoh's Confession. But the Lord God hath opeed his Gates of Life and Mercy to us, that obey his voice; and Christ has opened the Book to us, which you can∣not shut; Glory to his Name forever. And though we have the same Portion from thee, and such as thou art, as the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles had, the will of the Lord be done; and as Christ said, If they did so unto the green Tree, what would they do unto the dry? and we know, they hated Christ our Lord and Master with∣out a Cause: and so you do us.— But R. W. may say, He doth not Persecute with his hands. But let him read p. 200. of his Book, wherein he declares himself, That a due and moderate Restraint and Punishment he would have inflicted upon us, yea, though pretending Con∣science: and he would not have this called Persecution. But would R. W. be so served himself? No: but now he lives in a Peaceable Government, where he cannot Exercise his Cruelty, and he hath not the Sword in his hand, but is in a Restless spirit, who grudgeth at the Liberty of others, and cannot be content with his own; short of the Royal Law of God, That would do unto all, as they would have o∣thers do unto them. R. W. And then thou begins with a Flattering Epistle to R. Baxter and J. Owen,Epistle to R. B. our Old Persecutors, and tells them of G. F.'s silly and scornful Answers. Ans. Scornfulness we deny; and thou may'st look at home for that, in whose Chair thou sittest. And as for Silliness, Truth was always so called by that Spirit thou art of. R. W. And thou say'st, Through your sides (to wit R. B. and J. O.) the Devil by his Claws of this Wily Fox hath tore at the heart of the Son of God; it is no wonder then, if he tear at the heart of his Love-Letters, and the true Professors of his Name, who are Innumerable in Abraham's bosom, and the rest travailing uprightly thither. — As to the matters in difference betwixt your selves and me, I willingly omitted them, &c. Ans. Here you may see, though there is, and hath been great Dif∣ference betwixt R. W. R. B. and J. O. yet all these have written a∣gainst
Gods People, that are in the Truth. And as for the Devils Claws, and Tearing at the heart of the Son of God, and Tearing at the heart of his Love-Letters, and the true Professors of his Name, that are in Abrahams bosom, and them that are travailing up thither∣wards, I say, all these are Lyes, and come from an Evious Spirit. For the Son of God is our Life: and all that profess him in Truth, and are his followers, and all his Love-Letters, that he, and his holy Prophets and Apostles have given forth, we esteem them more then such as thee, that make a Trade of them. For is it not well known, what sufferings the People of God had in Oxford in the days of J. O. are they not upon Record? and was not Thomas Goodayr cast into Prison through R. B's means, when he was railing against the People of God, and T G. said but hum? But it's well, if they come to Re∣pentance for what they have done, for Imprisoning and Persecuting us, and the rest of their Tribe in the day of their Power, when they had both the Sword and the Bag. And so R.W. and the rest of the New-England Priests have been One with them in the Spirit of Envy and Malice against the People of God, like the Wily Foxes, whose Blood lyeth at all your dores. R. W. And after thou hast flattered R. B. and J. O. thou bids them Remember, he that loveth his life, shall loose it. — And of the 5 Bishops and 22 Ministers, and many other precious believers in the Lord Jesus, that were sacrificed in the flames for his ever-blessed sake against that Mon∣strous Man of Sin, and bloody Whore of Rome. These Foxians fancy is but a feather to those high Pico's &c. the Pope and Mahomet, whom some of you may live to see flung into the Lake, that burns with fire and brimstone. Ans. Here you may see, what a desire and a Spirit is in this R. W? hath not be manifested the same mind, that is in Mahomet? and is in the Bloody Whre, and the Man of sin, &c. that is the Destroyer? And why wouldst thou have them To live to see any flung into the Lake of Fire? for this is not like the mind of the Lord, that would have All men to be saved, and come to the knowledge of Truth: neither was it the mind of the Martyrs, that prayed for their Enemies; nor the mind of Christ, that Commands to pray for Enemies, and Persecutors, and love Enemies. But all may see, what a Devilish and Unchristian mind is in this R. W. whose desires are to R. B. and J. O. That they may see Mahomet and the Turk, and the Whore of Rme, and us (that he joyns with them, &c.) flung into the Lake of Fire, that burns with Brimstone. Now, would R. W. and the New-England
Priests be served so themselves, who are found in this Nature? How doth R. W. say the Lord's Prayer, The Lord forgive us &c? and so, is not his Eye double, and full of Darkness? Roger, give over Railing against the Quakers (and the Pope and the Turk) in the Woods, and in a Peaceable Government; but rather go and preach Repentance to them, and see, if thou darest say those Words to their faces (in the Streets at Rome, or in the Streets at Constan∣tinople) that thou hast written here behind their backs. For Christ tasted Death for Every Man, for Turk and Pope; and what canst thou tell, but they may Repent? therefore why should'st thou desire them To be in Ashes, or To be flung into the Lake, that burneth with Fire and Brimstone? For it is Christ, that will Re∣ward every man according to his Works, that hath dyed for all men, and tasted death for all men; out of whose Command and Doctrine thou manifestest thy Spirit to be. And take heed, that which thou speakest of others to see, that it doth not come up∣on thy self, that the same place is not thy portion: for it will be sure enough, except thou repent. And thou hast had enough of out∣ward Burning and Consuming to Ashes in the Province, where thou livest, since thy Book was written. And as for the Five Bishops and Two and Twenty Ministers, thou and you New-England priests are in the same Nature, that persecuted them. R. W. saith, That you (viz. R. B. and J. O.) more and more should study the Prophecies and the Signs of the Times, &c. and that you ought to be Instant and Constant at the Throne of Grace, &c. Answ. R. Williams, &c. you are to Study to be Quiet, and keep the Royal Law, To love your Neighbours as your selves; and Give over Slandering, and Lying and Persecuting God's people with the Tongue and Hand, and Desiring to have them punished for their pure Conscience to God: for Christ saith, Let the Tares and the Wheat grow together, till the Harvest (which is the End of the World,) &c. much more let the Wheat grow. For you are not like to Study the Prophets, nor the Signs of the Times, when you do not know, what Spirit you are of your selves; as Christ saith (in Luke) to such, as would have had fire to come down from Heaven upon them, that would not receive Christ: Nay, you are worse, for you would kindle fire on Earth to burn them, that would not receive you. R. W. And in thy Narration of the Conference thou say'st; I
have read over G. F's Book in Folio against (as I think) above Six Score Books and Papers written by Pious and Able Pens against them (the Quakers.pag. 1.2.) And this Summer hearing of his Coming into New-England, the poor Cheated Souls, the Quakers, expecting his Coming as the Com∣ing of an Angel of Light from Heaven, I read over his Book a∣fresh (as in the presence of the Eye of God) with a single Eye, &c. and more clearly finding his Answers so weak, silly, Antichristian and blasphemous, yet so imperious and scornful, so cursing and damning &c. all, that bow not down to their New-upstart Image, &c. Answ. Roger W. All that read thy words may see, it hath been an Evil Eye, that thou hast read G F's Book withal; and Herod and Pilate, Pharisees and Sadducees are agreed against the Lord's Christ and his people. For these are Pious to thee and Able Pen-men Now, that Once thou wast in Difference, but now dost joyn withal, meerly because they have Written and Printed against, and persecuted God's living Witnesse: as in the Days of Oliver there were several persecuted and Imprisoned to death, be∣sides what were PVT TO DEATH in New-England by that Generation, which practice was Antichristian. And thou being joyned with that Spirit, and envious against the people of God, that receivd G. F. Willingly in New-England, therefore with thy Evil Eye thou readst his Book, and brought'st forth thy Mon∣strous Birth of Lyes: and that which G. F. did write, which thou callest Silly or Weak, is come upon them. And as for Blasphemy, Imperious, Scornful, Damning, &c. thou may'st keep these words at home, which are the fruits of thy own spirit, as thy Book sheweth. — But what this New-Vpstart Image is, that we would have All bow down to, thou hast not manifested to us: for He, that we would have All people to come to, is CHRIST IESVS, and to receive him; whom all that are called Christians, profess in words. For as John saith, He that hath the Son, hath Life, and he that hath not the Son, hath not Life: he that believ∣eth in the Son of God, hath the Witness in himself, &c. AND THIS IS THE RECORD, that God hath given to us Eternal Life; and this Life is in his Son (1 Joh. 5.) who is the Bright∣ness of God's Glory, and the Express Image of his Person or Sub∣stance, and upholding all things by the Word of his Power: when
he had purged by himself our Sins, sate down on the Right Hand of the Majesty on High (Hebr. 1): and dost thou call this the New-Vpstart Image, and blasphem'st against it? And how darest thou open thy Mouth, and talk of the Holy Spirit of God and the Lord Jesus, and call him an Vpstart Image? who is manifest in the people of God called Quakers, and dwelleth in their hearts by Faith, which he is and hath been the Author of. R. W. And thou would'st make people believe, what thou hast done, hath been for the Honour of Christ, for thou say'st; My Spirit rose up within me, and I believe, the Holy Spirit of God, &c. quickned my Spirit to the present Vndertake, &c. Answ. If thou did'st believe in the Holy Spirit of God, thou would'st not be Against it in God's people, nor Blaspheme it, nor Tell Lyes, nor Call for Fire from heaven. R. W. And thou say'st, Therefore for his Holy Name's sake, af∣ter my Spirit was quickned, &c. I undertook this Service; and for the Name of the most-Holy, Only Begotten, the True Lord Jesus, the God-man and Mediator, &c. and for the Honour of the Most-holy Spirit of God so horribly torn in pieces by this foul Spirit of the Quakers. Answ. How darest thou take the Holy Name of the Lord Jesus or God into thy Mouth, and the Mediatour, &c? and his Holy Spirit into this foul Mouth, and speak so despitefully against him in his people? this is not an Honour to Christ Jesus. And is not this Blasphemy in thee to say, That the most Holy-Spirit of God can be torn in pieces by a foul Spirit? for where did ever the Prophets or Apostles use any such Expressions? It's said, They Resisted the Holy Ghost; but where is it said, They Horribly tore the most-Holy Spirit of God, or Jesus Christ the Mediatour in pie∣ces? We do charge R. W. to make it good (and all the Perse∣cuting Priests in New-England) by Scripture, where-ever Christ and the Prophets or Apostles said, That the most-Holy Spirit of God &c. could be so horribly torn in pieces by a foul Spirit? For R. W, aggravateth the words to the hight, and as high as he can: for his Words are these; The Most-holy Spirit of God &c. so horribly torn in pieces by this foul Spirit of the Quakers. First, we say, he is a BLASPHEMER, till he bring a proof out of the Scripture for it; which we know, he cannot do. Secondly, we deny his false Charge. For we own the Lord God, and the Lord Jesus Christ and his Holy Spirit to be our Helper, and
there is none but he, that hath been our Preserver to this day; that hath upheld us in all our Persecutions both with Tongue and Hand: and this (we can say) is good and acceptable in the Sight of God our Saviour, who would have All men to be saved, and come to the Knowledge of the Truth. R. W. is far from the A∣postle's mind, who desireth (in his Epistle) That Rome and the Pope, and Mahomet and Constantinople may be turned into Ashes; and that R. B. and J O. may live to see them cast into the Lake, that burneth with Fire and Brimstone: but we are of the same Mind with the Apostle, who saith; There is one God and one Mediatour betwixt God and Man, the Man Christ Jesus, who gave him∣self a Ransom for all, to be testified in due Time: Which is testified to us, the people of God called Quakers, Glory to God forever! who can love our Enemies, and pray for our Persecutors. R. W. it is thy Foul Spirit, that is torn in pieces; and therefore thou hast brought forth this Shattered Birth, which thou blasphemously Fatherest upon God's Spirit: and let the people Judge, whether it was the Spirit of God in R. W. that saith, That the Spirit of God can be Torn in pieces by a foul Spirit? this is to set the foul Spirit above the Spirit of God; and how can the Spirit of God mortify it? R. W. And further thou say'st; For the Vindicating of many of the precious Truths of the Old Christian Purity, and for the sake of so many precious Souls lying slain and bleeding before me, I made this Offer to G. F. and his Followers, &c. Answ. Thou hast not Manifested that Spirit to Vindicate the precious Truths of the Old Christians Purity; but thou hast Mani∣fested the Spirit of the Chief Priests and Pharisees against Christ and his Spirit, which is manifest in his people. And thy Spirit hath not so much care of Slain, Bleeding Souls, but is the Spirit, that doth SLAY, and maketh to BLEED. And for thy Making an Offer to G. F. when thou never spoke to him, nor writ to him, is not this a shame for such an Old Man, (that is above Three-score Years Old) to publish such Lyes to the World! I tell thee Roger, This Lying Spirit will never Vindicate the precious Truths of the Old Christians Purity, but is against that Spirit, that Vindicateth them, for it is Impare. — And thou dost Confess, that G. F. was at Providence, and spoke publickly; and thou say'st It was free for thee to have heard him, and opposed him: But why did'st thou not, seeing thou livest at Providence, where G. F. was? but there thou kept in thy Horns.
R. W. And to Excuse the Matter, thou say'st; But going the last year to one of their General Assemblies at New-port, and having begun to present some Considerations about the True Christ and the False, and the True Spirit and the False; and being cut off in the midst by the sudden Prayer of one, and the Singing of another, &c. Answ. So here thou may'st see, it was Thy Spirit, that was Cut by the Spirit of God, that led them to Pray and to Sing in Order: and this thou callest the Spirit of Confusion; and thus thou judgest of things thou knowest not, with thy Doting Spirit. For the True Christ we know, who is our Shepherd: and the False Spirit or Christ is easily savoured in thee, which was Cut off by the Spirit of Prayer and the Spirit of Singing from the True Spi∣rit of Christ. R. W. And then thou say'st: I resolved to try another way, and to offer a fair and full Dispute, &c. To this Purpose I drew up my Thoughts in 14. Propositions: and knowing, that Newport was the Chief Town on Rode-Island, and Providence on the Main, and that G. F. had spoke on both places, and bewitched many with his Sorceries, I sent this Paper following to G. F. at New∣port. Answ. R. W. here are more of thy Lyes, which proceed from thy Father of Lyes, which was a Lyar from the beginning, and abode not in the Truth. For thou say'st (pag. 4.) This Paper a∣bove said (to wit, of thy Lying and Scandalous Proposals) I sent in∣closed in a Letter to my Kind Friend Capt. Cranston, Deputy-Go∣vernour: and yet thou say'st (pag. 2) Thou-sent this Paper following to G. F. at Newport (Thy Offer of a Dispute on 14 Propositions:R. W's Con∣tradiction.) now, Let all the Honest-hearted see, if thy own Pen and Spirit doth not give thy self the Lye? And as for thy slandering Tongue in saying, That G. F. bewitched many at Providence with his Sorceries: —Ro∣ger, as for Witchery and Sorcery thou may'st keep it at home, it's thy own spirit. For G. F. did turn many to the Lord Jesus Christ (both at Providence and Newport) and to Hear him, with whom God is well-pleased: and they might know Christ to be their Shep∣herd to Feed them, and their Bishop to Over-see them, and their Prophet (that God hath raised up like unto Moses, whom they were to hear) who would open to them the things of his King∣dom: and to know Christ Jesus their Councellour, and Leader and
Priest made higher than the Heavens; who had offered up himself for them, and would present them to God without Spot or Wrinkle (Hebr. 7.) And these 14 Propositions are from thy Vain Thoughts. R. W. Again thou say'st; I drew up my Thoughts into fourteen Propositions. Answ. And indeed, thy Fourteen Propositions are but so many Fictions from thy Evil Thoughts, and not from the Spirit of God, nor Christ; but by the Spirit of Christ they are favoured and judged by all the True Christians, that fear God and honour the Lord Jesus Christ in his own Light and Spirit. R. W. Thou complainest, That One called thee Blind Sot; and that thou durst not send thy 14. Proposals to G. F. pag. 4.Answ. So he might well enough, for R. W. never Sen them to G. F: and what is this to G. F? And thou say'st, J. T. took a Copy of them (to wit, thy Papers) and read them in their Meeting: Still what is that to G F, who saw them not, nor heard of them? R. W. And thou say'st; In the Juncto of the Foxians [a Scof∣fer and a Mocker] at Newport it was concluded for Infallible Rea∣sons, that his Holiness G. F. should withdraw, seeing there was such a Knot of Apostles of Christ Jesus now at Newport together, &c. and it was agreed, that my Letters should not be delivered to the Deputy-Governour, till G. Fox was gone. Answ. These be all horrid Lyes, the Lord God knows, as W. Edmundson and John Burnyeat, and the Rest that where there, know, that there was no such Agreement. Therefore thou stuffest thy Book full of Lyes to feed others withal, and abusest both the Press and the Minds of people with Lyes. —And as for thy scoffing Words of His Holiness, I shall leave them to the Sober Christian to judge of this scoffing Spirit. R. W. And thou say'st, That one said, that G. F. was the Eter∣nal Son of God. Answ. But who that One is, thou dost not name. As for the peo∣ple of God, they are the Sons of God (as Job. 1, 6): and Job. 38, 7, All the Sons of God shouted for Joy. And, As many as re∣ceive Christ, he giveth them power to become the Sons of God, even to them, that believe in his Name (Rom. 8▪ 14:) They that are led by the Spirit, are the Sons of God (vers. 19.) And (Phil. 2, 15) That ye may be blameless and harmless, the Sons of God,
without Rebuke, &c. and, Behold, what manner of Love hath the Father bestowed upon us, that we should be called the Sons of God (1 Joh. 3, 1, 2.) R. W. Next thou tellest the Reader, What a Great Conflict thou wast in, before thou camest to the publick, &c. Answ. I do believe thee, that the Judgements of God were up∣on thee, which thou wrestlest against: and thy Greatest Conflict is yet to come for thy false Birth of Lyes and Slanders, thou hast brought forth in this Travail. R. W. Thou further say'st: My Antient Neigbour J. T. being bit by such Inectious Teeth, fell upon me, as a Man would fall upon a Toad or a Serpent,pag. 5. &c. he was but newly bitten by them (to wit, the Quakers) and for fourty years pretended no small Love to God and me. He first gave fire upon me in this following Letter, &c. Answ. Let all the Sober Christians read and see, what an Vn∣savoury Spirit and Language this Old Man R. W. hath! Thou con∣fessest, He gave fire; which fired thy Combustible Stuff. And now this Old Man J. T. being lately turn'd to the Lord Jesus Christ, his Teacher and Saviour, his Way, Truth and Life, thou Roger, Scoffingly say'st, He is bitten with Infectious Teeth, and fell upon thee, as a man would fall upon a Toad or a Serpent. What a foul spirit is there in thee, and what Vngracious Words flow from it! but we cannot expect any other from such a Corrupt Tree. R. W. (In his Answer to J. T's Letter) saith, My Antient Lov∣ing Friend (J. T.) pag. 6, and pag. 9, Your Old Vnworthy Friend R. W. And then J. T.'s Letter to R. W. again;pag. 6 and then R. W's to J. T. again: & (pag. 15) R. W. calleth J. T. (his Antient loving Friend) White Devil, and saith in these Words: But it is not the Light of Truth or Reason, or Scripture, or Experience, or the Testimony of the Prudent, that will satisfie this White Devil of this pretended Light and Spirit within, &c. Answ, Now Roger (who pretendeth much of God, Christ and Scripture-Language) calleth his Neighbour J. T. (his Loving Anti∣ent Friend) a White Devil: but where did ever any of the Pro∣phets or Apostles call any of their Antient Friends a White De∣vil? but all may see, such kind of Rusty, Cankered Language▪ (as this his Book is stufft up withal) which is uttered, procedeth from his Ill Fountain, (as Jam. 3.) I do not believe, that J. T. only pretendeth to a Light and Spirit within, or any of the people
of God called Quakers; but really have received the Light and Spirit of Christ: but thou and they, that have not the Spirit of Christ, are none of his (as the Apostle saith, Rom. 8.) And what are all thy Notions of Experience good for, when thou scoffest at the Light of Christ and the Spirit within, and callest Light Dark∣ness, and Darkness Light, as thy Forefathers, the Antient Apostate-Jews did, that had lost their sense, and became blind and hard∣ned. R. W. Again thou say'st: Can Reason imagine, that after much strugling within my self, and the Birth of my Propositions and Resolutions I can so suddenly strike sail and bear up,pag. 7.8. and Immediately stifle and smother, and burn my Conceptions? &c. Answ. Thou had'st better to have Burnt it, and stif'd it and smother'd it, then to have brought forth such a false Birth or Brat of thy own Conceptions: for it will be no honour to them, that be of thy Spirit, being Lyes and Ignorance are the Ground there∣of. R. W. And thou say'st; Knowing, The Quakers Spirit is a ready Ditch and Gulf, that readily sucketh and draweth into it Souls, &c. (pag. 6). Answ. Roger, This is thy own Condition, as thou writest to J. T. and thou knowest it not; but art wilful desperate and blind. R. W. Thou say'st, Thou hoped'st, that thou had'st Con∣jured down (at least for the present) that waspish Spirit [of J. T. thy Antient,pag. 9 Loving Neighbour, whom thou cal∣lest a White Devil.] Answ. But it seemeth, that thy spirit deceived thee. Thou must not think with thy foul spirit (from whence cometh thy E∣vil Language) to Conjure God's Spirit, or to Limit it; but be sure, that God will Limit thee, when he pleadeth with thee for all thy Lyes and Slanders: therefore Repent.—And well might J. T. say to R. W. How Childish, yea how Foolish dost thou shew thy self in thy First Proposition [and he might have said, In the Rest] what G. F. and all his Friends disown; Yea, and abhor all R. W's Lyes and Slanders, though he may boast of his Experiences and Education: but he hath manifested, what spirit it is. — And as for all R. W's Railing words to J. T. and his Comparing W. Harris with the Quakers, J. T. and the rest of the Sober
Christians in the Colony of Rod-Island know R. Williams and him, and can best answer him: for it's like, in his last Letter he doth belie J. T. and W. H. as he hath done us. R. W. But in his `22. page there is something to be noted:pag. 22. R. W. saith, I have been acquainted with Death, and have familiarly discours'd with the Grave and Pit of Rottenness, &c. Answ. I do believe thee, that thou art more Acquainted with this Pit of Rottenness and Death, and the Power of Death, and hast Discourst more with them, than with God and Christ, and more acquainted with them, than with the Quakers Princi∣ples. R. W. And whereas thou conceivest and flatterest thy self, Wai∣ting for a Wind to transport thee into Abraham's Bosom. Answ. Oh Roger! this Prince of thy Airy, Windy Doctrine of Lies (except thou repent) will transport thee into Misery, as he hath now into Folly. R. W. And whereas thou say'st: I pray you to know, that I be∣lieve, there is a Black Familiar, that haunts the Quakers; it may be, he whispers to you, that within fourty days ye shall be rid of me, except I repent: he may see into the Crazy temper of my house, &c. Or God may suffer him by some Immediate Revelation to em∣ploy some malicious Soul to Murder me, that this foul Liar and Murderer may extol and predicate himself in print, &c. that he was a True Prophet, applauding and triumphing against a Blasphemer of your Goddess, &c. Answ. What hard, wicked and malicious thoughts (which all come from this foul spirit) hath R. W. of J. T. which he calleth his Antient, Loving Friend and Neighbour! And now by this all the Sincere and Vpright-hearted, that fear God, may see, whether this be a fit spirit in R. W. to take the Holy God, and his Holy Son, and the Holy Law into his Mouth? though I believe, J. T. or any of the people of God would lay their Necks under his feet for his Eternal good. And as for his Black-Familiar spirit, that he believeth, haunts the Quakers, the Quakers are delivered from it by Jesus Christ their Saviour, who through Death destroyed Death, yea the Devil, the Power of death, &c. Glory to his Name for∣ever. But R. W. hath manifested this Black-Familiar Spirit, that he is possest withal, as his Father Cain was, or else he would not have such wicked Thoughts in him [That God should suffer
J. T. to set some to Murder him under a pretence of Immediate Re∣velation;] and then go and print such things, and Father them upon God: we do abhor his foul, blasphemous, lying Spirit and his Practice, the pure God of Heaven knows, and his Son, who hath taught us, He came to save mens lives, and not to destroy them; and we are known in the Hearts and Consciences of people, that we are not of that spirit and mind, which R. W. maliciously rendereth us of.— And as for his scoffing words, God's and Goddesses (as he calleth God, Christ and his Light) he may keep those words to himself: for our Trust is in the Lord God, the Creatour of all, and our Faith is in his Son Jesus Christ, by whom all things were Created; who was prophesied of by the Prophets, who came according to the Prophecies, and Suffered, and Rose again, and is at the Right Hand of God. And our Glorying is in the Lord alone (1 Cor. 1, 31.) and we have Confidence in the Lord, and the Lord is our Helper, (Heb. 13, 6;) and we have tasted, that the Lord is Gracious. And we know, that the Lord is the Avenger of all such as do Evil: and God hath not called us unto Uncleanness, but unto Holiness, praised be the Lord for ever! And we are taught of God and Christ, To love enemies, and to love one another, as may be seen by the Apostle's words (1 Thes. 4.) Oh! that ever such a foul spirit should take the Holy God and his Holy Son, and his Holy Prophets and his Holy Apostles words into it's mouth! And thou might'st better have applied this following Scripture: But to the Wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare my Sta∣tutes, or that thou should'st take my Covenant into thy mouth, see∣ing thou hatest Instruction, &c? Thou givest thy mouth to Evil, and thy tongue frameth Deceit; and thou sittest and speakest against thy (Neigh∣bour, or against thy) Brother, &c. These things hast thou done, and I kept silent; thou thoughtest, I was altogether such an one, as thy self: but I will reprove thee, and set in order before thine Eyes. Now Consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you to pieces, and there be none to deliver, (Psal. 50.) Thou art one of them, that Whettest thy Tongue, and Bendest thy Bow to shoot thy Arrows of bitter words; but God will shoot at thee (as thou may'st see Psal. 64) if thou repentest not. R. W. And thou often scoffingly and boastingly say'st, That G. F. shunn'd the Dispute, and pluck'd-in his Horns (as pag. 22. and in other places:) and (pag. 7) thou say'st, Thou wilt not Answer, as G. F. answered H. Wright's Paper, with a scornful and shameful Silence.
Answ. Better be Silent, than tell Lies, Roger; (but thou art found to be a Liar in the thing, as may be seen in the End of the book:) but these are all but Boasts from thy Conceited Mind; why did'st thou not print the paper, that it might have been seen? And as for all thy Childish Boast of G. F.'s Going away from the Dispute, and leaving his Chaplains, (as thou scoffingly callest them) thou shouldst have sent thy papers to G. F. or have written to him, when he was at Providence, or at New-port, or have spo∣ken with him, that thou had'st such a thing in hand; and then if he had departed before the Dispute, thou would'st have had some Ground to have boasted against him, and not to forge Lies, and print them to the world to defile their minds. And to send thy papers to the Deputy-Governour, and never send them to G. F. this was done rather, that thou might'st boast, when G. F. was gone: but this is thy Mystery of Iniquity, and that false Birth, thou wast striving to bring forth; which now thou hast published to the world to defile their minds. R. W. And thou say'st (after thou hast rambl'd in the 23. and 24. pages) Thou had'st a Strange Assurance given in∣to thy spirit from God in Answer to thy poor Requests,pag. 23. p. 24. p. 25. &c. that by Moderation and Patience thou should'st conquer the Immoderate and Impatient, &c. [Here Roger, thou praisest thy self:] but (pag. 25) thou fall'st a Rai∣ling against W. Edmundso, and say'st, That he was very Ignorant of Scriptures or other Learning, &c. and fit to make a Braggadocia, &c. and he would often vapour, and preach long. And when thou had'st patiently waited, till the Gust was over, and beganst to speak, he would stop thy Mouth, &c. Answ. Here again thou praisest thy self, and scoffingly condemnest W. Edm. And is this the Scripture-Language, to call him a Brag∣gadocia? who is a Known Man of Integrity to the Lord? and an Able Man in the Scripture? and a Minister of Christ? whom thou falsly chargest to be Very Ignorant of the Scripture, and fit to make a Braggadocia? who could not endure to hear thee cast thy Lies and Slanders upon the people of God without Rebuking thee? And often thou mentionest the Most-High, and takest the Name of God in thy Mouth, and would'st make people believe, that thou had'st an Answer from God in this Work: but we know, what God it was, that put thee on, and brought forth this Birth in thee; for it was the way of all the Enemies of God to use the Name of
God against the Prophets, and against Christ and his Apostles, as thou dost against us. And so the Lord and his people knoweth thy false Conception, that thou hast brought forth; and it will be for the Establishing of the Elect, and for the Confirming of them that serve and fear the living God, and to the Confounding thy self. R. W. And thou say'st: My End was the Vindicating of his Most-holy Name, which my Soul saw, was trodden in the Dirt by Satan clothed with Samuel's Mantle, &c. And, I had in mine Eye the Vindicating this Coy for receiving such persons, whom others would not;pag. 26. we suffer for their sakes, and are ac∣counted their Abettors, &c. and that thou might'st give a publick Testimony against their Opinions, &c. Answ. Here all may see, what is in this Man's spirit, that he must give a publick Testimony against such, as the Colony received (to wit, the people of God called Quakers) and how that you suffered for their sakes, and were accounted the people of God called Quakers, their Abettors. And is it not here clear, that thou would'st have them off the Island, & out of the Colony, and not let them have their Liberty in it? and to set the Magistrates against them, and not to be Received, as they do not Receive them in Other places? and yet the King lets them have their Liberty as well as thee? And thus thou hast brought forth the Birth of the Flesh, that persecuteth them that are born of the Spirit; and art short of the Royal Law, To DO VNTO ANOTHER, AS THOV WOVLD'ST HAVE THEM DO VNTO THEE. R. W. And thou, who would'st bear a Publick Testimony against our Opinions, &c. (as thou call'st it) in such a Way and Exercise, as thou Judged'st it incumbent upon thy Spirit and Conscience to do it (in some regards) more than most in the Colony. I may also truly say, that, &c. Answ. Here R. W. Boasteth and Setteth up himself, I do be∣lieve, More than any of the Colony with his false Conception: for why should not the people of God called Quakers have as much Liberty in the Colony, as Roger Williams, seeing both God, and the King and the people own them in the Government, and al∣low of them? And why cannot this Man be quiet with his own Liberty in his own Opinions and Imaginations, but he must grudge at others? but the Governors have not grudged at him for his; but he may preach as long as he will, if people will go to hear him: but I think, he is an Old Doting Man, and few mind him;
for I did not hear, that he preached to any, when I was at Pro∣vidence. And he may think, by publishing this Book of Lies to get some Followers: It's like, he may get such, as are given up to believe Lies, but none, that fear God and follow Christ Jesus. And for thy saying; Thou vindicatest his Most-holy Name, which thou saw, was trodden under foot in the dirt by Satan, &c. And if it be the Name of the Most-High God thou meanest, or the Name of Christ Jesus (in whose Name his people hath Salvation, and not by any other Name under Heaven. as Act: 4, 12.6.17, 18,) this Name neither thou, nor Satan can never Tread into the Dirt; though thou art forbidden To take the Lord's Name in vain, (as Pro. 30, 9: Exo: 20, 7.) And how dost thou prove by Scripture, That the Name of the Most-high can be trodden in the Dirt? thou say'st, thy Soul Saw it; give not thy Soul the Lie. And thou say'st, It was thy End, to Vindicate his Most-holy Name: Nay, Roger, never with Belying and Slandering of his peo∣ple; but in this thou takest the Name of the Lord in vain. For Isaiah saith; Behold, the Name of the Lord cometh from far burn∣ing with his Anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his Lips are full of Indignation, and his Tongue as a Devouring Fire, (Isa: 30, 27:) and therefore do not thou Blaspheme the Name of the Lord (Levit 24, 11.) And (Prov: 18, 10.) The Name of the Lord is a Strong Tower, the Righteous runneth into it, and is safe: and thou say'st? The Name of the Most-high thou sawest trodden in the Dirt by Satan; Now, Can Satan tread this Strong Tower into the Dirt? and we know, the False Prophets (like thee) often mentioned the Name of the Lord (in the days of Jeremiah and other Prophets) with a Lying spirit, (as thou may'st read Jerem. 23, and see thy Condition, and how they used their Tongues.) And Micha saith (Chap. 5, 4) He shall stand and feed in the strength of the Lord, in the Majesty of the Name of his God, &c. so here is a Majesty in the Name of the Lord, which is far above Thee and thy Dirt and Satan, and Blind Eyes. And David saith, They that know thy Name, will put their Trust in thee; for thou art Lord (Psal. 9, 10:) and, O Lord, how Excellent is thy Name in all the Earth! (Psal. 8.) And David saith, Thy Name▪ O Lord, endureth for ever, and thy Memorial, O Lord, throughout all Generations▪ (Psal. 135, 13:) can this be Trodden under foot according to R. W's false Doctrine? I am a Great King, saith the Lord of Hosts, and my Name is Dreadful among the Heathen, Mal: 1, 14: and
Isa: 63, 16, Thy Name is from Everlasting: and, Thy Name i as Ointment poured forth, Cant. 6, 26. And in the Name of Christ the Apostles Cast out Devils, and healed the Sick, &c. and if R. W. meaneth Christ's Name Trodden in the Dirt by Satan, His Name is called the Word of God; and the Word of God, (that liveth and endureth for ever) cannot be Trod∣den under foot neither by him, nor his God-Satan (Revel: 17, 13). R. W. Thou say'st; I had many Thoughts of beginning such an Exercise with prayer unto God for his Presence, &c. and thou say'st a little before in the same page, (when thou hast made a speech of Nicholas Davis being drowned, &c.) Some of these Blessed Ends it hath pleased God to propagate by this Occasion all this Colony over; and all of us round about have put forth our selves in Disquisitions and Searchings after the true Grounds of Christian Religion and Worship. Answ. If this was the Cause of your Searching after the true Grounds of Christian Religion and Worship, what hast thou been doing all this while Roger? how could'st thou go to Dispute of such things, and hadst them to Search for? which we do believe thee, thou hadst them Then, and hast them Yet to seek▪ and canst not find them with this Dark, Envious Spirit, and thy Thoughts, which thou Thought to Begin with Exercise of Prayer; &c. but thou knew'st, very well, that the people of God called Quakers, could not receive thy Prayers from thy Many Thoughts; they were not like from a Lying, Slandering Spirit. R. W. Thou say'st, Thou hast Cause▪ to Judge, that the Word QVAKER was given to us from that strange Possessing of our Bodies of Quaking and Shaking.pag. 27. Answ. Gervase Bennet, Justice of Darby gave us that Name, because I and we bid him and his Company, Tremble at the Word of God, (in 1650, when he cast G. F. and others in prison.) R. W. Further he saith, It is true, that they are (to wit the Quakers,) the Off-spring of the Grindletonians in Lancashire. Answ. This is also false; the Grindletonians and the people in Lancashire know it. pag. 28.R. W. And R. W. saith, The Ranters are but the Quakers Daughter. And pag. 29. thou say'st, That some Parliament-Men
told thee, that they themselves went to one of the Quakers Meetings about Charing Cross; but they were so frighted with the Shaking of their Bodies, of the Chairs and Stools, &c. and callest it, Satan's Counterfeit Motions. Answ. These are Two Horrid Lies: for all the Ranters and peo∣ple up and down England know, this Charge of thine is false; and is like the rest of the Lies of thy Book. For many of the Ran∣ters are come to be Sober in the Fear of God, and are turn'd to the people called Quakers; but not the Ranters come from the Quakers, neither Are they their Daughter: this hath been the spirit of the Devil, that moved thee, and not the Most-High. And thy Book, that is so suft up with Lies, it will do little hurt, where we are known here in England. — (The 2d. Lie:) And the Quakers never had any Meeting about Charing-Cross: this is another Forgery, that thou hast published; the people, that liveth about Charing-Cross, will testifie against thee. R. W. And thou bringest John Toldervy and Theora John, and thou say'st, The horrible Shaking of the Quakers,—We are tos∣sed and tumbled up and down, &c. (pag. 29.) Answ. As for Th. John, all people that knew him, know, he was no Quaker: and John Toldervy the priest did give forth a Book in his Name, wherein they much abused him, as thou dost now; but J. Told. hath cleared himself in his own Book, which is an Answer to the Priest, that abused him, called, The Foot out of the Snare. And doth R. W. think, to feed the Sober Christians in Eng∣land with such Lying Stories, as these? Nay, they may serve his New-England persecuting Priests. —And R. W. Thou often men∣tionest the Father of Spirits, and the Most-high, who stir'd thee up to this Work: but thy foul Mouth is not worthy to menti∣on the Name of the Lord. R. W. The People called Quakers are not True Quakers according to Scripture. Answ. The Lord God of Heaven and Earth knoweth, that thou speakest falsly of us here. And thou hast made a great Noise, but provest nothing; but hast brought several Lies to prove thy own (as thou may'st see pag. 27.29).—For the same Word of God and Power, by which all things were made, have we known the O∣peration in our hearts of it, and Tremble at it; which thou hast not konwn: for if thou hadst, thou would'st not have brought this false Charge out against us.
R. W. Thou say'st, The Tumultuous Spirit of the Quakers  Disputing; — and the Reason is, That Three of the Speakers consul∣ted openly, and whispered and uttered themselves, one immediately speaking after the other, and sometimes all together, as one man against me, (pag. 26.). Answ. The Auditory knoweth, whether thou speakest Truth in this: and what! must not Whisper one to another before R. W? R. W. Thou say'st, Thou wast first commanded this Work from Heaven, (pag. 25.) Answ. We desire all, that read thy Book, to mind thy Ma∣ny False Charges, and thy Vnsavoury Expressions; and then they may Judge, whether Thy Command came from Heaven or from Hell: for No Lie is of the Truth, nor cometh not from the God of Truth; but from the Father of Lies. —The First Part of thy Work thou undertook was, To prove us No True Quakers according to the holy Scriptures: Which thou did'st not then in the Dispute, (as I am satisfied, the Generality of the Hearers can bear Witness,) neither hast thou yet done it in all thy Writing by the Scripture, nor yet by any Sound Argument; but goest on to Charge and Accuse us, as if One of thy Accusation must prove Another, (unless this way can prove it:) so No Proof. R. W. And with this thou beginnest in pag. 28. and say'st, Thou wast the more confirmed, when thou sawest our foul spirit to transport us not only in Lying Doctrines, but also in Lying Quakings and Trem∣blings, and Lying Preachings through the Streets, Repent, Repent, &c. Answ. Now let all Observe, what he calleth Our Lying Preach∣ings? as if to preach Repentance by the Command and Power of God now were a Lying Preaching; which is one of the things, that Christ sent His forth to preach: and let the Wise consider, whether our Days and Generations do not need this Preaching, Yea of Nay?—And this is still a false Charge, to say, He saw our soul spirit to transport us into Lying Doctrines; But hath not yet made out these Doctrines: and again, With Lying Quakings and Tremblings; but hath not proved it: so, it's but still his False Charge.—And further, as thou did'st then in the Dis∣pute, so now, thou makest a great a do with our Men and Women going Naked: We told thee then, we own'd no such Practice in any, unless they were called unto it by the Lord, as a Sign of the Nakedness of the Professors of Our Age, who want the Co∣vering of the Spirit. And though thou would'st exclude Signs,
Christ being come; was not Agabus a Sign to Paul, when he took his Girdle, and bound himself with it? R. W. And thou further Chargest us, That Rantism is our Ug∣ly Child and Daughter, and rose from our Bowels: and with the Practice of the Ranters in the Streets, and in their Religious Meet∣ings. Answ. Now let all consider, whether this be a proper Way, to prove us No true Quakers, to charge that upon us to be Our Child, and to proceed from us, which was, before any bore the Name of Quakers in England? as many people know: and there∣fore not like to proceed from us. R. W. Thou grantest, That David, Moses, Daniel, Habakkuk and Paul Trembled; and the Corinthians received Titus with Trem∣bling; and, Working out Salvation with Fear and Trembling: and so grantest Trembling upon the Bodies of God's people (as thou say'st) in some Extra-ordinary Occasion (especially, in bringing Great or Old Sinners unto God, pag. 30.) but R. W. thou say'st, The Quak∣ing and Shaking Motions of the Quakers thou wilt prove, proceeded not from these holy Affections proper to God's Children. Answ. In the First place we would have all observe this, whe∣ther the People of God called Quakers, had not this Occasion (which he speaketh of) when God did visit them, being found Sinners, and some Great and Old Sinners? therefore the Occasion he granteth Trembling and Quaking proper upon, the people cal∣led Quakers might well meet with in their Conversion and Turn∣ing to God: as also afterwards in their Going forth to preach the Gospel; as it was with Paul, when he came among the Corinthians, who was among them in Weakness and Fear, and much Trembling, (1 Cor. 2, 3.) (R. W.) In the Next place, let all, who read his Book, ob∣serve, how he proveth his Charge: He saith; They proceeded not from those holy Affections proper to God's Children (but why?pag. 29.) They were Horrid and Monstrous Motions and Gestures. Answ. What would he have said of David's Roaring, and Crying and Trembling? and Habakkuk's Shaking? and of the Holy Men, who rent their Cloths? and many such things. Here we have his own Judgement; but how doth he prove it? he saith, By Abun∣dance of Notorious Instances: and so bringeth the Motions, Shak∣ings, Extasies, the Workings of Satan upon his Servants as Baal's
Priests and the people Possessed mentioned in Scripture and other Histories, and the Barbarians) to prove it. Now let all consider, what Proof this is, to prove us to be No True Quakers? what have we to do, with what the Devil doth upon his Servants, unless he can prove us to be of them? What is that to us, what Baal's priests did? or what the Barbarians do? must we answer for their Wickedness? or doth this make us Guilty? the same he may al∣ledge against the Holy Men of God. (R. W.) He further telleth us, The Devil will be God's Ape,pag. 30. and suborneth and instituteth a Bastard-Quaking and Trembling in the Body in Imitation of David and Moses, &c. Answ. Here he still granteth, There is a True Trembling: but this doth not prove ours False; though the Devil may beget a false Imitation, and be an Ape, as he saith. (R. W.) Another Argument he bringeth, to prove us No True Christian-Quakers,pag. 31 Because we did not Tremble at the Word of God in the Holy Writings or Scripture: and blameth G. F. for Not Calling them the Word of God, but for Accounting Christ the Word, according to Revel. 20. But he con∣fesseth, that G. F. granteth, the Scripture is True, and Inspired from the holy Spirit of God, and to be God's Words. (Answ.) Observe, He speaketh of Trembling at the Word in the Writings or Scriptures: what Scripture hath he for this? We know, that the Scripture saith, The Word is nigh, in the Heart and Mouth, that Word, which the Apostle preach'd (Rom. 10, 8;) but we do not read of the Word of God in the Writings. (R. W.) Pag. 32.33. he goeth on still Accusing us and the Papists,p. 32.33. and putteth us together for Slight∣ing the Scriptures. And telleth us of a Papist in Ire∣land in the time of the Massacree, who found a Bible; and with In∣dignation (the same, he saith, he believeth, is in most Papists and Quakers) ung it into the Kennel, stamp'd upon  and said; A plague of God take this Book! this hath caused all the Quarrels a∣mongst us. (Answ.) Now Observe, how he goeth on to prove his Charge against us, by Charging us (from his own Groundless Belief) with This Indignation, that he saith, was in this Irish Papist against the Bible: and so goeth about the condemn us for the Actions of o∣thers, that we never knew. And yet (in the same page and in
many other places) he confesseth, That we owned the Scripture, and saith: The Sum of all was (in the Dispute,) that we Owned the Scripture; but yet the Spirit, that gave it forth, was above it. Let wise men, that know us, Judge, whether this way of His Dealing with us to prove his Charge, be Christian-like or no, for him To Charge upon us the Actions of others, not of us? —And whereas he Endeavoureth, to prove the Scriptures to be the Word of God (though he granteth, they are not in so many Terms and Words mentioned:) That we forbear to speak to now; being fully Answered in the Answer to his Appendix, where the Single-hearted Reader may be satisfied. (R. W). He giveth an Account, how he came to give his Book such a Title;pag. 34 which came from a Guess of his own, and a Conceit and Thought, that Sprung from this Guess, as he saith. And then, when he hath done, taketh Bold∣ness, to Father it upon the Finger of God, and his Over-ruling Hand: and then in that Conceit to Judge G. F. and Ed. Burrough to Conspire against Christ with dark, subtle, Hellish Conjurings and Imaginations. (Answ.) Still let all observe, upon what Ground we are Char∣ged and Judged? and so he goeth on in his Boasting. (R. W.) He quoteth G. F. Answering J. Stallum, (G. F.'s fol. 155.) who said [To say,p. 35. The Light in every Man gave forth Scripture, and will open Scripture to us, is pal∣pable Darkness, and contradicteth Scripture.] G. F. Ans. [All be in Vtter Darkness, and know not the Scripture, until they come to the Light, that Every man was in, that gave forth the Scrip∣tures: for the Light letteth them see, to what it was spoken; and Christ the End of them.] R. W. Answereth and saith: The English of the Answer is, that Every man, that is, All Mankind, Men and Women if they will, can give forth Scripture, or write Holy Scripture. (Answ.) Now let all that are Wise, judge, whether this be not a Gross Perversion of G. F's words, to say, That all Men and Women can give forth or write holy Scriptures, if they will: but G. F. doth not say, The Scripture was given forth by the Will of Man. And so all may see, how he still goeth on Perverting and Accusing falsly, as if G. F. had said, Holy Scripture had or might be given forth by the Will of Man; which he saith, is not known, till Man come to the Light.—And as to his Vnlearned Questi∣on, whether the Light cometh into Man-kind at the Conception, or
at the Birth, or when else? we leave him to what is written, Joh. 1, 9. Christ is the True Light, that lighteth every Man, that cometh into the World. So, it's Evident, ALL ARE LIGH∣TED, that come into the World: and the Believers witnessed it to Shine in their Hearts. And Abraham saw his Light or Day; and in it David saw more Light, which was before Christ came in the Flesh. John saith, In the Word, which was in the Beginning, was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men. This in Answer, to what followeth in the same page. (R. W.) He again Compareth us with the Papists, Common Protestants,p. 38.39. Jews, Mahometans and Pagans; and beginneth again to upbraid us with our Men and Women's going Naked, as if it were a thing Ordinarily or Commonly allowed amongst us in their Wills, without the Motion of God: and would bring this as his Main Proof, to prove us No True Quakers. (Answ.) I have already answered to this: and in his own Book it may be seen, how that we own no such Practice, un∣less the Lord upon an Occasion should call for it as a Sign, (as before said) as may be read in our Answers to him, quoted by himself (pag. 39.) But this Way is, to Charge and Accuse us with all his Might; as if that were the Way to prove his Charge a∣gainst us.—And he telleth of Our being on High in our Desk (pag. 37) when (as the people there at Rode-Island, that was at the Dispute, know, that) it was but upon a Common Seat, as was at the other End, where he sat, and on both Sides. (R. W.) He also chargeth us with Exalting Cursed Nature. (Answ.) Now, I desire the Serious Reader to weigh well, when thou readest his Book, whether by all, that he hath said, he hath Proved his Charge? or whether in stead of Proving this One, he hath not Charged many more, and left both it and them Vnproved? and so gone off, as a false Accuser. And as for Exalting Cursed Nature, R. W. with the New-England Priests had better to have kept it at home. Now further observe: that in the Conclusion of the First Day we having a Discourse upon the Commands of God upon the afore∣said. Occasion, as, Of Abraham's Offering his Son, R. W. said; They could Discern and See in those Days, That Abraham's Command To kill his Child,pag. 40 was the Command of God: which we cannot now in these Days do. We asked, what
they Discerned by? was it not the Spirit of Revelation, that they Tried and Discerned by? He confest, It was: but said, We have it not so Now, nor is it to be Expected. Then we desired, seeing the same Spirit was not to be Expected, with what did he Try our Spirits? and how did he know, Ours not to be the same, as theirs was, seeing, he had so Charged and Condemned us? he said again; They had that Way of Discerning of Spirits, which none hath now. But as he saith in his Book, We must attend to the Scripture Only; and to use the Weapon, It's Written, It's Written, against Satans Immediate Inspirations and Temptations;p. 41. and this he calleth Christ's Weapons, by which he resisted the Devil: and so biddeth us, Follow his Example, and to use the Weapon of It's Written, It's Written. If this be All, or the Only Weapon, It's Written, the Devil, when he cometh to tempt, may Vse the same: for he did use it to Christ, as Matth. 4, 6. he said, It's Written, he hath given his Angels Charge over thee, &c. So all may see, R. W. is not for the Apostle's Weapons, his Hel∣met, his Shield, his Breast-plate, his Sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God, which he said, was Ngh in the Heart &c. A Question was put to him; Whether the Anointing, which the Apostle John directed the Saints unto, to Try the Spirits by, was not the same, that Abraham understood and knew the Mind of God by? But this Question he never would answer, although he promised, that he would Answer it the Next Day; yet though it was often urged, he still evaded, and would not answer: for if he had, and confessed) then he knew it must follow, That the Saint's being directed to the same, that was Abraham's Guide, Discoverer, and that by which he tried the True from the False, it could not be the Scripture, but that which was, before the Scripture was written, And yet, though he could not deny it, not would not grant it, the thing is True, Abraham saw his Day, whom the A∣postle saith, the Saints were in; and they that had him (to wit, the Son of God) had Life. And thou and the New-England Priests, that have not the same Discerning as Abraham had, are out of the Faith of Abraham, and so no Children of Abra∣ham, but of that Father, that Christ told the Jews they were of. The Second Day of the Dispute the Question afore-said was put again to him, and he was desired to answer, according as he promised
the Evening before, but would not, and so evaded: and made a great Narration, and began to tell us of Certain Bow-men, that bent their Tongues,p. 42. like Bows. So the Discourse upon this afore-said Matter he hath let fall in his Rela∣tion, as he hath done a great part of the Dispute; and instead thereof hath put in his own Guessings, Conceits, Imaginations and Inventions divised in Secret, when there was none to oppose him: and brought forth at last as a Monster to reproach, belie and slan∣der the Innocent. As all may see, that read his Book, how In∣vective and Bitter he is: and whether he is not one of that Ge∣neration, which Jeremiah speaketh of, That bend their Tongues, like Bows for Lies, I leave the Sober Reader to Judge, that doth read his Book. And so, take some few Observations of his Man∣ner and Way of Proving his Second Position, viz. That the CHRIST we profess,p. 43. is not the TRUE LORD Jesus CHRIST. R. W. He telleth us, We were not Christians, nor Pro∣fessors of the Christian Religion:p. 44. We might with Jews, Turks and Papists profess One God; yet Christians we could not be. And to prove it he saith, That the Description and Cha∣racter, which the Holy Scriptures give to the True Lord Jesus, no way agreeth with the Image, which we have set up. Answ. Which Image and Idol (as he calleth it) is Christ the Light, his Spiritual Appearance in Man: so that we find, he la∣boureth to set up Christ in his Appearing in that Body, which was prepared for him, (wherein he suffered without the Gates at Je∣rusalem) in Opposition to Christ Spiritually dwelling in his people. As if it could not be Consistant with his then Appearing in that Body, and taking that Flesh upon him, and becoming a Sacri∣fice therein for Sin, that he should afterwards Appear in his peo∣ple, and be in them the Hope of Glory: and be their Life; and they to become his House or Temple, and he to dwell in them: and to be their Head, and they to be his Body, and Members in particular, and of his Flesh, and of his Bone: and they to Eat his Flesh, and Drink his Blood, which he said, All must do, or they had No Life in them: and he to be formed in them, and he to Sup with them, and they with him: which is all according to the Scripture, (as you may read Rev. 3, 20. Gal. 4, 19. Ephes. 5, 30. Read John 6. Rom. 12, 5. Col. 1, 18.24, 27. Ephes. 1, 22, 23. 1 Joh. 5, 12. 1 Cor. 12, 27. Col. 3, 3, 4. 1 Cor. 6, 19. Hebr.
3, 6.)—Now who readeth these Scriptures, may see, that the Apostles and Primitive Christians did witness Christ within, and the Light within, even that Light, which gave the Knowledge of the Glory of God (as may be read 2 Cor. 4, 6.) And now this Appea∣rance of Christ R. W. fighteth against (Reprobate-like) as if those, that own him Now in this his Spiritual Appearing, and are Wit∣nesses thereof, must needs own him in Opposition to his Ap∣pearing in that Body, wherein he suffered. And so doth Labour, to make us Deniers of Christ, that suffer'd at Jerusalem, and was born at Bethlehem; though he often confesseth, We own him in our words: and our True Christianity hath manifested it self against that Antichristian Spirit, that you are in in New-England.—But he (R. W.) though he saith, He hath not the same Spirit, that Abraham had, and the Holy men of God, by which things were re∣vealed to them, yet he hath taken upon him to Judge our Hearts and Intents contrary to our Words; and there-upon doth condemn us through his Book: and this way he goeth To prove his Charges, and hath Confidence to say, He hath produced such Grounds, as shall never be shaken, (as pag 41.) (R. W.) Now, let all observe, how R. W. appeareth against Christ's Appearance according to the Experience of the people of God in the Scripture, viz. Christ within [which he calleth, Our Christ] he saith, is but half a Christ, a Light, an Image, a Picture or a Fancy of a Christ,p. 45 made up to the God-head and their Flesh: Christ within, an Imagination, an Image, a Christ in the Mystical Notion, but in reality Nothing. (Answ.) He may as well say, The Christ the Apostle witnessed, was Made up of the God-head and their Flesh, for they are the Apostle's Words, he thus quarreleth against (Ephes. 5, 30:) for we are Members of his Body, of his Flesh and of his Bones. (R. W.) In the same page he Confesseth, That we say, Christ was Born at Bethlehem, and died at Jerusalem: but he saith; We intend in Truth and Reality no other Birth, nor Life, nor Death, &c. but what may be extant and wrought in the Heart of man. (Answ.) Behold, how this man Judgeth of our Intents contra∣ry to our Words, and we say, contrary to our Intents! for we ne∣ver intended so. But we always believed, that he was SO born, and did SO suffer, as the Scripture doth declare; and by his Life or Spirit within us we are confirmed in this Belief: and so it is
not in Opposition to his Appearance at that Day in that Body. So we are not in a Bog and Swamp (as he saith) between Christ with∣in and Christ without; our Understanding is clear, it's his own State. (R. W.) He also chargeth us To preach the Lord Jesus to be Our selves,p. 46. and saith, Though we speak of Christ without, that died at Jerusalem, agreeing with Christ within. Our Meaning is Mystical: and he saith also, Ask them, What's become of the Person, that Suffered at Jerusalem? and we are forc'd to say, He is within: and saith, We answered so at Newport in Rode-Island. (Answ.) That we deny, that we ever said, That Person, that Suffered at Jerusalem, was within us: and appeal to the So∣ber people, that was there, whether he hath not wronged us in this Charge.—And That we preach the Lord Jesus to be Our selves, We deny; and lay it upon him, as a false Charge: let him prove it, if he can. (R. W.) He querieth, Do we not hold the Light within Eve∣ry man to Be all, to Suffer all within, that Christ without is, or did or suffer'd without. Answ. I say, No: it cometh FROM HIM, and witnesseth TO HIM. R. W. And (pag 43) thy Second Position is, That their Christ was not the True Lord Jesus Christ. To which we Answer: This thou hast not proved, though thou hast Uttered ma∣ny False Words against us: but this Position will be Thy own Condi∣tion, and the N. Engl. Priests. For doth the True Lord Jesus Christ give thee Command to Desire Magistrates to Punish the people of God? and doth the True Lord Jesus Christ lead you New-Eng∣land-Priests to CVT OFF their EARS, WHIP, HANG, SPOIL Goods and BANISH of his people? O No: for Thou and You, that do Evil, hate his Light, and will not come unto it, because it Reprov∣eth you. And so you love the Darkness, and do the Works of Darkness, and the Works of the Prince of the Air, that ruleth in you; and not the Works of Christ.—And again, how can you own the True Lord Jesus, and own not him the Light of the World, which Lighteth every man, that cometh into the World? and canst thou and you believe in the True Lord Jesus, who saith, Be∣lieve in the Light, that you may become Children of the Light, and
thou callest that Light  Frantick Light, and an Idol? And there∣fore thy Position is come upon thy self, Not to own the True Lord Jesus (in his Light, which giveth the knowledge of him) who died without the Gates of Jerusalem: and like the Jews in Words pro∣fessed God, so dost thou Christ, and deniest the Light, that giveth the knowledge of him. (2 Cor. 4.) R. W. Thou say'st (pag. 35.) I had observed and prepared many Quo∣tations out of G. F.'s Book, but they desired not to bear them read, as in the following Day's Conference they were read by my Con∣tinual Importunate Urgings.—And (pag. 47.) thou say'st, That they were willing, I should Produce out of G. F.'s Book, &c. And (pag. 48.) Thou say'st, The Truth is, they were Gravelled with those Considerations; and they were Willing, that G. F.'s Book and his Answers should answer for them. And when I began to open and compare the Assertions of the Opposite, and G. F.'s his An∣swer, they would cry out, like a Gall'd Horse winching; Why dost thou make Observations upon G. F.'s Words? G. F.'s Words need not thy Expositions: Let G. F.'s Words alone, they are able to speak for themselves. Answ. R. W. How darest thou affirm, That we desired not the Quotations read of G. F.'s Book, when all the people knoweth, that we Called for them so often? And (pag. 35.) thou makest it Thy Importunate Vrgings the Occasion of the Reading of them; but (pag. 48) thou makest Our Being Gravelled the Occasion of our Desiring to have them read of our selves: which is altoge∣ther false (and to say, That we were Gravell'd or Unwilling to have them read.) But our Calling for them was to Clear that, which thou said'st, was in them, which was not: and therein thou hast Gravell'd thy self, which spake that, which G.F. had not spok∣en; with Charging G. F. to say that in his Book, which was Evident to all the people there, was not in it, when we came to read it. And how darest thou say, Thou compared'st the Assertions of G. F.'s Opposites, and G. F.'s Answer, when thou wast making Observations and Expositions upon G. F.'s words, and giving Meanings of them, because they did not serve thy De∣sign? but what Observations and Expositions did he ever make of G. F.'s Opposites Words? And when thou wast reproved and told, That G. F.'s Words were Able to speak for themselves; thou scof∣fingly said'st, That we were like a Gall'd Horse winching, &c. but this is thy own Condition R. W. So the Reader may see thy
Folly and Contradiction; in one page laying it upon Thy Continual Importunate Vrging, and in another page upon Our being Gravel∣led, and Willing to have it answer for us. R. W. Thou say'st, G. F. picketh out some particular Lines, Say∣ings and Sentences, and out of the Book of his Opposites to his utmost Advantage,p. 47 &c. and for Instance bringest Samuel Eaton (from G. F.'s fol. pag. 3.) saying [The Saints have not Christ in the Flesh.] And G. F.'s his Answer, [Con∣trary to Christ's and the Apostle's Doctrine, who said, They were of his Flesh, and of his Bone; and they should eat his Flesh: and they that eat his Flesh, have it in them.] From whence R. W. Affirmeth, That Christ Jesus had such a Body, as might be Really and Materially in the Saints: and that it is Clear, that We are one with the Papists, &c. Answ. R. W. Is not this thy own Condition, of which thou accusest G. F. in Picking out here and there out of his Book, what thou thought'st, would make for thy Purpose and Advan∣tage? but did it not Make against thee in the Dispute to the Sight of the people, that was not prejudic'd? and cannot the Saints feed of Christs Flesh and Blood, and be of his Flesh and Bone, except they have the Whole Body of Christ Really and Ma∣terially in them? and for thy Affirming, That Christ had such a Body, as might Really and Materially be in the Saints, we deny: G. F. speaketh no such words; it is thy own. And the Quakers Feed upon Christ Jesus Spiritually; for Christ saith, His Words, that he spake, were Spirit and Life: but we know, the Papists feed upon Bread and Wine, which is not the Flesh and Blood of Christ; and so that's thy Envy, that leadeth thee to Join us with the Papists. R. W. And To feed upon Christ Spiritually, or Eat Christ Spi∣ritually, (thou say'st) wholly destroyeth his Material and Fleshly Being. Answ. R. W. This is thy Ignorance of Christ, who is at the Right Hand of God, and cannot be Destroyed, and dieth no more. And if To feed upon Christ Spiritually, is Wholly to destroy his Ma∣terial and Fleshly Being; then Thy Feeding upon Christ Fleshly, doth it not Destroy his Material and Fleshly Being? What must we Observe from this? Thy Feeding upon Christ Fleshly, and not Spiritually, doth not destroy his Material and Fleshly Being: and is that a Feeding upon Christ by Faith?
R. W. And R. W. Thou bringest (from G. F.'s fol. p. 4.) Sam. Eaton his Sayings; [The Saints do not see Christ, the Heavens contain him.] And G. F. Answ. [The Apostle saith, They Sate with Christ in Heavenly Places: So he is Contrary to the A∣postle. And Christ was in them, and walked in them, and God dwelt in them: and Christ in you, except you be Reprobates.] R. W. Replieth: I said, That as the Papists were up Ridiculously and Odiously with Hoc est Corpus Meum, This is my Body; so they with the Light within you, that Lighteth every man, Christ within you, except you be Reprobates. And therefore to Alledge Christ within, and their Sitting in Christ in heavenly pla∣ces, is but Irrational Nonsence and Jesuitical Equivoca∣tions.p. 48. And, The truth is, they were Gravell'd with these Considerations.— Answ. Let the Reader Judge, whether R. W. doth not call Christ's and the Apostle's Doctrine Irrational Nonsence and Jesuiti∣cal Equivocations, and the Papists Hoc est Corpus Meum, up Ridi∣culously, and termeth it Ridiculous and Odious with the Papists. For is not this the Apostle's Doctrine, Christ within you? did not the Apostles preach Christ within people, or the Light within peo∣ple, to give them the Knowledge? as may be seen Col. 2. and 2 Cor. 4. and Ephes. 2. how the Saints Sate in Heavenly Places in Christ Jesus? And we do grant, That the Heavens do contain the Man Christ: and thou dost confess, That we do believe, that he Died, Rose and Ascended; and then (thou say'st) in that Sense and Respect the Saints cannot now Sit Bodily with Christ in Heavenly Places. O Deceit! Is there any such word in G. F.'s Answer? If they Fed Spiritually, must they not Sit Spiritually? it's thou, that art Gravell'd, and in the Swamps and Bogs thou tell'st us of. R. W. Thou bringst John Bunion (from G. F.'s fol. p. 8.) saying,p. 49. [The Lord Jesus Christ is a far in his Bodily Presence.]G. F. Answ. [And yet he saith, The Lord is at hand. And the Apostle said, He was in them; and Christ said, He would dwell in them.] R. W. Thou say'st; G. F.'s Book was brought forth, the same with mine: and J. B. took it, and went along with me in the Quotations: and  read, and al∣wayes Endeavoured to make my Proof out of the Allegations. But W. Emmondson kept strict watch, and stood Centinel, that no Obser∣vations of Senses or Meanings should pass: and he was resolved, to keep out the Fire and Light of Christ Jesus. And so thou fall'st a railing and flattering thy self.
Answ. R. W. Why dost thou find fault with W. Edm. who Kept a strict Watch over thee, that thou should'st not Pervert, and Wrest and give Meanings to G. F.'s Words, which they did not intend, and otherwise, then they spake themselves? as thou confessest, he said, Let G. F.'s words alone, they are sufficient to speak for themselves. R. W. For thou bringst (Fol. p. 9.) John Bunyon Affirming, [That the Son of Mary, God man, is absent from his Church.] G. F. Answ. [Contrary to Christ's Words, I in them, and they in me, and I will be with you to the End: so that thou are one of the Blind Prophets: and contrary to John, who saith, We are in him (to wit, in the Son of God) that is True. And thou say'st, He (to wit, Christ) is Absent from his Church: the Apostle said, He was the Head of his Church, and dwelt in the Saints by Faith; but of Your Church we believe, He is not the Head, but will Grind you to Powder. [And Mark, what is become of you now, when you were up in Oliver's Days? are not G. F.'s words fulfilled? &c.] And thy words and thy Do∣ctrine are corrected by Christ and the Scriptures. And Christ saith, Where Two or Three are gathered in my Name, I will be in the midst of them: and the Saints are Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone (to wit, as the Apostle saith.] R. W. Replieth:p. 50. Here half an Eye may see, how he giveth no other Presence or Absence of Christ, but Invisible and Spi∣ritual: and subtily affirmeth, that Christ Jesus hath no Bodily Pre∣sence at all, &c. Answ. Let the Sober Reader Judge and see in G. F.'s Answer, how R. W. abuseth G. F.'s Words in his saying, G. F. Subtily affirmeth, That Christ hath no Bodily Presence at all; because he witnesseth his Spiritual Presence. R. W. He Bringeth J. Bunyon (from G. F.'s Fol. p. 10.) say∣ing: That [Christ was not in his Disciples, when he said, I am the Light of the World.] G. F. Answereth, [And so corrected by Christ, I in you, and you in me.] — And further he bringeth (from G. F.'s Fol. p. 12.) J. B's words [The Body of Christ is out of the Sight of all his Saints.] G. F. Answ. [And the Apostle saith, They sate in Christ in Heavenly Places: and the Saints are Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone, that were his Church, which he is the Head of his Body.] So far R. W. bringeth his Words; but these following he hath left out, and then calleth them Short Answers, to wit [Every one that Eateth his Flesh, know∣eth
his Body given for the Life of the World; and the Body of Christ is not out of the Sight of his Saints, that are the Church. Therefore you Ministers and Teachers, that say, Christ's Body is out of the Sight, are not Saints; neither are you His Church which is his Body: neither Eat you his Flesh; how can you Eat, it being out of your Sight? nor know that which is Given for the Life of the World. But you are Out of the Sight of his Church, which is his Body.] And was Christ and his Body out of the Sight of Stephen, when he was stoned to Death, when he saw Christ standing at the Right Hand of God? (Act. 7, 26, 27.) And was Christ and his Body out of the Sight of the Seven Churches, who walked in the midst of the Seven Golden Candlesticks▪ which were the Seven Churches? (Rev. 1.2.) Or was he out of the Sight of John, that writ the Revelations? and is he out of the Sight of them, that are the Holy City? (Revel. 2, 22.) — R. W. Replieth: In which, and all his Book over, though he own a Christ without, that died at Jerusalem in Word, yet he allows in Effect no other Body, but what is Mystical, &c. so that with Notorious Jugling and Jesuitical Impudence &c. they leave him in his Body no more Blood to shed, then is in a Spirit, &c. Answ. Here R. W. doth Confess, That G. F. owneth that Christ, that died at Jerusalem. And yet he Contradicteth himself, and saith, He alloweth to Christ no other Body, but what is Mystical and Spiritual: and yet himself saith, That Christ is the Head of his Church, as a Man's head is to his Body; and then, how can it be Out of his Sight? — But what must we understand by R. W.'s words? That Christ is in Heaven with a Carnal Body▪ doth not the Scripture speak of Spiritual Bodies? and must not the Saints be made like unto his Glorious Body? and is that Carnal? is it not Mystical to all the World? And the Apostle saith (speaking of the Resurrection) It is Sown a Natural Body, and riseth a Spiritual Body: and if the Saints must be raised a Spiritual Body; and Christ in Heaven with a Carnal Body, how doth this consist toge∣gether, R. W? There is a Natural Body, and there is a Spiritual Body: and who is it, that hath a Spiritual Body? is it the First Adam, or the Last? for The First Adam is of the Earth, Earthly, and the Second Man is the LORD FROM HEAVEN; and so hath not he a Heavenly Body? seeing, as the Saints have born the Image of the Earthly, so they must the Heavenly? And there∣fore, how is now Christ in Heaven with an Earthly, Carnal Body?
(as some priests have affirmed against us, which hath been the Reason of these Discourses) 1. Corinth. 15. But John in his Revel. telleth thee, That Christ walketh in the midst of his Churches: and John telleth thee, what Christ's Eyes and his Feet are like, (Revel, 2.) if thou hast an Ear to hear; and (Revel. 1, 12, 13, 14.) of his Head, and his Hair and his Countenance, which John fell down at: and do not thou say, That we deny the Body of Christ; who own it, as the Scripture declare it. And what must we Infer from R. W's words, that saith, We leave no more Blood in Christ's Body to be shed at all, then in a Spirit? what! must Christ come down from Heaven at the Right Hand of God, and shed his Blood a∣gain? how proveth R. W. this? prove this, we Charge R. W. and all New-England-priests, by Scripture. Now, the Saints Eating his Flesh and Drinking his Blood, and his Blood Sprinkling the Con∣sciences, that is Scripture: but to say, that Christ hath yet to Shed his Blood, that is Ignorance. Now, if this be R. W.'s and the New-England-priests Doctrine, That Christ hath his Blood to Shed, we tell him and them, that He hath Shed his Blood without the Gates of Jerusalem for our Sins, and risen for our Justification; and was Dead, and is Alive, and Dieth no more, but Liveth for Ever: and we Eat his Flesh, and drink his Blood, through whom we have Life. R. W. He bringeth (G. F. Fol: 17) Ench Howet saying: That [It is Blasphemy to say, that Christ is in Man, as God-Man. [And R. W. saith, G. F. Answers, like a Cuckow in one silly Note.] G. F. Answ. [How are they of his Flesh and of his Bone? and doth not the Scripture say, Christ in you, and, God will dwell in you and walk in you? and are not his Saints of his Flesh and of his Bone? and are they not Partakers of the Divine Nature?] And R. W. Replieth, and Confsseth, that the Saints by Receiving of Christ Jesus, and by Believing in him, did partake of the Divine Nature.—And further R. W. saith: Some have been so Bold Bay∣ards, as to say, they are Christ and God, as much as he; that Died at Jerusalem; Christed with Christ, and Godded with God. Asw. These are R. W.'s own words, he hath not brought forth his Author; if he had had them from a Quaker, we should have heard his Name in print: but let the Reader see, whether there be any such words in G. F.'s Answer to E.H? And then he telleth a Great Story of the Nicolatians and Rantrs, which he might have kept at home.
R. W. And R. W. telleth, That the Humane Nature, and Soul and Body of Christ Jesus is so cross,p. 51. and opposite and contrary to their New Whimsical Christ, the Light with∣in, &c. and how that G. F. cannot endure the word Humane: and how the word Humane is a Bugbear to G. F. in all his Book. For thou say'st, The word Humane signifies pertaining or belonging to man: so Humane Soul or Body is no more, but such a Soul and Body, as all Mankind have, &c (1 Corin. 10.) Answ. We charge R. W. and all his New-England-Priests, where ever the Prophets and Apostles give that name HVMANE to Christ's Body and Soul? And the word HVMANE is not a Bugbear, nor Odious to G. F: but for thee and the priests to give such Names to Christ, our Lord and Saviour, which the Scriptures do not give, and yet say, the Scriptures are the Rule, that is Abo∣minable. And there is no such word in 1. Corin. 10. that calleth Christ's Body and Soul HVMANE: and whether is Christ's Body Celestial, or Terrestrial, or which Glory doth he bear? seeing there is a Glory of the Celestial, and a Glory of the Terrestrial Body? (1 Corin. 15, 14.) And G. F. doth grant, and all the Quakers, that Christ was made like unto us, Sin excepted, and had a Body and Soul, or else how could he suffer? and is risen; the same that did Descend, is Ascended, as the Apostle saith. And Christ said, he was from above, and ye are from beneath: and ye are of this world, and I am not of this world, (Joh. 8:) and his Light within, thou cal∣lest here Dagon, their Monstrous, Horrible Idol of a Christ called Light within. O! this Light and Christ within R. W. cannot en∣dure to hear of; that Evil Spirit, that dwelleth in him, ma∣keth him thus to blaspheme it! But we must tell thee, None know∣eth Christ, but as he Reveaeth himself by his Light within: for Christ saith, No man knoweth the Father, but the Son, and he, to whom the Son will Reveal him. R. W. bringeth Daniel Gawdry (in G. F.'s folio 282.) saying we shall not see Christ, as he is, until he come to Judgement▪ and then, and not before we shall see him.] G. F. Answ. [You, where you are, see him not, nor know him as he is, we do believe you; but the Saints, the true Church, whom he is Head of, whom he is in the midst, and in whom he is. And Christ told his Dis∣ciples, They had known him, and they knew the Son of God, and had the Son, and they had the Father also: and he that hath not the Son, hath not Life; and they had handled and seen him.
And the Hope in it self is Pure; and that is it, which purifieth man, and maketh him pure, as He is Pure, &c. Answ. And are not these Christ's and the Apostle's words? but R. W. putteth in an IN more than G. F. and then he crieth Non-sence, and Silly Lines: and he Leaves out (as you may see pag. 282. in G. F.'s Book, where he leaves out▪ Daniel Gawdry's words, how he contradicteth himself. For after D. G. hath said, We shall not see Christ, as he is, till he come to Judgement; then, and not before, we shall see him: and then D. G, saith; Every man, that hath this Hope, purifieth himself: And what Hope is this? is not this Christ in him, the Hope of Glory? and dost not thou see him? And when R. W. saith, He was not desirous to trouble the Auditors with more Quotations: but still they urged, Hast thou any more? so it's like, thou wast Gravelled? but dost not thou Contradict thy self? before thou saidst, how thou Vrged'st them to bring out the Book? R. W. And thou say'st; That G. F. affirms, &c. That Christ Jesus is as much now seen visibly,p. 52. as ever he shall be seen, &c. and then he falleth a Railing, and crieth out, Deluded Soul. [But let the Reader read G. F.'s Answer to G. D. and see, if there be any such words there, as R. W. hath forged, who saith, G. F. affirmeth, &c] And thou Observest in G. F.'s An∣swer; That he cannot keep out of his Burrow of confounding a Vi∣sible Eye and a Spiritual, a Visible and an Invisible Seeing: and then fallest a Railing. Answ. But let the Reader see, if there be any such Confounding in G. F.'s Answer, that R. W. speaketh of? But Christ saith, No Man knoweth the Son, but the Father; nor the Father, but the Son, and he to whom he Revealeth him: Is this Revelation or Sight a Visible Eye? seeing Christ saith, Flesh and Blood hath not Revealed the Son of God to Peter, but the Father, that is in Heaven? R. W. Thou say'st, Though we use to please Children and Fools with the Words of Christ dying at Jerusalem, we see him in the midst of us, he is the Invisible Head of the Church in God, &c. Answ. Roger, these are Words of thy own, That we use to speak so, as to please Children and Fools: for we do Really own Christ's dying at Jerusalem. And why dost-thou scoff at Christ, he being in the Midst f his People by his Spirit? and is that Vi∣sible? or is Christ in the Midst of People upon the Earth, as a
Man Visible? or is he in his Church by his Spirit Ruling and Or∣dering it, who is the Head of it? And doth not Paul tell thee, That the Church is in God? and why dost thou scoff at this, and say, We please Children and Fools with such Speeches? for God's Saints being walking upon the Earth, how doth Christ ex∣ercise his Prophetical Office, his Kingly Office, his Priestly Office, &c? doth he it Visibly, or by his Power and Spirit? and so we do own Christ, as the Scripture setteth him forth. R. W. Bringeth Richard Mayo (G. F.'s Folio p. 276.) saying [That he did believe in a Christ, that died at Jerusalem; but not in a Christ within.] G. F. Answ. [He that doth not believe in a Christ within, doth not believe in a Christ, that died at Jerusa∣lem: and he that doth not believe in a Christ within, and preach Christ within, is a Reprobate, according to the Apostle's Doctrine, (Col. 2. 2 Cor. 13.) And he is not in a True Belief of Christ without, who believeth not in Christ within; but is in the De∣vil's Belief, and believeth as the Devil's do.] R. W. Replieth: A humble Soul may see, how this Subtle Traitor under the golden Name of Christ, and Christ within in the Heart he Stabs at the Heart of the True Lord Jesus, who suffered for poor Man-kind in Man's own Nature at Jerusalem. Secondly, I observe his Virulent, Venemous Mind and Pen stabbing, damning and reprobating all, that truly believe in the true Lord Jesus, whom he confesseth to have been a Real Man dying at Jerusalem, &c. except they can believe, that he is now no where to be found, but in Every Man's Heart, that cometh into the world, that is, No where. Answ. Let the Reader see, if there be any such words in G. F.'s Answer to R. M? And what must we Observe from R. W.'s words here? If Christ, which is in Heaven, that doth enlighten every Man, that cometh into the World, and dwelleth in the Hearts of his Saints (of them that Receive him, yet He) is No where (as R. W. saith); and Preaching Christ in people, except they be Reprobates (as the Apostle did preach the True Lord Jesus Christ, him that died at Jerusalem) if this be Virulent, Venemous and Stabbing, Traiterous, Reprobating and Damning all, that truly believe in Christ, let the Wise in Heart Judge! and read Col. 2. and 2 Cor. 13. But R. W. we Charge thee and the New-England-Priests, to make good by Scripture, That the True Lord Jesus Christ (who suffered at Jerusalem, and is at the Right Hand of God, that) his Heart can be stabb'd, and that he must die again,
who dieth No More: No, R. W. he is out of your Reach; though ye may Stab at him in his Members. O! that ever thou should'st take the Name of Jesus in thy mouth, and call G. F. Subtle Trai∣tor, that Laboureth in the Lord, and Preacheth the Name of Je∣sus Christ, his Death and Sufferings, who is manifest in his peo∣ple. But Roger, why did'st thou not bring in R. M.'s Doctrine, who saith, The Gospel was not the Power of God, no more then a Rose-cake, which he laid his hands upon in the Window? (Fol. 278.) but this thou hast left out, thou thought'st, it would make against thee. And then thou say'st [p. 52 That they were Wor∣thy of Christian Esteem and Honour] which were our Opposers and Persecutors, like thee and the New-England-Priests. R. W. He bringeth (from page 246. Fol.) Christopher Wade say∣ing, &c. and bringeth him again in the same page;p. 53. and bringeth the same Author (from G. F.'s Fol. 248.) and again (from Fol. 249;) and again in the same page the same Author; and once more in the same page, where he bringeth but bits and pieces of G. F.'s words, and leaveth some out. And R. W. thou scoffingly say'st (as the Reader may see, that readeth G. F.'s Book) Thou art Occasioned to follow this Fox in his Holes and Burrows,p▪ 54. to hale him out before God, Angels and Men, as a most-Greedy and Audacious Fox and Wolf, not spa∣ring the Son and Lamb of God, nor his precious Lambs and Sheep. Answ. These are Vngracious Expressions R. W; and thou must know God, and Christ, and his Angels, before thou canst bring any before them: and art blasphemously calling the Christ of the Qua∣kers, a Whimsical Christ. And did R. W. bring these Quotations in the days of his Dispute? for these are but empty, scoffing words, as Fox in his Burrows and Holes, most-Greedy, Audacious Wolf; thou may'st apply them at home, and to the New-England priests. Thus far we can say, The Son of God is come (as John saith) and we are in him; who hath given us Eternal Life, and an Vnderstanding to know him, and loveth all his Lambs. And it is the New-England-priests, that have Not spared the Flock, the Pre∣cious Lambs and Sheep of Christ, and SHED THEIR BLOOD: and thou wouldst Devour them (if it were in thy Power) who persecutest them with thy Tongue. But God and Christ is above thee: and thou shalt know, Christ (whom thou callest the Qua∣kers Whimsical Christ) will Judge and Reward thee in the End for thy Evil Speaking against him.
R. W. Saith: That the Notion of Christ within, Opposite to Christ without, is a most Frantick, Whimsical, Gross and Blockish Fancy. For though he grant, Christ &c. yet making him only Spiritual, and such a Christ, as is Whole Christ, God and Man in every man in the World, he maketh Christ to be but a Whimsical Christ; and that Man, that died at Jerusalem, but a Babilonian Fancy. Answ. Let the Reader see, if there be any such Sayings in G. F.'s Answer, as R. W.'s here, That the Whole Christ, that died at Jerusalem, God and Man in every man in the World, &c? this is thy own Babilonish Fancy. We say, Christ, that died at Jerusalem, Lighteth every man, that cometh into the World: and they that be∣lieve in the Light, receive Christ in them; and he that hath the Son, hath the Father, as the Scripture saith. But he that hateth the Light of Christ (as thou dost,) hateth both the Son, and the Father, and receiveth him not; and that will be both thine and their Condemnation: and so God Revealing his Son in the Apostle, and in his Saints, and their preaching him in the people, is not in Op∣position to Christ without, that died at Jerusalem. Frantick, Whim∣sical, Gross, Blockish Fancy, R. W. might have kept these Vngra∣cious, Vnsavoury words (which savour not of the Spirit of God) at home for his own food, and his New-England priests. R. W. He bringeth (G. F.'s Fol. 222.) the Author of Hosanna the Son of David, &c. saying: [Christ is without his Saints in Re∣spect of his Bodily Presence.] G. F. Answ. [They are Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone, and they Eat his Flesh and drink his Blood. And how have the Saints his Mind and Spirit, and he in them, and they in him, and sit with him in heavenly places? And he is the Head of the Church; how then is he Absent, ye Poor Apostates from him, who feel not Christ within you? And he is in the Saints, and they feel him.] R. W. Replieth: I Observe this Viperous Tongue saying to the Unknown Heavenly Author, &c. [Old Persecutor, he should have said, of the people of God:] and then R. W. falleth a-Railing instead of Answering, and saith; What is this, but a Hight of Devilish Pride going before Destruc∣tion and Condemnation? this proud Swelling Bladder pufft up with a Tympany of Wind—what a huge Swelling Shew he maketh, &c. what Brutish Impudency! a gross Frantick Papist, &c. [And these Vnsavou∣ry, Vngracious words Roger might have kept at home, for they be his own.] And R. W. thou say'st, G. F. will not distinguish between Christ's Spiritual Presence▪ and his Bodily; he will not consider the Difference
between Christ's Spirit and Body, &c. between their Sinful Flesh and Bones, and the Sinless Flesh and Bones of the Man Christ Jesus, &c. between God manifested in the Flesh and Bones of that Man Christ Jesus, and manifested in the Flesh and Bones of Believers in him: and then fallest a-railing, &c. and say'st, — the Self-conceited into the Dungeon of such Black and Helish Ignorance. Answ. This is thy own Wilfulness, that canst not receive a Distinction in thy Self-conceit and Dungeon, and Black, Hellish Ig∣norance. For have not we said over and over and was it not de∣clared to thee in the Dispute, That we own God Manifested in the Flesh and Bones of the Man Christ Jesus, and Suffered and Died at Jerusalem, that is Risen, and is at the Right Hand of God? and that also he is Manifest by his Spirit in his Saints? And as Christ saith, They must eat his Flesh, and drink his Blood, if they would have Life in him, who is that Bread, that cometh down from Heaven, whose words were Spirit and Life? and doth not the Apostle say, The Saints were Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone? and what! must we deny the Apostle's words, and Christ's Doctrine here, because thou gain-say'st it? But why didst not thou bring Hosanna's words (which thou call'st, Heavenly Author) who saith G. F.'s fol. 221.) The Evil done can never appear to be Evil by the Light? now is not this Contradictory to the Apostle, who saith, Whatsoever is made manifest, is by the Light, &c.? And fur∣ther thy Heavenly Author saith, [It is not in the Power of the Light, to call any thing, that is done, Good or Evil:] Is not this to Con∣tradict the Apostle, who saith, Whatsoever Reproveth, and maketh Manifest, is Light? R. W. leaves out his Heavenly Author's say∣ing in this, for this was not for his Purpose, nor none of the rest: if he had Considered it in the Fear of God, he would not have left it out, but have judged it. R. W. He bringeth (from pag 217. Fol.) the Saying of an Adversary of the People of God,p. 55. viz: [To say, Christ with∣in, is never to mention Christ without.] G. F. Answ. [There is none knoweth Christ within, but he knoweth him without, the same yesterday, and to day and for ever. And there is none, that knoweth him, but they know him within, revealed of the Fa∣ther: which is beyond Flesh and Blood.] And R. W. Replieth, and falleth a railing, and saith: This foolish Fox (for all his hi∣ding Craft) is here found out: he professes against his will a Christ, that died at Jerusalem, and therefore is he forced to name a Christ
without, &c. and then falleth a-railing. Answ. As for his Vngracious, Vnsavoury words, they are not worth mentioning: let the Reader see, if G. F. ever denied Christ (that died at Jerusalem) in any of these pages, that he hath brought, or in any of the Quakers Writings? And thou hast confest, that we own Christ, that died at Jerusalem; and now thou say'st, He is forced to name a Christ without: He suffered without; but doth G. F. say, as thou say'st, That he was born yesterday and to day? and, He died yesterday, and he dies to day, and he dies for ever? are any of these words in G. F.'s Answer? but did the Apostle say, Christ died to day, and yesterday, &c. when he said, Christ, the same to day, yesterday and for ever? R. W. But R. W. thou say'st: Such a Christ, as Really and Bo∣dily died at Jerusalem, they scorn, and hate, and fly from, as the Devils did, crying out, &c. Answ. Roger, thou addst Lie unto Lie. For that Christ, that died at Jerusalem Bodily, we own; and it is thou, that scornest it, hatest that Light and fliest from it, as the Devils did, who hatest the Light of Christ, which his Children believe in, and become Children of Light. And we do tell thee, that Our Christ Suffered upon a Material Cross in the Flesh (according to the Scripture) without the Gates at Jerusalem Really, and is risen and manifest in us by his Spirit. And a great deal of scornful Expressions thou hast in this page, which are not worth mentioning. R. W. And thou bringst (Fol. p. 211.) John Burton's saying, [That that Man, that was Crucified, his Body is now in the Presence of the Father, and Absent from his people, as touching his Bodily Presence.] G. F. Answ. [Doth not the Apostle say, He is the Head of the Church? and doth not the Apostle say, They are of his Flesh and Bone, and sit in heavenly places in Christ? and Christ saith, they must Eat his Flesh, and HE IS IN THEM.] R.W. Thou Repliest and say'st: G F. doth plainly deny Jesus Christ to have such a Body, as could be born of a Woman, wrapped in swad∣ling-cloths, &c. as could be hungry, weary, sleep, &c. buffe∣ted▪ whipped, nail'd to the Gallows, die, be buried, arise and ascend up visibly into these Visible Heavens,p. 56. now in the Presence of his Father, and Absent from his people on Earth touching his Bodily Presence. Answ. Let the Reader see, if G. F. speaketh any such words; who owneth Christ Jesus: and he and the people called Quakers
deny his false Charge. And how canst thou own that Christ, thou speakest of, that was wrapped, and in the Manger, and buffeted and nailed to the Cross, and is risen, and at the Right Hand of God, and not own his Light, by which he enlightneth all men, &c? for we do abhor thy words in the Light, and Power and Spirit of Christ Jesus, who was wrapt in swadling-Cloths, and in the Manger, and was an hungry, &c. buffeted, whipt and nailed to the Cross, died, risen, and is Ascended far above all the Heavens, and now in the Presence of his Father; yet manifest in his Saints, by his Spirit, who Eat of his Flesh, and drink of his Blood, by which they have Life in him, and sit together in heavenly pla∣ces in Christ Jesus. But did ever the Quakers say, That Christ's Bodily, or Humane Presence (as thou call'st it) is here now upon the Earth, as an Outward Man? R. W. (From p. 210. fol.) He bringeth J. Borton's (our Old Ad∣versary's saying, [Christ went away into Heaven from his Disciples; and so not within them.] G. F. Answ. [Did not he say, that he would Come again to them? and did he not say, that he was in them (to wit, I in you, and you in me? read John, for Christ said it in his Prayer.) And did not the Apostle say, Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates? and, The Hope of Glory? And was not he revealed in the Apostle, and so in him? and did not the Apo∣stle preach Christ within, as well as without? and you will have us preach him without, and not within: so, is not this to keep people Reprobates?] And again R. W. bringeth (from Fol. the same page) [Those Believers, that are in the Body at this day, are Absent from the Lord.] G. F. Answ. [Doth not the Apostle say, Christ is in them, except they be Reprobates? and, he is in them the Hope of Glory? And the Saints had fellowship with God the Father (John 1:) and God will dwell in them, and walk in them? And, he that believeth, believeth in him (to wit, God and Christ?) and so not Absent:] who are grafted into him, and abide in the Vine. So all the Priests Work hath been to preach Christ Absent, and out of his people, that the Devil may rule in the Hearts▪ not Christ.— And he bringeth the same page (fol. 210.) [They say, He is absent from them, as touching his Flesh.] G. F. Answ. [Doth not the Apostle say, They are of his Flesh and of his Bone? and they that Eat not his Flesh, have not Life in them? and they Sit in Heavenly Places in him? and he that Eateth his Flesh, hath it in him?] Again (in the same page Fol.) R. W.
bringeth the Priest's saying [There is not any Heaven within▪ into which the Man Christ is Ascended: or, can any man contain a Man four foot long?p. 57.] G. F. Answ. [Christ is a My∣stery; and is not he to be Revealed within, who is a Mystery? He, who did Ascend to be Reveal'd, and made Ma∣nifest in his Saints in Flesh and Spirit, that did Descend; which is now Manifested, that the World wondereth at: that is As∣cended far above the Heavens, who is the Saints Life, Living Bread and Drink (to wit, from Heaven.) And where did ever the Ministers of Christ use such Expressions, as thou dost? which sheweth, that Christ to thee is a Mystery.] R. W. Replieth: In all these four Passages G. F. expresly denieth, that Christ is Ascended into Heaven from his Disciples; that Believers now in the Body are Absent from the Lord, &c. Answ. These things are Answered before: but R. W. addeth Lie to Lie. How often hath G. F. confest, That Christ is Ascen∣ded into Heaven, and yet made manifest in his Disciples? and how can he be Absent, that dwelleth in them, and walketh in them, and ruleth in their hearts by Faith, and sit in him, &c? And the King∣dom of Heaven is within; and doth not Christ Rule there by Faith? but did ever G. F. or the Quakers say, That Christ a Man of Four Foot Long ruleth in Peoples Hearts; which R. W. bringeth here? And as for an Image, and Picture, and Imaginary Christ, (which he calleth the Light within) R. W. that is thy own Condi∣tion, Picture and Image, who blasphemest against Christ and his Light, and at the Quakers, who own the True Lord Jesus Christ, that hath enlightned them, as the Scriptures own him. R. W. Bringeth John Burton (G. F. Fol. pag. 206.) saying [A false Christ hath a new false Faith, to apprehend this Crucified Christ within.] G. F. Answ. [Which is contrary to the Faith of the Apostles, which preached CHRIST (that is Crucified (to wit, without the Gates at Jerusalem) WITHIN, and not another; and him that is raised up from the Dead, and is risen, the Lord Je∣sus Christ within, the same yesterday, to day and for ever, by whom the World was made: it was he, that is manifest in the Saints, and not another; for the other is Antichrist.] And R. W. hath Crucified the Son of God to himself a fresh: and is not this Within, R. W. that maketh thee to rail so against his Light?— And R. W. bingeth the same page and Priest saying: [It is a Scripture of the De∣vil's making, to apprehend this Crucified Christ within] G. F. answe∣reth
[Now I say, if there be any other Christ (but he that was crucified) within (to wit, Revealed within in the hearts of his people) he is a false Christ: and the Scriptures hold forth this, and the Devil never made it; but he and his Messengers are against it. And he that hath not this Christ (that was crucified and risen (to wit, Revealed) Within, is a Reprobate, though Devils and Reprobates may talk of him Without.] And R. W. replieth with Railing, and saith: For these subtle Foxes and their words discover (as the Sun at Noon-day) that as plainly as ever Absolom and Achito∣phel &c. rose up &c. against David,p. 58. &c. as Judas &c. Alexan∣der &c. and Himeneus, and Julian the Apostate denied Da∣vid's Antitype, the true Lord Jesus, so under a Cloak and Colour of Christ Crucified within do their Rebellious Traitors bear Arms against the Mediatour betwixt God and Man, the man Christ Jesus, &c. Answ. R. W. thou might'st have applied all this at home; for thou spoke forth thy own Condition, and not the Quakers: for there are no such words in G. F.'s Answers to his Opposers, as thy Evil Spirit hath Invented. And thou Contradictest thy self: For though (say'st thou) it be Scripture-phrase, that we are Crucified, Dead, and Buried and Risen with Christ; yet (thou say'st) what a poor Proof is this, that Christ was Born and Crucified, &c. yesterday and to day within us? These words are thy own Lies; there are no such words in G. F.'s Answer, neither did he ever say so, nor Quakers. R. W. And thou say'st, There is no other Birth, nor Life, nor Death, nor Grave, but what is within us: and all are Reprobates and Devils, that bow not down to this painted, devouring Mon∣ster. Answ. R. W. These are thy own Painted, Monstrous words, not ours, which we never heard of before; neither be there any such words (the Reader may see) in G. F.'s Answer to the Priest. And then thou boastest, what thou hast done; but little cause hast thou to boast, who makest Lies thy Refuge: for Christ's Birth, Death, Grave, and Crucifying, and Jerusalem without us, and the Man Christ Jesus, the Mediatour between God and Man we own; and do abhor thy words. Cloak and Colour thou may'st keep to thy self, and thy Dunghil-Righteousness, thou speakest of; and these are Evil Fruits, that come from thy Evil Tree: and if thou hadst had the least Fear of God before thy Eyes, thou wouldst have never pub∣lisht
such Slanders and Lies of God's people, which are clear of them. But we cannot deny God, who hath Revealed his Son in us, that was Crucified without the Gates of Jerusalem, who was Dead, and is Alive, and liveth for Evermore: and not (as thou lyingly say'st) Crucified yesterday, and to day within us. But such as thou art, Crucifie him to your selves a fresh (as the Apostle tel∣leth thee) and put him to open Shame, and rail against such as will not Crucifie him to themselves a fresh, as thou dost: no, we love the Lord Jesus Christ, our Saviour and Mediatour bet∣ter. R. W. Thou bringest Thomas Moor (G. F. Fol. pag. 35.) say∣ing [Christ is Absent from us, while we are in this Mortal Body.] G. F.'s Answer. [Contrary to the Apostle, who saith, The Life of Christ is manifest in their Mortal Flesh.] And (Fol. p. 36.) the same Author saying [Christ is distinct from every one of us, and without us in our particular persons.] And G. F. Answereth, [The Apostle saith, Christ was in them, except they were Reprobates; and they were of his Flesh and of his Bone. And they Ate his Flesh and drank his Blood; then it was in them: and he is Distinct from none, but Reprobates, who hate the Light.] R. W. In thy Reply thou say'st, Thou wondrest not so much at this Thunder,p. 59. &c. and that all are Reprobates with him, that bow not down to his Carved Image, as thou did'st wonder at thy Opposites, who had said, they would not follow G. F. but in the Truth, &c. Answ. Well, if we said so, thou hast not made out to the Contrary yet, that we follow him out of the Truth? what! because thou say'st, It's Thunder, and Fire and stinking Brimstone to say, They are Reprobates, (as the Apostle did) that have not Christ in them? and because he will not say, as T. M. (one of thy Wor∣thy Christians) Christ is Absent and Distinct from us, while we are in this Mortal Body? I tell thee, we have more Esteem for, and are better Witnesses of the Antient Primitive Doctrine, then thus at once to deny that Christ, and his Appearance and Dwelling in his people, which the Apostle preached (Col. 1.) then with thee & thy Worthy Christians (as thou call'st them) to thrust him out of our Bodies, which are his Temple, & have him alwayes Absent. Then how should he Dwell in us? & how should he be Our Life? & how should we Fed up∣on him? and how should our Hearts be Sanctified by him? and how should we be His, seeing the Apostle saith, He that hath not the
Spirit of Christ is none of his? And, If Christ be in you, the Body is dead, because of Sin: and, If the Spirit of him, that raised up Jesus from the Dead, dwell in you, he shall also quicken your mor∣tal Bodies by his Spirit, that dwelleth in you (Rom. 8, 10, 11.) and as G. F. Answereth, That the Life of Christ is manifest in our mortal Flesh, and manifest in our Body (according to the Apostle's words 2 Corinth. 4, 10, 11.) Now R. W. wouldst thou have us Deny G. F. in this, and not to Plead for him? why dost thou not speak out, and say, Thou wonderest, that we will not deny the A∣postles, but plead for them? for did not they preach this Doctrine? and did not they preach Christ within after his Resurrection, and said, he was their Life; and they that had him not, had not Life? And did not the Apostles say, they were Of his Flesh and Bone, &c? why should'st thou wonder, that we own G. F. in holding according to the Scriptures? And dost not thou often in thy Book say, G. F. owneth that Christ, that died at Jerusalem? (as pag. 50. thou say'st, he Owneth Christ without, and that died at Jerusa∣lem? and page 52. thou say'st, He confesseth him to have been a Real Man dying at Jerusalem:) now, whether we may with more safety take his own words to be his mind▪ or take thy say∣ings, He Intends so, contrary to his words? for this is thy way of proving him and us all to deny Christ by thy Meanings, that thou bring'st Contrary to our Words, all may see, that read thy Book. See pag. 45. where thou say'st, That Quakers say, Christ was born at Bethlehem, and died at Jerusalem; but intend in truth and reali∣ty no other Birth, Life nor Death, but what may be Extant and wrought in the Heart of Man: Here (as in many other places of thy Book) all may see, how Contrary to our Words thou Judg∣est our Intents;) and from this Ground (which we say in the presence of God, is false, and nothing, but thy own Inventions) thou thus Judgest and Condemnest us as Deniers of Christ's Coming and Suffering in the Flesh for Sin: but here we find thee in the Bog and Swamp lost between Christ within and Christ with∣out, which the Apostles preached, their Gospel being hid from thee, thy Eye being darkned.— And R. W. thou say'st, Thou wondrest, we should be so blinded and hardned, as to plead for G. F. in all particulars: And in the same page thou say'st, Thou dost not Re∣member, that any of thy Three Opposites answered to any of thy Observations on Fox's Principles, Answers and Evasions.—Is not hre a Palpable Contradiction? first, to say, We did so much plead
for, and excuse G. F; and then to say, Thou dost not remember, We gave any Positive Answer? if so, what did we plead? Thou say'st, All our work was, to keep our selves within our burrows. R. W. He bringeth Francis Higginson's Saying [Christ's Hu∣mane Nature &c:] G. F.'s Fol. 71.) G. F. Answ. [Where doth the Scripture speak of Humane? the word HVMANE where is it written, that we may search for it? Though we do not de∣ny, that Christ according to the Flesh, was of Abraham; but not the word HVMANE: and Christs Nature is not Humane, which is Earthly; for that is the First Adam.] R. W. replieth and saith, This Ignorant, simple Cavil (as I have before proved it to be from 1 Corinth. 10.) is often brought by G. F. in his Book in a horrible Equivocation,Let the Reader see, if there be any such word, as Humane Nature of Christ, in 1 Cor. 10? to overthrow and destroy that Humane Nature, that Flesh and Body, of the Lord Jesus, who yet had such a Body (they say) that died at Jerusalem. Answ. Dost not thou here Contradict thy self, in saying, We say, That he had such a Body, that died at Jerusalem? they are not G. F.'s words, the Humane Body of Christ, it's the Priests; for we own the Flesh and Body of Jesus Christ: and as for Equivo∣cation, thou may'st keep it at home. And Christ saith, his Flesh and Blood is Meat indeed: and he is the Bread of Life, that came from Heaven; and is it Humane Flesh R. W. that the Saints eat? and is it Humane Blood, the Saints drink? but thou should'st have proved this by Scripture in plain words. And doth not Christ say, That he is from above, and ye from beneath: I am from Heaven, and ye are from the Earth? and, as is the Earthly, such are the Earthly; and as is the Heavenly, such are they also, that are Hea∣venly? The First Man is of the Earth, Earthly; the Second Man (Mark, Man) is the LORD FROM HEAVEN (1 Cor. 15, 47, 48.) and Christ is of the Seed of Abraham according to the Flesh: This is according to Scripture. But R. W. saith, This is a Mental Reservation, according to their Flesh, God in their Flesh, and Christ in their Flesh sffering at Mystical Jerusalem within them. Answ. R. W. read in any of the Quakers Books, or let the Reader see, whether there be any such word in G. F.'s Answer, as, Christs suffering in Our Flesh at Mystical Jerusalem?) these
are R. W.'s words, which he hath forged (as the Reader may see, he often forgeth many words, which were never spoken by us) and then he crieth out, Traiterous (and Blasphemy,) Men∣tal Reservation: which indeed is his own Condition. For we de∣clare, that God was manifest in the Flesh of Christ, and Christ Suffe∣red in the Flesh without the Gates of Outward Jerusalem, and is Risen, and is at the Right Hand of God: and nevertheless Christ is manifest in our mortal Bodies, and God dwelleth in us, and walketh in us, and we are his Temple. And now, we cannot deny this, which is the Apostle's Doctrine; though R. W. opposeth the A∣postle's words, and saith, That we deny Christ without, and God manifest in the Flesh, his Sufferings at Outward Jerusalem, Death and Resurrection, which we own. But this is his Wickedness and Wilfulness; and he putteth us in his Bear's Skin to set his Dogs at Us, to make people believe, That We do not believe, Christ di∣ed at Jerusalem, because we say, that he is manifest within Us, 2 Cor. 4, 10, 11. And we are of the Seed of Abraham and Isaac, and are in Christ Jesus▪ the Light, in whom all Nations are Blest: and thou that art not in him, and He in thee, art in the Ser∣pent's Nature, and Reprobate, as thou speakest of. R. W. And thou bring'st Act. 13. At Antioch Barnabas and Paul in a Synagogue of the Jews made the Humane Na∣ture of the Lord Jesus,pag. 60. (as also in other places) the great Subject of their Discourse and Preaching, &c. Answ. And had Christ no Body, till Paul and Barnabas made it their Discourse in the Synagogue at Antioch? Nay, it was God, that prepared him a Body, before Paul was converted, or Barna∣bas either: and Act. 13, 38. speaketh no such thing of Christ's Humane Nature, there is no such word there; let the Reader see, how thou hast added to the Scripture. For is not Christ the Spi∣ritual and Heavenly Man, (1 Cor. 15?) Therefore do not rail and say, we deny the Body of Christ, because we deny thy Term or Title Humane, of thy Imagination. R. W. Thou tellest of a Diabolical Christ and Fancy within us, begotten by the Devil on a proud, lazy Ignorance. Answ. This is thy own Condition, and thy own Christ R. W: for the True Christ, that lighteth every Man, that cometh into the World, with the True Light, which giveth us the knowledge of him, we own and honour. For how can'st thou and the New-England-Priests own the True Christ, and do not own his Light, which
lighteth every Man, that cometh into the World? you are not like to Own the true Christ. And Roger, sometimes thou call'st the Scriptures the Word, sometime the History, sometimes the Word of God; and art Angry with the Quakers, because they will not call them the Word? and yet thou say'st, I could not prove, where∣in the Scripture was called the Word of God: So it is clear, R. W. will call them that, which he cannot prove; and yet the Scrip∣tures are his Rule, and not the Spirit. R. W. He bringeth Thomas Collier's Sayings (G. F.'s fol. pag. 37) [If the very Christ of God [R. W. saith, Christ, God-Man] be within those, that are called Quakers, he cannot come down from Heaven.] G. F. Answ. [Here he standeth against the Promise of Christ, That he shall come and dwell in you, and walk in you; and I will come again unto you. And, He hath revealed his Son in me, saith the Apostle: and thus thou T. C. and J. B. are ignorant of plain Scripture; the Scripture declareth it. And the Apostle said, Know ye not, that Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates? and, The Spirit of the Father speaketh in you. And how Contrary art thou to the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles!]. And then R W. Replieth, and telleth a Great Sto∣ry, and saith: That G. F. plainly denieth the expected Personal Coming of the Lord Jesus. Answ There is no such thing in G. F.'s Answer, the Reader may see; but how God and Christ will dwell in his Saints. But G. F. doth not say, That Christ, a Man of Four foot long is dwel∣ling in the Saints  pag. 57.) for God and Christ dwelleth in his Saints by his Spirit. — And where did ever G. F. say, That Christ, God-Man, dwelt in him? where is any such Expression in his Book, Christ God-Man? where doth he find these words in Scrip∣ture? though God, and the Man Christ Jesus is owned, as the Scripture speaketh. R. W. And when John Stubs was speaking to thee, what the Hebrew Word of Everlasting Father Signified, thou said'st,pag. 61. Some had rendred it, the Father of Ages, or an Age; but then thou told'st John, It was not a Seasona∣ble Time to spend time about Translations. And thou say'st, J. Stubs understood Hebrew, Greek and other Languages as well as thy self, and better too; [and did J. Stubs tell thee, he understood Hebrew, Greek and other Languages as well a thou, and better too?] and then say'st, Thou wast about to say, how wonderfully they were chan∣ged
from their former Principles and Practices, &c. Answ. No such thing, Roger: but it seemeth, here It was not a Seasonable Time, when J. S. had Gravell'd thee, though thou be∣gunst thy self with Hebrew; and yet, when thou wert stopped with it, it was not a Seasonable Time. R. W. And thou say'st: They have profess'd to thee, that they have no need of Books, no, not of the Scripture it self, [but who those are, thou hast not named;] for they had the Teacher with∣in them, that gave forth the Scripture, &c. now they are perswa∣ded to study the Scripture and the Translation of it, &c. Answ. Thou, that Studiest the Scripture and outward Transla∣tions without the Spirit, that gave them forth, thou wilt not un∣derstand them, no more then Antichrist and the Wolves in Sheeps-Cloathing. And it was always our Practice to Study the Scrip∣tures with the Spirit, that gave them forth (as thou may'st see in the End of G. F.'s Fol:) so we are not Erred from our First Princi∣ples, as thou Scoffingly speakest, nor did we ever Neglect and Slight them as Vseless and Needless, as thou maliciously say'st.— R. W. And thou scoffingly say'st, What Simplicity is it in us, to stoop down to Pen an Ink, when the Light is sufficient to bring us to Heaven, to guide us Immediately and Infallibly, &c. Answ. We tell R. W. that Pen and Ink, and Fallible Transla∣tions will not guide him nor his New England-priests to Heaven: and therefore do not scoff at the Sufficiency of the Light, for in the Light we see more Light. Nor do not mock at the Imme∣diate and Infallible Teaching of the Spirit of God; for They that are lead with the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God: for the Spi∣rit of God leadeth into all Truth; and that is Sufficient. R. W. And thou say'st again: The truth is, they look at the Scriptures still, but as the Ceremonies, which the Apostles dispensed with for a Season: they care no more for the Scriptures, than the Papists do. Answ These words R. W. hath forged himself, and they are none of ours; he might have applied them at home. And we have Esteem of the Scriptures, and know them by the Spirit, that gave them forth; and to what End. R. W. And then thou railest at W. Edmundson, who said unto thee,p. 62 Thou kept them long, but proved nothing: [and that he truly said; but thou manifestest thy own Folly.]
And thou say'st, W. E. fell into a down right Speech or Sermon: [but why did'st thou not print the Sermon?] And thou say'st, He de∣clared, how notoriously thou had'st wronged them, in laying and pub∣lishing so many false, and some of them dangerous Charges against them; and how they had been so patient towards thee, and suffered thee to produce so many Allegations out of G. F.'s Book, and yet they spake nothing for thee R. W. but G. F.'s his words cleared him from all thy Vnjust Challenges and Charges. And That W. E. Appealed to the people, how willingly they had shewed themselves to own the Scriptures, and to have all their Teachings and Differences tried by the Scriptures. And so W. E.'s words will stand upon R. W. and all his Teachers, (as ye may see pag. 62▪ 63.) — And when W. E. mentioneth the Preaching of the Light (of Christ,) Roger putteth in his Margent, And his Vain Extelling of their Idol Light. Answ. Now, is it not Clear, that R. W. (who calleth himself Oratour) denieth the true Christ, the Light of the World, which Lighteth every man with the true Light, that cometh into the World, who blasphemously calleth this Light, an Idol?— R. W. And then thou Scoffingly say'st, How J. Stubs began a large Speech or Sermon: [but both J. S.'s. and W. E.'s Sermon (if they were Large) thou hast printed them very Short.] And then thou say'st, W. E. that Pragmatical, Insulting Soul Stop∣ped thee,p. 63. so that thou openly complained'st of Incivili∣ty. Answ. But why should not we have Liberty to Speak, as well as thou? And the people knoweth, how many Long Speeches thou mad'st, but nothing to the purpose, what thou promised'st to prove out of G. F.'s Book; which was quite the contrary: and thou could'st make nothing Good out of it for thy Purpose R. W. as was Evident, when G. F.'s Book was brought forth. And when W. E. did Appeal to the People, thou hast not shewed, that the people was dissatisfied with W. E.'s Appeal: and were not W. E.'s and J. S.'s their Speeches (which thou scoffingly call'st Sermons) to the Matter of the false Charges, which thou could'st not make Good? R. W. And thou Say'st: Is it comely, when persons are Dispu∣ting, to fall upon our knees, and Answer an Argument with a Prayer.p. 64. Answ. But did there any of the Quakers do so at this Three-Days Work at Newport? let the people there Judge, whether
R. W. speaketh the Truth in this? for we Remember no such thing done there by any. But set the Case, they had; what! doth R. W.'s Spirit so Envy Prayer? and W. E. might very well say, Why should we sit here? when thou had'st kept them there to hear thy Lies Two Days together, and had'st proved nothing to the Purpose: therefore we had a great deal of Patience to bear thee so long, to multiply thy false Charges and Blasphemies against Christ, and his Light and Holy Spirit, as thou did'st; as may be seen at large in thy own Book. And thou say'st, That We Spoke so much: but let the Reader see, whether thou hast not here Spo∣ken a great deal more, than we all, as thy own Book testi∣fieth. R. W. And again thou say'st, That We be not Able to Answer, nor to Bear thy words. Answ. This the people knoweth, that heard our Answers and thy Words, whether we did not Answer to thy false Charges, and disproved them out of G. F.'s Book (which thou brought'st) and by Scripture. R. W. Thou say'st, Thou took'st a little Boldness, and told'st us, that if Paul himself was present, and Jesus Christ himself in their Bodi∣ly Presence (which we confessed, he died in at Jerusalem) yet we would say unto Christ and Paul, Thou hast falsly Charged us; and, Paul and Christ had proved nothing: and Paul and Christ should be a Blasphemer and Beelzebub, because he brought glad News of the Truth from Heaven to them. Answ. R. W. These are False Charges of thine, and Great Bold∣ness and Wickedness: and did'st thou Say all these words in the Dispute? let the people Judge; for we do not remember, thou did'st. And dost thou compare thy self with Paul and Christ Jesus here? and must we look upon thy foul Slanders and Lies as News from Heaven? Nay; for thou deniest him and his Light, who is the Good News from Heaven, that's God's Salva∣tion, that Old Simeon rejoiced at. But R. W. what must we In∣fer from thy words? That Jesus Christ himself in our Bodily Pre∣sence, &c. as thou say'st? Is not this so much as to say, That Jesus Christ was not in R. W.'s Bodily Presence at New-port in the Dispute? which we do believe him, it was not the Motion of the Spirit, nor the Spirit of God and Christ, that moved him to that Work; but the Father of Lies. For we can say, that we felt the Presence of the Lord Jesus Christ manifest in our Mor∣tal
Bodies, carrying us on in his Work at that Time (Glory to his Name for Ever!) by his Light, Power and Spirit: but it's like, R. W. did not feel him, who scoffeth at his Spiritual Ap∣pearance in his people. So as for Blasphemer and Beelzebub he might have kept at home. R. W. Thou makest a great Noise (in page 64, and 65,) and say'st: As we have denied the Person of the Lord Jesus, so we deny his Offices: when it was demanded, Wherein? thou said'st, Thou had'st many things to declare; and then tell'st, What the Pa∣pists hold: and say'st; The Quakers set up a Voice or Motion within them, overtopping the Voice of Christ Jesus in the Scriptures:pag. 65. and some of us maintaining, that the Light within is that Great Prophet, that was to come, which Moses Prophesied of. And that we are notoriously guilty of High Treason against the King of Kings, the Lord Jesus, &c. and rob him of his Crown, &c. Answ. The Person of the Lord Jesus Christ we own, and all his Offices in his Church, which he exerciseth by his Light and Spirit, which Light R. W. Blasphemously calleth an Idol; and therefore he is not like to own and see Christ in his Offices in his Church, how he exerciseth them there. And our Motions of God's Spirit and of Christ are owned with the Spirit of Christ, and the same, that gave forth Scripture: and so it will not Over-top or O∣ver-pour it self. And thou, that hast not the Spirit of Christ, art none of his: and the Spirit of Christ in Our Age owneth the Voices and Motions given forth from it self in Ages past, and doth not Over-top and Over-pour them, as thou vainly and foolishly say'st. And the Great Prophet, which Moses spoke of (to wit, Christ,) IS COME, and hath enlightned us with his True Light, which is in our Hearts, that giveth us the Knowledge of him: and thou, that call'st this Light within (that giveth the Knowledge of Christ, which cometh from him) an Idol wickedly, thou deniest this True Pro∣phet in blaspheming his Light within, whom we maintain. For this Great Prophet saith, I am the Light of the World; and so is the True Light, that Lighteth every Man, that cometh into the World: and so, thy Thoughts, that thou hast contracted, of No∣toriously guilty of High Treason against the Lord of Lords, and KING of KINGS, Christ Jesus, is thy own. R. W. Thou say'st: They Rob him [Christ, the KING of KINGS] of his Crown, and Life and all.
Answ. R. W. and the Priests of New-England, Can the Lord Jesus Christ, the King of Kings and Lord of Lords (who is As∣cended far above all Heavens, and at the Right Hand of God, who is now manifest by his Spirit in his people) be robb'd of his Crown, and Life and All? can R. W. and you New-England Priests take away his Crown of his Head, and Life and All? is this the True Christ, that can be thus Robbed, that R. W. pleadeth for? We must tell him, that the True Christ, the King of Kings, the Lord of Glory, he cannot Rob him of his Crown and Life; for no Robbers can Ascend, where Christ is: and here he speaketh, like a Man that doteth; and is this the New-England-High-priests Orator? For doth not Christ Encourage his Saints to lay up Treasure in Heaven, where the Thieves come not? but by R. W.'s Argument, as far as in them lay, they can Rob him of it. Thou say'st, As far as in them lay: but we must tell thee, this cannot he said, and thou speakest vainly; though thou may'st Crucifie him to thy self a fresh. And R. W. hath not proved this Assertion, That we go about to do any such thing; but it is his own Assertion, that calleth his Light an Idol: and we might very well Deny all thy Proofs, seeing that thou could'st make none of them Good out of G. F.'s Book, R. W. Thou say'st, We deny that Visible Kingdom and Church and Institutions, which he (Christ) as King over all his Subjects, hath Soveraign Right unto, and most faithfully and wisely Ordained to continue, till his Coming again. And thou say'st, Thou Told us, that G. F.'s his Book and all our Books and Professions denied any Visible Church of Christ at all, and Visible Officers, and that we maintain, the Church was in God. Answ. Christ saith, His Kingdom is not of this World, but an Everlasting Kingdom. And how wilt thou prove, that Christ's Kingdom is Visible? is it not Spiritual, and ruleth in the Hearts of his people? and is not that a Spiritual Rule? He Ruleth the Na∣tions with a Rod of Iron; is that Outward? His Kingdom we do own▪ though all his Subjects, his people (as to the Bodies) be Visible, and his Church; yet he Ruleth them by his Invisible Power and Spirit. And doth G. F.'s Book, that thou brought'st, and other Books or any of the Quakers Profession prove, that the Church of Christ (or Outward Congregations, to wit, the Bodies of his people) [were Invisible? though we do maintain, That the Church is in God (as the Apostle saith 2 Thes. 1.) And we Worship God in Spirit
and in Truth; and is not the Spirit Invisible? and though the Outward Bodies of the Saints and Officers of the Church are Visi∣ble, but the Holy Ghost, that maketh them Officers and Over-seers, is Invisible: and is not Christ's Baptism with the Holy Ghost and Fire Invisible? and is not this within? And Christ saith, If any one hear my Voice, and open unto me, I will come in to him, and Sup with him, and he with me: Is this Supper Visible? (Revel. 3, 20.) And as for Outward Bread, Water and Wine, art thou in that Practice thy self? R. W. And thou say'st, J. Stubs demanded of thee, why thou Charged'st us of being Guilty, and not Living in Church-Ordinance thy self? Answ. J. Stubs had Good Reason to ask thee this Question, see∣ing thou livest not in the Practice, nor under the Exercise of none thy self, as we understand. And whom hath R. W. Fellowship withal? or of what Church is he a Member of? but is not R. W.'s (like wild Ismael) his Hand against every man? the Bond-Wo∣man's Son cast out of Abraham's Family, the Father of the Faith∣ful? and well might J. Stubs reprove thee, who livest in none, and opposest us, that do. And thou goest over and over with thy Tautologies of Christ, the King of Kings his Visible Kingdom, and how that we turned all to Notions and Fancies of an Invisi∣ble Kingdom: Roger, are not the True Christians Christ's Army and Officers, though they outwardly be Visible? are the Weapons of Christ's Ministers and Officers Visible? yet do not they say, Their Weapons are Spiritual, and not Carnal? and is Spiritual Vi∣sible? And doth not the Apostle say, The Kingdom of God stan∣deth not in Words, but in Power and Joy in the Holy Ghost? and is the Power of God, and the Holy Ghost Visible, in which the Kingdom standeth? prove thou and the New-England priests this by Scripture; though the Saints Bodies, that possess this, are Vi∣sible: and thou may'st take thy Notions and Fancies to thy self of God and Christ's Kingdom. R. W. After thy Search thou say'st, Thou dost believe, that some come nearer to the First Primitive Churches, and Institutions and Appointments of Christ Jesus, then others, as in many Re∣spects, so in that Gallant,p. 66. and Heavenly and Fundamen∣tal Principle of the true Matter of a Christian Congrega∣tion, Flock or Society (viz) Actual Believers, True Disciples and Converts, Living Stones, &c: This was, and I hope is the Principle of the New-English Church.
Answ. How now Roger, art thou Flattering the NEW-ENG∣LAND-CHVRCH, and Daubing of them here with thy Un∣tempered Morter to get Favour, who hast so long lived in the Woods and Wildernesses, like Ismael? but let us Examine this NEW-ENGLAND-CHVRCH with their Heavenly, Fundamen∣tal Principles, and try thse Actual Believers, True Disciples and Converts, Living Stones &c. which thou say'st, Come nearer to the First Primitive Churches, and Institutions and Appointments of Christ. And yet R. W. professeth, That if his Soul could find Rest in Joining with any of the Churches professing Christ Jesus, now Extant, he would readily and gladly do it. How now Roger, canst thou not Join with those Actual Believers, True Disciples and Converts, Living Stones, to wit. The CHVRCH in NEW-ENGLAND, which was, and hopest she is, and comes nearer to the Primitive Churches, and Institutions and Appointments of Christ's Gallant and Heavenly, Fundamental Principle? Why! canst not thou Join with this R. W. that thou hast extoll'd so high? But Roger, as we said before, we must Try this CHVRCH of NEW-ENGLAND by the Fruits, as Christ Commandeth us, whether she be not the Whore, and False Prophet and Strumpet, and Anti-Christ, and the Beast, that hath her Power from the Dragon, that made war with the Saints, and the Whore, that drunk the Bood of the Saints, and the inwardy Ravening Wolves, that devour the Sheep in the Sheeps-Cloathing, and inwardly Ravened from the Spirit of God, and the Light, which cometh from Christ Je∣sus; which thou call'st an Idol: and so have denied the True Lord Jesus Christ. And Christ saith, We shall know them by the Fruits; and so we must try them by the Fruits as Christ saith. For Do men gather Grapes of Thorns▪ or Figs of Thistles? And now, let AMERICA and EVROPE whom the Sound of the Fruits of this CHVRCH of NEW-ENGLAND is come into, see, if they be such, as R. W. hath Characteriz'd them to be? Have they not manifest themselves to be the Thorny Trees (not the Vines) and the Thistles (not the Fig-trees) by their Pricking and Tearing of God's Chosen? Have they not manifested themselves to be the Wolves Wor∣rying and Devouring of God's Lambs and Sheep? and have they not HVNTED them with their Outward Dogs up and down the Woods? Have they not WHIPT and TORN the very Bodies of Men and Women on Whip-stocks, till they Tore the very Pa
of the tender Breast? Have they not WHIPT WITH PITCH∣ED ROPES the very Body to a Yelly. Have they not HAN∣G'D FOVR OF THE SERVANTS OF GOD upon the Gal∣lows, and BANISH'D MANY upon PAIN of DEATH? Have they not made FINES, that none should receive God's people, nor a Book; and aid GREAT FINES, upon Masters of Ships, that they should bring none into the Country? and IMPRISONED Multitudes, and CVT OFF the EARS of such, as came to visit the Prisoners, to see, what God's people lacked in their▪ Doleful Prisons? Have they not BVRNT and BRANDED with a Hot Iron? Have they not SPOILED MVLTITVDES of the Lord's peo∣ples Goods, and been Worse, then ever the Bishops were in Old-Eng∣land? FINED them five Shillings a day, that do not come to Hear them; whereas they know, in England the Law was but Twelve Pence? And all this for their OBEDIENCE to CHRIST IESVS. Whose BLOODY, CRVEL, MVRTHEROVS ACTIONS will be — CHRONICLED TO POSTERITY! And these are R. W.'s Living Stones, Actual Believers, True Dis∣ciples, Converts, Heavenly, Fundamental Principles of the true mat∣ter of a true Christian Congregation, Flek and Society; and these come nearer to the First Instititutions and Appointments of Christ Jesus, as R. W. saith — Now, we charge Roger Williams and his New-England-Teachers and Church, to shew us, where-ever the Living Stones, the Converted, that were in the Fundamental Principles of a Christian, and the Disciples of Christ Jesus used all or any of these Carnal Weapons to Hang, Burn, Whip, Spoil Goods, Cut off Ears, as R. W.'s Converts have done in New-England? and also we Charge him and the New-Eng∣land-Priests, to shew us a Scripture, where-ever Christ and his Apostles did command to WHIP, HANG, BVRN with a Hot Iron, CVT OFF EARS, BANISH on PAIN OF DEATH, SPOIL GOODS of the people of God, Lay GREAT FINES upon Masters of Ships, and such, that received the people of God, as the NEW-ENGLAND Priests and Professors have done, which are R. W.'s Converts, Living Stones, Actual Believers, True Disciples? And now, is not here the Mark of the BEAST, and the WHORE, because God's people would not drink their Cup, and because they would not receive the Beast's Mark, they in that RED DRAGON'S power have made this War against them. And these are NEW ENGLAND's CONVERTS and BE∣LIEVERS! And these are them R. W. saith, That can give an
Account of the Grace of God, that hath appeared unto them, and wrought that Heavenly Change in them: And if this be R. W.'s HEAVENLY CHANGE of the New-England-Church, as he calleth it, and in his Account, with all these Devilish, Wicked Fruits of the Old Man, and Carnal Weapons in Cain's Spirit, and Judas with his Sword and Staves against Christ's Followers, which hath been a Shame to Christianity, and a Dishonour to the Name of Christ, and a Scandal to Religion, yea, the very Profes∣sion of the Name of Christ; and have Caused his Name to be Blasphemed among the Heathen: Yea, the Turks, Jews, and Pa∣pists and Indians may HISS AT THEM, as many have done already. And we do say, That they know not themselves, what Spirit they are of; for Christ came not to destroy Mens Lives, but to save them: and he Rebuked such, that would have had Mens Lives destroyed. So it's Clear, you that have Destroyed Mens Lives, are not of God, but of the Devil: for doth not he De∣stroy Mens Lives? and doth not the Devil signify a Destroyer? And so it's Clear, that you have not the Mind of Christ, nor his Spirit; and so None of his: for his Spirit and Mind leadeth in∣to no such Actions or Practices; but to Love one another, and to Love Enemies, as he commandeth. And if this be a HEAVEN∣LY CHANGE in R. W.'s Account, then we must needs judge him Blind, and knoweth not, what the True Heavenly Change is, nor True Converts, nor Fundamental Principles, nor True Dis∣ciples and Believers: and therefore no wonder, though he hath Judged us, as he hath done in his Book; who calleth Darkness and its Works Light, and Light Darkness. R. W. And thou say'st; There is a Time of Purity and Primi∣tive Sincerity, a Time of Transgression and Apostacy, a Time of Com∣ing out of Babilon's Apostacy, &c; a Time of many Flocks pre∣tending to be Christ's, and saying, Lo here, and Lo there, &c. a Time when Christ Jesus his Doves cry, &c. and when thou hast gone on by way of Preaching, thou say'st, Thou dost not know, that there was made any Reply to this by thy Opposites —. Answ. Roger, this was beside the Matter: Thou should'st prove the Charges. We did not come there to hear thee Preaching; but to Prove thy False Charges: but when thou could'st not, thou fell a-Preaching to us. And well might W. Edmundson and J. Stubs tell thee, Thou had'st spent so much time, and say, They had other
Business in hand, than to Attend upon thy False Charges, when thou should'st have made them good, and fell a-Preaching to them (as in page 66.) R. W. And thou say'st; Thou used'st all possible Brevity, [but the Reader may see, how thou wentst beside the Matter in thy Preaching:] and thou say'st; I rather chose thus to Apologize for my self,p. 67. than down-right to blame them, on whom (they saw well enough) I laid the Blame of our Long Proceeding. Answ. Surely Roger, if thy Heart were not hardned, thou durst not thus speak, as to Lay the Blame upon us of our Long Proceeding; when as all the Sober People, that was there at the Dispute, know well, that our Long Proceeding was upon the Oc∣casion of thy Long, Impertinent Speaking, and not bringing that, which was Material for the Proof of thy Positions. And since thou hast taken thy own Time now at Large to write further for the Proving of them, let Sober People Judge, whether in all that thou hast yet done, thou hast Proved any of thy False Charges? And so i's-Evident, that our Long Proceeding was upon no other Occasion on our sides, than our Long, Patient Waiting upon thee to prove thy Charges and False Accusations; which thou didst not then, nor hast not yet done it. R. W. And thou say'st; Thou spake nothing, but the Eternal Truth of God: and thou said'st; The Words I have spoken, shall Judge you at the Last Day; and then thou did'st with-draw. Answ. R. W. how darest thou take the Words of the Lord in thy Mouth, and speak of the Eternal Truth of God with a Dark Spirit, and say, Thy Words shall Judge us in the Last Day? when thou hast utter'd so many Lies and False Charges, and makest thy Lies and Slanders Equal with Christ's-Holy Words, and call'st his Light a Fancy and an Idol? which will be thy Burden at Last, except thou dost Repent; which we fear, it will be Hid from thy Eyes. And any False Prophets or Persecutors, or the Dvil may use the Words of Christ against his Children, the Lambs of Christ, as thou hast done here, and so Abuse and Prvert the Scriptures as to a wrong End, to which they were never spoken: but Alas Poor Man! thy Words are nothing to us R. W. Thou callest W. E. Proud Mouth, because he called upon thee to make good thy False Charges; for we had used Long Pati∣ence to hear thee, and we would not endure any Long and Tedious Discourses.
Answ. And well we might say so, to hear thee tell a Tale of the Turk and the Pope, as many times thou hast done over and over in thy Book here to no purpose, when thou should'st have Pro∣ved thy Charges. — And thou say'st; Our own Souls know, and the Auditory, that thou used'st to be Brief; When Our own Souls know the Contrary: for W. E. might well tell thee of the Quar∣ter of an Hour at Providence, when thou forgottest thy self, and fel'st a Rambling and Doting beside the Matter. R. W. Thou say'st; Thou wast told at Providence, that thou knewest,p. 68. that we would not stand a Disputation; for if we did, we would not Continue without great Advantage, &c. and break off Abruptly, as our Spirit hurried us. Answ. Was not this thy own Condition R. W.? And we had Advantage enough upon thee, for thou could'st make nothing good. R. W. And thou say'st; Thou wast Queried at Newport by some, Why we did not proceed on the First-Day? and then thou say'st; That we do not Cordially own that Day (for the Quakers work up∣on it) but we wisely resolved to have the whole First-Day to make up the Breaches, stop Leaks, dress Wounds, that might be in the fore-going Agitations against our Consciences and Credits. And, It is doleful, that Men of Excellent Parts, and of Great Know∣ledge in the Scripture, should yet so lie under the Sentence of Gos∣pel-Justice, that they cannot but Deceive, as they are Deceived; that they cannot but Believe Lies, and Tell Lies, Horrible and Blas∣phemous Lies as Confidently, as the Purest Truths; and suck-in, and pour-out the Poison of Dragons, the Great Red Dragon, the Father of Lies, &c. Answ. R. W. this thou might'st very well have kept at Home with the Red Dragon, which ruleth in thee and the New-England-Priests and Professors, who are under the Sentence of Gospel-Justice and Judgement; though thou may'st talk of the Scripture. And thy Lies, thy Horrid, Blasphemous Lies, they did not (as thou scoffingly say'st) make Leaks, neither make Breaches among us; but we are confirmed in the Lord against them, knowing the Tree by its Fruits. And what Quakers those are, that Work the First-Day, thou hast not named them: so this is like the rest; and we shall not say much to it, till thou dost name them. But we Meet together on the First Day of the Week, as the Primitive Christians did; and so bestow it better, than to Hear thy Lies
and Blasphemies: any other day would serve R. W. But we do not understand, that R. W. maketh any Conscience, or hath such a Zeal either for God or that Day, as to Meet to Worship God upon that Day: and who dost thou Meet with? or hast thou not driven all People from thee with thy Dark Spirit? Thou callest W. E. Braggadocia; thou migh'st have kept that at home. R. W. Telleth a great story of his Brother sending a Letter to be read in the Assembly — And W. E. told thee,p. 69. That we did not come to hear Papers read; but how thou could'st make out thy false Charges. Answ. It seemeth, both thy Brother and Thou were offended, because it was not. And thou confessest thy self, thy Brother judged us as Insultors and Dominerers; therefore we had little Reason to take Notice of his Letter, or give any Credit to it. And we had Just Cause enough either for Hitchcock or him, or any others (that came to ask Questions that Time in the Dispu∣ting with thee, who hadst Challenged us and all the Comers) when we saw, they came to make Inter-ruptions, to desire them to set their Hands to the Charges, and so to have join'd with thee, that we might have kept to the Matter in Hand; or if they would not, it was Vncivil for them to make Inter-ruptions, when we had thee to deal withal, for to hear thee prove thy false Positions and Accusations. And if they had had the Civility and Patience, and stayed, till we had done with thee; and then appeared like Men, they might have been Heard and Answered in Season: but to come and make a Brabble, and ask strange Questions beside the matter in Hand; This we do not count to be Civil, though ye may count it so. But we knew, that thou wouldst willingly ac∣cept of any to make a Noise, for to ease thy self, and take thee off from proving thy false Charges. And as for thy Brother, thy Religion and his is both Alike. R. W. And thou tellest of a Paper containing the Sight of Sin, and the Sight of the Lord Jesus; these two were the Two Dag∣gers, which stab at the Heart of their feigned Christ and Light within. Answ. Here Roger hath discovered himself and his Blasphemy in Denying the Lord Jesus Christ and his Light: And often he bringeth the word STABBING, manifesting his Evil Spirit. And the Feigned Christ thou might'st have kept at home; for the Re∣al Christ we own with the Light, that cometh from him, by
which we see Sin and See our Saviour, which saveth from it. R. W. And thou say'st, Thou art not of thy Brother's Consci∣ence, that thou ought to have Admonisht the Quakers, be∣fore thou had'st so publickly,p. 70. &c. since they proclaim'd their Sin as Sodom on the House-Top, &c. and so goest on in Railing and Slandering: and say'st further; Nor do I think I charged them too deep or too sharply, &c. for I know, the Foxes and the Wolves (the Able Leaders amongst them) do not run a∣way with Pigs and Swine only; but Lambs and Chickins of Christ are carried away in their Soul-bloody Jaws, &c. and so fallest a-railing, &c. tellest of Blind Leaders and Chapmen, that by feign∣ed words make Merchandize upon mens Souls, 2 Pet. 2. Answ. R. W. and his New-England-Priests might have kept a great part of this at home. But is R. W. too high for the Com∣mand of Christ, First tell thy Brother, &c? but what are these Sins, we proclaim as Sodom, and the House-top, that the Quakers hold? we do abhor his false Charges here, we own no such things And whereas thou think'st, thou dost not Charge us deep enough; thou hast, nor couldst not make good the things, thou hast Charg∣ed us withal. And as for Wolves, Soul-Bloody Jaws, Fire-brands, blind Leaders, Foxes, Chap-men, that by feigned words make Mer∣chandize of mens Souls, (2 Pet. 2.) If there be any such in the World, they be in New-England, their Fruits have declared it. And R. W.'s his Brother's Letter beginneth pag. 71. and endeth pag. 75: which R. W. highly extolleth, and saith; This is the poor Letter Condemn'd Unheard, &c. who like the Men of China Judge all the World to have no Eyes,p. 75. except the Men of Europe, to whom they grant One Eye; and that is more, than our Proud Pharisees will do to any, that bow not down to their Gross Phylacteies. Answ. These are thy scoffing words: but R. W. is Judging the Chinaes as well as us. And it's false to say, we Condemn'd the Letter Unheard: but we count, It was not Time for thee to bring-in the Letter; but to make good thy false Charges. For thy Bro∣ther was a Party: though he would not subscribe to thy false Charges; yet would busy himself, and make himself concerned. But its like, thou may'st Charge the Chinaes falsly, as thou hast done us: for thou art full of such Tales and Stories. And many times, when thou should'st have proved the matter, thou tell'st
us of Papists, Arminians, &c. and truly, thy Brother's Letter is not worth the taking Notice of. Rob. W. He saith; I write not to Charge nor to Admonish, &c. (p. 71.) and thou say'st, Thou wouldst not have us to take it as a Charge; and then say'st, That we never dealt Faithfully (pag. 72.) [Now let the Reader Judge, whether this is not a High Charge and a Judgement too.] And 2ly say'st, That we assumed and pre∣sumed beyond the bounds of Moderation and Christianity; [yet we must not take these as Charges:] and further say'st; Our Expres∣sions and Behaviours in our Actings were not for Edification of the Auditors, but Advancing of self; and that we limited the Holy One of Israel: we break the Apostolical Command; we dealt not Faithfully and Christian-like: (pag. 73.) [And if these be not Charges, let the Moderate Judge.] Answ. And should we suffer any to speak, and make a Confu∣sion and Cavil (except they would Join with thy Brother in the Matter) and yet would not own the thing; but only Speak to Interrupt, and to Put by, and to Bring-in New Matter, taking up only Time, and to hinder the Matter in hand? For thou wouldst make us believe, that thou Vnderstood'st the Order in Courts of Ju∣dicature (pag. 73.) in Temporal Matters: but where, and in what Court are such things allow'd, that when a Man hath a Cause or Complaint against another, that many are suffered to Oppose, yet will not to join with the Complainant? will not the Court look upon such, as being Disorderly and Busy-Bodies, and cry, SI∣LENCE IN THE COURT? And though it was profered fair to you, or to any, that if they would have owned and joined with him in all or any of the Positions, we offered them Liberty to speak, what they would. Which is Clear, that you manifest your selves as Disturbers, who would not own or speak to the Matter in Hand: For it's known, that several there did speak to bring in other things beside the Matter; as R. Hitchcock, and many others. And was not R. Hichcock Answered fully in Sea∣son? and so might'st thou have been, if thou hadt had Patience, and appeared in the Meeting to have spoken in Season, when we had done with thy Brother. Robt. W. And thou tellest us a Story of a Man's Wife being big with Child, which came with him to the Arch-Bishop, and he gave her Liberty to speak to the full: [What is this to the purpose? for did not she speak to her Husband's Concern? So if thou wouldst
have taken thy Brother's Concern, thou might'st have spoken too.] But thou say'st, It appeared to thee, that thy Brother had assu∣med and presumed too much, being so large and high Proposals. Answ. And if this was the Ground, why thou could'st not join with thy Brother; then thou might'st have had so much Mode∣ration and Patience, and waited, till we had done with him; then thou mightest have been Answered, and Drunk of Our Common Wine-press freely, which is open to all. But thou wast so great with Child, (but not of the Man Christ Jesus) to bring forth these false Charges (which thou wouldst not have us to take as Charges) wherein thou didst abuse both our Liberty and thy own, in not having the Patience, till we had done with thy Brother: and then we might have Answered thee, if thou hadst appeared, and demanded it. For what need we a Letter from a Man, that was there present, that had Opportunity to speak? And as for True Liberty infringed, and Insulting Spirit of the Quakers, Truly, thou and thy Brother might have kept this at home; who went about not only to Insult over us, but with his false Posi∣tions and Charges to put us in his Bear-Skin, that the Dogs of New-England might have worried us. Rob. W. And because thou say'st, Your Indecorum Behaviours both in words and gestures unto your Elder fellow-Servant and Aged Father, complaining, as not performing your Duty, as Young-men according unto Rule of honouring Gray Hairs, &c. saying often, Thou Old Man, thou Old Man, thereby to provoke to passion, (pag. 74.) Answ. Is not Wisdom called Gray Hairs? wherein did we break the Rule? And what was our Indecorum-Behaviours, Words and Gestures? and where did we Not perform our Duty? did we not suffer him patiently, and bear him, till he went quite beside the Matter, and spent Two Days with Two Positions, and did not prove them neither? hearing his long Tales and Stories to no purpose? And pray thee, read thy Brother's Book and see, what Names and Evil Language he giveth us? whether he be a Good Example to Young-men and us? where thy Brother writeth to J. T. (pag. 6.) calling him his Antient, Loving Friend (an Old Man at Providence;) and (pag. 15.) he calleth his Antient, Loving Friend (to wit, J. T.) WHITE DEVIL: and thou art offended at us here, because we call him OLD MAN, thereby appearing to provoke to Passion. And so, if these be not Charges (which
thou would'st not have them to be so) let the Sober judge! which thou wast with Child to bring forth. — But as to our say∣ing OLD MAN to thy Brother, it was not in Dis-respect to his Person, nor to set at Nought his Old-Age (for we have learned better;) but it was a True Title to him, and not Dis-honorable, nor by us given in Derision, though thou and thy Brother take it so; who hath it in his Book, and telleth the World of it, and wrongeth us. — And thou dost Extol His exceeding Great Patience; but wrong'st us in Charging us with seeking to take an Advantage against the Aged, and say'st; Contrary to Covenant, by Three or Four baiting him at once, &c. This is another false Charge: but let the Vnprejudic'd then there judge! — And as for Charging thy Brother with Blasphemy, and for him to prove it; Let the Ingenuous Reader but read over his Book and see, whether he hath not manifest a Great Deal more of Blasphemy and not proved that, which we Charged him withal, nor his own Charge. R. W. Whereas thou say'st; It is acknowledged by Auditors, that as the Complainant brought substantial Proof (so far as he pro∣ceeded) so you the Defendants also brought substantial Defence, &c. but (thou say'st) who shall judge? you will not suffer the Gos∣pel-Rule, that the Standers-by the Spirits of the Prophets shall Judge, &c. Answ. This is not True, and a False Charge, though thou would'st not have us take it so: for we did refer over and over (the Peo∣ple knoweth) the matter to the Judgement of the People there,And is it not a Contradiction, that thou say'st; The Com∣plainant brought sub∣stantial Proof (so far as he proceeded) and that the Defen∣dants also brough substantial Defence, (in what was sub∣stantial?) that were the Standers-by to Judge, Whether he had proved his false Charges? And many more Charges there are, which thou would'st not have us to take as Charges, in thy Paper, which indeed is not Worthy to be taken Notice of: but let the Vn-prejudic'd people in Rode-Island, that was there, Judge, whether thou hast not wronged us! And did not a stranger speak aloud there, and said; I am no Quaker; yet I see, that Mr. Williams hath rather proved against himself, and not for himself? R. W. And doth not R. W. say; The Spirits of Just Men made Perfect (the Quakers say,p. 76. Here; and we say, In the Life to come?)
Answ. And doth not the Apostle say (to the Heb.) YE ARE COME to the Spirits of Just Men? and was it not HERE, while they were upon the Earth? And Isa. 11. 1 Thes. 2. Rom. 8. and Act. 8, 19.10.14.16. what are all these Scriptures? who denieth them? And Gal. 5. Joh. 3. what's all this to the Pur∣pose? for here thou goest on in way of Preaching: And all these Scriptures do not prove thy false Chorge. For thou say'st; R. W. The Holy Spirit of God was given forth by Means; but the Qua¦kers pretend in G. F.'s Book and other Books, That their Spi∣rit was without Means.p. 77. And thou bringest, The Lord open'd Lydia's heart, &c. and Christ's Breathing upon his Apostles, &c. Answ. Did not the Apostles receive the Holy Ghost by his Breath? and what! was that Mediate? and were not the Apostles Able Ministers of the Spirit? and was that Mediate? And that, which Open'd Lydia's Heart, was that Mediate? And did not Peter Preach Christ Jesus and his Light; and the Holy Ghost fell upon them? and was not the Light of Christ within them, that recei∣ved it? And was that Mediate or Immediate, that bid Cornelius send to Joppa? And what was that, when the Apostle (which was a Minister of the Spirit) was Preaching Christ Jesus? was it not something within them, that answered to the Apostle's Preach∣ing, (that pricked the Heart) that made them cry out, What they should do? was not this the Light Within, that lets them see, that they had Done Evil? according to the Apostle's words, What∣soever doth reprove and make manifest, is Light: and if they turn at the Reproof, this is Repentance? And what was that, that Saul Kikt against, when he was a Professor (like R. W. and the New-England-Priests and Professors) and Persecuted God's people? and is not R. W. and all his New-England Persecuting Priests and Professors kicking against it now? and therefore they will not receive Christ Jesus. But we never denied the Means of the Spi∣rit of God to work withal; but your Means, which are without the Immediate Spirit of God, and the Light of Christ Jesus, which thou Blasphemously callest an Idol. And goest about to prove, that the Spirit of Christ is not the Spirit of Christ, which Leadeth us, and Mortisieth us, and Circumciseth; in which we Worship the Living God, as Christ commandeth: and this Spirit thou goest about to prove a False Spirit; which will prove thy own Destruction, if thou repentest not. And so our Assertions
are no Contradictions to the Spirit of God; they are thy own. R. W. And thou bringst (pag. 6. in G. F.'s folio) Samuel Ea∣ton's Saying [The Prophets and Apostles drew people to an Out∣ward Word.] G. F.'s Answ. [Now, is that which Li∣veth and Endureth for Ever,p. 78. Outward? Did they not bring them to Christ and the Power of God, which is the End of Words, which is Immediate?] — And in the same page Samuel Eaton [Is not the Gospel an External Way?] G. F. Answ. [No: The Gospel is a Living Way, which is re∣vealed within; and is the Power of God to Salvation. —And in the same page: S. E. [Are not these seduced, who are drawn off from the External Means, by which the Spirit is given, and Faith wrought to wait for the Receiving of the Spirit without any Word to convey it to them? [he means, External] which Spirit when they have, it is not the Spirit of Truth, but of Delusion.] G. F. Answ. [The Spirit and Faith is not conveighed to any Man without the Word (to wit, Christ) and they are seduced, which rest in the External, from the Eternal. And the Spirit is not given by External Means; it is God and Christ, that giveth it: Neither is Faith wrought by External Means.] R. W. Replieth: I Ob∣serve, how the Wisdom of men is Enmity against God, and how witty this Fox is, to catch himself and others in the Traps of Eter∣nal Howling: how doth he here confound the Audible Words or Preachings of God's Mercy in Christ Jesus with the Inaudible, In∣visible, Mystical and Metaphorical Word Christ Jesus himself. 2ly Who sees not his gross and impudent Denying of the Spirit, and Faith to be conveighed by Means from God unto us? Answ. Let the Reader see R. W.'s Reply here, if there be any thing in it to prove, That we have not the Spirit; and, That the Spirit, by which we are acted, is not the Spirit of God? And what must we infer from R. W.'s words here, and S. Eaton,R. W.'s Third False Charge. the Priest? That the Spirit is given by External Means? and, That the Faith is wrought by External Means? and The Gospel, the Power of God, is an External Way? and That the Apostle directed peo∣ple to an Outward Word, and not to God & Christ the Eternal Word, the Word that liveth, and abideth and endureth for ever? but then how is God the Giver of the Spirit? and how is Christ the Au∣thor and Finisher of their Faith? And how is the Gospel (the Pow∣er of God, which was Revealed to the Apostles) an External Way?
and doth any know the Gospel, the Power of God, but by Reve∣lation? And was it not the Wisdom of Man, which was Enmity against God, that with-stood the Preaching of the Revealed Faith and Gospel, and called it foolishness then, and now? And as for Traps and Eternal Howling, Gross Impudency, &c. R. W. might have applied and kept at home. R. W. Bringeth Enoch Howet, (G. F. Fol. 15) saying: [There is nothing in Man to be Ministred unto, but Man.] G. F. Answ. [How then Ministred the Apostles to the Spirit, or sowed as to that? and Christ Spake to the Spirits in prison. And Timo∣thy was to stir up the Gift, that was in him: and, the Spi∣rit of the Father speaketh within them; and the Light, that shineth in the heart, and giveth Knowledge, &c. And, The Son of God is Revealed in me, saith the Apostle, Here the Scriptures are for Correction of thee, and Reproof of thee, who say'st, There is nothing to speak to in Man, but Man — When the Apostle saith, That which may be known of God, is manifest in Man, for God hath shewn it to them, (Rom. 1.) And the Apostle was manifest to Every Man's Conscience in the sight of God: and that was of God, which the Children disobeyed.] And R. W. replieth, saying: I was forc'd to omit the Allegations out of G. F.'s Book then by me and ready: [And why so, R. W? Why could'st not thou have let the people heard them and judged them?] And again he replieth: As in his late Book Exalting his Heathen-Light above the Scriptures (and say'st) he simply and profanely joins the Philistian Priests and Egyptian Conjurers with Holy Job and his Friends,pag. 79. &c. so here he confounds and jumbles together the Natural Powers and Facul∣ties, and Humane Light in all Man-Kind with the Grace of God, &c. Answ. These Charges are all false; and G. F'.s Book will clear it self: for his Book proveth, That Men have the Light, that have not the Scripture; and that some reject the Spirit of God and his Light, which have the Scripture. And it is plain, that Job had the Light and Spirit of God. that had not the Scripture: and so it was G. F'.s Proof, That Men may have the Spirit of God, which have not the Scripture. And the Priests would make us believe, That the Light, Faith and Spirit of God come from the Scripture and External Means; but Christ the Light (who enlightneth eve∣ry Man, that cometh into the World, which is called the Life in the Word, Joh. 1.) thou and the New-England-Priests and Pro∣fessors
have not proved this a Humane Light: and so, it's thou, that hast Jumbled all together here, Conjurers, Philistians, &c. and not G. F. And as for Simply and Profanely Jumbling, thou may'st keep it to thy self. R. W. saith; His Scope is (Abominably and Horribly!) to make the Holy Spirit of God capable of being Preach'd unto, to be Con∣verted and Turned unto God, yea, to Refuse and be Damn'd; for it is not Man (he saith) that is Preached unto. Answ. Let the Reader see, if G. F. saith so, That it is not a Man, that is Preached unto. And as for thy Abominably and Horribly, thou may'st keep to thy self: for G. F. doth not say, The Spi∣rit of God must be Converted and Turned to God, or else Refuse and be Damn'd; These are thy own Abominable Words: but, The Ministers of the Spirit Sow to the Spirit, &c. and, The Spirit was in Man, which Men and Women must take heed unto. And do not the Prophets and Apostles tell People, how they have Erred from the Spirit, and Quench'd and Vex'd it, and Griev'd it and Rebell'd against it, and Resisted the Holy Ghost? (read Nehem. 9. Act. 7.) and they that Rebel against it and Quench it, and Vex and Re∣sist the Spirit of God, they go from God, from that, that would Convert them then, into Damnation, and not the Spirit of God, as thou Blasphemously say'st. And so, it is the Spirit of God, that Con∣verteth Man, them that walk in it: and R. W. this is thy Sottish Paraphrazing of G. F.'s Words. R. W. saith; How Sottish and Blind doth this Deceiver proclaim himself in the Christian Doctrines of Preaching, Conversion, Faith, and the Grace and Spirit of God, confounding Gold and Dross, Pearls and Pebbles, Harps and Harrows (as all one) together. Answ. R. W. This is thy own Sottish and Blind Condition, that callest the Light of Christ (which lighteth every Man, that cometh into the World) an Idol: and how canst thou See without it, but art Blinded altogether? And let the Reader read G. F.'s Answer and R. W.'s Reply, and see, if there be any such thing (as he Blindly asserteth here) in his Words, that G. F. proclaim∣eth, as R. W. saith? for none of us can Preach the Doctrine of Christ, Conversion, Faith, Grace and Spirit truly without the Light, that shineth in the Heart, and giveth the Knowledge of them. R. W. He bringeth (G. F.'s Fol. p. 136, 137.) Thomas Moor saying; [Nor are we to wait for a further Revelation to us to be
given forth, than the Scriptures: for the Word of God came not first Immediately to the Gentiles, but to the Apostles.] G. F. Answ. The Apostles, that Preached the Word of God, it was Immediate, to whom-so-ever they Preach'd it; for they Received it Imme∣diately:[and R. W. putteth, READ it Immediately, and cri∣eth, Non-sense:] for the Word it self is Immediate; for it is the Savour of Death to Death, and of Life to Life. And none know∣eth the Scriptures, but by the Spirit, that doth Reveal them: so all that witness the Spirit of God, witness Revelation, and the Re∣vealing of the Scriptures to them by it, and the things of God laid up for them, that love God; which the Eye hath not seen: but the Eyes may see the Scriptures outwardly. And, None knoweth the Son of God, but the Father, neither knoweth any Man the Father, but the Son, and He, to whom the Son Revealeth him: And so People may have the Scriptures, but not the Reve∣lation of the Son of God by them. For the Pharisees had the Scriptures, but not the Holy Thing they testified of [to wit, CHRIST) who hated the Light, like R. W.] Most of this R. W. hath left out; and endeavoureth (but to no purpose) to prove, That We have not the Spirit of God: But the Reader may see, how we are maintaining of it against him and the Priests, that de∣ny it in God's People. And it is the Work of R. W. instead of Proving, That we have not the Spirit of God, To oppose it in his People. — But R. W. saith in his Reply; As if all, that Re∣ceive G. F. his Book simply pretended to be from the Spirit of God▪ Received it without G. F. his Brain, and Hand and Pen or Paper▪ &c. Or, because a King delivers his Mind to his Secretary, and commands him to pen it in a Proclamation, &c. therefore the King' Word or Will comes to every Man immediately without any such Means, as the Secretary's Composing, his Clark's Transcribing, the Vse of Printing, Letters, &c. to talk after this sort, what is it, but to talk Frantick and Bedlam, and without the Guidance of a Com∣mon, Rational Spirit. Answ This R. W. bringeth to prove, That We have not  Spirit of God: which is quite Contrary. For he knoweth himself (and the New-England Priests, as Dark as they are) That the King's Declaration or Proclamation (which his Secretaries writ and send to all his Subjects) Natural Men may understand; b the Proclamation or Declaration of God and Christ Natural Me cannot perceive, but by the Spirit of God. For the Apostle telle
them, They do not know him: and the Pharisees, and such as Cru∣cified him, it is said, They did not know him, the LORD of LIFE, which hath Sent out his Declarations by his Apostles. Yea, many of the Apostles could not understand some of his Declarations in their Young Dayes, till Christ opened their Vnderstandings: and they, that did Receive, what Christ declared, Received Him. — And as for thy Scoffs, that say'st; G. F.'s Book received without his Brains, &c. this is thy own Frantick Bedlam-Stuff; thou may'st keep it at Home. R. W. Bringeth Sam. Eaton (from G. F.'s Fol. p. 5.) saying; [Though all the Saints have the Spirit of Christ dwelling in them, which is Eternal and Infallible;p. 80. yet that this Spirit should do all, which Saints do, and should say all, that Saints say, and should judge for them both Persons and Things after an Infallible Manner; and that they should neither Say nor Do any thing by any Vnderstan∣ding of their own, but the Spirit, All this we deny.] G. F. Answ. [Which is Contrary to the Apostle, who saith; As many as are the Sons of God, are led by the Spirit of God. And Christ saith; That he Acteth all in them and for them, who saith; Without me ye can DO NOTHING: and, The Fruits of the Spirit, &c. and, The Spiritual Man judgeth all things. And that is it, which leadeth the Saints to divide and discern all things both Tempo∣ral and Spiritual: the Spiritual Wisdom of God, which giveth them Spiritual Vnderstanding, which Men must Rule withal; but not with their own, which cometh to nought. And ye, which have not that, which is Infallible to Judge in you, know not the Spirit of Christ; neither can ye Judge of Persons or Things, that have not the Infallible Judgement, nor have the Spiritual Man (to wit, Infallibly.) Neither have ye the Word of God in your Hearts, nor Christ, which is Eternal and Infallible: All which the Quakers have to Judge Persons and Things.] But R. W. hath let out many of the Priest's Words; as followeth. He saith; [That which is within them, is not Eternal or Infallible.] When the Quakers asked him, Whether it was so or no? he said; [Nay, that which Judgeth in them, is not Eternal and Infallible: (and) They Assrt no such thing as that, concerning Themselves.] So let the Reader see, how this Priest Contradicteth himself. And fur∣ther this Priest saith; [There is an Immediate Voice, which we ne∣ver heard; which is Within:] this R. W. leaveth out. And he saith; [The Gospel is the Letter:] this he leaveth out, (Fol.
p. 4.) The Priest saith; [Though we believe, that the Spirit of Christ dwells in the Saints; yet we assert, That the Spirit of Christ be distinct from the Saints (Fol. p. 1.) These Contradictions R. W. never medleth withal. And S. E. saith; [Such a Voice, which cometh Immediately from Heaven, we have not Heard: and such an Inspiration, as this from God, we have not Received, nor do we wait for it, Fol. p. 3.] Now, how can these Men have the Spirit of God then, which R. W. striveth to maintain their Do∣ctrine against G. F? and instead of proving, That We have not the Spirit of God, he proveth himself and his Priests without it, that he seeketh to Defend. — But R. W. Replieth, and begin∣neth with Railings: Mahomet, &c. and runs on and saith; These Foolish and Filthy Dreamers, &c. [And are these the Fruits from the Spirit of God?] and tells us a great Story, Preaching upon what Mahomet saith, and of Masters of Ships and Navigation, and Families, and Princes and Governours, &c. Answ. What is all this to the Spiritual Man, that Judgeth all Things? and to prove, That We have not the Spirit of God? And the Saints are led by the Spirit of God to Divide and Discern all things about both Temporal and Spiritual: and the Spiritual Wisdom of God, which giveth them an Vnderstanding, which Men must Rule withal, that be in it; Doth G. F. therefore say, That Natural Men do nothing with those Spirits? And because Natural Men do something with these Spirits, must therefore the Spiritual Man, that Judgeth all things, be denied the Immediate and Infallible Spirit of God to Judge of Persons and Things? For, was not the World made by the Word and Wisdom of God, yea, all the Natural Things or Temporal? and I ask R. W. and his New-England-priests, Whether they can know them without the Wisdom of God? or Judge truly of their own Persons both Before the Fall, and In the Fall, and in the Restoration After the Fall without the Infallible Spirit of God? And doth not Christ make All things New? R. W. And whereas thou speakest of the Meanest Youth or Wench of the Quakers, if but a pretended Quaker, what-soever they say or do, is by an Infallible, Eternal Spirit, &c. but how horribly their Spirits,p. 81. &c. Miscarriages (in many Sin∣ful Practices) and Apostacies, &c. and so going on a∣railing. Answ. These Fruits shew some of thy bad Spirit. Doth G. F.
speak of Lads and Lasses, that run into Miscarriages, and Sinful Practices and Apostacies, to favour those their Ill Actions with the Infallible, Eternal Spirit of God? Nay, this is thy own Lie R. W. thou may'st take it thy self; for all such Evil, Sinful Acti∣ons both in our selves and others we deny, as being erred from the Spirit of God: the Spiritual Man Judgeth all such things. And did not John Stubs say well; Ye have an Unction, and need not, that any Man teach you; ye KNOW ALL THINGS? R. W. And then R. W. replieth, and telleth of a Leading of a Beast by a Halter, and the Leading of Man with Reason. Answ. But what is this to the Leading by the Spirit of God and Vnction? that is beyond thy Dark Reason, and Judgement and Doting Spirit. And with thy dark Reason thou can'st not Judge of false Prophets and Seducers, but receive them: it's the Spirit of God and the Anointing, that must Judge of such things. And what's all thy Preaching good for? R. W. [Now he can not prove, That we have not the Spirit of God, he falleth of asking Questions, and saith] Whether this Lead∣ing, or Anointing or Teaching of the Spirit be by means of Pray∣ing, Preaching, Reading, &c. Answ. The Spirit is the Means of the true Prayer and true Preach∣ing, and opens to Man, what he Readeth: as the Spirit of God opened the Scriptures to the Eunuch through Philip. And the Apo∣stle saith, The Spirit helpeth our Infirmities. R. W. And thou say'st; If Motions without the use of these be pretended, Reason tells us, that a Rational Soul must be able to Try, whether the Spirit pretending be true or a lying Spirit? and that it must have some Rule or Touch-stone, &c. Thou further say'st, That the Rule must be thy own Reason, or some Testimony of Vnquestionable Witnesses satisfying my Reason; or some Hea∣venly-Inspired Scripture or Writing, which my Reason tells me, came from God. Reason also tells each Rational Creature, that it is very Suspicious to be a false, lying and Devilish Motion, which slights the Holy Scripture, &c. Answ. Here thou hast made thy Reason both Rule and Judge to judge both Rule and Touch-stone, and to Try them: and hast not thou said, The Scripture was the Rule and Touch-stone? — And dost thou not Admire the Devil for his great Wit and Rea∣son? (Append. p. 108.) and was that Reason in the Devil, that tempted Christ to Worship him and to Destroy himself, or Un∣reasonable
(seeing thou Admirest the Devil's great Reason, and say'st, Reason must be Judge; and makest no Distinction betwixt thine and the Devil's?) And had not the Pharisees and Chief-Priests so much Reason as thou, and yet judged Christ to be Beel zebub, and said, By the Prince of Devils he casts out Devils? And the Apostle telleth thee, That the Natural Man doth not perceive the things of God: And had not Pilate so much Reason, as thou (think'st thou) who asked Christ, Wha was Truth? And if the Holy Scripture was the Means, the Rule and Judge to try Motions, then Abel, Ench, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Moses had none. Now, an Heavenly-Inspired Scripture (which thou speakest of) that is by the Spirit, by which they are known again; and not by the dark Spirit and Reason (for No Man knoweth the Things of God, but by the Spirit of God,) which Reason thou here settest above both the Spirit that Inspireth, and the Scripture Inspired or given forth by it: and so hast made the Reason the Chief Judge; which the Apostle did not, but the Spirit. R. W. Thou say'st: It is best to take James's Counsel; If any Man want Wisdom, let him ask of God, &c. If so, then Reason tells us, that except we suffer our selves to be led s Beasts by Satan as the poor Quakers are) we must come to the Vse of Means,p. 82. or a Mediate Leading and Teaching: and then what's become of these Hellish Fancies of only Immediate Teach∣ings and Inspirations. Answ. This is R. W.'s Proof to prove, That we have not the Spirit of God. And R. W. calleth the Immediate Teachings and Inspirations (of God) Hellish Fancies: Now, would not he have dotingly said this to the Apostles, had he been in their Dayes? — And so, what must we understand from R. W.'s words? He and his New-England-Priests must come to REASON, and a Mediate Leading and Teaching, &c. and to Mediate Means: So, it must not be the Inspiration and the Immediate Spirit of God, the Holy Ghost, to Lead into all Truth. So, his Leading is Me∣diate, his Means are Mediate, and his Teaching is Mediate, and not Immediate; and yet he must Ask Counsel and Wisdom (as James did) from God, and yet it must not be Immediate and In∣spired into him, but Mediate. — And if Evil Spirits have such a Great Reason (as R. W. saith, Append. p. 108.) and he Admireth them so; and Reason telleth R. W. that except we suf∣fer our selves to be led as Beasts by Satan, &c. and yet, Evil Spirits
have great Reason: and let the Reader see, what Distinction thou hast made between Satan's Reason, and thy own and the New-England-Priests, and who is thy Leader? — And as for the Poor Quakers, the Light and Spirit of God, which proceedeth from the Father and Son, is their Comforter, and will lead them into all Truth. And so Hellish Facy thou may'st apply at home, who fightest against God's Immediate Teaching and Inspiration. And what dost thou talk of the Spirit of Wisdom or Knowledge; and talkest of Reason, that must be Judge? (Isa. 11. Luk. 11.) And as for Dreamers, thou may'st keep to thy self. And R. W. I must tell thee, None know the Scriptures and the Mysteries of Christ by their own Spirits, nor their dark Reason, but by the Spirit of God. R. W. And thou say'st; The Scripture in John [Ye know all things] we expounded Literally, &c. and say'st; Then why are not the Quakers Omnipotent and Almighty, as well as Omniscient or knowing all things? Answ. Why doth R. W. take James's words Literally, and not John's? As for Omnipotent and Almighty, and Omniscient or know∣ing all things as God, the Quakers hold no such thing, and there is no such saying in G. F's Answer. Yet the Saints know all things concerning their Salvation and Election, and concerning the Devil and his Angels, that will deceive them: and they knew knew all things so, that no man needed to teach them; and they knew God and Christ: and J. Stubs's words will stand. And did we speak no more to thee, but the four Lines thou settest in page 83? Why could'st not thou put down our Words?pag. 83. And why canst thou not take John's words Literally, as thou ta∣kest James's, who saith: The Light, which Lighteth every Man, that cometh into the World; which is Life in the Word, &c. which Light thou Blasphemously callest an Idol? R. W. And thou say'st; I desire to know, what is meant by the Word WITHIN? Answ. That which Paul preached (Rom. 0.) which is as a Fire, and hammereth down Sin and Evil, sharper then a Two-edged Sword; which was the Word of Faith, which he preached▪ and we. And thou comest to learn of us, What is meant by the Word Within? It openeth the Vnderstanding; it openeth the Eye of the Soul, and changeth the Affections, where it is loed and done, as James telleth thee: but if thou be a Sayer of the Word, and Dost
it not, thou deceivest thy own Soul. And how now R. W! is this thy Proving, That we have not the Spirit of God, To come and learn of us, What is the Word of God within? this is quite be∣side the Matter: and well might W. Edmundson call thee back a∣gain, when thou wast Rambling on beside the Matter. R. W. Now thou say'st, It is said, that God hath shined in our hearts. Answ. But thou dost not speak, as the Apostle doth, who saith; God, who commanded the Light to shine out of Darkness, hath shined in our hearts to give the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Christ Jesus (2 Cor. 4, 6.) Now, what must we understand from R. W.'s meanes or meanings here from the Scripture? That God shineth in the Heart to give the Knowledge of God? if we had said so, would not he have cried out, Blasphe∣my? and God commanded God to shine out of Darkness? O! R. W. take heed of such dark means! R. W. And then thou contradictest thy self, and say'st, — The Seat of the Light and Knowledge of God, &c. Further thou say'st; Though Fox makes it (the Light) to be Natural, and born with every Man, &c. and goest on a-railing, callest it Their Natural Hellish Darkness: and upon this thou makest false Conclusions up∣on thy own Invented Words (which G. F. hath not spok∣en.) Answ. Let the Reader see, if G. F. any where hath made the Heavenly Light of Christ Natural? &c. John, the greatest Pro∣phet born of a Woman maketh not the Light Natural, that came for a Witness to be a Witness of the true Life in the Word, which was the Light, that Lighteth every Man, that cometh into the World. For R. W. may read such as he is, of the same Spirit, saying, John hath the Devil: and such were not like to own the Light (no more then R. W.) which he bore Witness of. R. W. Thou say'st, That to hearken to, to turn to, to lissen to any Voice or Motion within in Heavenly things in matters of Super-natural Light is as proper, as in matters of Law to go for Counsel to a Cheating Thief or Rogue, in matters of Health to a known,pag. 84. Cheating Mountebank, as to turn within to a Man's Heart, which is the Arrantest Jugler and Chea∣ter in the World. Answ. Why how now Roger! hast thou not fulfilled W.
Edm.'s Words here, who said, Thou wast a Blasphemer? And is this the Proof to prove, That we have not Spirit of God? and is R. W.'s heart such a Juggler and Cheat, as he compareth to the Thieves, Rogues and Mountebanks? But come R. W. Though Men's hearts are wicked (as Gen. 6. &c. and dark & deceitful (as in Jer.) and (thou say'st) as God is Light and no Darkness, so in them is Darkness, & no Light: so that to hearken to any Voice, or to Lissen to any Voice or Motion within in Heavenly things and matters of Super-natural Light is, as thou said'st before, &c. But let us Consider; Is there no Light in R. W? nor in his New-England-Priests? nor no Voice nor Motion in him or them in Heavenly things, in Matters of Super-natural Light? then how can he judge us, That we are not in the Spirit of God, and that our Spirit is not the Spirit of God, whereas he hath no Savour of it? and how can'st thou otherwise, but call the Light of Christ a Fancy and an Idol, when thou hast no Voice or Motion within in the Heavenly things in Matters of Super-natural Light? But we tell R. W. that Christ hath Enlight∣ned him, though his Darkness cannot comprehend it: and Christ hath poured out his Spirit upon all Flesh, though he quencheth it and grieveth it; though he saith, There is no Motion in him, and so of others as he falsly judgeth. And did not the Holy Men speak forth the Scriptures, as they were Moved by the Holy Ghost, and was not that within them? and did not the Light shine in the hearts of the Corinthians, to give them Knowledge, &c. and was not that Within them? And so, thou hast proved thy Spirit to be Satan's, and not the Holy Spirit of God, which we are led by. And as for Jugglers, and Cheaters and Mountebank (thou speak∣est three times over in this page) thou might'st have kept at home, R. W. And dost not thou Contradict thy self, and say'st, That God hath shined in our Hearts; and no Voice nor Motion there (R. W.) to hearken or lissen to? and yet God shineth there to give Knowledge? &c. R. W. Thou bringest Isa. 59; That we own: but what is this to prove, That we have not the Spirit of God, that proveth, That the Word and Spirit of Christ should be in the Mouth of his Seed,p. 85. and in the Mouth of his Seeds Seed, which we are? that proveth not, that we have not the Spirit of God; who are true Believers, and call upon the Name of the Lord. — And R. W. Thou further say'st, That G. F. should not say, that the
Word and the Spirit are all One (as Commonly he saith) and, The Father and Son are One, &c. Answ. For Christ saith (Joh. 16, 30.) I and my Father are One. Then the Jews took up stones to stone Him for Blasphemy: and is not R. W. and the New-England-Priests ready to stone us for holding forth Christ's Doctrine? manifesting, that he hath not the Spirit of Christ, which is offended at us, that we say, Christ and his Father are One. We do not say, The Word, that liveth, and abideth and endureth for Ever, is the Scriptures; though the Word owneth the Scriptures, which gave them forth in the Holy Men of God. And Christ saith himself, I and my Father are One: He doth not say, I and my Father are Two and Di∣stinct, R. W. For thou say'st, That we join not the Word and Holy Spirit together; but tread upon the Word under a Cloak of Ad∣vancing the Spirit. Answ. The Word is called the Sword of the Spirit; and how can they be divided? we do not divide them. And the Word of God cannot be Trodden under Foot under a Cloak of Advancing his Spirit; for the Word of God is as a Hammer, and a Fire and a Sword: and thou and the New-England-Priests may as well Tread upon a Fire and a Sword, as Tread upon the Word of God; though thou and you may Tread upon the Scriptures. And there∣fore thou hast manifest thy Ignorance and Dotishness of the Word of God and his Spirit, and knowest not it, nor ours: neither art thou like to try ours, that hast no Motion in thee of Heavenly Things. R. W, And thou Instancest, that we have not the Spirit of God, from our Reviling, &c. Answ. By the same Argument thou hast proved thy self, that thou hast not the Spirit of God. But thou must not call Truth's Speaking Reviling: for when thou speakest Lies, we tell thee, who is the Father of them. We tell thee, when thou callest the Light of Christ Frantick Fancy and an Idol, we tell thee, it is Darkness in thee; that is no Reviling: as Christ to the Pharisees said, They were Blind; and cried Wo against them. Nor the A∣postle did not Rail against Elimas and Simon Magus. And as for Monks and Friars, and Oister Women thou might'st have kept at home. — And as for Priest Wiggan, the Woman's Words were true upon him; whom God suddenly Cut off by an Eminent
Hand. And our Going Naked, and the Lord, who hath moved some to Go Naked (a Figure of your Nakedness) as he did Isaiah, this doth not prove, That we have not the Spirit of God: which hath been fulfilled upon the Priests and Magistrates in England; and hath been fulfilled upon you in a Measure, and will be more. R. W. And to prove our Spirit not to be the Spirit of God, he Chargeth us with Irrationality and Vnruliness, which is Con∣trary to the Wisdom, Rationality, and Order and Holiness of the Spirit of God: this (saith he) is Apparent from their Bitter and Frantick Reviling. Answ. Now, Let all that read his Book, Consider, Whether this Argument, that he hath brought, To prove Our Spirit not to be the Spirit of God, he hath not sufficiently manifested His Spi∣rit not to be the Spirit of God, by the Irrationality and Vnruli∣ness of it in his Apparent, Bitter Reviling, the like scarce to be read of, Exceeding in words the Devilish Inquisitors, Monks and Friars, &c. spattering out Diablo, Diablo, &c. (as he speak∣eth of.) R. W. Thou tellest us of a Dumb Spirit and Dumb Meetings;p. 86. and then (3 lines after) thou Contradictest thy self, and say'st; Their Monstrous Singing and Tu∣ning. &c. Answ. What R. Williams! Dumb Spirits and Dumb Meetings, and Sing too? this proveth thee in a Dotish Contradiction; and not, that we have not the Spirit of God. For we are not like thee, that can'st Speak, when thou wilt; for we Speak or Sing, as the Spirit of the Lord giveth us Utterance. And thou hast No Motion of Heavenly Things in thy Heart, who can'st speak and write, when or what thou wilt, (as pag. 83.) R. W. saith: The Holy Spirit of God is subjecting it self to be tried, commanding all Men to Search the Records, and commending the Bereans for examining Paul's Preaching and Spirit by the Scrip∣tures: &c. and this is the True Maning of — The Spirits of the Prophets are subject to the Prophets, &c. Answ. This doth not prove, that we have not the Spirit of God; but that we have it. For did not we shew these Scriptures, and read them to thee and the people? doth not the people, that was there, know this? And R. W. is a-searching the Scripture's mean∣ing of—The Spirits of the Prophets being Subject to the Prophets:
R. W. giveth no Scripture for this to Search for. And what Scrip∣ture had the Prophets, before Scripture was written, for to Search, by which they might know their Subjection? and therefore he is a false Spirit, according to his own Judgement. For, were not the Spirits of the Prophets Subject to the Prophets, before Scrip∣ture was written? though we own all the Scriptures given forth by the Spirit of the Lord. And if Searching the Scriptures be the Meaning, The Spirits of the Prophets are Subject to the Prophets; Then Anti-Christ, Jews and such, as have a Form of Godliness, and deny the Power, may Search the Scriptures without the Spirit of God. And then that is R. W.'s True Meaning, The Spirits of the Prophets are Subject to the Prophets, when they are in the Spirit, like the Whore and Jezabel, like New-England, that DRINK∣ETH THE PROPHETS BLOOD. — And R. W. saith, Hence it pleaseth God, to give Rules for the Trial and Discerning between the True Spirit and the False,pag. 87. 1 Joh. 3. and 4. Answ. R. W. If thou look into the former Chapter, thou may'st there see, what the Apostle directed the Saints to, upon the Oc∣casion of them, that would seduce them, which he saith, is the ANOINTING, which was within them, by which they were to Know all things: And so, if they were to Know all things by it, they were to Try Spirits by it. Thou Cavilst at G. F.'s words, and say'st, The Quakers, if they knew all things, were Almighty: Prove by Scri∣ptures, that the Almighty God is THINGS, who is the Creator of ALL THINGS, & therefore Incomprehensible. Yet we know, To know God and Jesus Christ, that he hath sent, is Eternal Life; and there is a Difference betwen Being God, and Knowing all things, that he hath made. And the Apostle saith, We are of God; and he that knoweth God, heareth us: and, Hereby know we the Spirit of God, and the Spirit of Error: and, Hereby know we, that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he hath given us of his Spirit. (1 Joh. 4.) R. W. Thou say'st, We dare not come to the Light and Search: and comparest us to a Thief, Gall'd Horse, Debers, Jugglers, &c. Spirits escaping in a Mit and by the help of dark Lanthorns —. and so goest on a-railing. Answ. Now, we can leave this to the Judgement of the peo∣ple in Rode-Island, how often we have called for Scripture! and called for Scripture from thee to prove thy false Assrtions. So
that we were so far from Shunning to be Tried by the Light and Scriptures, as thou hast conest several times in thy Book; though now thou givest thy self the Lie. So the Gall'd Horse-back was thy self, that could not endure the Robbing by the Scripture, nor Christs Light neither. And as for Juggling, and Thief and dark Lanthorn thou migh'st have applied at home; for its thou, that wilt not come to the Light of Christ, that callest it an Idol. And R. W. Thou sayst, Thou hast been often visited by the Qua∣kers, crying, Repent, Repent, Hearken to the Light, &c. and callest it a Cuckow's Note, &c. Answ. What would R. W. have said to Christ and his Apostles, that preach'd Repentance; and did they harden themselves against it, like R. W? and the Apostles turning people from darkness to Light, were they not to Hearken to it? or else what were they to turn them to? and this thou scoffingly callest Cuckow's Note: and this is no Proof, That we have not the Spirit of God. — And thou bringest Muggleton's and Reeve's Cursings; But let R. W. and the Reader and the New-England-Priests read in R. W.'s Book, and Appendix p. 119. and see, if he be not found in Muggleton's Spirit in his Cursings, and worse Blasphemies and false Judgment. R. W. And thou bringest W. Edmundson, who said; The Spirit of God was above the Scriptures; and so not the Trier. Answ. And what must we infer from this? Therefore the Qua∣kers have not the Spirit of God? no Proof. But R. W. What! is the Spirit of God under the Scriptures? is not that above it, that gave them forth, and leadeth into all Truth of them? And R. W. Thou sayst, That W. Edm. said, Men will not come to the Light, left they should be reproved, because their Deeds are evil: (and thou said'st,) This is the true Cause of your quar∣reling against Scriptures, and of exalting the Spirit above them. Answ. This is false: For we do not quarrel against the Scrip∣tures, nor W. Edmundson, who useth Christ's words. And there∣fore ye are a Dark People, ye New-England Professors, that can∣not use Christ's Words, but it must be counted the True Cause of quarreling against Scriptures. — And this is a false Ballance in thee, that thou callest True, that say'st, We set up our own Spirit, yea, the Spirit of Satan to be God, and Christ, and Spirit and all — But R. W. this is thy own Spirit, and the New-Eng∣land priests, that will not hear, nor come to the Light of Chrst, lest it should reprove you: for if thou did'st thou would'st trem∣ble
to speak these words. For we have known the Reproofs of the Light, which giveth the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Christ Jesus: And we do not set up our own Spirits above the Scriptures. R. W. Thy Fourth false Charge is, That the people called Qua∣kers do not own the Holy Scriptures —And then thou tell'st a great Story of a Two-fold Owning the Scriptures,pag. 88. &c. and say'st, The Jews and Papists did not more disown the Scriptures upon the Account of the Pope's Traditions and Interpretations, than the Quakers did upon the Ac∣count of their Light,pag. 89. and Spirit and Interpretations al∣so▪ And thou say'st, 'Tis true, the Quakers in the Dis∣pute professed to be tried by the Scriptures; which the First Quakers among us wholly denied, but only by the Spirit with∣in. Answ. As for all his Stories of the Jews and Papists they may answer for themselves. But what are the Quakers Interpretations of their Light and of the Scriptures? why hast thou not set them down? dost thou find Fault with us, because we take them Li∣terally? (as in pag. 88.89) hast thou so soon forgot thy self, and tell'st us of Interpretations? And we own the Scriptures Truly and Really in our hearts with the Spirit of God, that gave them forth: but we will prove, that R. W. and the New-England Professors do not Really own the Scriptures, and that they are not in the Spirit of God, that gave them forth; thy Vnsavoury Words, and calling Christ's Light a Fancy and an Idol, and would'st have the Magistrates to punish us; and the Magistrates and Priests in New-England their Persecutions instead of Loving Enemies, & doing unto all Men, as they would have them to do unto them, have declared it. So 'tis plainly pro∣ved, that ye are neither in the Royal Law, nor in the Gospel; nor do not Really own the Scriptures, that do not practise them. Love thy Neighbour, as thy slf: Love one another, Love Enemies, Are the Com∣mands of Christ; but thou callest the Lord Christ Jesus his Light a Fancy and an Idol: and therefore thou art not, nor canst not be in his Spirit, that callest his Light an Idol; and so None of his, but a Ravening Woolf.—And we always did own the Scriptures, and have said, We and the Priests would be tried by the Scrip∣tures; and to see, which was in the Practice of Christ and his Apostles by the Fruits. And so we are Faithful Witnesses for Christ and his Light, as John was; for we are Come for Wit∣nesses,
and do bear a True Witness for Christ and his Light, which enlighteth every Man, that cometh in the World; which is the Light of the World.—And the Occasion, that we must speak this over and over, is, because thou bring'st it so often. R. W. And thou tell'st us of an Irish Papist, that flung the Bible in the Kennel, and kickt it, saying, The Plague take this Book. [And what's this to us? is it not a shame to print such Fruits of a Wicked Spirit over and over? which we abhor.] And thou say'st, That John Burnyeat took a Bible, and rad publickly, Luke 1. How the Scripture was a Declaration: and yet thou say'st (and Contradictest thy self,) that we would not endure the searching of the Scripture (as pag. 78. See his Margent.) And thou goest on to no Purpose,pag. 90. and say'st, Still they sied to this Borrow, The Spirit, that gave forth Scripture, is greater than the Scripture. Answ. Why R. W. and the New-England-Priests! is not the Spirit above the Scripture? Cannot the Devil get Scripture, and the Wolves and Anti-Christ, but can they get the Spirit of God? would ye have the Spirit less than the Scriptures, which was be∣fore they were written, and gave them forth? R. W. thou say'st, Thou maintainest the Inward Breathing of the Holy Spirit more than we. Answ. But where is it R. W? dost not thou say (pag. 83.) There is no Voice or Motion within Man, that is to be hearken'd unto, turn'd to or lissen'd to in Heavenly and Supernatural Light? — And R. W. Thou say'st, We ought in all our Preaching, Hearing and Reading, &c. beg the Help of the Spirit, &c. Answ. But R. W. Are ye to Preach and Pray of Heavenly Things without the Spirit of God or a Motion in you? and can a Man Hear or Read the Scriptures with understanding without the Spirit of God? which we affirm, They cannot truly. And if the Spirit of God, then must be a Motion within hearken'd to: and so R. W. overthroweth his own Assertion, and proveth him∣self a Doter. — Then R. W. Telleth a Story of Babilonian, Assyrian and Popish Ty∣rants, Devils, &c. Answ. What are all these (he might have kept them at home) to prove, The Quakers do not own Scriptures? R. W. And thou say'st, This Record is the Outward and Exter∣nal Light, Lanthorn, Judge, and Guide and Rule, &c.
Answ. Now, but can an External Rule, and Judge, and Guide guide the Eternal Spirit of God? doth not the Spirit of God Lead into all Truth of it? But R. W. that seemest to own the Scriptures, and ye New England-Priests, where is it written, that the Scriptures are called an External Judge and Guide? let us see Chap∣ter and Verse for it: do not tell us of a Gall'd-back-Horse; but give us Chapter and Verse, and abide the Search. But are not ye New-England-Priests and Professors gone beside this External Judge, Rule and Guide, so that ye neither walk according to the Light of the External Guide (as thou callest it) the Scriptures, nor ac∣cording to the Light of Christ? for the Light of Christ thou call'st a Fancy and an Idol. And thou art made to confess, That God and Christ were before Scripture: and then why wouldst thou set the Scriptures above his Spirit? And then thou tell'st us in a Way of Preaching of John Baptist,p. 91. what he said of Christ; All this we own, and the Scriptures that speak of him: but how can'st thou own the Scriptures, and not John's Tstimony, who came for a Witness to bear Witness of the true Light? And we also can say, God sent us amongst you. R. W. And thou tell'st us of Prating of the Light (and say'st) If they slight the Outward, Standing Record and Witnesses of God in them, there is no Light in them. Answ. That is thy own Condition, thou slightest both Scriptures and Light, which John bore Witness to, as the Scriptures te∣stify. R. W. saith telling us of subscribing to the Papists, or else (he saith) ye must study the Scriptures and search the Originals, &c. Answ. R. W. may subscribe to the Papists. How can he search the Scriptures and study the Originals without the Light of Christ? no more than They can see without the Light of Christ; than a Blind-Man can see to read the Writings. And so without the Heavenly Light of Christ thou can'st not Judge of pretending Christs, Prophets, Doctrines, Churches and Spirits, nor see, what is in thy self. R. W. Thou say'st, That the Quakers do affirm, that the Scrip∣ture is within them: and, What is the English of that? but that the Light, which they and every Man in the World hath within them (the Christ, the Spirit, which every one hath) is the Scripture. Answ. Who did ever hear any of the Quakers say, or in G. F.'s
Book here, That Christ, the Light and Spirit in Man was Scri∣pture (to wit, Writings, or Paper and Ink?) Though this we must needs tell R. W. That is Scripture within, when God writeth his Law in the Heart, that is Heavenly Scripture: that is the Table in the Heart, that every true Christian readeth; that is Law there. And every one, that hath the King's Declaration, he hath not the King in his House; so every one, that hath the Scripture, hath not Christ: but he that hath the Word, hath Christ the Scripture declareth of; so that he hath both the Decla∣ration and the Word it self (to wit, Christ in his Heart:) then he hath the Comfort of Scriptures. And we own the Scriptures to be Love-Letters, and can bless the Lord God for them; and have the Comfort of them, though thou may'st say, what thou wilt. R. W. And then thou say'st: The Light, Christ [which enlight∣neth every Man, that cometh into the World] and the Spirit [the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Truth which leadeth into all Truth,p. 92. which proceedeth from the Father and from the Son; which we have received from the Lord Jesus Christ] this Light, this Spirit (thou say'st) thou hast proved Hellish Dark∣ness, the Spirit of Satan, a false, lying Christ. Answ. Thou hast proved thy self a Blasphemer, and thy own false Light, and Spirit and Anti-Christ to be so: and God will Judge thee for these Words! And what dost thou talk of God's Dispensation, when thou blasphemest after this Manner against the Light of Christ, his Spirit and his Son; or talkest of Believing in him (that Individual Person of Christ Jesus) and not in a Fancy within? — Rom. 15. is owned, and John. 20. is own'd: and dost thou ever think to receive Blessedness and Life from Jesus Christ at the Right Hand of God, and can'st not endure to hear talk of him within, and call'st his Light a Fancy and a lying Christ (in the same page) and Hellish Darkness? But we own no other Christ, than him, that was born of the Virgin and conceived by the Holy Ghost; and by the Holy Ghost we call him LORD (which we know, no Man can do, but by the Holy Ghost) And how can'st thou call him LORD, which hast no Voice nor Moti∣on within in Heavenly things in Matters of Super-natural Light? And then thou fallest a-railing; Pharisees, Jesuites, Quakers, A∣theists, &c. but this thou might'st have kept at Home. — And as for the Breath or Wind of the Devil in the Lips of A∣theists, Jews, Ranters, Papists, &c. thou might'st have kept at
Home: for it are not the Quakers, but your selves, that puff and blow with your Evil Breath against Christ Jesus his most Holy Light, which shineth more pretious, than the Sun in the Firma∣ment, and is revealed in our Hearts; that giveth the Knowledge of him, and standeth against all your Black Storms, and Persecu∣tions and Persecutors, and shineth more and more to the Perfect Day: Glory to God for Ever! R. W. And then thou tell'st us a Famous Story in Turkey of a Woman appearing in the Heavens with a Book in her Hand,pag. 93. &c. and the Two Witnesses: Item, the Book in Revelations, and queriest, Whether it be the Book of the Revelations, or the Whole Bible or Scripture? Answ. If we must teach R. W. (who saith, We do not own the Scriptures) we Answer; That neither these Two Witnesses, nor John did eat up the Outward Bible, to wit, Paper and Ink. Nei∣ther did he Eat up the Revelations in Paper and Ink, for it was join'd to the Bible (I believe, History may tell thee) a great while afterwards: for the Book of Revelation was Revelations in him, before he spoke them forth; and then after it was printed. — And as thou bringest Tindal, thou may'st stop thy Mouth for him; for he owneth Christ and his Light which enlightneth every Man, that cometh into the World. And thou tellest us the Story of the Jews, of their Curious Writing the Old Testament; And all this is nothing to prove R. W.'s Saying, We disown the Scrip∣tures: and he is confounded in this over and over. For he saith, J. B. shewed him Scriptures, and called unto thee for Scrip∣tures: and pray thee R. W. how many Scriptures did'st thou show to us, when we were in the Dispute, to prove thy false Charges against us? but told'st us Several Stories, as thou dost now. R. W. Thou tell'st us of the First Protestants Affection to the Scriptures;p. 94. and then rail'st and say'st, The Pa∣pists and Quakers slighting the Scriptures. — [R. W. might have put in the New-England-Priests with him; and not the Quakers, which have an Esteem of the Scri∣ptures, and practise them more than they.] And then thou tell'st us of Christ's Martyrs or Witnesses Love to the Scriptures in the Days of Q. Mary; of Ridley, Bishop of London, &c. and as the Fire grew Hotter, &c. they spent Hours and Nights in Prayer and Holy Conference upon the Scripture.
Answ. What is this to R. W. and the New-England-Priests? So have the Quakers spent Hours, Nights and Days; yea, in New-England and other Places the Lord's Spirit stir'd us up the more, as the New-England-Fires grew Hotter and Hotter, till they came to HANGING and BLOOD-SHED. And then we saw, They that were born after the Flesh, persecuted him that was born after the Spirit: and the LORD alone knoweth, what Suf∣fering we have had amongst you, who is our Only Protector, Preserver and Vpholder to this Day! We gave our Backs to our WHIPPERS, and our EARS to be CUT OFF! and to BRAN∣DING with an HOT IRON! Did we ever lift up a Hand? did we not suffer, as Lambs and Sheep among you Wolves and Foxes, that profess'd the Scriptures, as the Papists? O! that the Lord would open your Eyes, and thy Eyes R. W. (that is all the Hurt we wish you) that thou might'st see a Day of Repen∣tance of thy Evil Work! who abusest the Press, desilest peoples Minds, blasphemest against Christ and his Light! But when we Consider, it was the Portion of the Righteous in all Ages to suffer Affliction by the Birth of the Flesh, that it was not only given us to Believe, but also to Suffer (that it was the Day of the True Lord Jesus Christ) yea, and by such a people, as New-England's Great and High Professors, that R. W. extolleth so high (that could not stand in Persecution themselves, but fled into the Wil∣derness; as though they had learned of the Wolves and Bears there to Devour the Lambs and Servants of Christ) it was no New Thing to us, to suffer by such proud Pharisees, that profess God and Christ in Words, and Pesecute him, where he is Manifest. And R. W. most-Impudently and Maliciously saith, That James Parnel Murther'd himself; which here is something following to Clear that Martyr and Witness of Jesus from R. W.'s lying Tongue and his fellow-Persecuting Priests. A Short RELATION of JAMES PARNEL'S Imprison∣ment, Sufferings and Death, (which R. W. slandereth and Printeth against.) One Henry Barrington a Justice said, That James Parnel was Guilty of his own Death (which he had (as he saith) from One Smith's Mouth) And after he said; He put those words (concerning James Parnel's being Guilty of his own Death)
in Himself; because there was a Letter (he said) at White, Hall, which was given in by One Davis, which said, That the Goaler through his Cruel Usage was Guilty of James Parnel's Death. — So here ye may see the Wickedness of the Ju∣stice to Cover the Murthering of the Innocent: and see the Goaler's Cruel Usage of this James Parnel, and R. W.'s Ma∣lice. After they had put up James in a Close Hole, and made an Order, and stuck it upon the Door, That every One, that came to see him, should spend Four Pence in Beer: but James's Friends being not Free to serve the Goaler's Lusts, the Goa∣ler's Wife run at them with a Knife, and would have taken their Hats from them. And several of James's Friends and Re∣lations came for to visit him, but were denied, and not suffered to Worse V∣sage than Paul had among the Heathen-Ro∣mans, Act. 28.30. and at Mal∣ta. spak to him: and when he had Victuals, the Goaler's Wife set others to steal his Uictuals from him. And the Goaler suffered the Prisoners to break James's Box, and take his things out of it: and when they were reproved, they said; That the Goaler's Wife was the First Inventer of the stealing of his Victuals from him: and so they were Imboldned the more. And the Goaler's Wife Swore several times, THAT SHE WOULD HAVE HIS BLOOD; and told James's Friends so. And as for his Fasting Voluntarily, the Witnesses deny it, that were with him, when e was Weak. But the Ground of the Taking of James Parnel was: There was a Fast held at the Town of Great Cox-Hall in Essex up∣on the 12 day of the 5th. Month. 1655. where there were a∣bout 9 or 10 Priests and 4 Justices, and many of the Indepen∣dent and Presbyterian Faction. And this James Parnel hearing, that they Railed against the Truth and the People of God cal∣led Quakers, he went to the Steeple-House: and there was one Priest Wells an Independant. And when this Priest had done, James spoke a few words unto him as concerning his Railing against the People of God called Quakers: and all these Priests having the Justices on their sides, they interrupted the Youth James Parnel. And after a Whie, when he had spoken, what was upon him from the Lord to them, he went away; and ma∣ny Sober People went after him out of the Steeple-House. And as he was passing away to his Friend's House, a Justice called
Wakering, came behind him, and said, He Arrested him in the Name of the Protector. So after, when their Fast was done, they made a Mittimus, and sent him to Colchester-Goal. Now, here are some of the Names of the Persecuting Priests, that had a Hand in James Parnel's Blood. First, Priest Wells of an Independant Company at Brantry; and Priest Shams, a Teacher of the Independant Company at Great Cox-Hall: and Priest Sparrow, a Teacher of an Independant Company at Halstead: and Priest Steltam, a Teacher of an In∣dependant Company at Tarling: and yet all Parish-Priests. And the Goaler, when they sent him to Prison, would not let him have so much as a Truckle-bed: and they Chained this youth among the Thieves and Murtherers day and night, and led him Eighteen miles to the Assizes, and had Irons upon one of his hands: as you may see in the Book of his Life in the 243. and 244. pages. And the Goaler put him into a little Hole, called the Oven, up in the Castle-Wall (after he returned from the Assizes) and would not suffer him a little Char-coal: and so for Want of Air his Naturals grew weak; and they not suffering him to have a Bed, and his Friends being denied to come at him. And the Goaler's Wife did not only Beat him her self several times, and Swore, she would have his BLOOD; but set others to beat him: and so, he was forc'd to Lie on Stones in a Wet Season another time. And when he was so beaten and abused with the Goaler's Wife and her Company, they would not suffer his Friends to give him a little Meat to pluck up by a Rope in a Basket, he being too weak to come down out of the Oven. And the Ladder was Six Foot too short to reach the Hole: and therefore there was a Rope tid above the Ladder, for him to swing up into the Oven. And though so Weak, and so Stupiffed in is Joints, yet he must Swing down and up that Rope to the Ladder, and fetch his Food; or else he must Famish t the Hole: For ese Hard-Hearted Priests and Justices, and the Goaler agreed toge∣ther (as by these Proceedings appeareth to destroy him. For when Some of James's Friends profered to the Justices and Goa∣ler forty pound Bond, it would not be accepted; though they profered Body for Body, to let him have a little Liberty. And one time, when he got down into the yard to get a little Air,
the Goaler Lockt him in the Yard all night, it being in Cold Winter. — And so after a time climbing up the Ladder, he being grown very weak, he mist the Rope, that he was to swing down by; and so fell down from the top of the Ladder, and hurt himself: And so grew weaker and weaker; they not suf∣fering his Relations and Friends to give him necessary things, nor suffer him to walk to the Castle-door. And therefore said James, If I die▪ they have this Body. And all Means were u∣sed that could be ound, that the Justices and Goaler might be clear of his Innocent Blood; but no Mercy could be found a∣mong them. And when he died, he said; I DIE INNOCENT∣LY: and so fell asleep in Christ Jesus. And at his Departure there were some of his Relations, Anne Langley, and Thomas Shortland, who through great Trouble got to him; and heard him speak these words afore-said; I MUST DIE, AND I DIE INNOCENTLY. And after he was dead, the Wicked Priests and their Confederates went, and made a Book, and said; That James Parnel fasted himself to Death. And this is the Food and Lies, which Roger Williams and the Priests of New-England feed upon, that Old Jezabel's Fast; the Fruits of it were for Per∣secution and Blood: And James Parnel's INNOCENT BLOOD LIETH ON THE HEADS OF THEM! And much more might be written; but the Testimony of ma∣ny sober good Christians in Cox-Hall, and Colchester and Essex, with the several Certificates, that are in print (which is too large to Instance here) of the Innocency of James Parnel, and of the Cruelty of his Persecutors may testifie. And also beside May∣or Beard (which was one of the Jury upon James Parnel) after∣wards much Lamented his Death, and the Barbarous, Cruel Suf∣ferings of James Parnel, and was sorry, That ever he should have a hand in his Persecution; which he saw, was stirred up by the Priests. But this is no strange Work with the Presbyterian and Independant Priests,Matth. 28.13, 14, 15. to say, James Parnel fasted himself to Death; when the Priests, their Fore-Fathers, said; That Christ's Dis∣ciples stole him away by Night, while the Souldiers slept. And this was the Work of their Day, to make Lies their Refuge, and to sow them abroad, like Roger Williams, and the Whore, that Solomon speaketh of; to Wipe their Lips, as though they were Clean. And this may serve Roger Williams and the Persecu∣tors
of New-England, which have BANISHED, and WHIPT, & CUT OFF EARS, and HANGED the Servants of the Lord; and then Wipe their Mouths and say, They are Clean, or Good Christi∣ans, and they have done Christ Good Service in so doing. But Christ rebuketh such, and telleth them, They know not, what Spirit they are of: for he came not to Dstroy Mens Lives, but to Save them. R. W. Thou say'st, We (after the Devil's Method) make use of the Scripture as a Shield or Buckler, to fence our selves against the Scripture;p. 95. and as a Sword, to run through the Heart and Bowels of the Scriptures, the Saints, and Christ and God himself, &c. and then fall'st a-railing. Answ. Jer. 22. 2 Kings 17. 1 Cor. 11. These Scriptures do not prove this; nor that we Disown Scriptures. Now R. W. and ye New-England-Priests, can the Heart and Bowels of Christ be run through with a Sword? who can but tremble to hear those Words! We do charge R. W. and the New-England-Priests (that say, The Scripture is their Rule) to give us Chapter and Verse for these Words, that we may see, where they be written? that we may Search for them. Is the Incomprehensible God and Christ his Son (whom he hath given all Power in Heaven and Earth unto and at the Rigt Hand of God) so light unto you, and of so low a Value? doth R. W. own any God or Christ, but whose Bowels and Heart may be run through with a Sword? and is not that a false God and Christ? We tell him, the true Christ and the living God is far above his Reach and Sword? and his unholy Hands. And is not this Blasphemy to say, The Living God and his Son Christ Jesus (who is at the Right Hand of God) can be run through with a Sword? we tell him, He dieth no more: but such as thou art, Crucify him to themselves a fresh, Imprison and Perse∣cute him in his people, as Christ saith in Matth. And we own the Scriptures, and the Saints and the true Christianity; and not for this wicked End▪ as thou wickedly speakest. And as for thy Ladders and Scaffolds, and a many such Ill favour'd Comparisons, that thou hast in thy Book, might't have kept them for thy self, with all the rest of thy Vngracious Expressions. R. W. The Merchants desire to see Effects, &c. the Jews, Pha∣risees; the Papists and the Quakers do not own the Perfection. Answ. But R. W. where are thy Effects of thy Religion and the
rest of the Priests? where are the Effects of true Christianity? where are the Effects of the Fruits of a Good Spirit? for this is not the Language of the Spirit of God, but of the Evil Spi∣rit; is but of the Effects of the Pharisees and Papists thou speakest of, which are Envy, Bloodshed and Murther: And ye persecuting his Servants with Tongue and Hand, and HANGING his peo∣ple, these are not the Effects of the Good Spirit, but of the E∣vil One; as the Apostle hath described it in the Scriptures. And as for the Effects in the Practice of Religion in any Duty, that may appear (for with whom dost thou Meet, and Pray and Preach? or whether or no thou art not found in the Manner of them, whom the Apostle condemneth, and exhorteth the Saints not to have Fellowship withal, Heb. 10, 25.) we think, thou may'st for∣bear to upbraid any, thy self bringing forth so little Effects, but Effects of an Evil Heart and Vnbelief, according to the Apostle's words. And is not the Authority of the Scripture the Holy Ghost, that moved the Holy Men of God, that spoke them forth, which lead the Disciples in all Truth of them? which we witness. For dost not thou say, They are of no Value, without the Spirit of God set them home to the Heart? (as in Append. p. 94.) And so, if they be of No Value, then that which maketh them Valuable, is the Power and Spirit of God: and then that must be the Authority of them. R. W. But thou say'st; The Quakers and Papists call the Scrip∣tures a Dead Letter [and say'st, They are of no Value, &c. as be∣fore.] Answ. And as for the Papists, thou had'st better join'd them to thy self; they are nearer thee, then we are. And where did we ever Throw Dirt at the Holy Scripture, and said; It was a Nose of Wax, and a Leaden Rule? let the Reader see, if there be any such words in G. F'.s Answer, or any other Books. And truly, if any make a Nose of Wax of them, twisting them up and down, it is thy own Condition; thou giving Meanings of them this Way and that Way, and findest fault with us, because we take them Literally. And 2 Cor. 3. that is nothing to the purpose: If the King giveth a Pardon for Death in Writing; this cometh to a Man,p. 96. and preventeth his Execution. But what must we infer from R. W.'s Words here? That e∣very Man, that hath the Writings of the Scripture, hath the Par∣don of Eternal Death? and why doth he cry against Papists
then and all others? for they have the Scriptures, therefore they have the Pardon. So in this R. W. stoppeth his own Mouth, and shutteth out Revelation of the Son of God, which Scripture speaketh of, and Revelation of Faith, Revelation of Grace, Revelation of the Gospel, Revelation of the Spirit, which is the Seal of all Be∣lievers of the Pardon from Eternal Death by the Blood of Jesus Christ and the Witness with themselves, by which they can set to their Seal, that God is True in all his Promises, and Figures and Shaddows of his Son Christ Jesus, Blessed forever! R. W. Bringeth (G. F. Fol. p. 47.) Joshuah Miller saying, [It is an Error (if not Damnable) to say, Christ is the Means; and that there is no other Means of Salvation.] G. F. Answ. [And Christ saith, No man can come to the Father, but by me: and he is Able to save to the uttermost; and, He shall be my Salvation to the Ends of the Earth, saith the Lord. And (saith the A∣postle) God is in Christ reconciling the World to himself: And, He that hath the Son, hath Life: the Father and Son are one; and there is no Salvation in any other.] And R. W. replieth and saith, His Adversaries would not Suffer him to meddle with the Sense of G. F.'s words: [But G. F.'s words are Plain enough; and what doth he give a Sense of that? where is your Nose of Wax now?] Yet he thinketh not, that a man of Wisdom would call it an Er∣ror, to say, That Christ is the Means to Salvation. Then he fall∣eth a-railing and saith; For this Wretched Juggler (to wit G. F.) subtily confounds the Instrumental Causes of Salvation with the Efficient in God the Father,p. 97. the Meritorious in God the Son, Christ Jesus. Answ. How can this be? when G. F. saith, God was in Christ reconciling the World to himself? and God saith, He shall be my Salvation to the Ends of the Earth? And the Apostle saith, (Eph. 1, 17.) In whom we have Redemption through his Blood, Forgiveness of Sin, according to the Riches of his Grace. And — R. W. saith, I know, this Juggler meaneth not a Christ, nor his Blood, nor his Death, as we mean, but an Imaginary Christ, &c. Answ. This Knowledge of thine, and this Meanes of thine is false, the Lord knoweth it; and the Imaginary is in thyself.— But — R. W. saith, Christ's Messengers are said to Save. Answ. And what then? is not this through Christ?
R. W. Secondly, Thou say'st; The Scriptures are said to make Wise to Salvation. Answ. But why will not R. W. put in, THROVGH FAITH? as though the Scriptures can Make Wise to Salvation without Faith, Thou say'st — R. W. A Man may be God's Means to Save his Wife, and she her Husband. Answ. And is not this Means FAITH, which Christ is the Au∣thor of? And thou say'st — R. W. That we are Saved by Hope, Faith, &c. Answ. But doth not Paul tell thee, That this Hope is Christ, and Faith he is the Author of? And thou say'st — R. W. Saved by Baptism. Answ. And what! without FAITH? And — R. W. Women are Saved by Child-bearing. Answ. But what! without Faith by Christ? And what! are all Women Saved by Child-bearing, all that are in the World, with their Bastards? for thou dost not say, Some Women; and thou dost not put in FAITH. But can they grow up in Christ the Sa∣viour without Faith? And then thou say'st — R. W. All these Subtilly and Wickedly G. F. setteth at Variance with the Meritorious Salvation by Jesus Christ. Answ. G. F. Setteth them not at Variance; but he saith again, There is no Salvation in any other Name under Heaven, but in the Name of Jesus Christ: And thou that say'st, There is, givest the Apostle the Lie, and dost not own the True Lord Jesus. R. W. Thou tellest of a Man saving his Brother by a Rope, and a Mid-wife saving a Woman in Child-bed. Answ. What is this? this is Outward from a Natural Death: but it is Christ Jesus, that Saveth his People from Eternal Death through Faith in him; which is more, than from Outward Death. And — R. W. Thou say'st; To talk of this Immediate Christ and Spirit without Scriptures, without Preaching and other Holy Means, is as Silly, as Impious, as Blockish, as Blasphemous, and as Bedlam and Frantick, as Wicked and Anti-christian. Answ. R. W. hath not described, what his Means are? But Reader, is not the Means the Faith in Christ Jesus? and is not that Revealed? and is not the Means the Holy-Ghost, that Pro∣ceedeth
from the Father and his Son, that leadeth all True Be∣lievers into all Truth? And they are not the True Preachers, that are not in the same Holy Ghost, that gave forth the Scriptures, and all their Means are good for nothing; seeing the Apostle saith, That no Man knoweth the Things of God, but by the Spi∣rit. And so as for thy Ungracious Words, Silly, Impious, Blockish, Blasphemy, Frantick, Wicked, Anti-christian and Bedlam, thou may'st keep to thy self; and so all thy Means, that hast No Mo∣tion of Heavenly Things. And all they, that be in the Faith of Christ, and the Holy Ghost, that leadeth into all Truth, which the Ministers of the Spirit they have their Means from Christ, in whose Name is Salvation; and Preach Christ, and not themselves: and such we are One withal, and such cannot but own the Scrip∣tures. So the Holy Means are in the Holy Spirit: but what is this to the Means of all your Priests and Thee, who ownest not the Light of Christ, but callest it an Idol? — And thou talkest of an Immediate Christ without the Scripture: Will R. W. say, That Christ and the Spirit is in the Scripture? is not Christ in Heaven? and the Spirit of God was in them, that gave forth Scripture. And Christ saith, Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think, ye have Life; but ye will not come to me, that ye might have Life. But we tell R. W. We, and whosoever else owneth the Lord Jesus Christ, own the Scriptures, and cannot deny them, nor none of his True Preachers, which carry their Message from Christ for the Good of People: and such the World receiveth not, that come in the Name of the Lord; but such as come in their own, they will Receive. R. W. And again thou bringest a Comparison of the King's Par∣don sealed with his Broad Seal to a Condemned Rebel: (which thou often bring'st over and over.) Answ. What dost thou think to prove by this? That the Scrip∣ture is the Pardon, or is the Evidence? if it were, then the Pa∣pists, (that thou Comparest us so often to) and many Wicked Men might have Pardon and Remission. But is it not the Spirit, that Sealeth? (according to Ephes. 1, 23.4, 30) and is it not Christ, that Bringeth the Glad Tidings of Life unto the Soul, and by his Holy Spirit beareth Witness? (according to Rom. 8.) and is not the Assurance thus known? R. W. bringeth Hosannah, &c. (G. F.'s Fol. pag. 221.) saying, [The Sure Word of Prophecy the Apostle speaketh of, is the Pro∣phecy
of Scripture.] G. F. Answ. [Doth the Scripture shine in a Dark Place, until the Day Dawn? and are they them, that must be Taken heed unto, as to a Light? Can any see the Scrip∣ture, or know the Scripture, but by the Light within? cannot a Cain, a Balaam, a Korah bring Scripture, that is gone from the Spirit of Prophecy within; and then put the Letter for it?] R. W. Replieth, and beginneth with Blasphemy and Railing, and saith; I know, that Fox maketh their Idol Within, called Light, to be the More Sure Word of Prophecy; and his Vsual Proof is,p. 98. The Testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophe∣cy, &c. And why must all the Prophets or Messengers of God, who from the Beginning of the World were God's Mouth and Pens concerning the Birth, Life and Death of Christ, &c. here be ast out from the Word of Prophecy? Answ. What! cannot R. W. endure to hear talk of the Scrip∣tures? are not John's Words (in Revelation) The Testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy? and thou deniest it, both Scrip¦ture and Spirit, who say'st; I Vsually bring this Proof? And Pe∣ter's Saying, We have a more Sure Word of Prophecy, which ye do well to take heed unto, as unto a Light, that shintth in a Dark Place, until the Day dawn, and the Day-star arise in your Hearts: This the Apostle lets them see the Sufficiency of that Light, till they came to the Day-Dawning and the Day-star-Arising. And what is this Day-dawning and Day-star-arising in the Heart? if it be the Outward Scriptures of the Prophets, prove it by Scrip∣tures. And is this Day-Star-Arising in the Heart, and Day-Dawn∣ing and Idol? as thou callest the Light within an Idol, a More Sure Word of Prophecy, than the Voice which was Heard in the Mount? And this is not to Cast away the Prophets: and Peter, who directed the Saints to this Sure Word of Prophecy, (the Light, that shineth in a Dark Place) did not Cast out the Prophets▪ that Prophesied of Christ's Birth, Death, &c. (as thou Dotingly speak∣est;) no more do we, but own them all. And Luk. 1. and Rom. 16. and the Apostles, that had this Light shining, (this More Sure Word of Prophecy) they saw the Fulfilling of the Scriptures in Christ Jesus; which none doth without the Light of Christ, by which he is seen. And— R. W. Thou say'st; The Written Word or Prophecy of the Prophets is a more Sure Word and Evidence to us, &c. than the Voice from Heaven, of which Peter here speaketh, &c.
Answ. Now what must we Observe from R. W.'s Words here? That the Written Word or Prophecy of the Prophets shineth in a dark place? Now R. W. saith, that the Scripture is the Rule and Touch stone; We do Charge him and the New-England-Priests to make this Good by plain Scripture, and give us Chapter and Verse, and a Rule for it either. And Secondly tell us, Where is this Dark Place? and what it is, that this Written Word or Prophecies of the Prophets shine in? (seeing he saith, That the Scripture availeth nothing without the Spirit; (and yet, they are more) and then how can they Shine, when they avail nothing?) And whether he doth not now oppose Peter's Doctrine, who calleth it a Light, that shin∣eth in a dark place? and the Day-dawning, which shineth in the heart? so, if the Light be the Written Word, that shineth in a dark place; whether or no the Day-dawning and Day-star be the Writ∣ten-Word? And this Light (that shineth in a dark place, which we are to take heed unto, until the Day dawn, and the Day-star a∣rise in our hearts) this Light and Day-star doth own all the Pro∣phets from the Beginning of the World concerning the Lord Christ, who fulfilleth them. And — R. W. thou say'st, How sure is the Quakers Light, their Word of Prophecy? a Sober Mind cannot but admire that Face and Fore-head of Brass and Adamant, &c. So that they blush not to pre∣fer such a simple Image, a meer Baby and Child's Puppet of their Immediate Word of Prophecy before the Word, the Mind and Will of God by the Mouth of all the Prophets, &c. And dost not thou say —What Cursed Opinions, horrible Vncleannesses, Bloody Mur∣thers and Slaughters have been conceived and brought forth from the Spirit within, and Revelations from Devilish Lights and Spi∣rits, &c. Answ. Let all the Moderate and Sober Christians Judge here of R. W.'s words, and what work he hath made against Peter's Doctrine, who saith, That they have a More sure Word of Pro∣phecy, which they do well to take heed unto, as unto a Light, till the Day dawn, and the Day-star arise in their hearts: which we do own and stand unto. Now he calleth this a Simple Image, a Meer Baby, a Child's Puppet; and he would make this Light and Spirit the Author of Murther and Blood-shed, and Cursed Opinions, and likewise the Author of Devilish Lights and Spirits: see, how he blasphemeth Peter's Doctrine with Devilish Lights and Spirits, Murthers, Slaughters! he might have applied it at home to his
own Spirit and the New-England-Priests and Professors, (as in pag. 98.) — And thou bringest Rev. 19. The Testimony of Jesus is the Spirit of Prophecy: and then in the Margent thou say'st [The workings of Satan by his Spirit and Inspirations in all Ages] but not by the Testimony of Jesus,p. 99. the Testi∣mony of Prophecy R. W. but by such a Spirit, as thou art in. And thou say'st — R. W. Doth not the Angel forbid John Worshipping of him? &c. Answ. But hath R. W. and his New-England-Priests forbidden this Worship? and art not thou offended in speaking the Word Thee and Thou to every Body, and for want of the Hat and Knee? &c. and thou hast publickly declared thy self, that we might be punished for not doing these things. But would'st not thou and the New-England-priests and Professors be honoured with Hat and Knee? and yet John was not to bow down to the Angel. R. W. And thou goest on Railing, and say'st; And shall we say, that the Angels too are Quakers? and Christ hath Enlightned them also, as well as every Man? &c. Answ. where did ever we say, the Angels were Quakers? is there any such thing in G. F.'s Reply to Hosanna, let the Reader see. But were not all things made by Christ Jesus? and did not Christ, who is God, who made them, enlighten them? if not, how should they see their Work they are to do, who are called Mi∣nistring Spirits, Flames of Fire, &c. (Hebr.) R. W. And then thou tellest, G. F. mentions Cain and Balaam and Koe. Answ. And very well he may Vse it to thee, and to our Old Persecutors, and such as thou and the New-England-Priests, who gain-say the Light of Christ, and the Law of the Spirit (which maketh us free from Sin and Death) as Core did the Law of Moses: And we have not mist you, for you are worse, then Core, who did not call the Law of God an Idol and a Fancy; as thou hast called the Light of Christ over and over in thy Book. And all the Prophets of God from the Beginning of the World, they spoke from an Inward Sight and Light of God in their hearts, which is heard, known and seen by the Light and Spirit of God in the heart, which leadeth into the Truth of them: and thou, that would'st not hear the Light within, and take heed unto in the dark place; thou would'st not hear the Prophets and Christ Jesus,
from whence it cometh: And so Remember Dives. And — R. W. goeth on Railing and saith, G. F. is so used to Cur∣sing, &c. Answ. But let the Reader see, Whether there be any such words of Cursing in G. F.'s Answer in page 97? — And so, as for Horrible Wickedness, their Lying Father, Vgly Spiders, Poison and blind Dream∣er, thou might'st have applied to thy self. And— R. W. thou say'st, What a madness is it for this Blind Dreamer to ask, Whether the Scripture shineth in a dark place, until the Day dawn, and the Day-star arise in the heart? &c. and then thou say'st,p. 100 All the suttle Foxes in the World must know, that if they attend unto Whisperings and Peepings, and leave the Written Law, &c. and other Prophecies of Scripture, &c. for all their Childish Vapourings and Prating of their Light, the Eter∣nal Father of Lights proclaimeth them to be Children of howling Darkness, and that there is no Light within them. And thou say'st, He that shall find a spark of true Light &c. in this their Fantastick Light, he shall find the Living among the Dead, and prove the Pro∣phets of God, and God, (whose Word was Spoken) to be Liars, for saying, There is no Light within them. Answ. All this Blasphemy and Railing is not so much against the Quakers, but against Peter's Doctrine, to wit, the Light, which the Saints did and were to Take heed unto, until the Day dawn, and the Day-star arise in their hearts. And R. W. goeth about to give Peter the Lie, and would seem to prove it by the Law of God and his Prophets; but by this he hath prov'd himself a Liar, and one that hateth the Light. And he bringeth Esa 8; but let him see, it is said in the Margent there, And there is no Morning in them, if they speak not according to the Law and Pro∣phets; so we may speak to him. And R. W. this is not in him, who speaketh not according to the Law and Prophets, Christ and his Apostles: for the Light, that Peter speaketh of, that shineth in Darkness (which they are to take heed unto, until the Day dawn, and the Day-star arise) this was afore the Morning; they were come to the Morning. And so he giveth Peter the Lie, and John the Lie, and abuseth Esaiah's Words, what John saith, This was the true Light (which he bore witness to) that Lighteth every Man, which was the Life in the Word: and R. W. with all his Evil Speakings witnesseth against it, and calleth it a Fantastick Light, a Childish Vapour, and Whispering and Peeping; but he might have
kept this at home. And [The Father of Lights (he saith) pro∣claimeth us to he Children of howling Darkness, and that there is no Light in them.] Answ. The Father of Lights proclaimeth no such thing, nor his Son; but saith: Every One, that doth the Truth, cometh to the Light; and every one, that doth Evil, hateth the Light, and will not come to it, because it reproveth him: And this is R. W.'s Condition. R. W. asketh,, What Light have the Papists, Jews and the De∣vil, when they bring Scripture to Christ? —and so falleth a rail∣ing. Answ. But if the Jews and Papists do hate the Light, like R. W. yet I never heard the Jews and Papists call it an Idol, and a frantick Light, as R. W. doth: and we say, neither he, nor the Papists or Jews can see neither the Scriptures, nor Christ with∣out the Light. And we never did say, That Christ did enlighten the Devil himself with his true Light; for Christ saith, There is no Truth in him: but R. W. saith, That there is something of God, that is, from the Power and Wisdom of God, in the fallen Spi∣rits and the Devils themselves; which we Charge R. W. and all his New-England-Priests to give us Scripture for those Words (as in his Append. p. 5:) and therefore why doth R. W. ask G. F. What Light hath the Devil himself? And thou say'st, The Devil bringeth a pertinent Scripture and Promise to Christ Jesus, as ever the Papists or Quakers: This R. W. might have kept at home, with the Jesuitical, Diabolical Reservations, and venemous and poisonous, with his Unsavory, Ungratious words. R. W. bringeth Enoch Howet (G. F. Fol. p. 14.) his sayings [The Scriptures to be the Only Weapon, whereby Christ overthrew the Devil.] G. F. Answ. [Who bruiseth his Head (to wit Christ) was, before the Scripture was: yet the Scripture is for Correcti∣on and Doctrine, furnishing the Man of God in his place. And Christ the Seed was, before the Scripture was: and all that have Scrip∣ture, and not Christ, cannot Overcome the Devil (ye and the Papists doing his Work.) For they that Overcome him, it is with the Power of Christ [for Christ saith, Without me ye can do no∣thing:] and those have the Scriptures of Truth, which the Devil is out of.] R. W.'s Reply: How doth Christ's bruising of Satan's Head, and being before Scripture was, dis∣prove, &c. and so falleth a-railing;p. 101. Who sees not Fox in his Burrough?
Answ. R. W. doth not or will not state G. F.'s words right, as he hath spoken them; as the Reader may see, viz: [As Christ, who bruiseth his Head, being before Scripture was] who bruiseth his Head by his Power, and destroyeth Death, and the Devil, the Power of Death: who is manifest in Time, &c. And — R. W. saith; As for G. F.'s saying, [They that have the Scrip∣ture, and not Christ, cannot overcome the Devil.] (And R. W. Re∣plieth) What News doth he tell the World, which no body denieth? and yet thou say'st again; How doth this deny, that Christ Jesus overcame the Devil by Scripture? [which is the Sword, the Only Sword, and is called a Sword, Append. p. 88.] Answ. But R. W. thou must show us a Rule for it in Scripture, Chapter and Verse, That the Scripture is the Sword, the Only Sword: and yet thou say'st (Append. p. 94.) That it (the Scripture) doth not avail without the Spirit of God. And how doth this hang to∣gether R. W? That they that have the Scripture without the Spirit, cannot overcome the Devil: and yet, The Scripture is the Sword, and the Only Sword, by which Christ overcame the Devil? and, The Scripture doth not avail without the Spirit; and yet it is thy Only Sword? [and in thy Book called Experiments (Epist. to La∣dy Vane the Younger, 1652) thou say'st, That the Two-edged Sword is of his (God's) most Holy Spirit, which pierces between the very Soul and Spirit, &c.] But these things are Answered more Largely in the Appendix. R. W. saith; Is all Scripture or Writing given forth by Inspira∣tion of God, and is profitable (though G. F. alledgeth the Scriptures by Halves) for Correction and Doctrine, &c. and, Then it clearly follows, that as Christ Jesus overcame the Devil by the Scriptures, so &c. Answ. Christ was the Power of God: and the Devil brought Scripture to him and said, It is written; but Christ overcame him by the Power, who is the Substance of the Scriptures: And Christ through Death destroyed the Devil, the Power of Death; and was that by Scripture? And G. F. doth confess, he doth not write all the Scriptures, which thou Scoffingly callest Halves; neither doth R. W. write all the Scriptures, nor half neither: And Christ did not Overcome the Devil by the Scripture, when he correct∣ed him by Scripture in his Power and Spirit. And the Apostle saith, All Scripture given forth by Inspiration of God, is profitable for Doctrine, Reproof, for Correction, for Instruction in Righteousness, that the Man of God may be perfect, and throughly furnish'd to
all good Works (2 Tim. 3.) and this he doth not say to the Men of the World, that be in the Evil Work, like R. W. and his New-England-Priests and Professors are. R. W. And thou say'st; So, by the same Weapon this Suttle Fox and all other of Satan's Foxes must be corrected, confuted, catch'd and destroyed (except they repent) for ever. Answ. What! must the Scripture destroy us? and that which is of no value without the Spirit of God R. W? but this is Answe∣red (as I said afore) Largely in the Appendix. R. W. And with Scoffing words to no purpose thou say'st; How he runneth in and out of his Holes, &c. As for the Quakers Power here pretended in Opposition to the Scriptures, &c. and, Thus sometimes a Devil of Drunkenness, Swearing, Stealing runs away from the Sermons of the Quakers, as a Naughty Devil, some∣times as the Chiding and Conjuring of a good Witch, that he may get the faster hold by &c. Self-Conceit and Contradicti∣on to the Scriptures,p. 102. by Will-worship and superstitious In∣ventions against the Holy Institutions and Commands of the true Lord Jesus Christ. Answ. R. W. and his New-England-Priests and Professors might have all those Vngratious, Vnsavory Words kept at home. But what is this good Witch he speaketh of? for we own the Holy Scriptures, and the Commands &c. of the true Lord Jesus Christ, and his Worship in Spirit and Truth: And if thou had'st Overcome the Devil by the Only Sword of the Scripture, we should never have such Railing Expressions from thee, which proceed from him.— And thou tell'st a Story of the Devil, and how a Child lieth down and crieth; but thou might'st have kept this at home, with all the rest of thy Railing Language: for thou, who hast him so often in thy Mouth, its like, thou art more acquainted with him, than with Christ and his Light. And R. W. must not be called a Rai∣ler; not He, but it's We must be the Railers: but see, if he find∣eth any such words here in G. F.'s Reply to Enoch Howet. And— R. W. bringeth Francis Duke (Fol. pag. 189.) saying, [Whe Christ told the Devil, that Man should not live by Bread alone, bu by every Word, that proceedeth out of the Mouth of God; That wa Beieving the Scripture: and this Word of God in the Scripture was the Ground of Christ's Faith; and so to all, that are his.] G. F. Answ. [Many may have the Scripture, and never hear the Voice o
God, as the Jews, Joh. 5. and they said, they believed the Scrip∣tures; though they were out of the true Belief. But receiving the Word from God, is as they, that gave forth the Scriptures, which Man liveth by, and not by Bread alone; and so knoweth him, who was, before Scripture was given forth. And for say∣ing, That the Scripture was the Ground of Christ's Faith; he was, afore the Scripture was writ, and so fulfilleth their Words, and is the Author and Finisher of the Saints Faith, which was, be∣fore the Scripture was given forth: he by whom the World was made, is the Author of the Saints Faith, that bruiseth the Ser∣pent under his Feet, &c.] And R. W. Replieth, and falleth a∣railing and saith; How Notorious for Tautologies are these Bru∣tish Clamors! shall we believe their Notorious Lies? &c. and so goeth on railing and crieth, Childish, &c. Antient, Doting Women, &c. so full of Idle Repetitions: and crieth, How brutish and impi∣ous, viz: That a Man may have the Scriptures, and yet not be in the Belief; therefore the Word of God was not the Ground of Christ's Belief? and again; The Devil and the Wicked Men may have the Scriptures, and not Believe in them; and therefore Christ Je∣sus and the Saints Believe them not neither. Answ. This is a False Inference of thine, as to say, Christ and the Saints did not believe the Scriptures; the Reader may see, there is no such thing in G. F.'s Answer: and dost not thou con∣fess, That (many) they may have the Scriptures, and not o∣vercome the Devil? (p. 101.) But did those Jews, that Perse∣cuted Christ, and his Apostles and Prophets, Truly Believe in Christ? — Now, as for Tautologies, and the Doting Woman, with Idle Repetitions thou may'st apply to thy self: for how of∣ten in thy Book dost thou call over and over the Light of Christ an Idol, a Frantick Light? And read pag. 109. in Append▪ and there thou may'st see thy Tautologies; Quakers, Papists, Papists and Quakers, Papists, &c. where he mentioneth the Quakers and Papists a matter of Twelve times over, as though R. W. would fill up his Book with it: and let the Reader see most of the Pages throughout his Book, whether he hath not done the same. And R. W. may note, how often David and the Holy Men of God go over the same thing; and the Apostles mention often the Name of Jesus: and if R. W. and his New-England-Priests do say, That these are Notorious Lies, that which G. F. saith (as the Reader may see in his Answer) viz. ["Many may have the Scrip∣tures
and hear not the Voice of God.] This is a Notorious Lie by R. W. (as in Joh. 5.) [And the Jews would say, They Be∣lieved Scriptures; though they were out of the True Belief and Receiving Christ, the Word of God: and Christ in plain Words told them, They were of their Father, the Devil;] This is another Lie of R. W. and the New-England-Priests. [But Receiving the Word from God, is as they, that gave forth the Scriptures, (that received his Word, which Man liveth by, and not by Bread only;] And these R.W. calleth Notorious Lies: [and so know∣eth him, that was, before Scripture was given forth (to wit, Christ] and these R. W. saith, are Notorious Lies. [And they say, that Christ was, before the Scripture was writ, and fullfilleth the words, to wit, the Scripture:] This is a Notorious Lie; shall we believe those Notorious Lies? saith R. W. [and is the Author and Finisher (to wit, Christ) of the Saints Faith.] Shall we be∣lieve these Notorious Lies? &c. And — R. W. thou say'st, Shall we believe their Notorious Lies, that the Light within gave forth the Scripture? and that they speak and write, as they are moved by the Spirit, when their Writings are so weak? &c. Answ. Let the Reader see, if there be any such thing in G. F.'s Answer, That the Light within us gave forth Scripture? but it was the Holy Ghost in the Prophets and Apostles, that gave forth Scriptures; and with the Light of Christ we see them, and are led into all Truth by the Holy Ghost. And again, as for Tauto∣logies, R. W. may read his pag. 84. of his Book, and see, where he 11 or 12 times goeth over Juggler and Cheater, Juggler and Cheater, &c. in one and the same page. R. W. beginneth with Railing: Let Heaven and Earth hear and abhor the Sophistry of these Deceivers! they would fain have no such Christ as Man,p. 103. a Christ without, an Out-side Christ, &c. And then thou contradictest thy self and say'st, That We confess, that there was such a Man or Per∣son, who came according to Gal. 4. Answ. Which we really believe: and we do not Cloak nor Cross our Principle in saying, That Christ was afore the Scrip∣ture; but thou wrongst G. F.'s words again. For his words are not, That Christ bruis'd the Serpent's Head before the Scripture was; but, Christ was, before the Scripture was; who bruiseth the Serpent's head: for all things were made by Christ, (as the Rea∣der
may see pag. 102.) And doth not Christ say, Before Abra∣ham was, I am? And as for Sophistry, and Deceiving, and speak∣ing of an Out-side Christ, those are thy own Railing Words, not ours; and doth not become an Old Man, nor Christian. R. W. Let any of these Jugglers answer, if they speak honestly; If there was really such a Man called Jesus at Jerusalem? &c. Answ. R. W. beginneth with Railing here: but seeing, he querieth of us, we shall answer him and all the World. We do believe, there was Such a Man, who was born in Bethlehem, Christ Jesus, suffered without the Gates of Jerusalem, after the Scripture was written: who was tempted of the Devil, and the De∣vil brought Scripture to him; and Christ Reproved him with Scrip∣ture, and Overcame him by his POWER. And Christ died and rose, and fulfill'd the Prophets, and at the Right Hand of God: who is the same that Descended, the same that Ascended. But where doth R. W. prove by the Scriptures, (and the New-England-Priests) That the Scriptures were the Ground of Christ's Faith? this we must have Scripture for, before we can receive it from R. W. and his New-England priests, to wit, That the Scripture is the Ground of Christ's Faith, and the Ground of the Saints Faith: and yet he saith, The Scripture availeth nothing; is of no value without the Spirit, &c: (Append. p. 94.) And further we say: If the Scripture was the Ground of the Saints Faith, and the Scrip∣ture availeth nothing without the Spirit; How was it, that the Pha∣risees and the Papists (whom thou mentionest so often) had not Faith from that Ground? for they all say, they believe Scripture. But what must we Observe from R. VV.'s Words here? That the Scripture is the Ground of Christ's Faith? and yet he will ac∣knowledge, Christ was before Scripture; and Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, Abel, Enoch and Noah had Faith, before Scripture was written. And now, if Christ be the Author and Finisher of the Saints Faith, and they are to look unto him, I query, Whether he be Scripture, if it be the Ground of the Saints Faith? And the Spirit of God, which lead his Saints to give forth Scriptures, lea∣deth into all Truth of them. And the Spirit and the Scriptures are not at Odds one with another, neither did we ever set them so, as thou us in Effect chargest: neither can the Children of God know the Scriptures given forth by the Spirit of God, but by the Spirit of God within (which thou scoffingly callest a Secret Whispe∣ring Voice within, contrary to Scriptures.) And the Voice, that owneth
not the Scripture, is not the Voice of the Spirit of God, that gave them forth both before Christ's Coming in the Flesh and since. And — R. W. As to the Spirit's Leading into all Truth the Sons of God, thou answerest and say'st; Is not Fox here in his Burrough, not distinguishing betwixt the Extra-ordinary Leading of the Holy Apostles appointed to be the Eye-witnesses of Christ's Death and Resur∣rection? &c. Answ. What must we Infer from R. W's. Words? That because the Leading of the Apostles and Preaching the Resurrection of Christ Jesus by the Holy Ghost, that others therefore were not reproved by the holy Ghost? and must not every Son of God be led into all Truth to know Christ and his Resurrection? but G. F. doth not say, that all were Messengers and Apostles, &c. (1. Cor. 12.) And thou ur∣ther sayst; Yet all God's Children are Regenerated and Sanctified;p. 104. [and dost thou not say in another place, They must have a Combate all their Life?] and thou sayst, That God's Children are Guided and Built up together an Habitation; &c. And then R. W. must not the Spirit of God be within? and if so, then thou ownest the Quakers Principle, and confessest that, which thou all this while hast been fighting against. And as for what David said, if he had been in thy Day, thou wouldst have cried against him, as thou dost against us, who said; I have hid thy Word in my Heart. R. W. And this is the Devil's (the Old Fox) his Devilish Subtle∣ty, to make the Cloak of the Spirit's extra-ordinary Assistance, &c. and the Angels Extra-ordinary Protection a Ground of Christ Jesus and his Servants flinging themselves down from the Pinnacle of the Temple: and thou pretendest to tell us from God, that this will be the Break-neck of the People called Quakers (without Repentance) every Soul of them. Answ. How now R. W! hast thou not here given rash Judgement a∣gainst the Assistance, and Protection and Sufficiency of the Spirit of Christ and his Grace, which God saith, is Sufficient to Paul in his Trouble? And hast not thou broken thy own Neck here, and falln down from the Pinnacle, who dost not look at the Grace of God, and his Light and Spirit to be Sufficient? Is it sufficient to condemn them, that Erre from the Spirit, and turn the Grace of God into Wantonness? And God sent an Angel, and brought the Children of Israel out of Egypt: and (Exod. 23, 20.) Behold! I send an Angel before thee, to keep thee in the Way: (vers. 23.) For my Angel shall go before
thee, and bring thee, &c. and Chap. 22, 24: And behold! my Angel shall go before thee: And was not this Angel sufficient to bring them into the Land of Canaan, if they hearkened unto him? and is not Christ Sufficient by his Light, Power and Spirit to bring us out of Spiritual Egypt? and Christ saith to his Sheep, that hear his Voice; I give unto them Eternal Life, and they shal never perish; neither shall any man pluck them out of my Hand (John 10, 28.) But R. W. how canst thou say, Thou passest thy false Judgement upon us from the God of Truth; and yet sayst, There is no Voice nor Motion within to be lissen'd, or hearken'd un∣to in Heavenly Things, in Matters that are Super natural? (pag. 83.) R W. Thou say'st; Our Principles and Practices are fll of Con∣tradiction and Hypocrisy. Answ. Our Principles and Professin are Holy and Pure; and Contradictions and Hyppocrisy thou might'st have kept at Home: for we Profess the Lord Jesus Christ, and all the Prophecies and Things in the Law, that Figured them forth; and the Things in the Law, as truly, as the Prophets and the Apostles did Profess him: and own all that is Written in the Scriptures from Genesis to Re∣velation. And we own the Worship in the Spirit and Truth, and are in it, that Christ set up Sixteen-hundred Years since; and the Re∣ligion, that the Apostle describeth above Sixteen-hundred Years since, which is Pure and Vndefiled before God: And the One Faith, which Chrit is the Author of; and the One Baptism, and the One Spirit into One Body: and One God and Father of All, who is above All, and through All, and in you All, as the Apostle speak∣eth. And the Lord Jesus Christ, who was Born of the Virgin, Conceived by the Holy Ghost; &c. and Preach'd, and Suffered un∣der Pontius Pilate, before whom he made a Good Confession: and Died, and Rose again, and is at the Right Hand of God; and remaineth in the Heavens, till all things are Restored: &c. who will Judge the World in Righteousness, and Reward every Man according to his Works; and therefore no Salvation in any o∣ther Name, but in the Name of Jesus, &c. And let New-Eng∣land-Professors see, if our Principles and Practice, Life and Do∣ctrine hath not Out-stript theirs; let the Witness of God in them Answer! And — R. W. saith; He told us of False Gods, and Worships and Prophets, &c. [but this is nothing to the Purpose to prove his
False Charge: for we are Not to Believe thee and the False Pro∣phets; but to Try them:] but thou say'st; We must Try them with Fire it self. Answ. Yea R. W. Ye and the New-England-Priests did Try us, God's True Prophets, with FIRE; whom ye Tried with your HOT IRON, when ye BRANDED them, and your GALLOWS, when you HANGED them: And so ye are TRIED not to be in the true Principles and Profession of the Apostles and of Christ. And didst not thou say afore, That the Scripture was to Try? and what R. W! is the Scripture now become a FIRE? where is that writ∣ten? But the Counterfeit, and the Dross, and the Devil himself, as black a Fiend, &c. the Spirit of Darkness, Samuel's Mantle, thou speakest of, and Sheeps-Cloathing, and Deceiving and Covering your Black Spirit withal; and then thou say'st: Thou told'st us, 'Twas Common for the Papists and Turks; and Judas betraying his Master with a Kiss, and a many such like Words (but we do remember few:) but this is nothing to prove our Principles and Profession, what others were. And — R. W. Thou say'st; Thou Remembrest, thou told'st us, That Paul telleth Timothy of some, that speak Lies in Hypocrisy; [What is this to us? this is thy own Condition; this is no Proof:] and of Such,p. 105. as knowingly (for Devilish and Wicked Ends, & Preferment & Profit) take the Leading-Staff in the Hand, &c. and then thou Tell'st of the Pope's and Cardinals, and of Judas his Gain, that betrayed Christ, &c. of the Sechemites and their Successors; of Nebuchadnezar's Idolatry, &c. And further, thou Tell'st us of such, that the Lord Jesus Christ hath positively fore-told of, that they should think to do God Service, to Kill himself in Killing his Servants. Answ. But R. W. giveth us no Scripture for this, To Kill him∣self in Killing his Servants; (except he meaneth them in New-England, that Crucified Christ first to Themselves, and then Killed his Servants:) but all this is nothing to us. Here thou dost Confess and Wonder, that We bore all this Load of Stories, which was to no purpose: therefore thou might'st very well Wonder at their Patience: but R W. had not W. E. and the rest (which thou scoffingly say'st, Broke out) Reason to call thee to prove thy Charge, when thou had'st run so far beside the Matter? And we are, as we were, when we First came amongst you. And —
R. W. Thou say'st, Thou told'st us, that we were Charg'd with denying the Man Christ Jesus.p. 106. But— (Answ.) We say, thy Charge is False: For we own Christ, that died at Jerusalem, more than thou and the New-Eng∣land-Priests, as we said before; and there is no such thing neither in G. F.'s nor in any of our Books. And let the Reader see, whe∣ther there be any such Words in G.F.'s Book? It is R.W.'s own false Charging to prove his Assertions. And our Books hold forth (without Juggling, as thou Falsly Chargest us) Church-Ministry, Baptism, &c. Resurrection, Eternal Judgment, Eternal Life now, and in the World to come. R. W. And thou say'st; We deny any Church, but that Invi∣sible. Answ. The Church is in God; but their Bodies are Visible (1 Thes. 1.) And so thy Principles are False, and thy Profession, that is not according to the Apostle's. And that, which keepeth us together in the Fellowship and Vnity, is the Spirit; which, as it doth Move us, we Pray, we Preach, we Sing, as the Holy Men of God did, who spake, as the Spirit of God gave them Vtterance: And this is according to the Primitive Sense, Principle and Pro∣fession; though thou may'st say Monstrous and Dissimulation. And we do proess we have an Vnction; and Christ enlightneth every one, that cometh into the world (and this as in John 1.2.); and this is according to Sound Principle, and the Profession of the Holy Men of God: and thou deniest this, and art in a false prin∣ciple and profession, contrary to the Apostle's. R. W. And further thou say'st, That Christ, and the Spirit, and the Kingdom of Heaven is in them (as the Pharisees had, and the very same the Saints have.) Answ. These are thy false professions and principles, and not ours. But that which we do profess, we shall manifest; Know ye not, that Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates? And, He that hath not the Spirit of Christ, is none of his: And thou that deniest this to the Saints, art of a false principle and profession, contrary to the Apostle. And Christ said, The Kingdom of Heaven was in the Pharisees (Luke 17.); but neither Christ nor We say, That Christ was in them, as he was in the Saints: and the Pharisees, and their going from, and hating the Light, which Christ hath enlightned them withal, they are condemn'd by the Light, and not Justi∣fied.
R. W. And then thou Scoffest at the Quakers She-Apostles and He-Apostles sent into New-England, Ireland, Scotland, Italy,p. 107. and Turkey, &c. Answ. Yea, they are gone thither, where R. W. and the New-England-Priests durst not shew their Heads (though they may Rail against the Turk and Pope behind their Backs,) your Spirits are too Cowardly: And by all this thou hast not disprov'd our principles and profession. And we believe, if R. W. had been in the Dayes of the Apostles, he would have join'd with the Scribes and Pharisees against Christ Jesus; and have Rail'd against Christ and his Disciples, and against Mary Magdalen and other Women, that preach'd the Resurrection of Christ Jesus. R. W. Thou say'st, We profess the Scriptures to be the Words of God, and not the Word (and therefore We are in a false Prin∣ciple and Profession.) Answ. Are we? Is this thy Proof? And doth not the Scrip∣tures (which thou say'st, is the Rule and Touch-stone) themselves call a Declaration the Words of God and Christ? Nay, dost not thou call it an History? And so thou, that callest the Scriptures with other Names, than the Holy Men of God have called them, thou art in a false profession, not we; who speakest otherwise than the Scripture speaketh. And where did ever we say, If all the Scripture was burnt, we have the Scriptures within us? We charge thee to make this good by any of our Books or Writings; un∣til then, we look upon thee as one that hath Slander'd us to the World: And we abhor thy words, as Burning the Scriptures; and yet we must not deny Knowing the Scriptures by the Spirit of God within. R. W. And so thou say'st, By deceitful Owning and not Own∣ing, as G. F. in his late Book Exalting the Heathen — Answ. This is thy false Charge: for we Really Own the Scrip∣tures. And G. F. Magnifieth the Lord, and Exalteth that of God in the Heathen, which was condemned by such, as thou and the New-England-Priests, that have no Scripture. As, let the Reader read over the Book called Heathens Divinity, and let him see, whether he doth Exalt the Heathen, or the Lord on their be∣half. R. W. And thou say'st; How full are their Books against Perse∣cutors. Answ. And well they may be, for we have felt the stroke of it,
even to DEATH in New-England; amongst whom there is manifest, both their Profession and Principle to be False, and not according to the Primitive Church. R. W. He bringeth (G. F.'s Fol. 170.) John Stallam, saying: [The Magistrate is not to level the Law with the Light in every Man's Conscience. Again, If the Magistrates be in the Light, and discern the Mind of Christ, and discern his Law, is he to Compel all the Nation and Common-Wealth to come to the Practice of his Light?] G. F. Answereth: [The Magistrate of Christ, the Help-Government for him, he is in the Light and Power of Christ: and he is to subject all under the Power of Christ into his Light, else he is not a Faithful Magistrate, (to wit, the High∣er Power.) And his Laws are Agreeable, and Answerable according to that of God in every Man:p. 108. When men act con∣trary to it, they do Evil. So he is a Terror to the Evil-doers, and discerneth the Pretious and the Just from the Vile: and this is a Praise to them that do well.] [I Query of R. W. Whether the Fundamental Laws are not ac∣cording to the Spirit of God and Scripture? whether it is not said, The Laws of England hang upon these two Hinges? and then, Whe∣ther Magistrates must not be according to the Laws? And the Higher Power never did the Prophets cry against, but the Corrup∣tion in Magistrates: neither doth G. F. as here was testified in OLIVER's Dayes, when these Priests-Opposers said, That we denyed Magistrates. But R. W. Must not the Christian Magi∣strates be in the Light of Christ? and must they not punish Evil-doers; to wit, Adultery, Fornication, Theft, Murder? &c. and are not these Actions Contrary to Christ? And then, if they punish these things; do not they subject unto the Light of Christ? For our Prin∣ciple is, To bring all people from those, and other Evils: Or, must not these Evils be punisht, and the Magistrate of the Laws keep down such Evils with his Higher Power? &c. But what is this to matter of Religion, seeing R. W. saith, That they are a Praise of them that Do Well? Such as Do Well, walk in the Light, and walk in the Spirit, that mortifieth Sin; and worship God in Spirit and Truth: Such the Magistrate is a Praise unto, and doth not Punish; except they turn their Sword backward, (as the New-Eng∣land-Priests) and let Evil-doers at Liberty: But more of this here∣after.] But let the Reader see, if there be any such thing in G. F.'s Answer to John Stallam, That G. F. intendeth there,p. 139.
that Magistrates, in Christ must fight for their Christ against all Opposers. Answ. This is R. W.'s false Surmising Charge: but these are the New-England-Men, that Fight for their Religion and false Christ. But G. F. saith, The Magistrates in the Light are for the punishing of the Evil doers, as the Apostle saith. And will not R. W. have the Christian Magistrates enlightned by Christ? and to have the Higher Power, that they may punish Drunkards, Perjurous persons, Whoremongers and Thieves? &c. for such is G. F. speaking of: he doth not speak of Religion, and the worship of God, as the unprejudic'd Reader may see his Words. R. W. Bringeth (Fol. G. F. p. 221) Hosannah, &c. saying: [They know not Absolute Perfection, that are admitting of Mea∣sures and Degrees; or come to the Day of the Bright Morning-Star: and the Bright Morning-Star is not Risen.] G. F. answer∣eth [Did not the Apostle speak, that they were Children of the Day, and the Night was over, and knew the whole Body; and yet said, he would not go beyond his Measure? and doth he not speak of the Stature, and Measure and Fulness of Christ? were they not come to Perfection▪ and spoke Wisdom among them that were Perfect?] And R. W. Replieth, and falleth a-Rail∣ing (his Wonted Course) Monstrous Pride, &c. and then thou askest, whether Paul speaketh of his Measure in Holiness, or no? Answ. What should it be in else? But R. W. is this thy Way to prove thy false Assertions by asking of Questions? But let R. W. show these Words [Omnipotent, Omnipresent, Omniscient] in G. F.'s Book, or any other of our Books, where we say, That we are in Power Omnipotent, Omnipresent and Omnisci∣ent, as he chargeth us? And G. F. speaketh of the Perfection, that God, and Christ and the Apostles exhort unto. And thou makest a great Story about Perfection; but to no purpose. And Paul (saith he) spoke Wisdom among them that were Perfect; but not that Wisdom of this World, which denieth Perfection. And as for all thy Railing Expression and Vnsavory Language, they are all return'd home again to thee; thou hadst better, to have kept them within. And where doth G. F. say, That a Child though Perfect, is equal to a Man? or a Cup is equal to a Tun or Pipe?p. 110. all this thou might'st have kept at home: this is no Proof against our Principle and Profession. As for Blckish, Blasphemous Fallacy and Contradictions R. W. thou
might'st have kept at home thy Railing Expressions, it doth not become thy Gray Hairs; but that the whole Body may be known, which serve to Compleat the Saints into an Entire Stature (see Ephes. 3, 18, 19. Col. 2, 10. and 4, 12.) and yet here may be a Growth still (Ephes. 4.13, 14.) R. W. bringeth Hosannah, &c. (G.F. Fol. p. 222.) saying [Christ is without his Saints in Respect of his Bodily Presence.] G. F. Answ. [How are they Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone? How can they Eat of his Flesh, and Drink his Blood? And how have they his Mind and Spirit, and he in them, and they in him? and sitting in Heavenly Places? And he is the Head of his Church; and how then is he Absent, ye poor Apostates from him, that feel not Christ! But he is with the Saints, and they feel him.] And R. W. replieth, and asketh; Is this Eating of the Flesh of Christ, and Drinking his Blood Corporal (or Visible) or Spiritual? Answ. Why! Dost not thou know R. W. Christ saith, His Words are Spirit and Life? And is this thy Proving, when to prove thy Charges, thou art asking Questions? We tell thee, None can eat the Flesh of Christ without Faith. And thou further Beggest Questions concerning a sitting in Heavenly Places in Christ Jesus: We tell thee, the Apostle speaketh, We sit together in Hea∣venly Places in Christ Jesus (Ephes. 2.) and, He that Sanctifieth, and they that are Sanctified, are all of One (the Hebr. telleth thee.) And we hold, that Christ is the Head of the Church, as the Apostle did; and we do not direct you to the Pope: But we bid you, Repent, and turn you from Darkness to Light, and so to Christ; whom ye must come to know, Christ the Head. And did not the Heavens open, so that Steven saw Christ by the Holy Ghost, at the Right Hand of God? And what Body was that, that some did Eat (as the Apostle saith) as ate and drank Vn∣worthily, nor discerning the Lord's Body? and then must not the Lord's Body be discerned by True Believers? and was not this after Christ was Ascended? And the Ground of R. W. and the persecuting Priests is, They would neither have Christ, nor his Light to be within them; nor to feed upon his Heavenly Bread, which cometh from Heaven, which he calleth his Flesh; nor drink his Blood, which is the Saints Food, upon which they Live. And the Jews said of Christ, How can we eat his Flesh? and so per∣secuted the Apostles, which were of his Flesh and Bones. R. W. falleth a railing, and saith; An Adulterous Wretch accu∣seth
Joseph of Whoredom, &c. who was a Pattern of pure and holy Chastity:p. 111. For, whom do these Whorish Brood of Foxians brand for Apostates, and fling among them Firebrands, Arrows and Death? Answ. This is R. W.'s and his New-England-Priests and Pro∣fessors Condition; he might well have kept this at home, who is Adulterated from the Light and Spirit of Christ Jesus, and call∣eth it an Idol. And now flingeth his and their Fire-brands at such, as be in the Purity and holy Chastity of Joseph, against the Chil∣dren of God, whom we are. That Spirit in the Whorish Egypti∣ans, the Whorish Jews, you the Whorish New-England Men and R. W. casteth his Fire-brands after us; but that, which the New-England-Professors BRANDED them withal, their Marks are to be seen this Day! And these Railing Expressions do not prove R. W.'s Assertion; but prove his own Principles false, and his Profession Railing. And the Souls under the Altar, those that kept the Testimony of Jesus, as we have done against Deluders (as thou speakest of) and the First Churches, and the Apostles of Christ, they did not call the Light of Christ an Idol; but they saw Christ, who was Ascended into Heaven, and yet was manifest in them by his Spirit. And the Apostle saith, They came to sit down in Heavenly Places in Christ Jesus (though he was Ascended into Heaven;) and was not this in Spirit? And— R. W. thou say'st, They mean no such Individual Man or Per∣son, but a Mind ad Spirit; and such a Christ, as hath no Indivi∣dual, Bodily Presence, as we and all men have. Answ. Christ hath no such Sinful Body, as all men have; If so, I would have R. W. prove it by Scripture. But doth not the Apostle say, He is made like unto us, Sin excepted? But that by R. W. is left out; he would have his a Corruptible Body, as him∣self (as we shall see hereafter, whether he doth not maintain Christ to have a Corruptible Body.) But we query of R. W. whe∣ther it is not the Work of him (and all those Priests, that Op∣posed us in Oliver's Dayes) to shut Christ and his Spirit, his Light and his Presence out from the Saints? as is clearly seen: as one of these Priests Scoffingly and Carnally said, How can a Man of four foot long be within us? And this is false for thee to say, That we would have all the Saints of God to be Apostates, & fall from God and Christ: Paul saith, Christ is a Mystery; and so he is a My∣stery still to them, to whom he is not Revealed. And —
R. W. Thou say'st, If of G. F. when he is in New-England, one should say, He is in London in his Bodily Presence, and that his Friends feel'd his Bodily Presence there, because they feel his Love and Affections there in their Minds and Spirits, &c. Answ. Is this a fit Comparison R. W? Doth not the Apostle say of Christ, That He is Ascended above All, that he might fill All? &c. and doth not the Apostle say, That they, that have no the Spirit of Christ, are none of his? And is not he cal∣led the Heavenly Man? and is not he, as he is called the Hea∣venly Man, the Head of the Church? is not he called the Second Man, the Lord from Heaven? and the Apostle saith; As we have born the Image of the Earthly, we shall bear al∣so the Image of the Heavenly: and now, The Saints shall bear the Image of the Heavenly; my Query is, Whether Christ must bear the Image of the Earthly in Heaven? (1 Cor. 15.) And — R. W. Thou say'st, I will turn my Thoughts higher: O thou most Glorious Sun of Righteousness, Truth and Holiness! shine forth, and let it be seen, how the Devil calleth the Lord Jesus Beelzebub. Answ. But R. W. Dost not thou Call the Lord Jesus Christ an Idol and a Frantick Light? THOV art the Man. And dost not thou say (in this page) his People are Horrible, Egyptian, Canting (Languague,) Juggling, Whorish Brood, Adulterous wretches, Whoredom, Fire-brands? so thy High Thoughts are in the Dirt; not fit, to take the Name of the Lord Jesus in thy Mouth. And — R. W. Thou say'st, They boast with the Bloody Papists, and o∣ther Traitors and Rebels against thee. Answ. This thou might'st have applied to thy self and the New-England-Priests, for it is thy own: for we have shed none of your BLOOD, the Lord knoweth it! And when did we break down your Altars? and Burn your Temples and your Altars? &c. R. W. Is not all this a false Profession and a false Principle? and is this to prove our Profession and Principles full of Contradiction and Hypocrisy? This is thy own Profession. And we do Challenge all you New-England-Professors and Priests, what Altars have we broke down? and what Temples have we burnt? &c? this is a Lying Spirit R. W. that leadeth thee, not the Spirit of Christ. R. W. Thou say'st, They cry up a false and Hellish Christ within them,p. 112. &c. Christen him with the Name of Light. Answ. R. W. Thou can'st not tell, how to invent Wicked Words
enough against the Lord Jesus Christ, that Died at Jerusalem, and is Risen, at the Right Hand of God; who enlightneth every Man, that Cometh into the World: surely, thy Spirit would have Roar'd against the Apostle, if thou hadst been in his Day. Now it's clear, thou neither ownest Scriptures, nor Christ there: And instead of proving our Principles and Profession false, thou mani∣festest thy own to be Wicked; and not so Wicked against us, but against the Lord Jesus Christ and his Light, which he Light∣eth every Man, that Cometh into the World, withal. For (I say) if thou had'st been in the Apostle's Dayes, he Preached Christ within the Hope of Glory; and his Work was To present every Man Perfect in Christ Jesus: and the Apostle said and told them, Christ was in them, except they were Reprobates: and Christ said, I in you, and you in Me, &c. and pray'd the Father, That where he was, there they might be to behold his Glory: And what dost thou think, the Saints must behold his Glory now? And this Christ thou callest False and a Hellish Christ: O Wickedness! thou wilt find him a Heavy Stone! Nay, dost not thou call him a Con∣quered Slave? an Angel of Light? art thou not worse than the Jews, that Crucified him, and Pilate? did they ever give him such Names, as thou hast done the Only Begotten Son of God? is this thy N. England-Profession of the Only Begotten Son of God full of Grace and Truth, which is manifest in his People? the LORD DELIVER all good Christians from them! For we can expect no other Work, but what they have done (if R. W. and their Principles be one concerning Christ Jesus, the Holy One of Israel) but to HANG, BANISH, and WHIP, and BRAND with an HOT IRON, and SPOIL the GOODS of the Members and Followers of Christ Jesus! Surely, all their Consciences are not so sear'd with an Hot Iron, as R. W.'s is against the True Lord Jesus Christ; who casteth a Flood of Wickedness against him and his Light: but we expect no other, it is nothing to us. R. W. Bringeth James Brown, that saith, [The Kingdom of Heaven that is in the Saints, is not in the Pharisees. (Fol. G. F. p. 259.] G. F. Answ. [That which is in the Saints, is in the Pharisees in a Measure, though it be but as a Grain of Mus∣tard-seed, or as a Little Leaven: (But this is fully Answered in the Append. where he bringeth it there.) And R. W. Re∣plieth, and bringeth (Luke 11.12.) Christ's Saying, If I by the Finger of God cast out Devils, no doubt, the Kingdom of God is
come upon you: And this R. W. Malitiously bringeth to Oppose Christ's Words cited, when the Pharisees demanded of Christ, When the Kingdom should come? he answered them and said; The Kingdom of Heaven cometh not with Observations, neither shall they say, Lo here, or Lo there: for behold, the Kingdom of God is within you, (Luke 17.) Now, whether must we believe Christ or R. W? And this he bringeth to Disprove our Principles and Profession not to be True; and hath here manifest his own Profession and Principle not to be according to Christ. And — R. W. Thou say'st, That the Pharisees expected a Temporal Kingdom: and yet thou say'st, Christ's Visible Kingdom is his Church. And the Apostle telleth thee, His Kingdom standeth in Power, &c. and the Holy Ghost; and what is Visible, but Tem∣poral? And we do not say, That the Pharisees had such a King∣dom as the Saints, in Joy and Peace with the Holy Ghost; for their Darkness could not comprehend the Light, therefore they were not like to receive such a Kingdom. And what Kingdom was this in the Pharisees, if it was not a Measure of the Seed, which Christ Soweth in all Grounds, and of the Spirit, and of the Light, which enlightneth every man that cometh into the World? R. W. And whereas thou Scoffingly say'st, What do We talk of Measures, but that We are all one in Quality and Equality? &c. Answ. Let the Reader see, if there be any such Words in G. F.'s Answer? R. W. cannot bridle his Tongue, and keep in the Rule. But — R. W. Thou say'st, What a Stinking Work do these proud Phari∣sees make of Christianity! how justly, &c. Answ. This R. W. might have applied at home, his Stinking Work and proud Pharisees, &c. What! must not we own Christ's words, nor Scripture? Were not they Fools, blind Guides and Pha∣risees, that would not own Christ's Doctrine? and so it may be said Still of R. W. R. W. Asketh the Reason, Why this Seed doth not Grow, and this Leaven doth not Spread within the Pharisees? Can a Nation be Subject to the King of England or Spain,p. 113. &c. and yet not know how? nor have no Knowledge or Feel∣ing of it at all? Can there be such a God, such a Spirit, such a Fire, ea, but such a Mustard-seed or Leaven, such a Teacher, and yet not grow, not prevail, nor prosper, nor be perceived? ye Fools and Blind! And so goeth on a-railing to the end of pag. 113.
Answ. Here thou hast manifest thy self to be as Blind as the Pharisees, concerning the Doctrine of the Kingdom of Heaven within, as Christ preached. For is it not the same Seed, that is sown upon all Sorts of Grounds by the Seeds-Man; though Christ tellth thee, Ye are Thorns and Stony Hearts, and what ye do to the Seed? And is it not the same Light, that enlightneth every man that cometh into the World, which the Saints believed in; which Thou, and the Pharisees and the New-England-Professors hate, and thou callest an ? So thy principle and profession is False, and not agreeable to the Primitive profession and principle. And is not the same Grace, which bringeth Salvation, appeared to All Men, which the Wicked turn into Wantonness, and walk despitefully against it? And is not the same Spirit, which is poured out upon All Flesh, by which the Sons and Daughters Prophesy? &c. but if thou quenchest the Spirit, and turnest the Grace of God into Wantonness, and the Carnal Mind choke the Seed, and erre from the Spirit, then thou may'st say; Why doth it not Grow? Why doth not Leaven Spread? Why doth it not Spring? Why don't it Grow? and, Why are they not Subjects to the King? and yet thou art building the Tombs of the Righteous. And all such, that erre from the Spirit, turn the Grace of God into Wanton∣ness, and hate his Light, and by their Carnal Mind choke the Seed, and are Rebels to the Kingdom of Heaven: and go, read the Talent of the Slothful Servant. However, thou hast improv'd the Devil's Talent, and hidden the Lord's, thou and the New-England-Priests; and therefore ye persecute him with your Tongue and Hand: and a many Vnsavoury Words, that are in this page, which are not worth mentioning. And so in all this thou hast prov'd thy self not to have the Spirit of Christ Jesus; but an Oppo∣ser of his Doctrine, and prov'd thy own profession and principle False, and contrary to Christ's and the Apostle's words. R. W. Thou say'st, That the Quakers Religion is He∣resy,p. 114. and they themselves Hereticks in the Matters of God's Worship. Answ. The Religion we maintain, which the Apostles above 1600. years since set up, which is Pure, &c. and therefore we forsake yours. And the Worship of God, which Christ set up 1600. years ago, this we in Practice maintain: and we do not differ from the Servants of God, the Prophets and Apostles; but we have Unity with them in the Faith and Spirit of God, Glory
to the Lord God for ever! And we believe, we Shall prove thee in the Heresy thou speakest of; which thou confessest, John Stub stood up and said, That Heresy was defined by some, to be an Opinion obstinately stood in against the First Christian Purity: and this thou confessest too. First thou say'st R. W. That our Religion, Way or Sect was False, &c. and upon this Ground R. W. will prove, Our Religion is not only Heresy in Matters of Worship, but also in Doctrines of Repentance, Faith, &c. Now come on R. Willi∣ams, make good thy Charge, and see, if thou hast not thrown thy self in the same Condition, as thou chargest us. R. W. Thou say'st, First, as to Worship We deny the Converting or Gathering of Saints into Visible Congregations, affirming the Church to be Invisible, the Ministry Invisible, the Baptism and Sup∣per Invisible. Answ. Let the People in New-Engand Judge, whether we do not Gather people into Visible Assemblies? let their Meetings there speak. And though we do say, as the Apostle saith (1 Thes. 1.2. 2 Thes. .) The Church is in God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ; yet the Saints Bodies were Visible upon the Earth: and thou that deniest this Doctrine, deniest this Primitive Doctrine; and so holdest another Opinion, than the Apostles did: And the Mi∣nisters of Christ are Ministers of the Spirit, though their Bodies be Visible, while they be upon Earth. And we never said, That Outward Assemblies, or Outward Men, which did eat Outward Bread and Wine, (which is Visible) were Invisible; this is a Lying Charge from a Lying Spirit: But the Baptism with the Holy Ghost and with the Spirit, which is the Baptism of Christ, we charge R. W. and his New-England-Priests to prove that Visible, and by Scripture. But whom hath R. W. Converted in New-England? who are his Assembly? if he cannot shew them, his Epistles, as the Apostles could, then he is gone away from the Institutions of the Lord Jesus Christ and his Messengers, &c. and cometh under his own Charge, and not we: And where is the Assembly of R. W.'s, and with whom? And we tell R. W. that he must come to Re∣pentance from his Dead Works, and Faith towards God, before he cometh to know the Christians true Religion. And whereas — R. W. speaketh of the Two Doctrines of Laying on of Hands, and of Baptismes, concerning the Circumstances of which God is pleased to permit his Children lovingly differing and discussing, &c. Answ. If these things, Baptism, Laying on of Hands, &c. Anoint∣ing
with Oil and Washing the Saints Feet be laid aside and practi∣sed not by R. W. and his New-England-Priests, and if that were Institutions, and delivered by Christ and his Apostles for practice in worship or doctrine to be held up in the Church; Then if you be gone from the practice of these things, then are you fallen and gone away from the Institutions of the Lord Jesus Christ delivered by him, his Apostles and Messengers, and so fallen into that, which thou chargest the Quakers with: and so proved thy self a HY∣POCRITE, to Charge others with Neglect of that, which thou dost not practise thy self. R. W. Thou say'st; Repentance, it was an Heavenly and Saving Work of God upon the Soul, &c. and it was preach'd by Moses and the Prophets,p. 115 by John Baptist, by Christ Je∣sus and his Apostles, Luke 24. And Christ sent his A∣postles to preach the Gospel to all Nations, &c. Answ. This disproveth R. W.'s Charges against us. For as the Lord hath commanded us to preach Repentance, yea, in New-England (as the people well knoweth) yea, and to himself (as he hath confest) and to other Nations; but he and his New-England Priests, like a Company of Hard-hearted Jews, stopped their Ears to it. But doth R. W. and the New-England-Priests go into all Nations, and preach Repentance and the Gospel accor∣ding to his own Charge? if not, he and the New-England-Priests are gone away from the First Institution of Christ, his Apostles and Messengers; and your Repentance is no more than the Papists thou speakest on, who remain in your Persecuting Spirit Vnrepented of. So it's no true Repentance: and your principle and profession is no sound principle or profession, whilst thou wouldst have God's peo∣ple PVNISHED; and the New-England Priests Persecute them: Those Christians, that are come to true Repentance, they Love one another, and they Love Enemies; and their Repentance is be∣yond yours, and the Scribes and Pharisees, which do Persecute. So it's clear, that thine and the New-England Professor's Repen∣tance is no true Repentance, whose Hands are full of BLOOD and Cruelty, and whose Tongue is full of Persecution. And — R. W. Thou say'st; The Protestants protested against this Re∣pentance of the Papists and Quakers. Answ. And why against the Papists? but is it not clear, that R. W.'s and his New-England-Priests and Professors Repentance is but like the Papists, Saul's, Ahab's and Pharaoh's, and the
Philistians and Judas's? For have not ye Protestants in NewEng∣land manifested your Swords and Staves against the people of God call'd Quakers, that have warn'd you to Repent? and HANG'D, BVRNT with an HOT IRON, CVT OFF EARS and SPOIL'D the GOODS of the people of God? and your Repentance is not come so far as Judas's was, to make Restitution of the GOODS you have SPOIL'D. And because R. W. liveth under a Go∣vernment, where he cannot have the Magistrates to punish us; yet he saith, he desireth, that we might be punisht: So it seem∣eth, he wanteth Magistrates; yet we must be Punisht, though it be in Matter of Conscience. But Christ and the Apostles give him no such Command: and therefore his Repentance is a false Repentance; and he is out of the Spirit, that Christ and the A∣postles were in, which was to Love Enemies, & Overcome Evil with Good, if there were such a thing. And it's plain (and true) that the Church of New-England is the Whore, because the BLOOD of the Saints is found in her: But God will reward her, and them that are in her and cry her up! And — R. W. Thou say'st; For all their Craking of Fear and Trembling▪ &c. there hath appeaed no Sense of Godly sorrow, &c. and Brokenness of Heart in them for their Sinful Nature, &c. but immediately upon their Bowing down to Satan,p 116. and Owning him as a Light, and Christ and Spirit with∣in, &c. Answ. R. W. Thou in the Spirit of Horrid Blasphemy against Christ, his Spirit and Light within art not like to be Sensible of our Sorrows and Brokenness of Heart! And here hast not thou manifest thy self an Vn-repented Man, worse than Judas? For did ever Judas or the Papists, nay the Turks call the Lord Je∣sus Christ, the Only-Begotten Son of the Father (who is full of Grace and Truth,R. W. is turned an Atheist. who saith himself, he is the Light of the World) did they ever call Christ, and his Light and his Spirit Satan? and they, that Bowed down to Christ, a Bowing down to Satan? O Blasphemer! what an Age of Darkness and Blasphemy are the New-England-Priests come into, that hold orth such a Doctrine! And here is it not clear (let all that fear God, see) how R. W. is Degenerated, and his New-England-Priests (if this be their Doctrine) from the Doctrine of the Apostle, as he falsly chargeth the Quakers? For the Apostle turn'd people from Darkness to
Light, &c. (this he confessed in his Examination, as may be seen in the Acts) and open'd the Eyes of the Blind, &c. and after that he had preach'd Christ's Death and Resurrection, and at the Right Hand of God, and many come to believe, he preach'd Christ within them, except they be Reprobates; and told them, that the Light that shined in their Hearts, gave them Knowledge. And so thou goest on with many false Accusations; which are Answered in other places. And — R. W. Thou say'st, VVhy should they say Thee and Thou to the Aged, Learned, Holy and High? Ans. This R. W. bringeth, that we are gone from the Institutions of Christ and his Apostles (as in pag. 114); but we Charge R. W. and the New-England-priests, where Christ and the Apostles insti∣tuted, that we should say YOV to a Single person? But who are these Learned, Holy and High? Is it R. W. and his New-England-priests, that set themselves in the place of God, and call themselves Holy and High? but it is himself▪ that is the Aged. And was not our patience manifest, in bearing thy Cankcred Spirit, which utter'd forth all these railing words against us, let the people Judge? R. W. And thou say'st, Why should they not st Silent? even Scores and Hundreds of them (possessed with a dumb Spirit) as in a Form and Order of Christian worship, waiting for the Spirit. Answ. R. W. Had better been Silent, who hath brought forth such an Evil work; and to have VVaited upon Christ, as we do, who speak, as the Spirit giveth us Vtterance. Which was the practice of the Church of the primitive Times, which thou art erred from; and now scoffingly callest Dumb Spirit, because thy Railing Spirit were not fed with words according to thy Will. And this is a False Charge of thine [VVe wait for the Spirit] But we VVait for the Signifi∣cation and Motion of the Spirit; for the Holy men of God spoke, as they were Moved by the Holy Ghost: But thou say'st, There is no Voice nor Motion within, that is to be turn'd to, lissen'd to, or hearken'd to in Heavenly Things (as page 83.) And now, Is not R. VV. gone into the Darkness, and from the VVay of all the Ho∣ly Prophets, and Holy Apostles, and Holy Men of God, that Spoke, when they were Moved by the Holy Ghost? And is not R W. in the Steps of the Jews, that Christ speaketh to, that had neither heard the Voice of the Father at any time, nor seen his Shape? R. W. Thou sayst, The Protestants both English, French and Dutch have manifested against the Papists, and therein against the
Quakers, That Repentance is a Turning of the whole Soul from all Sin as Sin to all of God, as God. Answ. What must we infer from his words in this place? If that R. W. and his New-England-Priests and others be Turn'd so from all Sin by the Repentance to God as God, that they are as Pure as God, as Holy as God, as Righteous as God? and yet he findeth Fault with this in the Quakers? But we must try R. W. by his Fruits, and his Protestants, (especially in New Eng∣land) if their Repentance and his be not like to the Papists? and how dare R. W. speak of this Repentance, when he Blasphemeth so much against the Light of Christ, and calleth it an Idol and a Frantick Light? But that which he casteth upon us, is come upon himself; who like the Pharisees of Old their Conversion and Sin is from one Sin to another: and their Swelling Pride of a Dropsie and Tympany, &c. (as he scoffingly speaketh of) of his Conceited Faith, Repentance, Justification, Sanctification, Mortifi∣cation, &c. all this he might have applied at home, and to his New-England-Priests, who all along proveth himself and his New-England Professors to be the very people in the things, he Chargeth upon us. And it were well, if ye could see nothing, but Hell and Damnation in your selves, as thou speakest of! but this ye cannot See, until ye come to the Spirit and Light of Christ, which thou callest Blasphemously an Idol and a Fancy: and therefore art not like to See the true Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ and his Light. And thou sayst — R. W. How do they Superciliouy and Pope-like belch out as from Hell, God, I thank thee, that I am not like these Publicans.p 117. Answ. R. W. and his New-England-Priests might have kept this at home, with his superciliouy, as he calleth it (if he had found such a word in G. F.'s Book, he would have roar'd and made some work at it, and shewn it in print:) but Roger hath not hit our Conditions, but himself. And — R. W. Thou sayst: How instantly do they rail, revile, condemn and curse, breath out Fire, &c. as Fire & Brimstone from the mountains in Sicily, &c. against all that oppose them; far from the Teaching of Christ and his first Messengers, as Lambs, &c. Answ. Let the Sober Reader look in R. W.'s Book and see, how he Condemneth himself and his Practice. But how doth R. W. Rail against the Papists and Mahomet, yea, Protestants
too, as Formal! and hath not R. W. and his New-England-Priests done more than Breathing out Fire from the Mountains of Sicily, who have Hang'd, and Burnt with an Hot Iron? O! he and they might shame (if they had any in them) thus to up∣braid the People of God called Quakers, and to tell them, they be in Cain's Nature, and Core's and Balaam's, and the Phari∣sees, and Jezabel's and the Whore's, that drinketh the Blood of the Saint's, when Y have done it; and persecute for Religion, like Nebuchadnezar: this is not Railing. And to tell R. W. when he calleth the Light of Christ an Idol and a Fancy, and tellest him, he is a Blasphemer; this is not Railing: And when R. W. saith, A Bowing to Christ his Light and Spirit is a Bowing to Satan, (as in pag. 116.) to tell him, he is a Blasphemer against Christ's Light and Spirit; this is not Railing. But we do not matter, what he and the New-England-Priests say against us: but it woundeth our Souls and Spirits, to hear the Son of God, in whom he is well pleased, to be thus blasphemed by such, that falsly calleth himself a Christian! And Christ did not Rail, when he cried Wo against the Blind Scribes and Pharisees, calling them Whited Walls, and said, They were of their Father the Devil: nor the Apostles, who called such as he, Evil Beast and Slow-Bellies, and cried Wo against such, as went into the Way of Cain. Nei∣ther did they Rail against Elymas and Simon the Sorcerer, which Spoke Truth unto them. But thou, that givest us Names, to the Lambs and Children of God, and hast no Motion within of Hea∣venly things of Supernatural Light, art degenerated from the Spi∣rit and Practice, the Saints were in in the Primitive Times: I and J. B. do maintain and preach true Repentance towards God, and Faith in Christ Jesus, as the Apostles did. And thou sayst, He continued above half an hour, though not so long as W. Edmondson in preaching this Doctrine: But why did'st not set it down? and thou confessest, They delivered many holy Truths of God (p. 119) R. W. Thou goest about to Prove, Our Faith is False. Answ. But we shall see, if R. W. hath not prov'd his own and his New-England Priests and professors Faith contrary to Christ's and the Apostles, and the Faith of God's Elect, which Christ Jesus is the Author and Finisher of. And is not R. W. erred from this Doctrine and Faith, who maintaineth with Fr. Duke, The Scripture to be the Ground of Christ's Faith and the Saints? (pag. 102, 103, 104.) and so erred from the Apostles in
the Primitive Times, who said, Look unto Jesus, the Ground, Au∣thor and Finisher of Faith: He did not bid them, Look to the Scrip∣ture, the Ground, Author and Finisher of Faith; but to Christ. And— R. W. thou sayst, That thou wouldst demonstrate by Instances out of G. F.'s Book all along, that he confounded and made all one both Faith and Justification, &c. and made Believing in Christ but a meer Babel;p. 118. and fallest a-railing, because that G. F. saith, He that hath Faith, hath Repentance, hath Justi∣fication, Sanctification, &c. Answ. But dost not thou Confound thy self? for thou sayst, That Repentance is a Turning of the whole Soul from all Sin as Sin to all of God as God (as this is R. W.'s Form of Words:) and yet R. W. have not they then, that have Repentance, Faith, Justification and Sanctification? And G. F.'s words are, He that hath Faith, hath Repentance: Can any have Faith without Repentance? or any Justification without Repentance and Faith? or any have Sanctifi∣cation without Repentance & Faith? & thou wouldst have Justification & Sanctification without Faith and Repentance; Thou mayst keep thy Babel to thy self. And Christ Jesus, that preach'd Repentance, saith, Believe in the Light, that you may become Children of Light: and this Light thou callest an Idol and a Fancy; and so hast plainly ma∣nifest, thou art no true Believer in the Lord Jesus Christ, nor true Christian: and who wouldst have Faith, Justification and Sanctification without Repentance, hast neither true Faith, Justi∣fication, Sanctification. And so as for Babel, Non-sense, Confusion, Monstrous thou mayst keep at home. R. W. And thou sayst, Thou told'st us, that we and the Pa∣pists talk of Faith, and G. F. talk'd much of Faith. Answ. As for the Papists Faith, thou and the New-England-Priests might have applied at home. But for the Saints Faith, it is the True, which Jesus Christ is the Author of: and we have received it from him, and not from Men. And thou in dispro∣ving our Faith, thou hast prov'd thy self out of the True Faith in Christ, which thou opposest. R. W. And so thou sayst, They have put out the True and Liv∣ing Faith; and have put in a painted or Glass-eye in the Room of it. Answ. This is thy own condition, who deniest the Faith in Christ Jesus, that he is the Author and Finisher of: Which in all
this Work thou goest about to overthrow, but thou canst not. R. W. And thou sayst, True Faith is Receiving of Christ Jesus as only King, Priest and Prophet: it is believing on and receiving of Christ distinct from God, Joh. 14. And, This true Lord Jesus Christ the Quakers turn into a meer Fiction, Dream or Imagina∣ry Christ in the Mind of Man, &c. And thou fall'st a-railing, and tellest us, We are like the Papists, and sayst; The Quakers Transubstantiation is worse, then the Fantastick Transubstantiation of the Papists. Answ. How can R. W. receive Christ Jesus as a Priest, King and Prophet, and believe in him, who call'st the True Light of Christ an Idol, which John bore Witness unto? Or be a Believer, as Christ Commanded and said, Be a Believer in the Light; and he calleth this Light a Fancy? So no Believer in the True Christ, nor no Receiver of Christ, King, Priest and Prophet. Neither is R. W. in the True Faith, which Christ Jesus is the Author and Finisher of, who maintaineth, The Scripture is the Ground of Christ's Faith and the Saints; yet he saith, Christ is afore Scrip∣ture: And he confesseth, that Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, &c, had Faith afore Scriptures; and again he saith, That true Faith is Receiving of Christ. But let R. W. and his New-England-Priests prove by Scripture, That God (the Creator of all things) and the true Lord Jesus Christ, his Son (whom we believe in accord∣ing to Scripture, as the Prophets and Apostles did) can be turn'd into a Fiction and Dream: let him make this Blasphemy good by Scripture, if he can. And R. W. who calleth himself Orator, did the Apostles turn Christ into an Imaginary Christ, Dream and Fiction, when they preach'd Christ in you, except ye be Reprobates? and is this Worse, than the Papists Transubstantiation? prove this by Scripture: And thou art degenerated and the New-England-Priests (if this be their Doctrine and Preaching) of Christ and the Apostles in the Primitive Times. R. W. And then thou sayst, that we say, All Spirit, and no Body; and so not consisting of Flesh and Spirit: and yet thou con∣tradictest thy self and say'st, We are of his flesh, &c, And then thou fall'st a-railing, and thou sayst, That we say, All must die and rot, and never rise again (and sayst) So you have blown up and Juggled away the Flesh of Christ Jesus, both his and your own altogether. And further thou sayst, We can give no Ac∣count
of the Flesh of the Man Christ Jesus: and thou fallest a-railing. Answ. Dost not thou see, how thou Contradictest thy self? but instead of proving thy false Charge, thou hast utter'd forth many more false Charges. Where did ever we say in any of our Books, That we shall not rise again, or, That Christ is not risen? The same that Descended, is the same that is Ascended, and at the Right Hand of God: did not we confess this before thee at Newport? and yet thou Wickedly sayst, That we can give no Account of; when we gave Account according to Scripture, as the Apostle saith. And did not we say, that we believe the Re∣surrection, as the Apostle did? and as we have born the Image of the Earthly, so we shall bear the Image of the Heavenly? 1 Cor. 15. R. W. And thou sayst, The Quakers, which grant Christ Jesus to have been born, lived and died, as we, &c. [and here thou overthrowest thy Babel of false Charges:] And then thou Contradictest thy self and sayst,p. 119. And yet now Transub∣stantiated into a Spirit and the Quakers Flesh; so that in the upshot the Christ, in whom they believe, is vanished (by an Hellish Chymistry) into themselves, &c. Answ. R. W. How far art thou degenerated from the Apostles Doctrine! did the Apostles say so, when they preach'd Christ within and said, They were Flesh of his Flesh, and Bone of his Bone? And Christ saith, Except ye eat my Flesh, and drink my Blood, ye have no Life in you, &c. and wouldst thou keep us from our Heavenly Food, by which we have Life? And art not thou worse then the Jews, that loaded the Manna from Heaven, who addest Lie unto Lie to prove thy false Charge? but the Father of Lies hath set thee at Work, and the Day will come, when Christ will reward thee, who Blasphemest him! R. W. And thou sayst, They do believe on themselves, and that lying Spirit within them. Answ. R. W. Thou canst not speak Truth, thou art not like indeed: this is another false Charge. For we believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, as he hath taught and the Apostles, and deny Our selves and thy Lying Spirit within thee. And we know thy con∣dition, where thou art and the New-England-Priests, better than thy self: and if you had been good, we would not have for∣saken you. And — R. W. Confessed, That J. B. had delivered many Holy Truths
of God: and yet thou sayst, At this there was a deep Silence, a If I had turn'd a Proselite; at least it pleased them to be ap∣plauded. Answ. Nay, R. W. we saw the Subtilty of the Serpent in thee: And if I B. had spoken many Holy Truths, why didst thou not join with them? it seemeth, thy spirit could not join with Holy Truths. And then thou speakest of Repentance, and Being saved by the Blood of Christ Jesus, and of Living soberly and righteously: Then how cometh all this Vngratious Language from thee, if thou art to live soberly and righteously? these are but Words R. W. And how canst thou be Saved by the Blood of Christ and Repent, and not believe in the Light, as Christ commandeth, by which thou must see thy Sin and Evil Heart? And so thou hast prov'd thy Faith and Repentance to be Antichristian, and not at all dis∣prov'd ours. And so thy Faith and Repentance may go along with the Papists, as thou speakest of, who opposest the Faith of God's Elect, that purifieth their hearts: and that is thy false Faith, that purifieth not the heart. R. W. And thou scoffingly say'st, That we might have preach'd (to wit, I B. and I S.) this Doctrine of Faith and Repentance be∣fore the Pope at Rome at his Chappel. Answ. Here R. W. scoffeth at True Faith and Repentance, and maketh himself unsensible of it: but its very well, he hath ma∣nifested himself to be so much One with them, and the New-England Professors. But some of us have preach'd Repentance and the Faith of Christ at Rome (where neither he, nor his New-England Priests dared to shew their Heads) and suffered there Death for it; though thou and the New-England-Priests may rail at them behind their Backs. And so thou might'st have applied at home the Sayings of the Lord Jesus Christ, De∣part from me, ye Workers of Iniquity, I know you not: whose Light thou callest an Idol. R. W. And thou sayst, Thou hadst intended to Charge us with the Falseness of our Hope, Love, Peace and Joy, which they often Crake (thou say'st,p. 120 &c.) their Heaven consisteth, and all the Eternal Life to come they look for, they are now in present and full Possession of. Answ. Why did not R. W. do it there, what he Intended? But where doth R. W. prove these Lies, That our Heaven, &c. and all the Eternal Life, that is to come, that we say, We are now
in present full Possession of it? he hath brought no Proof for these his Lies. From the Seed, which Christ hath sown in their hearts, some bringeth forth Thirty, Sixty, Hundred-fold in this Life, and in the World to come Life Eternal: So these Words of his we turn back as R. W.'s forg'd Lies. And as for true Love, Hope and Faith, he and his New-England-Priests have banished that long ago. R. W. Thou sayst, What Scripture is more Common in their Mouths and Pens, &c. than Col. . Christ in you, the Hope of Glory? Whereby they insinuate Two of their grand Deceits and Lies. 1. That there is no other Christ, but what is in every Man in the World: 2. That there is no other Glory to be hoped for, or by or with the Lord Jesus Christ, but what is in the Saints, &c. Answ. The Reader may see R. W.'s Contradiction here in this very Scripture: but still he is forging Lies, which we never heard of a fore. Christ in you, the Hope of Glory; Mark, of Glory: And are not the Saints to grow up in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ unto a Perfect Man? and do not our Writings, and hath not our Mouth and Pens declared it? So as for Deceits, thou might'st have kept this at home. But R. W. and the Rest of the Priests, which G. F. hath brought, could not endure to hear of Christ Within us, the Hope of Glory; but ye would only have him Without, and so keep people in the Reprobate State. And how can R. W. have him Within, when he calleth his Light an Idol and a Fancy? And So R. W. thou tell'st of Hopes like unto Spiders; but this thou might'st have applied to thy self with the Hope of the Hypocrite, not to us. R. W. And R. W. thou sayst, Do they not overthrow the very Nature of Hope, which they prate of, and give the Spirit of God the Lie, which telleth us, That Hope is not of things in Posses∣sion, &c. (Rom. 9.) Answ. When did we tell to R. W. this Lie? he hath forg'd it himself. And so as for a Dead and Painted Hope thou might'st have kept thy self; for our Hope, which is Christ, maketh not a∣shamed: for we are Saved by Hope. But Hope that is seen, is not Hope, &c. (Rom. 8.) But R. W. bringeth Rom. 9: but let the Reader see, if there be the Word Hope in the Chapter. But the Living Hope (as Peter speaketh of) we witness (1 Pet. 2, 3.) We, whom Christ hath begotten again to a Lively Hope, ou Faith and Hope standeth in God; and Christ our Hope of Glo∣ry
ankers our Immortal Souls, (see Col. and Hebr.) And our Hope is Steadfast, that keepeth us above all the Waves, and Storms and Floods, that R. W. and all the New-England-Persecutors can cast upon us; for we have the Hope of Eternal Life and Glory, as Paul writeth to Titus: and we know, we are the Sons of God (1 Joh. 3.) as the Saints did, that were the First Fruits. But let us return again to Try R. W. and his New-England-Priests their Love, Faith, Hope, and Peace, &c. whether they are not degenerated from the Love of the Primitive Christi∣ans, and the Apostles and Messengers. First, doth not the Apostle say, Faith worketh by Love? and, Christ Jesus is the Author and Finisher of Faith? and is not Faith called a Shield? now, is not R. W. and his New-England Priests dege∣nerated from this Faith and this Shield, that worketh by Love? have not their Fruits Manifested them by their HANGING, BURNING with an Hot Iron, BANISHING and SPOILING the GOODS of God's people? and R. W. would have them PUNISH'D for Matter of Conscience. Nay, have not ye prov'd your selves to be the Tinkling Cymbals, Sounding Brass? (1 Cor. 13.) have not they persecuted such, as would not run after the Sound of their Tinkling Cymbals and Sounding Brass? Charity suffereth long and is Kind: have ye not been Unkind and full of Envy, out of this Charity, Vaunting yourselves, pufft up and rejoicing in Iniquity? And how did the Mayor General Vaunt and boast, when he told the Prisoners, How Mary Dyer hang'd like a Flag, when ye had Hanged her! This was your Charity, and your Joy, and your Love to Enemies and to Christians. So neither your Faith, Love, nor Hope, nor Peace nor Joy is according to the Primitive Christi∣ans, your Practice showeth your Error from them. And like∣wise ye are not in the Wisdom of God, which is pure, gentle and peaceable, &c. which the Apostles were in as in Jam:) and are gone into a Devilish and Destroying Wisdom. And so Christ in the Saints, the Hope of Glory, hath not been yours, his Nature nei∣ther appeareth in R. W. nor in the New-England Priests & Professors. R. W. And thou sayst, Can the Eternal God in any Literal Sense be called the Hope of Israel? Jer. 4. p. 121Answ. Doth not Jeremy call him the Hope of Israel, and the Saviour? and was he not so? and was not God Israels Saviour, and was not his people to Hope and Trust in him for it? and the Hope of Israel (to wit God) is the Hope of
all his peoples Comforts and Mercies, &c. And the Saying of the Apostle, If in this Life only we have Hope, &c. is own'd: and so, we have both the Hope in this Life, and that which is to come. R. W. And when thou hast utter'd a many false Charges, thou sayst; It's true, they will pretend to own Scriptures, Christ, Resur∣rection, Judgment, Faith, Hope, Repentance, &c. and as true and sound, as any Protestants. Answ. Pretended, is thy own Thrust-in: for we do really and more truly own Christ's Resurrection, Judgement, Faith, Hope, Repentance and Scriptures, then such Protestants, as thou and the New-England-Priests do. And— R. W. thou sayst, It was reported, that some of us at our Death have used these words, Lord Jesus, receive my Spirit; and some have Judg'd Charitably of i (our going presently to Christ Je∣sus:) but R. W. saith; But as to the Truth and Bottom, however they blind the World and weak Followers, &c. and so thou goest on railing, with more false and lying Charges, which we never thought on. Answ. Here R. W. hath manifest his false Love and false Cha∣rity: for when a man is Dying in a sense of the Lord, and de∣sireth the Lord Jesus to receive his Spirit, doth he think, that men will dissemble at this Time, and do it in Hypocrisy? what a sense∣less Man is R. W. and what a Malitious Spirit hath he mani∣fested here! And we own the Resurrection, as the Scripture speaketh: And is not the Soul a part of God's Breath, which he hath breathed into man? and hast not thou confest thyself, That it goeth unto God? R. W. And thou say'st,p 122. This Saying, Lord Jesus receive my Spirit, is no more then, Lord Jesus, receive thy self. Answ. These are R. W.'s Forgeries: for where doth he prove it out of any of our Books? and so goeth on with Railing and scoffing at God's people on their Death-beds, when they say, Lord Jesus, receive my Spirit; and therefore thou sayst, their say∣ing is, Lord Jesus, receive thy self. Well R. W. thou mayst do the Work, that thy Father setteth thee about: but we do abhor thy forged Words! R. W. bringeth John Bunyon (G. F. Fol. p. 127.) his saying [It is a Counterfietlng (as thou callest it) of a New Birth, to fol∣low the Light, wherewith Men coming into the World, are enlightned.] G. F. answereth [Which none cometh to (the New-Birth) but
who cometh to the Light, wherewith every Man, that cometh into the World, is enlightned; which believing in is a Child of the Light, by believing and receiving Christ they come to re∣ceive Power to be the Sons of God.] (And R. W. quoteth his Book for G. F.'s fol. 127. where there is no such thing in that page: but we have so much Charity, to overlook R. W.'s mis∣take, and not rail at him, as he doth at G. F.) But this is ful∣ly Answered in the Appendix, where he bringeth it again in his page 5, 6. (As for the Word Counterfieting, whether it be the Printers or the Orator's Mistake, we shall leave that) But thou confessest here, that Christ is the Author and Finisher of Faith: and in another place thou sayst with F. D. That the Scripture is the Ground of Christ's Faith and the Saints (pag. 102, 103. in thy Book.) And thou askest, If this Light be Christ the Mediator. Answ. We tell thee, Christ enlightneth every Man, that cometh into the World: and John telleth thee, that This is the True Light, which enlightneth every Man, that cometh into the World, which is the Life in the Word, which became Flesh, &c. And thou art no Believer, according to Christ's words, until thou believest in his Light. R. W. And thou sayst, Fox saith, this Turning to the Light with∣in is the New-Birth, and callest it Our New Light (as they falsly and foolishly prate.p. 123) But (Isa. 8.) they have no true Light, but a false and painted Light within them. Answ. Thou abusest Isa. 8. as well as us: He doth not say of a False, Painted Light within; but read the Margent, and thou wilt see, it saith, There is no Morning in them: and there is Light, before they come to the Morning. But thou callest it a New Light and a false New Birth; Here thy Ma∣lice appeareth against Christ's Doctrine: So thy Doctrine is false, and thy Preaching. For Christ saith, Believe in the Light, that ye may become Children of the Light: so its clear, thou art no Preacher of Christ, nor Messenger, nor knowest not Repentance, that speakest so much evil of them, that turn people from Dark∣ness to Light, as the Apostle did; and believest not in the Light: so thou art no Child of Light, but art in thy own false Birth. And so it's thou, countest it false and foolish Prating, to bid thee Re∣pent and believe in the Light, that thou mayst become a Child of Light: But the Light is true, thou shalt find it, that believest not in the Light, but callest it a Fancy; which will be thy Condemnation.
R. W. And he bringeth G. Willington's saying, [That he is Justified by Faith alone without Good Works.p. 124.] G. F. Answ. (Fol. p. 44.) [What! without the Faith that Worketh by Love? hast thou concluded those Works the Works of Popery, which are the Works of Faith, that worketh by Love, which Faith giveth the Victory? For Faith and Works by Love is owned; and he that believeth, is ceased from his own Works, as God did from his, and hath entred into his Rest. And Faith giveth Victory over all the Popish Murthering Spirits; and both thine and their Works are out of it.] R. W. Replieth and falleth a railing, That G. F. maketh true Justifying Faith to be not one hairs breadth more, than the Faith that may be to God in the First Covenant. Answ. In this thou wrongest G. F.'s words, as the Reader may see; And Rom. 3. Therefore we conclude, that a Man is Justified by Faith, and not by the Works of the Law: but R. W. leaveth out James's, who saith; Shew me thy Faith by thy Works: and these are the Works of the Gospel. But R. W. thou believest, There is a God (and the New-England-Priests) thou dost well, the Devils also believe and tremble: For as the Body is dead with∣out the Spirit, so Faith without Works is dead. (Jam 2.) And so it's clear, R. W. and his New-England-Priests and Professors profess Faith, but it's Dead, without the Works of Faith, which Worketh by Love and purifieth the Heart: but your Dead Faith Worketh by Envy, Malice, Persecution, Bloodshed and Murther. And so Poor Bancrupts ye may apply to yourselves. And if ye were in the Grace, which cometh by Jesus, your Practice and thy Words would have been more Gratious: which testifieth, you are not in the Grace of God, which the Apostle was in; but have turn'd it into Wantonness. R. W. Bringeth Joseph Miller's Saying [It's an Error to say, we are Justified by that which Christ doth in us.] G. F. (Fol. p. 47.) Answ. [Contrary to the Apostle, who saith, We are Justified by Faith in his Blood: And the Faith is in the Heart; and the Blood is in the Heart, that purifieth it: And the Mystery of Faith is held in a pure Conscience. And the Word of Faith is within (Rom. 10) and Faith giveth Victory over the World; and that which giveth Victory, Justifieth: and Christ is within, who is Justification, Sanctification, &c. and if either of them is found within, thou art in an Error, and not fit to talk of these things,
thou understandest not.] R. W. Replieth and saith, Grant that in a true Respect and Sense Faith is within, and the Blood, &c. And then he saith,p. 125. Will it therefore follow, twice over. Answ. And doth G. F. say, that they were not Without, be∣fore they were Within? or else, how should they come Within? and doth G. F. say any such word, that they are one, in his Answer? So as for thy Babilonish Mystery, Jumbling and Blen∣ding thou might'st have kept at home; who hast confest to the Truth, and canst not own it. R. W. And thou sayst; It's true, Christ dwelleth in our hearts by believing (the Apostle saith, by Faith) Ephes. 3. and (thou sayst) Consequently his Cross, his Manger, his Grave, his Literal Bloodshed are Within, &c. and his Spear, Soldiers, High-priests, Scribes, Pharisees, Pilate, Romans, Jerusalem are literally within us. Answ. This is thy own Brutish Fancy, (as thou callest it) to talk at this Rate, which neither we, nor the Apostle preach'd such a false Doctrine: and therefore thou mayst take it home a∣gain, as a Forging by thy own spirit: And cannot Christ be preach'd by the Apostles and his Servants now in the Hearts of his Saints without all these Outward Things, as thou Maliciously bringest here? And the Reader may see, there is nothing in G. F.'s Answer for him to bring these Words: For we own the Man Christ Jesus really, shedding his Blood without the Gates of outward Jerusalem, &c. And a many Vnsavoury Words thou hast here, which thou mayst take home again. — But can Christ Jesus be blown up, and Vanish together with the Scriptures, (as thou affirmest, and according to thy Consequence here?) O no he is A∣scended far above thy Blowing up. But thy Antichrist may be blown up, who callest the Light of the true Christ an Idol and a Fancy. And— R. W. bringeth John Bunyan (G. F. Fol. 10.) saying [It is not Faith and Works, that Justifieth a Man before God; but it is Faith and Good Works, which justify in the Sight of Men only: and such Works will not justify in the Sight of God. And he saith, That Works are only to justify their Faith to be true before Men.] G. F. Answereth [Abraham was not justified only to Men by his Obedience,p. 126. but to God: and where is Faith, there is Justification, which worketh by Love.
And the Saints Faith and Works were not only to justify them in the Sight of Men: For the Work of God is to do what he saith, and his Will, which who doth not, are not justified in so doing; but are to be beaten with stripes. Who seek to be justi∣fied by their Faith and Works in the Sight of Men, are in a Dead Faith and Works both: for such seek to please Men more than God.] And R. W. Replieth, and falleth a-railing and saith; G. F. main∣taineth a Covenant of Works. Answ. But there is no such thing, as the Reader may see; but the Faith, which worketh by Love, as the Apostle speaketh of, the New Covenant: and this R. W. (who is so Envious) cannot see. But he maintaineth the Faith of Christ Jesus, and also the Faith of Abraham: and the Apostle saith, They are of Abraham, who walk in the Steps of the Faith of Abraham, who is the Father of the Faithful. R. W. And thou sayst, The Work of God according to Christ's Doctrine is, to believe in him, whom God hath sent. It is true, it is the Command of God to keep his Commands; but since the Dead∣ly Fall of Man none, not one being able, &c. Answ. What! None can keep the Commands of God neither in the Old Testament, nor in the New, that cometh to Christ and doth the Work of God, To believe in his Son, whom God hath sent? then None loveth God, nor believeth. For is not this the Com∣mand and Work of God, to believe in his Son? What! are the Com∣mands of God in the New Testament only to be talked of, because they did not keep them in the Old? Now, doth not the Apostle say, The Law is fulfill'd in one Word; Love God, and thy Neigh∣bour as thy self? We know, R. W. and his New-England-Priests &c. have not kept this Command: for if they had Loved God, they would not have kill'd his people; for Love doth not kill, nor Envy. And also R. W. if he had Loved God, and kept in his Love, we should not have had this Envious, Evil Work brought forth. And — R. W. saith, They that do not God's Will, are not justified in so doing. And therefore R. W. concludeth, They that do God's will, are justified in so doing, and that their Sins are par∣don'd; as Paul and David by pardon of Sin describe justification.p. 127. And thou sayst, That there is divers Signi∣fications of this Latin Word Justification. Answ. What is this to the Purpose, as to Christ's words, They
that do not the Will of God, are un-justified in so doing? And wa not Paul's &c. Sin pardon'd by Christ through Faith, who Justi∣fied him? But dost thou justify the Papists, and the New-Eng∣land Priests and Professors Drinking the Blood of the Saints? and thy self, who would'st have us to be punisht? so, thou wouldst have us Beaten; and the New-England Men did Beat us, because we did not do your Wills. But you cry, Pardon of Sin by Christ Je∣sus, and are doing the Devil's Work, and not Christ's Will and Com∣mand, which is, To love one another, and to love Enemies. Thou sayst— R. W. Doth it follow therefore, that they that do not Steal, Whore, Murther, &c. by this abstaining from Sin, and by this their Work they obtain their Pardon, and stand by this their Work Legally right and justified in the Court of Heaven. Answ. R. W. Are they Justified, that Run on in their Sin, Stealing, Whoredom and Murther? which the true Faith, that Christ is the Author of, leadeth from, purifieth from, and giveth Victory over such Evils; and seeth Christ the Author of their Faith, whom he hath bought with his Blood. And so our Doctrine of true Repentance and Faith, Love, Hope, Joy and Peace is according to Scripture and the Primitive Church, and not R. W.'s nor his New-England-Priests. And we have Examin'd Our selves, and prov'd ourselves by the Light of Christ Jesus, & found him within us: and he is come, and we are no Reprobates; and hath given us an Understanding, and we are in him, Glory to God for ever! And as for Counterfeit Christ, painted Faith and Hope, and dolefully Counterfeited perishing Salvation, &c. R. W. might have kept at home; for it will fail him in the End, which he speaketh of: And this is thy own Condition, that thou speakest of the others, such as believe Lies for Heavenly Truths. R. W. And thou sayst, Thou hadst purpos'd to have shewed, how the Quakers have followed the Cerdonians, the Priscillians and Valentinians, the Old Gnosticks and Manicheans. Answ. R. W. might have kept these for himself, who calleth the Light of Christ Jesus a Fancy and an Idol: but where did any of those call it so? for we follow Christ Jesus, and neither him nor them. And — R. W. thou sayst, Thou confinedst thy self to the Terms of thy Position, and declaredst the Quakers to be Down-right Papists in many points.
Answ. Well, we shall see, what Points they are? and see, whether he and his New-England-Priests are not nearer to the Papists, then the Quakers are. R. W. Bringeth (from G. F.'s Fol. p. 214.) the Elders and Messengers of the Churches,p. 128. saying [We are conceived in Sin, and brought forth in Iniquity.] And G. F. Answ. [David doth not say, YE, who are conceived in sin, but [I]: and R. W. saith, John was sanctified from the Womb; and the Scripture speaketh of such, as were Sanctified from the Womb, and Children that were Clean, &c. and this is fully answered in Answ. to App. pag. 134, 135] And— R. W. saith, That the Protestants say, that their natural Births and Conceptions are all defiled with Sin. Answ. And so say the Papists. But what doth R. W. and his New-England-Priests say to Paul? [For the Believing Hus∣band is sanctified by the believing Wife; and the unbelieving Wife is Sanctified by the believing Husband: For else were their Children Vnclean, but now are they Holy.] I ask R. W. and his New-England-Priests, Whether or no there be any such Believers in New-England? or, Whether they believe this Doctrine of the A∣postle, or preach this? if not, then are they degenerated. And this doth not deny the New Creating of the Soul and Spirit in Everlasting, Vnchangeable Holiness and Righteousness after the Image of him, that Createth him after him, &c. But R. W. if the Papists confess, They are born in sin; and Paul saith, The Believers Children are Holy: How do the Quakers, and the Be∣lievers and the Apostle here Jump into one thing with the Papists? R. W. thou sayst, The Quakers are in one step with the Pa∣pists as to the power of Nature in spirituals; and that every Man &c. in the World hath a Sufficient Light within him to see God and Christ, &c. Contrary to the Protestants, who from the Holy Scripture maintain Natural Blindness and Darkness, and Man's Natural Deadness: and that our Wisdom cannot discern any Spiritual thing, &c. and that our Wisdom is Enmity to God. Answ. Did ever the Quakers say to the Contrary, but that ye and the New England-Professors were in this Condition? and ye might have taken the Papists with you, and not to have join'd them with the Qua∣kers. And in this Condition and Birth ye are still; though ye may make a Profession of God and Christ, the Fruits of that Birth show
it self forth. And indeed, how can ye be any other ways, who call the Light of Christ Jesus a Fancy and an Idol, which John bear witness to, and Christ said, Believe in the Light, that ye may become Children of the Light. So here it's clear, that your Birth is not Changed: but (as thou sayst) your Wisdom is Enmity, and ye are in Natural Blindness and Deadness, as to Spiritual things. But we never heard, that the Papists did own the Heavenly Light of Christ Jesus, that lighteth every one, that cometh into the World, the Life in the Word; for they persecuted us for preaching of it, as the New-England-Professors have done. And whatever Christ hath profer'd you, still how can ye see it, except ye be∣lieve in the Light?—And thou comparing us with the Papists, thou hast but manifest thy own Folly: for thou say'st;— R. W. The Papists speak more like Men, and yield, that Men▪ and Women have left them (since Adam fell) power to listen to,p. 129. &c. and sayst, The Quakers talk (like Brutes) of no Means, but Immediate Revelation of the Spirit; and the Protestants affirm, that we have not a good Thought, but from God, &c. Answ. Let the Reader Judge, who speaketh like Brutes? for if the Papists listen to that, which is left them in Adam (as thou sayst) and ye say, ye have not a good Thought, but what ye have from God; how have ye any thing that is Good from God, but by that which Revealeth it from God? which thou grantest, is the Quakers Means. For the Apostle saith, No man knoweth the things of God, but by the Spirit of God (2 Cor. 3. Phil. 2. Rom. 10. 1 Cor. 4.) And so now thou, that deniest the Immediate Revelation of the Spirit of God to be the Means (and the New-England Professors) ye are as dark as the Papists: and so thou hast prov'd thy self a Nearer kin to them, then the Quakers. And thou confessest, That God open'd Lydia's Heart (Act. 16.) Was not this by his Immediate Spirit and Revelation, by which she received the Gospel? And this is the Quakers Means; but not R. W.'s it seemeth, who saith: There is no Voice, to Moti∣on within to be lissen'd to, as often hath been quoted. And dost thou and the New-England-Priests believe, There was no Mo∣tion nor Voice in Lydia's Heart, when the Lord open'd it, by which she gave Attention to the Gospel, and received it from Paul? R. W. Thou sayst, The Papists and Quakers maintain a Fal∣ling away from Grace.
Answ. And yet thou sayst; The Truth is, none of them seemeth to know it experimentally: Then how canst thou maintain, They fall away from that, they do not know Experimentally? But as for the Papists, let them Answer for themselves. R. W. And thou sayst of the Protestants, Though they grant great Fallings and Desertions of the Children of God, yet they hold the holy Seed of God, the Holy Spirit and Word of God, that In∣corruptible and Eternal Seed, of which they are begotten, never final∣ly and totally to be Eclipsed. Answ. Where did ever Quakers say, that the Holy Spirit of God or his Eternal Seed ever fell away, of which his people are be∣gotten, or that they fell away, that came to that State? for I tell thee, If the Righteous fall, they shall rise again. But neither the Papists nor thou (as ever we could meet withal) did believe, that the Grace of God, which bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to all men: and is not that Saving, which bringeth Salvation? which the Wicked turn into Wantonness, and walk despitefully against the Spirit of Grace. But what doth R. W. say of them, that had tasted of the good Word of God? (Heb. 6) I do not believe, that ever he or the New-England-Priests came so far. And how can R. W. talk of Falling away from Grace and Light, and is yet in the Fall, and calleth Christ's Light an Idol? and so not come to it. R. W. And thou sayst, Thou told'st us, that the Papists and we were Confederates in their Endeavours to raze the Heavenly Records,p. 130. and to rob the Saints of the Holy Scriptures. [This is a false Charge: for we esteem of the Scriptures more then thou and the New-England-Priests and they.] And thou sayst, The Papists own the Snriptures to be the Word or Will of God, &c. but the Quakers will not vouchsafe it the Name of the Word of God. Answ. Here then the Papists differ, and are one with thee and the New-England-Priests; and are Contrary to the Prophets and the Apostles, who call the Scriptures WORDS, and Christ Jesus, who saith, they are Words: and his Name is called the Word of God, and not scoffingly (as thou call'st it) our Simple Pre∣tence, but really he is so. And thou, that givest the Title to the Scripture, which belongeth to Christ, which the holy Men of God did not, art degenerated from both Spirit and Speech.
R. W. And thou sayst; The Papists horribly abuse the Scrip∣ures, and call it a Nose of Wax, &c. and so do the Quakers, riumphing over it, &c. as over a Dead Letter, a Carkass, &c. Answ. R. W. These are thy own forg'd Words: Where did ever the Quakers call it a Dead Carcass, and triumph over the Scriptures? for thou sayst thy self, The Letter profiteth nothing without the Spirit. And the Apostle saith, The Letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth Life: and was he therefore a Papist? R. W. And thou sayst; The Papists prefer the Vulgar Latin Co∣pies before the Hebrew, and sayst, Do not the Quakers simply and brutishly bind themselves to the bare Letter of the Common Eng∣lish? Answ. Here the Quakers and the Papists Dis-agree. And dost not thou say, That the Scriptures are the Word of God? which we say, are Words? And must not we own Scriptures, as they call themselves? for dost not thou say, They are the Touchstone? and if the English Copies be not true, why dost thou tell us, The Scriptures are the Touchstone, and the Rule, and the Word of God? and why hast not thou and the New-England-Priests men∣ded them all this time? And dost not thou say, That Ra∣vius proclaimes above a Thousand Faults to be in our Last Translation? How now R. W.! and yet are they the Touch-stone? and the Rule? and the Word of God? how darest thou say, they are the Word of God, if there be a Thousand Faults in them? And how darest thou say, They are the Touch-stone, the Ground of Christ's Faith and the Saints? (as in thy Book pag. 102.) and the Priest saith, They are the Means of Faith: yet thou dost extol this Man, calling him a most-Famous Hebraician, hat saith, There be above a Thousand Faults in the last Translation of them. And — R. W. saith, The Papists set up a Judge in Controversy above the Holy Scriptures,p. 131. &c. and the Quakers say the same of their Spirit, &c. Answ. But how canst thou call it the Holy Scriptures, if thou sayst, There be a Thousand Faults in them? And is not the Spi∣rit aove the Scriptures, that gave them forth? and the Word of God, which was afore they were, as thou hast confest? But the Quakers are not agreed with the Papists here; but the Papists are agreed with you: If the Spirit of God be not the Judge, and not to be set above the Scriptures, ye and the Papists are of one
Spirit; but not in that, that gave forth the Scriptures, and the Word of Wisdom, which was, afore they were Written. R. W. And thou sayst; The Papists will not deny, to make the Scriptures the Rule to be tried by it; yet their Church and Pope must Interpret it. Answ. That is like to you, that do Interpret them, and give Meanings, and find Fault with us for taking it Literally: so ye and the Papists are agreed. And then thou fall'st a-railing: But we tell you both, that the Holy Ghost proceedeth from the Father and the Son; the Spirit of Truth is that which leadeth into all Truth. R. W. And thou sayst: The Papists generally use not the Scrip∣tures in their Devotions in their Mother-Tongue, but in Latin, (which thou callest the Whore's Tongue of Italy:) And then thou tellest a long Story of Luther, and sayst, The Papists and Quakers slight the Holy Scriptures. Answ. But here thou canst not Join the Quakers with the Pa∣pists, for we do not use in our Devotion to speak the Scriptures out of our own Language: Neither do we justify the Papists in o doing. R. W. And thou sayst, The Quakers at first took off themselves, p. 132. Families and Assemblies from any use of it, (to wit, the Scriptures.) Answ. This is altogether false, all people knoweth, it is, that knows both our Families and Assemblies. R. W. And thou sayst, The Papists and Quakers say, If the Scriptures were consumed, and quite taken out of the World, there would be no Loss, &c. Answ. This also is false, the Quakers never said so; they never had such a Thought in their Hearts, that we know of. But No man knoweth the things of God in the Scriptures, but by the Spirit of God: and the Spirit of God leadeth us into all Truth of the Scrip∣tures both to the Comforting of our Assemblies and Families. R. W. And thou sayst, The Quakers and Papists love the Scrip∣tures no better, then Goliah loved David's Stone. Answ. And we may say to thee, Thou lovest the Scriptures no more, then thou lovest the Light of Christ, who callest it a Fancy and an Idol. But by the Scriptures and the Spirit of God, that gave them forth, we have proved thee, That thou neither lovest the Scriptures, nor the Spirit of God, which gave them forth: which we love and esteem.
R. W. Thou sayst, The Papists and Quakers Shake hands in the most Hellish Doctrine of Justification, by what Christ worketh within us. Answ. Is the Apostles Doctrine Hellish and Popish, who are Justified by Faith? and doth not Christ work Faith within? how doth it purify the Heart? And this Faith within owneth Christ, it doth not deny, that he died without the Gates of Jerusalem for all men. And where do we put Justification for Sanctification? and is not this Sanctification wrought within Men? And where do either ye or the Papists confess, that Christ is the Author and Finisher of Faith? for thou wrongst the Papists. For if they confess, that that Faith, that purifieth their hearts, giveth them Victory and Ac∣cess to God, they need not plead for a Purgatory, when they are dead; nor thou for a Body of Sin and Death to the Grave. R. W. Thou sayst, The Quakers are Papists in that Infallible Spirit, &c. [to wit, the Spirit of Truth, which Christ and his Fa∣ther hath sent to lead us in all Truth.] Answ. This Holy Ghost the Papists have denied to our Faces: and therefore thou Abusest the Papists. And ye have confest, ye have not the same Holy Ghost, that the Apostles had; and there∣fore they and the New-England-priests are of one Nature, for they have said the same: And this Spirit shall reprove the World of Righteousness, &c. as Christ saith. And if all men did believe in the Light, and not turn the Grace of God into Wantonness, nor grieve the Spirit, which God hath poured out upon them, it would Teach them and instruct them: And that we do exhort people to, that they may escape the Dread∣ful Judgements of God, who will Judge the World in Righteous∣ness. And then thou scoffest against our Preachers, &c. But we have preach'd the Everlasting Gospel in New-England and other places; and it had been very well, if thou had'st turn'd to the Spirit of God within thee, that thou makest slight of. R. W. Thou sayst, The Quakers are Papists in a high, Lofty Conceit of Perfection,p. 133. when in Calvin's time this Spirit came from Hell, &c. Answ. Dost not thou Contradict thy self and sayst, The Papists hold a Purgatory? then how are they like the Quakers, that hold Perfection? And so they are near thee, that must have a Com∣bate or a Fighting all thy Life, and no Overcoming. And how darest thou to say, The Spirit and Doctrine of Perfection came from Hell in Calvin's Time? &c. for it is the Doctrine of
Christ and his Apostles to his Saints and Followers. R. W. And thou sayst, The Quakers in the latter Years in Lancashire came from the Grindletonians. Answ. This is also false, the Grindletonians know otherwise, and the people in Lancashire. R. W. And thou sayst, The Quakers and Papists are great Friends in their Notions and Practice of Revelations, &c. and Inspirations. Answ. How can the Papists own true Revelation, that own not the same Holy Ghost, as they were in, that gave forth Scriptures? So their Dreams and Visions are like thine; and so not like the Quakers, who know the things of God, that are reveal'd by the Spirit of God. And thou that scoffest at Revelation, Inspirati∣on, &c. knowest not the things of God, but art in the Natural, dark State thou speakest of. And— R. W. Thou sayst, What a Noise we make about Vncovering the Head, Knee, Wearing of Lace, &c. and saying of You and Thou, and Musick, and Painting; and thou callest it Idle, Popish Trash and Trumpery. Answ. These are thou and thy Protestants, that make such a Noise about them: Nay, would'st thou not have us to be pun∣ish'd for doing those things? (p. 200.) And What must we in∣fer from all this? R. W. would have his Musick, and the Head Vncovered and Knee bowed to him, and Wearing of Laces, and You instead of Thou said to him: and he is offended at us, be∣cause we deny such things; and so are the Papists, his Brethren. And we tell R. W. and his New-England-priests, that they ne∣ver shall know true Religion, till their Flesh be Silent to know, what it is, to Tremble at the Word of God, and to work out their Salvation with Fear and Trembling: for it is God, that worketh in us both to Will and to Do. But this Voice and Motion hath R. W. not known nor heard yet. R. W. Thou sayst; The Papists and Quakers are Brethren in Iniquity in their Affirming, hat the Pope is not the Anti-Christ. Answ. And how can this be? when G. F. said, Anti-Christ was come in the Apostles Days, and the World went after him? And thou and ye New-England-Priests, and the Papists, that are inwardly Ravening from the Spirit, and Grace, and Truth in the heart, and Anointing, and Word and Faith there, though ye do profess Christ and the Apostles Words in the Sheeps-Cloathing,
and drink the Blood of the Saints (as the Papists and New-Eng∣land have done) must needs be the Whore and Anti-Christ, your Fruits have declared it (and thou art Stirring up the Magistrates to punish us) who were the Livery of the Bloody Whore. R. W. Thou sayst, The Papists change their Names; and why the Quakers guided by the same Hellish Spirit and Fancy, are so tender about owning their Old Names. Answ. Let the Reader see how Angry this Old, Doting Man is: where had any Quakers changed their Names, as the Papists have done? this is no Comparison. But I must tell thee, as John said, He that overcometh, hath a New Name. And Our Names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life; and doth R. W. think, this is the Old Name? nay, this is not: And yet we do not say, we are weary of our Old Names, which our Parents have called us by. But will R. W. say, that was a Hellish Spirit, that chan∣ged Paul's Name, and therefore was he like a Papist? And if thou dost call the Holy Ghost, the Spirit of Truth, a Hellish Spirit, and so blasphemest against the Holy Ghost, remember Christ's Sen∣tence. R. W. Thou sayst again, The Papists and Quakers are led by one Spirit of feigned Holiness, &c. Monkish Solitari∣ness, &c. must be sequestred from Wordly Business;p. 134. is the Beggars Life: — and, Paul wrought night and day with his hands; which I never read of any of these Lying Apostles, Qua∣kers, in all their Travails to have done. Answ. All people may Judge thee here Led with a Lying Spi∣rit. For of whom hath our people Begg'd? and where are our Nuns and our Fryaries? thou fillest up thy Book with such Lying Sto∣ries: The Spirit of God Leadeth us to no such things, no more then he did the Apostles. But R. W. to prove us, that we are not According, &c. (as thou sayst) because thou hast not read, that we labor night and day in our Travails, as the Apostles; and there∣fore our Doctrine, our Practice, our Faith and our Religion must not he according to the Apostles: Herein he hath proved all his Priests in New-England not to be in the Doctrine of the Apostles, which have so much a Year, which the Apostles had not; and that you are gone from the Religion, Practice and Profession of the Primitive Messengers and Teachers. And it is known, that we have Labored night and day in our Travails, though he hath not read it: and have not been Chargeable to any, and coveted
no Man's Gold nor Silver. And let him enquire in Rode-Island and Long-Island, whether J. B. did not work there; or no? R. W. (Thou might'st have kept that at home, to say) The Quakers Tongues and the Papists are both spitting and belching out Fire from one Fire of Hell. Answ. And this is thy own Condition; let any read thy Vn∣gratious Words and see, if the Papists can be worse? R. W. Thou sayst, The Protestants hope and speak Charitably of the Salvation of many of the Papists.p. 135. Answ. But ye shall hear R. W.'s Charity, viz: If it please the most-High, Old and New-England may Flourish, when the Pope and Mahomet, Rome and Constantinople are in Ashes, (in his Epistle to the King) And further (in his Epistle to Baxter and Owen;) The Pope and Mahomet, whom some of you may live to see flung in the lake, which burneth with Fire and Brimstone. Here is R. W.'s his Protestants Charity. R. W. And thou sayst, G. F. and the rest, they Judge all that differ from Christ, that is, themselves. — Answ. This is a scoffing Word, to say, That Christ is Our∣selves; for he teacheth us to deny Ourselves, who Lighteth every Man that cometh into the World. And they that hate the Light, hate Christ, from whence it cometh; and are not the true Be∣lievers, and have not Vnity with Christ or with us (who walk in the Light) or amongst themselves either. So with the Light they are condemne, that hate it▪ (Joh. 3.) R. W. Thou sayst, The Quakers and Papists are Fire brands both in the matter of Persecution, &c. and thou sayst: The Pro∣testants cried out against all Persecution — and further: I say, the Quakers most vehemently cry out against Violence, against Crea∣tures; but against their Corruptions and Corrupt Principles. Answ. Is this good Sense R. W.? those are thy own words. And further, this is a false Charge, as to say, The Papists and Qua∣kers are Fire brands both in the matter of Persecution: For this thou shouldst have applied to the New-England priests, whose BLOODY HANDS have been embroiled in the BLOOD of the Lambs of Christ. And therefore thou and the Papists are one, and not the Quakers, as thou hast proved them all along thy self, and the priests and Professors in New-England to be one with the Papists, and not the Quakers. For whom have we IMPRISON'D? whom have we WHIPT? whose EARS have we CVT OF? Whom
have we BANISHT? and whose GOODS have we SPOILED, because they would not hear us? nay R. W. Christ hath given us better Weapons. And we do believe, that the Word of the Lord, that we preach'd amongst you, is Cutting: but thou art afraid, we shall get an Outward Sword. O! we have better Weapons to maintain our Re∣ligion, the Lord hath abled us withal; the Shield of Faith and the Sword of the Spirit, &c. And what! is Cain, that kill'd Faith∣ful ABEL, now afraid? Well he may: but we leave God to revenge the BLOOD of his Faithful Servants, which hath been drunk in New-England. And there is no such thing neither in G. F. nor E. B: nor J. Stubs maintaineth, that any should be pun∣ish'd for Religion, Conscience, Faith or Worship, as thou falsly char∣gest; but that Magistrates are to punish Evil-doers: and as Christ saith, He that doth Evil (to wit, any Murther, Theft, Adultery, &c.) hateth the Light. And as for our Agreement with Papists, Arminians, Pelagians, &c. This is like the rest of thy false Charges and Com∣parisons. And what dost thou talk of Election and Pre∣destination,p. 136. &c. when thou callest the Light of Christ an Idol? For these are Mysteries to thee, who art not come to take heed unto the Light, that shineth in a dark place. R. W. And thou tellest us of the Protestants Doctrine: of a Certain Number of God's Elect, that are Chosen and drawn by Mercy out of the Lump of lost Mankind. Answ. Now, if they be drawn by Mercy, must not this be by the Spirit of God within? And is not this contrary to thy own Doctrine, to say, There is no Voice nor Motion within of heavenly things and supernatural Light? And thou speake  his Call in Time, by his holy Word and Spirit, &c. And is not this Spirit and Call within! then is there not a Voice and a Motion? And how canst thou talk of the New Birth, and believe not in the Light, to become a Child of Light? Those things indeed ye New-England-Protestants hold in Talk, but not in Posses∣sion. R. W. And thou sayst, The Quakers are Brethren with the So∣cinians, &c. in making Christ a Type and Figure — an Example, how Christians ought to walk; not that the Blood, that was shed upon the Cross at Jerusalem, was a sufficient Price and Satisfacti∣on &c. for the Sins of the whole world.
Answ. It's like, thou wrongest the Socinians, as thou dost us: For we tell thee, thy Charge is false, and a Lie in thy Mouth. For we say, Christ is the Substance of all Figures and Types: but doth not the Apostle say, He left us an Example, how Christians ought to walk, even as he did? But R. W. and his New-England-priests cannot endure to hear talk of this Walking and this Ex∣ample; This is Socinian, this is Quaker's and yet the Apostle's Doctrine: and thou, that deniest this, art degenerated from the Apostle's Doctrine, Practice and Walking. For even hitherto were ye called, because Christ also suffer'd for you, leaving you an Ex∣ample, that ye should follow his steps (1 Pet. 2:) So we can com∣mit our Case to God, who judgeth righteously, and doth not heed thy false Judgement. And so we own the Lord Jesus Christ both his Birth, Suffe∣ring, Death, Resurrection; though thou falsly drawest this Conse∣quence upon us, That the Body, and Blood and Death of Christ is nothing but a Fancy. We have heard thy Foul Words and Slan∣der, the Lord knows, there is no such thing in our Hearts: and if thou hadst the Fear of God in thy Heart, thou wouldst never have publisht such things, to defile peoples minds with such Lying Imaginations of thy own Brain. And thou shalt know one day, that the Lord will return Judgement upon thee for all thy Hard Speeches against us. R. W. And as for Devilish, Jesuitical Tricks thou might'st have kept at home,p. 137. who sayst; G. F. buggles at the Word Humane, as at a Ratle-snake. Answ. Nay, he doth not: but to give a New Name to Christ, which the Scripture doth not give, which thou sayst, is the Rule— And we do not find the Word in the Scripture: and therefore, why canst not thou keep Scripture-Terms? R. W. Thou sayst: Yet then examine them, (as I have done) what is become of him? then he is vanisht into a Spirit and Ghost. Answ. R. W. had not a Word to say to G. F. when he was at Providence: where was the Spirit and Ghost then (as thou callest it?) but railest upon him behind his back. And art thou like to Examine us or our Principles without the Light of Christ, that callest it an Idol? Nay R. W. thou knowest not thy own Condition, and therefore thou art not like to Examin ours.
R. W. saith, The Sabellians and Quakers are one, confounding Father, Son and Spirit in one. Answ. Then thou mayst say, Christ confounded the Father and the Son, when he said, I and my Father are one: and that John con∣founded the Father, Son and Spirit, when he said; The Father, the Word and the Spirit are one. R. W. saith: There it much Judaism in the Quakers Religi∣on: And then thou tellest of their Zeal (as the Quakers) in the works of Righteousness; and, to pacify God, they put Dirt, and Dung, and Swines Blood and Dogs Necks upon God's Altar, &c. and Washing of Cups and Platters, &c. Answ. Where doth R. W. prove this, that the Jew put Dung and Dirt, and Swines-Blood and a Dog's Neck upon God's Al∣tar? let us see Scripture for it, which is his Rule: And where do the Quakers do so? he should have quoted their Books: those are false Charges without any Proofs. And as for outward Washings of Cups and Platters, &c. truly, he is not come so far as the Jews and Pharisees; for his and his New-England-Priests Outside is not Washt, they have not so much as a fair Outside. For where did ever the Jews BANISH any of the Christians upon PAIN of DEATH, and CVT OFF their EARS, and SPOIL'D their GOODS, as the New-England Priests have done? Nay, have not they Outstript the Jews in their WHIPPING and in these things? where did ever the Jews BRAND any with an HOT IRON? we challenge them to prove it by Scripture. And how darest thou speak of the Father and the Son, and Par∣don of Sin, and the Spotless Lamb, when thou Basphemously cal∣lest his Light an Idol and a Fancy? And both yours, and the Papists and the Jews Ceremonies we are come from, who Wor∣ship God in Spirit and Truth. And then thou fall'st a scoffing at Women-Ambassadors, &c. Thou might'st as well scoff at those Women, that carried the Message and glad Tidings of the Resurrection of Christ.p: 138. And then thou speakest of our Brutish Salutations of Strangers, Acquaintance and Friends: and then thou contradictest thy self and sayst; Some of them will say, How do ye do? and, Farewell: and when did any of us say, that we put Holiness in these Tw Words? this is thy own Application. R. W. And thou tellest of a New Way of Feeling and Grabling the Hand instead of Kissing, and callest it an Immodest Way.
Answ. Well! have not the New-England Men made a Law against Kissing? And what! doth our Taking one another by the HAND offend thee, that thou callest this a New Way of Holi∣ness? And did not Christ Take the Damsel by the Hand? Took the Blind by the Hand? (Mark 5.8.9.) Jesus took him by the Hand? (Luke 8.) Took her by the Hand? And (Act. 9.) did not Peter take Dorcas by the Hand? Did not the Captain take the Young-man by the Hand? (Act. 23.) And what! is this a Crime in R. W.'s Eye, that we Take one another by the Hand? And was not the Word FAREWELL commonly used in the Scriptures? Doth not the Apostle say, Farewell? (Acts 15, 29. and 18, 21:) Bad them Fare-well? and (Act. 23, 30.) Farewell? and (2 Cor. 13, 11.) Finally Brethren Farewell? Thou art Offended, when we say nothing; and Offended, when we say, Farewell: what a Discontented, Doting Man art thou! R. W. And thou sayst: The Quakers dis-respect the Superiors: and some of you have heard, the Quakers Children said to their Father and Mother, George thou liest, and, Mary thou liest; a Language, which deserveth little less than Death. Answ. But thou hast not mentioned, whose Children these were? nor where they lived? nor who gave thee this Report? But R. W. saith, It deserveth little less, than Death: But if R. W. and his Wife do tell their Children, That Christ (that died for our Sins, and is our Mediator between us and God, who hath Enlighted us; and Christ saith, Believe in the Light: And so if R. W. tel∣leth his Children, that this Christ) is a Fancy and a Whimsical Christ, and his Light is an Idol: and if his Children should say, He spoke not true, but it was a Lye of his Father the Devil; then these Children for so saying must deserve Death? for tel∣ling, They Lye and speak not the Truth, seeing it was a Lie, and not the Truth, that they held forth? when such as R. W. are drawing them from the true Christ, that died for their Sins? But we do not own nor love any such thing, that Children should give their Parents the Lie, or be Uncivil or Irreverent to them. And we have all Men in Esteem, as they are God's Crea∣tures: and them that Rule Well, we say, they are worthy of Dou∣ble Honor. But we ask R. W. and his New-England-Priests, Whether all the Honor lieth in Bowing the Knee, and putting of their Hats? and saying You instead of Thou to a single Person? if so, make it good by Scripture: and whether Superiors or Inferiors
cannot be honoured without these? (Secondly) What was the Honor, that the Chief Priests and Pharisees did seek one from a∣nother? and Christ told them, How can ye believe, while ye seek it? And what is the Honor, that cometh from God? And — R. W. Thou sayst of Their Crying down of Musicians and Mu∣sick, so Excellent a Gift of God, &c. Answ. We do charge R. W. and his New-England-Priests to show us any Scripture in the New Testament from Christ and his Apostles, where they said, That outward Musick was an Ex∣cellent Gift of God? For did not all the Outward Musick in the Time of the Law and Prophets type forth the Heavenly Musick and the Melody, that the Saints had and have in Christ in his Grace and Spirit? And further we charge R. W. and his New-England-Priests, if that they had Musick and Musicians in the Church in the Primitive Times, Tell us the Names of those Mu∣sicians, and the Outward Instruments, they Play'd upon? And thou art offended at our Tuning and Singing, and callest it Phantastical; and it's like, 'tis Vnprofitable to thee, who cal∣lest Musick the Gift of God. But hadst thou been in the Days of the Apostles, their Singing with Grace, and making Melody in their Hearts, thou wouldst have called it Phantastical and Absurd, as thou dost now. R. W. And thou sayst, We condemn Carving, Em∣broidering and Painting,pag. 139. and sayst, It is commended by God himself in Scripture. Answ. Here R. W. is one with the Papists, and crieth against us as much as they; and if it be not for Images, it is for the Lust of the Eye, and the Pride of Life: And this R. W. crieth up, as Commended of God; and that Quakers condemn it. Though there was Carving, &c. in the Old Covenant of Works: But we charge R. W. and his New-England-Priests, where God and Christ commended to his Apostles and Disciples Embroidering, Carving and Painting in the New Testament? and name the Names of those Carvers and Painters, &c. among the Church of the Primitive Times. Here R. W. is one with the Papists both in his Musick, and Carving and Painting, in saying, They are commended by God, and a Gift of God. And doth not Christ the Substance End all those Outward Things in the time of the Law in the Old Covenant? R. W. And thou say'st, We cry out against Ornaments of Gar∣ments,
and otherwise against the Order, God hath set in his Works, and the Variety of his Gifts for Necessity, for Conveniency, for Delight, &c. Answ. How now Roger! art not thou one with the Papists here? Now, we charge R. W. and his New-England-Priests to make it good by the Scripture in the New Testament, where Ornaments of Garments are called the Order of God? and that they should set forth his Works, and that Variety of his Gifts for Necessity, for Conveniency, for Delight? This is a Brave Ran∣ting Doctrine of R. W.'s for the Lust of the Eye, for the Pride of Life; which is not of the Father. And art not thou degenerated here from the Apostle's Doctrine in the Primitive Times, That the Women should adorn themselves in Modesty of Apparel? &c. not with broidered Hair, or Gold, or Pearls, or Costly Array; but plaiting the Hair? And Gold and Pearls and Costly Array setteth out the Creature, and are for De∣light and Conveniency: But the Apostle doth not say to the Christians, that those are for Conveniency. But R. W. is angry with the Quakers, because they Cry against such things (1 Tim. 2, 9. and 1 Pet. 3.4.) Who is Adorning, let it not be that Outward Adorning of plaiting the Hair, and the wearing of Gold, or of putting on of Apparel; but let it be in the Hidden Man of the Heart. Now here ye may see, these things are forbidden by the Apostle; and R. W. saith, for Conveniency, for Dilight. And here all may see, how he is degenerated from the Apostle's Spirit and Doctrine, like unto the Vain People, Papists and Jews; and how he opposeth us, that stand for the Doctrine of the Apostle: In this he will have Proselites enough, for Delight and Conveni∣ency, his Vain Doctrine, Contrary to the Apostle. And these are some of the Proofs to prove us to be Like un∣to the Papists, Arminians, and Socinians and Judaism, and that we are not as they were in the Primitive Times: which all these will receive this Doctrine from R. W. very Joyfully; and so he is nearer to them, than the Quakers, which testify against all such things. And so J. B. and W. E. might well tell thee, how thou hast charged them, and Proved nothing: and so, these things are left to every Man's Conscience to Judge, whether R. W. hath proved his Charges, or prov'd himself to be the Man found in those things, which he hath falsly charged upon us; the Lord God and the Witness in People knoweth it! And —
R. W. Thou sayst, Thou asked'st us, where was the Man Christ Jesus now, that we confess'd was Born in Bethlehem, and died at Jerusalem? Answ. We say, He is, where the Scriptures say He is, to wit, at the Right Hand of God. He that Descended, is the same also that Ascended; and yet Manifest by his Spirit in his People (E∣phes. 4, 10.) To this — R. W. saith, Then musl his Body be Ubiquitary (as the Tran∣substantiators and Consubstantiators are forc'd to hold) then must his Monstrous Body come from within his Saints, yea, from within all Mankind to Judgment. Answ. This R. W. might have told to the Apostles, if he had been in their Days, and compared Paul's Doctrine with the Pa∣pists Transubstantiation, who told the Saints, that Christ was in them, except they were Reprobates. And what must we Infer from this Doctrine? That Christ cannot be within his Saints by his Spirit (who is at the Right Hand of God, and filleth all things) but he must be within them, as a Man of four foot Long, as the Priest saith? And whereas thou sayst, That then his Body must be Ubiqui∣tary (that is Every where;) thou may'st as well tell the Apostle so, who saith, He that Descended, is the same also that Ascended up far above all Heavens, that he might fill all things. And was not this Christ, that must Judge the World according to the Go∣spel? R. W. And thou tell'st us of a Woman, Elizabeth Williams, that the Lord open'd her Mouth, and saying: This Man hath discharg'd his Conscience,pag. 140. he hath fully pro∣ved, what he undertook against you; and the Words which he hath spoken, shall Judge you at the Last Day. And then thou goest on pleasing thy self. Answ. But what! hath this Woman set R. W. in the Room of Christ? and must his Words Judge us? and must we believe, that R. W.'s Words, Lies, false Charges and Slanders are equal with Christ's Words? So she hath proved R. W. the Anti-Christ, his Words must Judge us. But R. W. how could the Lord open this Woman's Mouth, when thou say'st, There is no Voice nor Motion within in Heauenly things? &c. But how can R. W. tell us of the Father of Lights, when he calleth Christ's Light an Idol and a Fancy? And so, as fo
Deceived and Deceiving Souls R. W. had better to have kept this at home. R. W. Thou sayst, Thou presented'st a Paper to us at Providence (which thou hadst presented,p. 142.143. at New∣port) Anabaptists moving for the Reading of it. Answ. And Wm. Edmond. might very well call upon thee to make good thy Written Charges; for thou hadst written already more, than thou couldst make good: and thou bringing in of fresh Matter to spend time, and to put by what was already in hand. For the Business we had with thee was, to make good thy false Charges; which thou neither couldst nor hast: and we said well, If the Letter contained Matter tending to prove thy (false) Charge, it should be read. Then (R. W. saith) he put it up at the Motion of Capt: Holden. Now the Reader may see, that we profered fair, viz: If that it concerned the Matter of thy (false) Charge, it should be read. And — R. W. Thou sayst of John Green asking, Whether R. W. be here as a Delinquent charged at the Bar, or as a Disputant upon Equal Terms? and thou sayst, We waved this as well, as we could. Answ. He might have seen, that R. W. charged us; and there∣fore it was but Civil in all people, for to have heard him to make good his Charges, who charged so many horrid false Charges against us (or joined with him, which we offered fairly to them) and shewed their Civility to us as strangers in the Country. For it was he, that Summoned and Arraigned us; and not, that we Arraigned him: which the Vnprejudic'd Reader may see in his Book over and over, how he has Arraigned us, and Judged us and Condemned us; but was turn'd back upon his own Head. So it had been but Civil for any of the people, that took his Part, to have Joined with him; or else to have Ceased, differring any New Matter, till he had done. And — R. W.'s Seventh false Charge and Position is, viz: [The people called Quakers in Effect hold no God,p. 144. Se ow is W. dtes ere! no Christ, no Spirit, no Angel, no Devil, no Resurrection, no Judgement, no Heaven, no Hell, but what is in Man.] And R. W. brings in Alexander Ross (G. F. fol. 273.) say∣ing: [It is horrible Blasphemy to say, The Scriptures are not te Word of GOD; and to say, The Soul is a Part of God.] G. F's
Answ. [The Scriptures are the Words of God (Exod. 20. and in the Book of the Revelations:) and Christ is the Word, in whom the Scriptures end; and he fulfilleth them. And it is not Horrible Blasphemy to say, The Soul is a Part of God (to wit of his Breath) for it came out from him: and that which came out from him, is of him, and rejoiceth in him.] And these four Books of the Revelations was a Mistake in the Printer (though that, which was the four Books of Moses, was Revealed to him.) R. W. Replies: G. F. imagins such a God and Godhead, as maybe d∣vided into parts and pieces, &c. [And this is Answered in the Appen∣dix (p. 108.109.110:) but nevertheless something we shall say to it.] (Answ.) And doth the Apostle divide God into parts and pie∣ces, when he saith; There is One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all and in you all? (Ephes. 4.) And dost not thou confess, The Soul is immortal? and sayst; It's true, in a secondary way (â Posteriori) as they say, The Spirits of Men and Angels are as a Lamp lighted up by the Most-High and In∣finite Majesty never to go out (pag. 49.) And John Stubs read the Words of G. F. and said: The Reason was to be weighed, which G. F. used, which was; [For it came out of him (to wit, out of his Breath) and that which came out of him, is of him, and rejoiceth in him.] And to this End he desired, the words in Gen. 2. might be viewed; which he turned to and read, viz: God breathed into Man the Breath of Life, and he became a Living Soul. And then Samuel Garton said [If it be affirmed, that God can be divided, and that Man was a part of God; the Godhead was destroied, and the Soul of Man:] But we say no such thing, neither doth G. F. say any such Words But doth R. W. and Garton say, That it cannot be a part of his Breath, by which Man became a Living Soul? and is not the Soul called the Breath of Life? and doth not Robeson say, That the Soul properly is the Breath of Life, which God did breath into him at his First Creation? that is his Immortal Soul, which is his Principle of all Breath, Motion and Life in him. (p. 150.) And there is no such word in G. F.'s Answer of the Divine Essence, as the Reader may see. And all the Scriptures, that speak of the Soul, we own; and Christ's saying, They may kill the Body, but not the Soul: yet God is able to cast both Soul and Body into Hell; Who is to be feared. And we own God, who is over all, and in us all, as well with∣out
us, as within us: God, who is a pure, holy Spirit, and Christ at the Right Hand of God (who hath all power in Heaven and Earth given unto him) we own him without and within, and his Kingdom as well without as within; who is God over all, who is blessed for ever! And we own the Angels, who behold the Face of God: and where and in what Book did ever R. W. read, that we said, The Angels were within us? for if they be Ministring Spirits, they must Minister to our Souls within us. For are they not Mi∣nistring Spirits, sent forth to Minister to them, who shall be Heirs of Salvation? (Heb. 1.) And Resurrection, and Judgment, and Heaven and Hell we hold without us, as well as within us, according to the Scriptures. And we must tell thee, all these Lies thou hast of the Father of Lies as well without thee, as within thee. R. W. And thou tell'st us a Story of One desirous to give Thanks at Dinner, asked roundly, To whom should I give Thanks?p. 146. &c. And thou sayst: Calvin relates, that one Quintinius, a Leader this Way, being demanded, how he did? &c. answered resolutely, How can Christ do but well? and yet at that time he was Sick. Answ. Now Mark: Instead of proving R. W.'s Charges, he is telling of Stories; which may be as false upon them, as his Charge is upon us. But R. W. saith; In his time a Leader this Way (to wit, the Quakers) &c. But the Lord knows and his own Conscience, whether he doth not wrong us! and Wm. Edmond. might well reprove him. And then thou sayst; Thou wouldst not trouble us with Proofs but out of our own Writings: and yet thou canst not keep out of these Old Stories. Then — R. W. Bringeth Magnus Bine (G. F. Fol. 88.89.) and this is Answered in the Answer to the Appendix, where he bringeth it there (in his page 47.) And well might Wm. Edmond. say to R. W. Let G. F.'s Words and thy Meaning alone: and keep to his Words. And — R. W. saith: The Fulness of God is one thing, and another thing our (and all his Works and Creatures) Partaking of that Fulness,p. 147. &c. Answ. Who saith to the Contrary? But must not the Saints grow up to a Perfect Man therefore? and unto the
Measure and Stature, and the Fulness of Christ? R. W. And thou say'st: To partake some Drops of the Ocean of his Wisdom, Power, Goodness, &c. is not to become the Ocean of the Power, &c. it self. Answ. But they may come into the Power. But let the Rea∣der see, how he perverts G. F.'s words all along and his Mean∣ings: And we do believe, thou wrongest Sam. Fisher as well as thou hast us. R. W. And when G. F. speaketh of the Fulness of the God∣head dwelling in Christ, thou say'st: He means the Body of the Quakers, &c. Answ. Let the Reader see, if there be any such words in G. F.'s Answer. And that 1 Tim. 3. God is manifested in the Flesh, we own, as the Apostle speaketh it: and S. Fisher's Book neither thou nor J. Owen could ever answer it; though some of you pervert some of his words. R. W. And thou bringest Magnus Bine, &c. which is also Answered in the Answer to the Appendix p. 108. — And thou sayst: In these few Lines let him that hath his Senses, make Common Sense and English of some of them. p. 148.Answ. But let the Reader see in R. W.'s (if he be finding Fault with others▪ how he spells Bishop, with Bist-(in his page—) but I can look over such words, and never heed it. R. W. Thou goest on in thy Railing, and sayst; The old Ser∣pent has taught them, in so much that these bewitched Souls say and print, that this World is God and the Godhead, &c. Answ. The Reader may see, there is no such word in G. F.'s Answer; neither did we say any such word at the Dispute at Pro∣vidence, the people knows it. And then thou call'st us Horrible and Blockish: thou might'st have applied this to thy self, and to that which thou assertest upon us; which are thy own words, not ours.—And G. F. asketh you the question concerning the Soul: but why doth not R. W. Answer it, and tell, what the Soul is? as the Reader may see in pag. 147: in the Book. — And then thou tell'st a Story of the Manichees; when this is no∣thing to the purpose to prove thy Charge; but to fill up the Book and Time. And the Apostle saith, Beware of Dogs: and (Cant: 2:) Beware of Foxes (which thou bringest:) Then the
Lambs must beware of such as thou, and of the New-England-Persecutors. R. W. And thou say'st: You are to fly, &c. from these brutish Fancies, brutish Barkings and Blasphemies against the infinitely Glo∣rious and Inconceivable Excellencies of God, &c. Answ. Then they must Fly from such as thou, who callest Christ's Light an Idol and a Fancy: and therefore thou art not able to know neither Christ nor his Godhead. R. W. And thou qoutest (G. F.'s Fol. p. 67) Fran. Higgin∣son saying, [That one should say, He was Equal with God.] G. F. Answ. [And in the Catechism of the Assembly of the Priests called Divines, which they have put forth to the Nation, in which they have laid down (for young Children, and old Men and all to Learn) That the Holy Ghost and the Son are Equal in Power and Glory with the Father. Yet if any one come to witness the Son of God to by Revealed in him, or any come to witness the Holy Ghost in them, as they did that gave forth the Scriptures, or witness the Mind of Christ, or witness that Equal with the Father, that Equality which you speak of; ye Priests destroy that which ye have put forth to the Nati∣on, and cry out; Horrible Blasphemy, &c.] R. W. Replieth, and beginneth with Raiing and saith: The Quakers say, that they are Equal in Power and Glory with the Father, the Son and Holy Spirit, &c. Answ. Now let the Reader but read G. F.'s Answer and see, how horribly he abuseth it! doth he mention WE? but only the Holy Ghost, and Christ and the Son of God to be Equal with the Father, according as the Priests said; and yet they are a∣gainst this Son and the Holy Ghost to be in Man and Woman. And the Reader may see, how he hath changed a many words in G. F.'s Answer, to instead of or, and Equality for E∣qual: and so hath changed the sence, and crieth out, Horrible Blasphemy; as ye may see in G. F.'s Answer: And besides he hath left out many of his words. An how can they, who are Witnesses of the Holy Ghost, and Witnesses of the Son; how can it be meant, they be Equal, when they are but the Witnesses of it? The Reader may see, if R. W. hath not doe this on pur∣pose, to wrong G. F.'s words. R. W. Bringeth (G. F.'s Fol. p. 282.) Da. Gawdry saying, [Surely, they cannot be Perfect here or hereafter in Equality, but
only in Quality.] G. F.'s Answ. [Christ maketh no distinction in his words, but saith; Be ye Perfect, as your Hea∣venly Father is Perfect;pag. 149. and be ye Merciful, as He is Merciful: and as He is, so are we in this World. And that which is Perfect and Merciful, as he is Perfect and Merciful, is one in Quality with the same thing.] And R. W. Replieth and saith: The Quakers challenge an Equality with God; and crieth, Horrible Blasphemy! Answ. But let the Reader see, if there be any such thing in G. F.'s words in his Answer? but using Christ's words, Be ye Perfect, as your Heavenly Father is Perfect; and Be ye Merciful, as He is Merciful: and as He is, so are we in this present World. Now if these words be Blasphemy, then R. W. may as well call John's and Christ's words Blasphemy: But none of those Sto∣ries proveth his Assertion. And there is not the word Equa∣lity in G. F.'s Answer, which R. W. hath basely thrust in. And — R. W. Bringeth (G. F.'s Fol. p. 248.) [To say, that God is substantially, &c.] Thou bringest Names, and there is no such thing in that page; as the Reader may see in G. F.'s Folio afore∣said. — And then thou sayst: That the Quakers make them∣selves Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. Answ. All people may see, we have need of great patience, to hear all thy Lies and false Charges; for it's thy own Confes∣sion. Thou say'st, that G. F. Answereth, That God will dwell in Man: and the Saints had Vnity with the Father and the Son; and this is Scripture, as in John 1. And how darest thou envi∣ously say upon these words of G. F.'s, They make themselves Fa∣ther, Son, and Holy Ghost? And thou sayst, We make no Distinction between Christ Jesus himself, and his Saints or Believers in him: when often we declared, Christ in us, the hope of Glo∣ry; and, Christ in you, except ye be Reprobates. And how did the Apostles make the Saints the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who preached this Doctrine? R. W. might as well charge the Apostles, as the Quakers. R. W. And thou sayst, We make no other work of Redempti∣on and Justification, but what is wrought in our Spirits, Minds and Fancies, called within them. Answ. R. W. we say, Christ is made unto us Redemption and Sanctification; we make him not, God has made him so to us:
For we know him so by his Light within; and dost thou pervert our words? And thou might'st as well have Charged the Apostle with such sayings, as us, who saith (1 Cor. 1, 30.) But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us Wisdom, and Righteousness, and Sanctification and Redemption: This we witness; Glory to God for ever. And— R. W. Bringeth Christopher Wade (G. F.'s Fol. p. 246,) saying [ God the Father never took upon him Humane Nature.] G. F.'s Answ. [Contrary to Scripture, who saith, GOD was in CHRIST,pag. 150. reconciling the World to him∣self. And art Ignorant of the great Mystery, GOD manifest in the FLESH: and his Name is called the Ever∣lasting Father. As for the word HVMANE, which is From the Ground, it comes from thy own Knowledge, which is Earthly: and Christ took upon him the Seed of Abraham and David, according to the Flesh, and this is Scripture-Language] R. W. Replieth and saith:pag. 151. The Bottom of this is, to deny the Lord Jesus to be a Man, &c. Answ. Let the Reader see and read G. F.'s words, how he wrongeth him; for G. F. speaketh no such thing. And doth not Christ say to his Disciples, when they asked him, Shew us the Father: and he Answered them and said; Believest not thou, that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you, I speak not of my self, but the Father that dwelleth in me, &c. (John 14.) And— R. W. Bringeth in Priest Frgison (G. F.'s fol. p. 293.) say∣ing [That Christ, the Father and the Holy Ghost are not one, but they are Three, therefore Distinct.] G. F.'s Answ. [This is a denying of Christ's Doctrine, who saith, I and my Father are One; and the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father and the Son, and he was Conceived by the Holy Ghost, and they are all One, and not Distinct, but One in Vnity. And that which cometh out from him (to wit, the Holy Ghost) leadeth the Saints into all Truth (and that was it, that ever was given forth from the Spirit of Truth) and so up to God, the Fa∣ther of Truth: and so goeth back, from whence it came.] R. W. Replieth and saith, That G. F. calls that Blasphemy, which the most-Holy and Eternal Lord calls Heavenly Truth: he hath like some Witches, &c. so inur'd himself, &c. Answ. Why R. W? because he speaketh Scriptures? art not
thou like the Pharisees, that could not endure to hear Christ say, That he and his Father was One? And John said, They were One; wilt thou call him a Notorious Wretch? Indeed, thy Spirit will call Christ a Deceiver. But R. W. and his Priests say, They are Distinct: give us a Scripture, that saith so, and that they are not One; and How far are they Distinct one from another; then thou sayst something. R. W. And thou say'st, That the Scripture tells us concerning these Mysteries, that in this Life we know but in part, as through a Glass, darkly, &c. Answ. Let the Reader read 1 Cor. 13. and see, whether R. W. hath not addeth [In this Life] to the Apostle's words? and the Apostle doth not mention [in this Life:] So here thou abusest the Apostle's words, as thou dost ours. And we know, Christ saith, My Father is greater than I: And what then? doth this deny Christ's words, who said, The Father is in him, and he and the Father is One? nay, do not your own Books say, They are One and Equal? But thou wast finding Fault with the Socinians: nay, all the Proofs and Evasions thou bring'st concerning G. F. and M. F. is nothing to disprove Christ's words, who saith, He and the Father are One.pag. 152. And what dost thou talk of the Four Points; of the Pather, Son and Spirit, &c. Fall and Redemption, &c. of the Church-Officers, Baptism, &c. and Resurrection, Eternal Judgment, &c. Art thou like to see them, when thou callest Christ's Light a Fancy and an Idol? For all these we own, as Scripture declares, both within and with∣out, and therefore thy Charge is false. R. W. And thou bring'st in Tho: Collier (in G. F.'s Fol. p. 38.) saying [The Kingdom is not come, nor the Refreshing from the Spirit of the Lord.] G. F. Answ. [Which sheweth, they are like unto the Pharisees, Unconverted, gazing here and there: and Christ told them, the Kingdom was in them. And they that are not turned to the Light, which cometh from Christ the Re∣fresher, whereby Refreshing might come, are not come to Repen∣tance yet.] And R. W. Replieth and saith; Who sees not, that G. F. speakes not here of the Kingdom of Christ in the future and to come, and the times of Refreshing; but that he cuts off all fu∣ture hopes and expectations to come. Answ. The Reader may see, this is a false Interpretation upon
G. F.'s words: for did Christ Cut off all Future Comfort to come to his Saints, when he said, The Kingdom of Heaven was in them? And they that turn to the Light, receive Refreshing from the Lord. And G. F. saith; They that turn not to the Light, which cometh from Christ the Refresher, whereby Refreshings might come, Receive not: And how can R. W. say, G. F. cuts off all future Hopes and Expectations to come? But what should we expect from him, that calleth Christ's Light a Fancy and an Idol? R. W. saith; That the Scripture tells him and Experience, that the Hypocrites have no solid Peace and Joy here, nor so∣lid Hope or Joy of Glory to come,p. 153. &c. Answ. Roger, this is thy own Condition: and if thou did'st not abhor the Thoughts of a Judgment to come, thou would'st never have spoken such words.—And Foolishly, Atheistically, Childish Dreams of no Heaven and Refreshing, which thou speak∣est of, thou might'st have applied to thy self. — And let the Reader see, if G. F. say, There is no Heaven or Hell, or Torment in us? &c. is there any such saying in G. F.'s Answer here? These are words of thy own Forging: and then thou hast charged them upon us, and criest; Foolish, Childish Dreams, &c. which are thy own Sayings, and not ours. R. W. Bringeth John Clapham (G. F.'s Fol. p. 101.) saying: [To witness Heaven and Hell, and Resurrection within, is the Mystery of Iniquity.] G. F.'s Answ. [Which sheweth, thou never knew'st Heaven in thy self nor Hell there, nor Christ's Resurrection and the Life, which they are Blessed, that are made Partakers of the first Resurrection, on them the Second Death shall have no Power. And the Scripture doth witness Heaven within; and if Christ, that was offered up, the Resurrection and the Life, be not within thee, thou art a Reprobate.] R. W. Replieth and saith: If G. F. would speak of Heaven, and An∣gels, and Hell, and Devils, and Resurrection, and Life to come by way of Allusion and Similitude, or by way of First Fruits or Tast of them, he might profitably do it. Answ. All ye, that do not know a Resurrection of Life to come by Christ Jesus, and know not the Kingdom of Heaven within you, how can ye know it without you? And know Hell and the Strong Man cast out there, how will ye know the Eternal Judge∣ment, which is upon the Devil and his Angels? upon the Wicked
(cast into Hell, and the Lake which burnes with Fire and Brim∣stone) which go to the Devil, who is out of the Truth; who are gone from the Spirit of God, his Grace, his Truth in the In∣wards parts, and his Light which thou callest a Fancy and an Idol, which will condemn thee: and thou shalt know a Hll, which thou so much pleadest for without thee. And we are not Revolted from the true Christians Faith and Religion, that was in the Apostles Days, but thou, that deniest this, art. And— R. W. in the same page bringeth Some Nameless Author (G. F.'s Fol: p. 214.) saying: [To say, the Heaven and Glory is in Man, which was before Man was, they are sttish and blind.] G. F. Answ. [There is none have a Glory and a Heaven, but within them, which was before Man had a being] And he brings Tho: Pollard's Saying: (G. F. Fol: p. 81;) [For a perfection of Glory to be attained to on this side the Grave, I utterly deny.] G. F. Answ. [Where Glory is in the least Degree, it is in Perfection; and who have not Glory, and do not Attain to Glory on this side the Grave, they are in a sad Condition. For the Saints rejoiced with Joy unspeakable and full of Glory; and they witnessed the Hope of Glory within them, while they were upon the Earth (Col. 1:) and of that Hope they were to give a Reason, that was within them. And they Saw the Glo∣ry of God, and of the Father; and so came to be Changed from Glory to Glory, till they came into the Image of God. And the A∣postle saw &c.] And so ye may read at large in G. F.'s Fol: which is to large to be set down here: but R. W. hath taken about three lines of it, and left out the rest. And — R. W. replieth: As the Swinish Epicures and Dives's of this World, (what-ever they formally and loosly profess) have no solid Hope of Peace and Joy to come after this Life: and therefore (like Brute Beasts) practically confess it, saying in their Hearts and Lives; [Let us eat and drink, for to morrow we must die, &c.] Answ. What is this to the purpose for G. F.'s Answer? R. W. might have put himself amongst his Company, and Judged him∣self, as well as others, for it's his own Condition. p. 154.R. W. thou sayst, Thou knowest, that same of the Qua∣kers will not believe, that G. F. and others of them deny the Resurrection, &c.
Answ. And why should they believe a Lie, as thou dost? and why should not we stand by G. F.'s words, when he speaketh Scripture? and thou that dost not, deniest Scripture, and the Light of Christ, and call'st it a Fancy. And the Resurrection we own accor∣ding to Scripture. R. W. And here thou bringest the Ninth false Charge, viz: All that the Quakers Religion requireth externally and inter∣nally to make Converts or Prselytes, amounts to no more, then what a Reprobate easily may attain to and perform. Answ. This is false: for Reprobates do not believe in the Light, and become not Children of Light, and recive not Christ in them, from whence the Light cometh. R. W. And thou hopest, many of us will come to Abraham's Bosom. [But then why dost thou rail at us? And how can we come to Abraham's Bosom, and Attain to no further, then to what a Reprobate may?] And then thou sayst: Thousands may have got∣ten, all their Religion requires or performs, yea, all that their Prin∣ciples call for outwardly or Inwardly, and yet not be accepted but re∣jected from the holy presence of God. Answ. How now Roger! and yet come to Abraham's Bosom? O Roger, thy Darkness cannot comprehend the Light, that seest not our Condition, no more then thou seest the Saints in the Apotles Days; thou would'st have said the same of them, had'st thou been in their Day. We know our Assurance of God, and our Acceptation through Jesus Christ, his Beloved Son, through whom we have peace with God: and we do know the Son by Reve∣lation, and God that sent him, which is Eternal Life, Blessed be his Name for Ever! And are grafted into him, and built upon him, the Rock and Foundation of the Prophets and Apostles: and thy words are but Chaff. R. W. And then thou tell'st a story of Perkins, and appliest that to us, which he spoke of the Papists: But thou hadst better to have applied this to thy self. And thou fall'st a Judging the Common Protestants and Quakers, and tell'st of their Great Refor∣mations and Joys, &c. their enduring great persecution and burning of their bodies,p. 155. &c. and yet be far from the true Protestant Religion, either in the true Dctrine and Prin∣ciples, or in the true Life and Practice of it. Answ. How can Roger Williams tell? why doth he Judge such,
that they were not in the true Religion? — Who was this Pro∣testant? not in New-England, nor R. W; he never felt the Flame, nor was BRANDED with an HOT IRON: his Religion will not lead him to undergo such suffering, (for why did he not stand, but go in the Woods, when he was tried in Boston-Colony?) But R. W. would make people believe, he was a High Prote∣stant beyond all these; but plainly, he is nothing but a Railer, as his Book doth make manifet. But let the Reader see, how he hath lost himself, and gone from G. F.'s Answer And— R. W. Tearmes our Faith to Rotten Nature, &c: and our Pray∣yers, and Fastings and Sufferings to Womens filhy Clouts, and dung of Men and Beasts, put into the Ballance of God's Infinite Justice, instead of the Infinite Righteousness and Satisfaction of the Son of God, &c. Answ. As for the Papists, they may Answer for themselves; but our FAITH Jesus Christ is the Author and Finisher of: we had it not from Men nor Rotten Nature. And we Pray, as we are moved by the Spirit of God; and ast, as we are ordered by his Divine Wisdom: And our Sufferings amongst the New-Eng∣land-Professors have been for the Truth and the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ's sake, in whom our Poor Souls have had Satisfaction. And we know Christ's words to be true, Blessed are they, that Suffer for Righteousness sake, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven (Matth. 5.) And for all thy Vngratious Words the Lord will re∣buke thee in one Day; and in that Day of thy Torment remem∣ber, thou hast wronged us. R. W. And thou scoffingly sayst, That if a Notorious Drun∣kard be convinced, and come to hearken to a Spirit within, to say Thee and Thou, and thinks himself Equal and above all his former Superiors, &c. he is Justified, Sanctified, &c. and so holy, that he cannot sin in Thoughts and Words, &c. Thus they pretend Re∣pentance, Faith, and a Change of Heart, because they have changed their Talk and Garments. Answ. The Spirit of God within leadeth to no such Sudden Thing; neither is the Work so easily done, as R. W. here would foist into the minds of the World, to make them load the Truth: neither shall he find it so easy himself, if ever he should see a Day of Repentance. And the Spirit of the Lord leadeth to Humility, and that is a good Spirit that Leadeth to Modesty in Apparel, and to True Words, and from Evil Thoughts, and from
Drunkenness. For after a Man is restrained from Actual Sins without him, then he cometh to know the putting off the Body of it within, and crieth as Paul did to Christ: for no Man can help him then, but He that did help Paul, who Thanks God in Victo∣ry in the end. But why should R. W. be so against the Spirit within, in saying THEE and THOV, and putting off our need∣less Apparel, seeing it was the Practice of the holy Men of God in the Scripture? hath not he proved himself, that he is degene∣rated from the Spirit, Life and Practice of the Primitive Church? R. W. And thou say'st, John Bradford said unto God, Lord thou art Heaven, and I am Hell. Answ. And was not this Hell within him, think'st thou? and if so, why dost thou find Fault with the Quakers? R. W. Then thou fallest on a preaching; but to no purpose to thy Position, nor G. F.'s answer. — And dost thou not say,p. 156. The Blood of God doth Cleanse and Re∣deem (thee)? Answ. And yet dost thou not find Fault with the Quakers, for men∣tioning the Blood of God? And the 2 Cor: 7. doth not evidence thy True Repentance from a Pharisee's. And — R. W. Thou say'st, That no Papist nor Quaker by their Grounds could get up this Jacob's Ladder, much less upon Higher Grounds or steps of casting off Self. Answ. As for the Papists, they may Answer for themselves: and the Quakers Cast off Self by the Light and Power of Christ, by which they see it; and by which Light they see Christ, who is their Way to God. R. Williams, thou inventest words, and then thou fightest against them, which are none of ours. And the Quakers never said, That the Activity of Nature could advance and clime up any higher then it self: for Natural Man (we do tell thee) knoweth not the things of God; but they are Revealed by the Spi∣rit. And so it's clear, thou art in the Rotten Nature thy self, thou speakest so much of, that hatest the Light of Christ, which callest the Light of Christ a FANCY, which giveth the Know∣ledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Christ Jesus; who re∣maineth in the Heavens, until all things be restored: and he is lifted up, and is drawing Men after him with his Light, Power and Spirit. And J. Stubs and we might well say to thee, Thou countest our
Religion an Easie Religion; but thou never trod'st in it. We know, where thou art, in the Broad Way; for the Narrow Way is not so Easy: thou hast not found it yet, though thou may'st talk of it. For thou and the New-England-Priests are but Holders of Opinions and Sayers, Pharisee-like: the Scriptures and your Religion is but in your Lips, but ye never came into the Possession with God's Spirit of that, of which they speak. And your Formalities, that ye have performed, have but been with your own spirits, (that is clearly manifest) and the Evil Spirit, by which ye have been led to Persecute God's People. And so have manifest your selves, that ye are not in the Sirit of Christ, nor have his Mind to love Christians, and to Love Enemies: worse than Ham, who laid open his Father's Nakedness, for thou invent'st words to make us Naked to the World: But the more we are Clothed; the Lord clotheth us: Blessed be his Name for ever! But R. W. is talking of this body's and the other body's Re∣ligion, and of Arminians, Papists and Socinians Religion; but he hath not told the World, what his own Religion is: and so W. Edmondson might very well tell thee, Thou knewest not, what true Religion was (as in thy page 157.) And — pag. 157.R. W. Thou say'st: Our Religion is like the Pa∣pists which is easy and agreeable with Nature. Answ. Had our Religion been Easy and Agreeable to Nature than your Corrupt Nature had not Persecuted us, nor HANGED, nor WHIPT, nor BVRNT us with your Hot Iron: but our Religion is that Religion, which James speaketh of, which is Pure and Vndefiled, &c. R. W. And thou say'st, It is easy to perswade the Quakers, to change one foul Devil for another. Answ. Nay, ye New-England-Priests and Professors find it not so Easy, when ye cannot do it with your HANGING, and WHIPPING, & BVRNING, & BRANDING with your Hot Iron, and CVTTING OFF EARS: and it's thy own Conditi∣on To prate of a Narrow Path, (and changing one Devil for another, as thou speakest of) but never camest into it. R. W. And then thou tell'st a story of the Papists Whipping themselves: [What is all this to tell such Tales and Stories, to prove thy Charge and Reply to G. F?] And then thou tell'st a Story of Mahomet having Thirteen parts of the World, being di∣vided
into Thirty: &c. and the Church of Rome, the great Whore. Answ. What is all this to the purpose of proving thy false Position against a Great People (as W. E. said to thee without Boasting) a great people, that thou had'st slandered? But your New-England-Priests (Pharisee-like) have WHIPT the Servants of God, instead of Whipping themselves. And — R. W. thou say'st: It is to thee, and may be to all men Wonderful,p. 158. that since the Religion of the Quakers is so Easy, &c. that Ten Thousands more of People, &c. have not listed themselves under this New Mahomet, &c. Answ. This is Scoffing R. W: and we must tell thee, neither thou nor Mahomet, nor the Ten Thousands will find our Way so Easie; which is the Straight Way, that leadeth to Life (For as Christ saith, We are hated of all Men for his sake (Mat. 10, 23.) His words are true) And is the New and Living Way, which the Primitive Christians walked in: which any tender-hearted Christians may see and savor, that thou art led by a foul Spirit in the broad Way, scoffing at them, that are in the Narrow Way. R. W. And thou say'st: It's true, we pretend two Horns like the Lamb. [Where is there any such Pretence in G. F.'s Re∣ply, which thou wilt maintain thy Slanders by?] And thou say'st: The Quakers only want a Sword, to subdue as many Proselites, as Mahomet and the Pope: The Quakers some prate subtily, some Childishly against Carnal Weapons, &c. Answ. R. W. How doth this hang together? do we Prate sub∣tily and Childishly against Carnal Weapons? and yet do we Want a Sword? Nay, we do tell thee, we do not Want one; for we have the Sword of the Spirit, the WORD of GOD: and we have and do deny outward, Carnal Weapons to convert peo∣ple to Religion by, but those are your Weapons of New-England, their Fruits have declared it, whose Souls cry under God's Altar; How long, O LORD! &c. And therefore let thee and them Dread God's Vengeance from Heaven. So with your Carnal Sword ye are like Mahomet and the Papists; for thou say'st, thou would'st have us Punish'd: and that must be by such, as have the Sword. And so thine and your Pretences are Opposite to the Meek and Patient Spirit of true Purity and Holiness: And what is your
Principle then? AND how canst thou say, We are Led by a Dumb Spirit? when thou say'st (in page 133.) Our Apostles, and Messengers and Preachers sent into New and Old England? &c. and yet thou contradictest thy self and say'st, We are Led by a Dumb Spirit. And as for Dogged, thou and thy New-England-Priests might have kept it to themselves. AND thou talkest of Shameful Pride and Vapouring, and Mouthful of Cursing and Rail∣ing, and to march under the Christian Name and Colours; This is thy own Condition (see Append. p. 119.) Spitting out the Ve∣nom (as thou say'st;) There thou may'st see thy self: thou art worse than Balaam, and as bad as Balak. R. W. Thou say'st, It's wonderful, how their Spirit professing to be Protestants, can so wickedly strike in with the Bloody Spirit of the Papists against the Witnesses and Martyrs of Jesus.pag. 159. Answ. R. W. hath not proved any thing of his Charge, not by G. F.'s words, neither out of other Books: but because J. Parnel calleth them Your Records, this doth not prove, that we Strike in with that Bloody Spirit of the Papists against the Witnesses and Martyrs of Jesus; But it is thou and the New-England-Priests, that have drunk in that Bloody Spirit, and have drunk the BLOOD, as they did in Queen Mary's Days, &c. And had those Martyrs been in your Days, Men and Women, that preached Christ, ye would have served them, as ye serve us now: And — Our MARTYRS of IESUS will be Recorded to POSTERITY — against you; for the Martyrs bore this same Testimony in ma∣ny things, as we do. And again thou speakest over and over of our Women going stark Naked: but this is Answered fully in other places. R. W. Thou say'st: Thou wonderest, how any Godly Soul, how any Learned, &c. who have studied the Primitive Copies of He∣brew and Greek Scriptures, can yoke with such rude Bablings and Repetitions of simple, ignorant Praters. Answ. R. W. might very well have applied this to himself: for let him look back (and the honest Reader) and see his Simple Re∣petitions and Ignorant Prating over and over; and therefore are we constrained to speak the same things over and over: and then in some places we have left the same things, because we
have Answered them so often. And so its true, I do not know, where Any Godly Soul, either in New-England or here doth Join with R. W. for he hath not discovered, what Fellowship he is of. R. W. Thou say'st: The Hebrew, Greek and Latin, &c. which Helps most of the Leaders of the Quakers want. Answ. But what Fruits have either the Papists or R. W. and his New-England-priests brought forth by these Helps, seeing ye are found in the Spirit, that Crucified Christ? What Help was the Latin to the Romans, when they persecuted the Martyrs of Jesus in the Ten Persecutions? What Help was the Hebrew to the Jews, who Crucified Christ? What Help was the Greek to the Grecians, seeing Christ faith, It is the Spirit of Truth, that leadeth into all Truth? and, No Man knoweth the things of God, but by the Spirit of God? and, No Man knoweth God, but by Revelation; And therefore what Helps are those Natural Languages to any people concerning their Salvation? But R. W. hast not thou been poring and doting about the Natural Languages, till at last thou art grown so dark with thy Helps, that thou callest the Light of Christ an Idol and a Fancy? And if we must study the Hebrew, Greek and Latin, as thou hast done, 'tis to no purpose: and may be some of the Quakers know these Languages better than thou. R. W. Thou tellest a great Story of the Ranters, (and thou seemest to Join the Quakers with them; but thou canst not, when the Lord hath separated them by his Holy Spirit) where thou say'st,p. 160. Thou hast known the Ranters almost Sixty Years: — and thou say'st (p. 28.) The Ranters are but the Quakers Vgly Child and Daugh∣ter, and Rantism rose from their Bowels.—and then again thou say'st (p. 27.) The Quakers are but a New-upstart Party or Faction, risen up little above 20. Years since in the Northern Parts of England, Lancashire. Answ. Now, let but the Reader read his pages, and see his Confusion and Contradictions, and how he hath Lost himself in his Ac∣counts, in proving the Ranters the Quakers Daughter; who con∣fesseth to his own Knowledge, He hath known the Ranters nigh 60. years ago: and saith, The Quakers are but a New-Upstart Faction, little above 20: Years since, so he hath made the Child (the Daughter) according to his own Knowledge, nigh 40. Years Elder then the Mother. This is like the Rest of his doting Proofs,
to prove our Religion false.—And as to the Adamites, and Mon∣strous Religion, thou might'st have kept that to thy self, which the Spirit of God abhorreth. R. W. Thou say'st: These Moderate Times have not driven the Quakers to bow down to their Spirit for Fear of Persecution, &c. Answ. This ye know well enough in New-England, where it concerned our Lives in the Heat of your Persecution; we could not Bow to your Image, no more then the Three Children could Bow to Nebuchadnezzar's. R. W. Thou say'st: Some are false and rotten in their Pro∣fession, and ready to fall and tumble, when any strong Wind of Temptation blows upon them.p. 161. Answ. This is the New-England-Priests and Profes∣sors, and R. W.'s own Condition. For how did'st thou stand in Boston-Colony? And how did ye stand in New-England? And how have ye Received God's Servants, but with your WHIPS and GALLOVSES? &c. And so the Lord hath tried your spirit, and we have stood your Tempests and Winds of Persecution, and did not Tumble down. And Christ bids his Disciples, Take heed of the Leaven of the Scribes and Pharisees; Truly, so his Disci∣ples must still of you, who are found in that Leaven. And ma∣ny things thou writest here, which thou might'st have applied to thy self. And— R. W. Thou sayst; They that are taken by the Quakers Bait, are such as never Loved truly the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity, (as the Scripture speaketh) neither within nor without, &c. Answ. This is like the Rest, Roger: for we declare, None can Love the Lord Jesus Christ in Sincerity and in Truth (as the Scrip∣ture speaketh on) within and without; but such as own the Light of Christ, which he hath enlightned them withal, and believe in his Light. Then there is a Belief in the Heart, and with the Mouth a Confession is made to Salvation: and this is not Oppo∣site to Christ without, as thou falsly speakest. And thou say'st: And some will plead with Christ at the Last Day, &c. Yea, R. W. that will be a Sad Day to thee, when thou art rewarded according to thy Works; who call'st his Light an Idol and a Fancy. R. W. Then thou say'st: I told the Quakers, that their Theora John pretended to write after the Spirit, &c. a Volumn in Hebrew, &c.
Answ. What is this? Why dost thou call him Our Theora John, when he never was no Quaker? But this is like the rest of thy Proofs. And then goest on with thy If's and thy And's to no purpose. R. W. Thou say'st: It was a famous Principle of the first New-England Reformers, viz:p. 162. To be Christianly careful, that their members gave Christian Evidence (so far as Godly Eyes of Charity could reach) of the truth of their Conver∣sion and turning unto God; which (thou say'st) for ought thou know∣est, is not changed by their Successors. Answ. Which if so, that the Successors Evidence be the same, that the First New-England Reformers was; then it cannot be the Evi∣dence of a True Christian: as witness their Fruits of Persecution and Cruelty in BLOOD-SHED, which never was an Evidence of a true Church of the true Lord Jesus Christ; but the Evidence of the false Church, the Whore, that drunk the Blood of the Saints, as the Church of New-England hath Evidenced and proclaimed to Christendom and the Indians also. R. W. saith, That our Religion, Principles and Practice arise to no higher, then what a Reprobate may attain unto. Answ. What! because New-England's Religion, Principle and Practice has risn no higher, then what a Reprobate may attain unto? therefore he Judgeth, that ours Attaineth no higher, than his own. And poor Man, how can he do otherwise, when he blasphemeth against the Light of Christ, which We are comman∣ded by Christ to believe in, and to receive him in us; and so no Reprobates. R. W. Bringeth forth his Tenth Position: That the Popes of Rome do not swell with, and exercise a greater Pride, then the Quakers have express'd and would aspire unto; although many truly humble Souls may be Captivated amongst them. And R. W. Thou say'st: Thou hast a spacious Field to walk in, the Pride of Christ Jesus his pretended Triple-Crowned Vicar, and the Pride of the New Papists pretending to be Christ himself. [and under the Papists he means us.] Answ. As for the Papists (as we have often said) let them Answer for themselves. And where did ever any of the Quakers pretend to be Christ Jesus? we charge R. W. that he shew it; there is no such thing in G. F.'s Answer, which he quoteth to prove his false Charges. But as for his calling us New Papists, truly, this hits himself and his New-England-persecutors, whose
Image they have born; their BLOODY HANDS and their Laws declare it, they be in the Spirit of the Old Papists, and not we, who suffered Death by both of them both in Rome, in France and in New-England: and we may very well call it NEW ROME. R. W. And thou tell'st us of the Devil's Pride and Condemnation in Spiritual Gifts, Priviledges and Excellencies: this was the De∣vil's Break neck, and will be of the Pope's and Quakers, &c. Answ. R. W. and dost not thou say (pag. 154.) Thy Hope is, that many of us may come to Abraham's Bosom? and now dost number us with the Devil's Pride, and our Necks must be broken with him and the Pope? And under the Devil's Condemnation? R. W. might have applied this at home better, and to many of the New-England-Church, then to the Quakers. But R W. and the New-England-Priests, we would have you make good by Scripture, what Spiritual Knowledge the Devil hath, and Spiritual Gifts and Priviledges, and Spiritual Excellencies? For Christ saith, There is no Truth in him (the Devil;) and then what spiritual Knowledge, spiritual Gifts, spiritual Priviledges and spiritual Ex∣cellencies hath the Devil? describe them, and let us see, where they be written in the Scriptures, that Christ and the Apostles said so much of the Devil, as thou hast done? R. W. Thou say'st: As to the Quakers, they know, it is not yet time to put on the Eagle's and the Lion's, but the Sheep's and Foxe's Skin, and say'st; But if—let loose, the Qua∣kers Spirit—would scorn to come behind the Pope.p. 163. Answ. Thou and the New-England-priests might ve∣ry well have applied this at home, who have gotten the Sheep's-Skin; but have been the Wolves and Foxes, devouring the Lambs. But it is the Pope's Spirit, (and not the Quakers) who have shed the Blood of Christ's Martyrs: So have the New-England-People SHED our BLOOD for the Testimony of Jesus. But we and the Reader may understand, that their Guilty Consciences are a∣fraid of an Eagle to be let loose upon them: And is not the Fourth Angel pouring out his Vial upon your Head, that maketh thee to Blaspheme? and the Fifth upon the Seat of the Beast, that you Gnaw your Tongues so, and Blaspheme the God of Heaven? So it's clear, that ye are not Come behind the Pope's Spirit, who have SHED the BLOOD of the Lambs of Christ: And so the Com∣parison is true between you and the Pope, and not the Quakers, whom thou wickedly slanderest.
And W. Edmond. saying, That thou had'st slandered many peo∣ple both in Old England, &c: Did this fright thee? This was not a Boasting of our Numbers, as thou scoffingly say'st, W. Edmond. was a fit Man to make a Bonifacius or a Hildebrand, and J. S. also, &c. and all of them are ready to cry up Diana, whom all Asia and the World worshippeth. Answ. Now let the Reader see, whether R. W. speak Truth or no? Do All call Christ the Light (with which he Lighteth every Man that cometh into the World) and God (whom we wor∣ship in Spirit and Truth, as Christ commanded above Sixteen hun∣dred Years since) Diana, whom the World worshippeth? What an Enmity is in R. W. against Christ, his Light and the Worship of God! (as John 4.) And as for his Saying Bonifacius and Hildebrand, which W. Edmond. and J. S. is so fit to make, This he might have very well applied at home to his New-England-Priests, and see his Boniface there, and BLOODY perscution ready made: J. S. they cast him in the Goal; and Nicholas Alexander a Justice of Peace of Jamaica, when they came to visit their Friends, they cast him in the Goal: And this was their Entertainment in New-England. R. W. And thou say'st: In their first Creeping (like Hercules) out of the Cradle, how doth this Spirit dare the Spirits of Kings, &c. to Thou and Thee to the Faces of Mighty Monarchs: with what rzen, Faces, &c. Answ. The Reader may see, what a plague the word THEE and THOV is to R. W! yet was the Language of Christ and the holy Men of God both to Superior and Inferior. And R. W. who calleth himself an Orator, what! hath he not read his Acci∣dence and Grammar, Plural and Singular? Is the Practice of this called Brazen Face by R. W? Then why do they teach the Chil∣dren Plural and Singular? AND for their First Creeping (like Hercules) &c. Plainly, this might the New England-priests and professors very well applied to themselves: What Protestations of Religion have they made in their First Creeping out? And how at last they threw it all down, and turn'd it into Persecution both among themselves and Strangers. R. W. And thou art offended, because we do not Bow our Knee, and Vncover our Heads (which thou call'st Reverence,) &c.
Answ. Is not R W. worse then the Turk here, and more fon∣der of his superstitious Honor? For doth not the Turk say: The Christian spends most of his time in shewing of his Bare Head? But where did the Apostles or Christ command, that the Christians should Put off their Hats one to another, and Bow their Knee, and say YOV to a Single Person? We do charge R. W. and the New-England-priests to give some Scripture for it, seeing they make so much to do about it. And W. Edmond. saying Whist, Whist, upon this thou scoffingly call'st him Pope Edmondson: Nicholas Easton,p. 164. the Governour was not offended at it; and what should R. W? but only proud Pharisee-like, seeking the honour one of another, and is offnded, because he hath it not. And if the Honor was sought, which cometh down from a∣bove, this would be laid into the Dust. BVT hath not R. W. who looketh so much at Putting off the Hat, and Bowing the Knee, proved himself to be Like the Pope here, and not the Quakers who Put off the Hat and Bow their Knee neither to him nor the Pope, and neither King nor Governour are offended at it? So R. W. hath proved the New-England-priests and himself like the Pope, and not the Quakers, with his Hat and Knee. R. W. Thou say'st, That the Pope sits in the Temple of God, as over the Churches and Consciences, &c. Answ. So doth R. W. and his New-England-priests BRAN, HANG, WHIP and SPOIL the GOODS of such, as will not Bow to the Image of their Religion, &c. R. W. And thou say'st, That We do not regard; as the Apstle and the Berens, the Holy Scripture. Answ. This is false: for we trying you by the Scriptures, ma∣keth you so to Rage, whose words and practice is Contrary to them, and therefore you cry so often for Meanings. And it is the Spirit of Truth, that proceeds from the Father and Son, that lea∣deth into all Truth, and leadeth us into the Truth of the Scrip∣tures. AND why should not we send Word to our Friends of Coming into the Country? &c. this doth Torment thee: Yea, and the Lord will Torment you more; who is gathering his people, and drawing them to his Son, and bringing them from your Barren Mountains: and he has set his Shepheard over them, Christ Jesus. Read Ezek: 34. how ye have Marr'd Pastures and Foul'd Springs, and Thrust the Sheep with your Shoulder. And —
R. W. is offended, because our Meetings are Established in New-England. And thou tell'st of Laws, Papers and Decrees, but thou hast not produced them. And it was always our Practice, as thou scoffingly say'st, [There was not Liberty for all to speak, as the Spirit gave them Vtterance, till G. F. came into New-England] That is false. And our Vnity stands in the Holy Spirit of God, which is the Bond of peace; if any go from it, they are reproved. And why did'st not thou produce the Decrees, thou say'st, G. F. gave forth,p. 165. of loosing from that brutish and dog∣ged Behaviour, &c. and commanding them to be more So∣ciable and Man-like? Answ. This is Untruth: for G. F. gave them no such Com∣mand: this is a base Reflection upon thy Neighbours, for they were Sociable and Manlike afore. And as for brutish and dogged, Ro∣ger may keep at home: for he had not so much Civility, as to speak to G. F. when he was at Providence; but snarling behind his back, Base and Vn-manlike. And did not we Bow and Vn∣cover our Heads in Prayer, &c. before G. F. came to New-England? R. W. But thou say'st of G. F. uncovering his Head, and Bow∣ing to the people, and passing through the midst of them with his Hat in his Hand, with much Respect and Civility: and he blames others, that did not so, &c. Therefore thou Concludest, that either the For∣mer Spirit or the Latter is not of God — Answ. According to thy forged Lies or false Reports. Neither did G. F. Vncover his Head, nor Bow to the people, when he past through them; it is not his Practice: though he might take his Hat in his hand, when he was Hot, and walked through the peo∣ple. And G. F.'s putting off his Hat was in Reverence to the Lord, the God of Heaven, and not to Man. R. W. Thou say'st, The Pope lifts up himself as God over the Scriptures, and, He is Sole Judge, &c: and dispenseth of Oaths and Marriages, &c. Answ, Might not R. W. have kept this at home, with his New-England-Priests, that They must be the Interpreters of the Scrip∣tures, and so Over the Scriptures? For doth not R. W. cry out against us for Want of Meanings, and saith, We take it Literal∣ly, and we are Fools and Silly, and will not own your Meanings? And therefore do not thou claim the power of the Expounding, as the Pope doth. AND are not the New-England-Priests and
Professors both the Dispensers of Oaths and Marriages (Pope like?) But we neither Swear, nor Marry none, but are Witnesses to them. R. W. For dost not thou say, We admit of no Interpreter, but Our selves? Answ. Nay R. W. It is not Self, that Interprets Scripture: we tell thee, they were given forth from the Holy Ghost, and it is the Holy Ghost, that leadeth into all Truth of them: which the Papists and ye cannot endure to hear of; and so are of one Birth, that persecutes him that is born after the Spirit. R. W. And thou say'st, That we said, We would be tried by the Scriptures; and yet (thou say'st) We admit of no Interpreter, &c. Answ. Then the Scripture it self is not the Trier, but the Meaning, which the Interpreter giveth, must be the Judge, according to thy sense: How is the Scripture the Judge then, as thou say'st? And so the Meaning is set up, and not the Spirit, and this makes the Confusion in the whole World: and is not this One with the Pope? And we say, The Spirit of God is the Interpreter of its own words, that gave them orth. R. W. And thou say'st over and over, That the Papists and Quakers said, that there would be no Loss if the Scriptures were gone out of the World. Answ. These are but thy own words, to prove thy false Char∣ges, that thou say'st: We most horribly and hypocritically trample the Scriptures under our proud Feet. R. W. And whereas thou say'st, Tha the Quakers and Papists most Insultingly lift up themselves against the Servants and Children of God all the World over,p. 166. that bow not to their Images. Answ. R. Williams hath mistaken himself; it's he and the New-England-Professors, and the Papists: for never did the Quakers force any to their Religion by WHIPS, &c: So they are Brethren in Iniquity. And so the tender Babes have been TORN, and received MARKS in their Backs with your WHIPS, and the BRAND with your Hot Iron, and your CVTTING OFF EARS, and your Immodest STRIPPING of Women and Maidens at your Whipping-posts. NOW we do Charge R. W. and all his New-England-Priests, where ever Christ, or the Apostles or the Church in the Primi∣tive Times did Strip Men and Women, Young and Old, as ye have done? O! ye have been a Shame to Christianity among the very Indians!
R. W. saith: And say not the Quakers (as the Pope, &c.) All that believe not in their pretended Light, their Repentance, Holiness Zeal, Preaching, &c. is nothing. Answ. The Papists do not own the Light; for Papists do not believe in the Light, that lighteth every Man, that cometh into the World, no more than thou, and you of New-England. And so in this thou canst not compare us with the Papists, but thee, that callest the Light of Christ (which Christ bids us Believe in, that we may become Children of the Light) an Ido and a Fancy: But thou and they, that do so, are in a blind Zeal, and cannot see Repentance. And what is your Holiness and Preaching good for without the Light of Christ, that shineth in the Heart, that should give the Knowledge of him? AND we do profess and preach Christ, that Died without the gates of Jerusalem without us, and yet is manifest to us by his Spirit, and dwelleth in our Hearts by Faith (Eph. 3) yea, it is for his sake, that the Birth of the Flesh Persecutes us: and so we follow the Lamb, his Leading. AND so as for Apollo's Worshippers, by whose Priests the Devil gave Oracles, R. W. might have applied at home, who owneth no Voice or Motion of Heavenly things in him; and therefore how can he Worship God in Spirit and Truth? AND this He∣brew Child, the Lord Jesus Christ, will stop thy Mouth, as he did the Devil's, whom Apollo Consulted withal (as thou say'st) for neither he nor thou have proved your Lying Charges: And G. F.'s words stand against thee clear from thy Charges: R. W. And why dost thou say, We upbraid all o∣ther Ministers and people for being out of the Infallible Spirit?pag. 167. Answ. Do not your Ministers, and Peopl and Professors Confess; Ye have not the same Immediate Holy Ghost, as the Prophets and Apostles had? So then, are not ye Fallible (Pope and Papist-like) and not true Ministers and Over-seers made by the Holy Ghost▪ who are not led by the same Holy Ghost as the Apostles were? and so degenerated from the Apostles Spirit in the Primitive Times: And J. Stubs witnessing the Vnction and saying [as in John, &c.) Hereby we know, that we dwell in him, because he hath given us of his Spirit (John 1.] and W. Edmondson, they did not proudly boast of the Spirit (as thou scoffingly say'st) but they spoke, what they knew. R. W. saith: The Apostles were Eye-Witnesses of the Resur∣rection of Christ, &c. but who are you? &c.
Answ. Yea, but Who are you? and who art thou, that callest the Light of Christ a FANCY? R. W. And thou say'st, That G. F. said at Providence, that he opened the Eyes of the Blind. Answ. But thou didst not hear him say so, for thou wast not there: and yes, he and we do, turning them from Darkness to Light. But thou, that callest the Light a Fancy, stoppest their Eyes? As for the Pope's and Balaam's (thou migth'st have put in Balak too) Saying, This he and his New-England Priests might have applied to themselves, and not to the Quakers: for they have not only railed and cursed, but HANGED; outstript Ba∣lak and Balaam. AND as for the Quaker in London and She-Apostle, that cal∣led some Devil in New-England; That was not of God, that SHED his Servants BLOOD, nor that Envyes them.pag. 168. — AND the Quaker at London carrying Dung in to the Priest; It was to shew him, that it was Like his and your Profession: who ventur'd his Life. But you New-England-Professors could cast him into your Prison at Boston: That is your Entertaining of Strangers at Boston. R. W. Thou say'st: It is the great point of horrible Pride both among Papists and Quakers, exalting Dung and Dirt of their own Qualifications, xcellencies, Graces, &c. and so goest on railing and say'st, That we count the Business of this Christ (as the Pope said) but a Fable. Answ. This is false, the Lord knoweth it! It never enter'd in our Hearts. And thou that art to prove thy false Charges with such horrid Lies, add'st Lie unto Lie: and therefore what are your Qualifications and Excellencies, but Dung and Dirt? which thou might'st have applied to thy self, and not to us. And let the Papists Answer for themselves: And R. W. should go to Rome, and tell them so; but there he dare not shew his Head. R. W. And thou say'st, That We exceed the Pope in our Do∣ctrine of Perfection. Answ. Yes Roger, and Thee too; who say'st, Thou must have a Combate to the Grave, and be Fighting all thy Life time: and givest the Apostle the Lie, who said, He had Fought a good Fight, &c. and then he was not Fighting. R. W. Thou say'st: G. F. maks a the Saints born of God. Answ. What is a Saint R. W? The Apostle tells thee, He that
believeth, is born of God. (John 1, 5.) So thou manifestest, that thou art not a Believer, that opposest his Doctrine. (But these and many other things are Answered; which he bringeth over and over to fill up this Book.) R. W. Thou say'st: They can prove, that the Three, that bear Record in Heaven, and the Three that bear Record in the Earth, and the Scripture is within them, they made it, &c. Answ. R. W. Thou art a Forger of these words (which thou bringest to prove thy false Charge) and to say, That we are the Father, Son and Spirit; when we never spoke such words: nei∣ther are such words in G. F.'s Book, neither did we ever hear such words before, as thou hast invented. What! because Christ saith, He and his Father are One: And, We have the Spirit of Christ, and he dwelleth in us, and, We are the Temple of God; Doth it follow, that the Apostle had preached this Doctrine, and said, The Saints were GOD? And because John saith, There is Three, that bear Record in Heaven, &c. and therefore doth it follow, that They are the Three? Well! but R. W. thou may'st do thy work: and those Lies may be Food for the Persecutors in New-England, but not for the Children of God. And H. B. affirming, that which he spoke to you, was that God gave him, &c. But what was his Ridiculous Folly acted amongst you at Barbadoes and London since, that thou hast not set it down?pag. 169. And thou should'st have put down his Name at large; for we do not know, who it is, thou speakest of. But R. W. would have us to know, that His Words were from God, yea, and his Sisters; but his Words and Spirit are favored not to be from GOD. AND J. Stubs spoke Truth, That it is our practice to pay Tri∣bute to Caesar, and Honor, to whom Honor, &c. But — R. W. saith: It was against our Principle and Practice, to shew Respect to any Person. Answ. That is false: and thou knowest, much Respect was shewed unto thee, and Patience; yet thy Peevish Spirit was offen∣ded, because we called thee Old Man. AND there are no such Words in G. F.'s Writings, that say, That we are the Higher Power, the Dignities, the Most-High GOD; but that every Soul must be Subject to the Higher Power. O. R. W! how darest thou speak those Forged Lies without Shame, Blushing and Trembling, if thou ha' any Fear of God in thy Heart! Do the Magistrates
in Rode-Island profess any such thing, which have the Govern∣ment, or the Governours? And where did we desire Tribute of R. W. or the New-England-Professors, or the whole Creation? We charge thee and them, to Answer it: mention the Per∣son and Time. And we are the same as ever we were. — AS for Juggling and Dissembling, thou may'st keep at home: and it would be well, if thou and the New-England-Priests and Professors could find a Day of Repentance. For have not the New-England-Priests and thou taken the Authority of God to Judge and Rule over Mens Consciences, which is the Seat of GOD? R. W. And thou scoffingly say'st, That we read the Fourth Charge, as willing to be out of Pain. Answ. R. W. thou appearest to be Light, Frothy, Scoffing and Scornful, and not like an Aged Man, that should be a Good Example to the Younger. And so thou hast plainly proved thy self and the New-England Priests to be the Swellers, thou speakest of (in the Third false Charge, at Providence) exercised with Pride; and that your Religion, Principles and Practice rise no higher, than what a Reprobate may attain unto; Who hatest and scoffest at the Light of Christ, and callest it an Idol: which thou must believe in, before thou art a true Christian; or else it will be thy Condemnation. R. W.'s (Eleventh) False Charge: The Religion of the Quakers is more Obstructive and Destructive to the Conversion of Souls and People, than most Religions, that are at this Day extant in the World. Answ. Our Religion is the pure Religion and undefiled, which was in the Apostles Days: and thy Religion and the New-Eng∣land-Priests, (that callest the Light of Christ a Fancy, which John was a Witness to, and Christ said, Believe in) is Destruc∣tive to people both to Conversion and Salvation. For how can they see Christ their Salvation without the Light of Christ? And how can they see the True Religion from the False without the Light of Christ? And therefore we tell thee, without the Light of Christ thou knowest neither our Religion, nor thy own, nor o∣thers in the World, which in thy Darkness thou would'st seem to be a Judge of. AND then to prove thy false Charges, thou bring'st us a great Story and Tale of the Pagans, and the Pope's and Mahomts Wor∣ship,
and the Jews, Who art as Ignorant of theirs, as thou art of the true Worship,pag. 170. Christ set up above Sixteen Hundred Years since. R. W. And thou tellest, How the Protestants have revolted and separated themselves from the Papists, and have cried up the Lord Jesus in the Scriptures. Answ. But how is R. W. and the New England-Priests revol∣ted and separated from the Popes, when they are found in their Envious, BLOODY Spirit? And how doth R. W. cry up Christ in the Scriptures? Is Christ in the Scriptures? (to wit, in the Writings?) Christ saith, They testify of him; and what Sense is this, to say, Ye cry up Christ in the Scriptures? The Apostles and the Quakers Preach Christ at the Right Hand of God, which the Scriptures testify of. And Christ saith, And it is Written of me; he doth not say, He is in the Scriptures: And the Apostle doth not say, Christ is in the Scriptures; if he doth, let us see, where it is Written? and keep to the Form of sound VVords. R. W. And then thou tell'st us a Story of the Episcopalians, and Presbyterians and Independants, &c. Answ. As though R. W. was a Judge of all these and many others, and yet denieth any Voice or Motion of Heavenly things within himself, and calleth the Light of Christ an Idol. Yet in all this he hath not discovered his own Religion, and what he is of himself? for we do not understand, that he is setled or joined with any of these Protestants Religion in any way of VVor∣ship, except by his Slanderous Book he may get into Favour with some Loose and Persecuting Spirits. R. W. And thou say'st, Those Religions differ each from the o∣ther, as the Quakers do from the Papists. Answ. And doth not R. W. himself differ with them all? And R. W. if the Papists and the Quakers differ, dost thou say so? which wast making us one all this while? R. W. And thou say'st, That we are more Destructive to the Souls of Men,p. 171. than the Papists, who wildly profess all Ordinances and Ministers to be Invisible; and yet are found to be as Visible and Open as any. Answ. Here is a false Charge; we never profess'd, but the Bodies of the Saints and Ministers were Visible: but being Able Ministers of the Spirit, the Spirit is Invisible. And we do be∣lieve, thou hast more Love to the Papists, than to us; and that
we are more Destructive to thine and your Hypocritical VVay and VVorship, than the Papists. But as for Destructive to the true Religion and the Souls of People, this the New-England-professors and thou might have applied at home, who call'st the Light an Idol; by which Light they should see their Sins, and know their Saviour, that died for their Sins, and saveth them. AND it is in vain for thee to tell of Repentance, and Faith, and Saving of Souls, and the VVorship of God in the Spirit and Truth, and knowest of no Voice nor Motion of Heavenly things within thee to be hearken'd unto; All thy Religion, and thy VVorship and Pro∣fession hath been but from the Lips and the Mouth, not from the Heart. And we never Crack't of Quaking and Trembling, as thou scoffingly say'st; but we do VVork out our Salvation with Fear and Trembling: It is God, that worketh in us both to will and to do according to his pleasure. And all, that come to VVorship God in Spirit and in Truth, they must come to the Truth in their Hearts, the Spirit of God there, to mortify their Evil Nature, &c. and this they will not find Easie. R. W. And then thou say'st: The Turks and Papists (to thy knowledge) take more pains in their Religion, than the Common Protestants; and thou Confessest, they do all but paint and gild over Nature's old and rotten Posts. Answ. This is thine and New-England's Condition, far of a true Faith and Repentance; and that thou and you cannot see, that callest the Light of Christ a Frantick Light and a Fancy: And did Paul, that turned people from Darkness to Light, &c. turn them to a Fancy? And— R. W. Thou say'st; The Quakers come not near that Care of New-England (I am sure, at first) for the personal true Repen∣tance and Holiness of their Churches and Congregations: and in the Margent thou say'st; That the Quakers Conversion is not com∣parable to the VVay of New-England. Answ. What ever their Conversion was at the first, this we know, that the Church in New-England are not now true Con∣verts; they are not turned from dead Works to serve the Living God: Nay, they are not turned from the Cruelty, Persecution and Envy of the Vnconverted Jews and Heathens (as their Fruits at large have manifested it) Then they are degenerated, from what they were at first. Therefore the Comparison will not hold between the Quakers Conversion, who like Lambs have suffe∣red
even unto DEATH, and yours, who Cruelly have persecuted even unto DEATH: Therefore their Conversion is made no Con∣version. R. W. And then thou fall'st a-Railing again at our speaking THEE and THOV, &c. and bowing down to a dumb Image and Worship, &c. and that we say, we are God and Christ. Answ. Which is Answered over and over, and thy false Charge denied: for we never of our selves said any such thing; but God and Christ dwelleth in us. AND why art thou angry so much at THEE and THOV? and yet thou confessest, It is according to the Accidence and Grammar? R. W. And then thou tellest us a Story of the Papists and Arminians Flattering, &c. Flatterers. Answ. Which thou better might'st have applied at home: and well might W. E. say, We dealt plainly with thee, and you and all Men. R. W. And thou say'st, Thou Intended'st to add, that the Qua∣kers pretended to be as fine Flower sifted▪ out from the Common Protestants,p. 172. Independants and Baptists; And so goest on a-Railing. Answ. Thou dost not know, what thou say'st, for we Pretend no such thing: for we are the Off-spring of the Lord, and of Abraham, who walk in the Steps of the Faith of Abraham. R. W. And thou said'st: As the Whore of Rome deceived whole Towns and Cities, &c. so the Painted Quaker (as a drunken Whore) should follow the drunken Whore of Rome (drunk with the Blood of Jesus, &c.) &c. Answ. R. W. here thou hast falsly charged us, and speakest a false Divination of thy own Brain, and not from the Lord. But let the Quakers, and the New-England-Professors and the Papists be examined, and see, who hath DRVNK BLOOD? and who is the Painted VVhore? whether it be not R. W. and his New-England-Professors? BVT R. W. Is the VVhore of Rome Drunk with the Blood of Jesus? (as thou say'st) Is the Saints Blood the Blood of Jesus, that cleanseth from all Sin? For John saith here, Drunk with the Blood of the Saints; but doth not say, Drunk with the Blood of Jesus: We charge R. W. and the New-England-Priests to make this good, that the Saints Blood is the Blood of Jesus. For thou say'st, Drunk with the Blood of Jesus for the obtaining of the Smoke of a Tobacco-Pipe, &c. We do believe,
thou wrongest the Papists here (as bad as they are) for to be Drunk with the Blood of the Saints (which thou callest Jesus) for the obtaining of (the Smoke of a Tobacco-pipe) Riches, &c. shew us the Chronicle for this. R. W. And after thou hast told several Stories of David and Absolom, Joab and Achitophel (which is nothing to the purpose to prove thy false Charge) thou say'st; We and the Jesuites will be found at last to be Apostles,p. 173. Messen∣gers, Emissaries of Satan, sent out from Hell to predicate the Goodness of rotten Nature, Hell and Damnation, that false Hellish Gospel: And so goest on railing. Answ. R. W. might have kept this at home, and his New-England-Professors, who have proved this already, from whence they came, with his Jesuits in their bloody Practice; and not blas∣phemed the Everlasting Gospel, and say, It cometh from Hell: Which was Revealed to the Apostle, and Revealed now again; which is the Glorious Gospel, CHRIST, which hath brought Life and Immortality to Light, and preserves us in Life and in Immortality. And this Gospel he cannot damn; though he en∣devoureth it with his Rotten Nature. And if he Saw but him∣self to Know, whose Image he was, and whose VVork he was a-doing; he would dread the Lord God, that heareth his VVords, and seeth his VVork, and will reward him accordingly. R. W. And thou say'st: The Devil knows, that after the VVit∣nesses have done their VVork against Anti-Christ, and after their Slaughters, the Lord will send his Messengers abroad, &c. Answ. The Lord God hath sent his Messengers abroad with his Everlasting, Glorious Gospel, whom ye, like BLOODY Butchers, have slaughtered some of them in New-England; and your Gos∣pel needeth a Rope-maker's Shop to make VVHIPS and HAL∣TERS, and needeth a Smith's Shop to make you Swords, and Chains and BRANDING-IRONS: which manifesteth, it is not the Gospel of the LORD IESVS CHRIST. But New Jerusalem is come down from Heaven among the Sons of God; and it's you, that have been stirred up against them with your outward Swords and Staves, like Mahomet or the Je∣suits, (or Papists) who fish for smoke of this VVorld's Sodom, thou speakest of; and not the Quakers. R. W. And thou say'st: Cursed is that Charity, that puts out the Eye of Reason, &c. and the Eye of true Affection to Christ Je∣sus.
Answ. And hast not thou in this Cursed thy self, who callest his Light, which openeth this Eye, which cometh from him to see him, an Idol? And Christ said, Believe in the Light, &c. and what thinkest thou, this was an Idol, he bid them believe in? R. W. And thou say'st: As to the Saving of Souls, it was a Thunder from the Heavenly Mouth of Christ Jesus [They that tke the Sword, shall perish by the Sword] As if he should say The Sword is not a Saving, but a Destroying Tool, in Soul-humbling and Soul-Saving: making worlds of Hypocrites, but not true Pro∣testants and true Christians, and Followers of the true Lord Jesus. Answ. HERE Roger Williams, who is going about to prove his false Charge upon the Quakers, hath proved himself and his New-England-Priests one with Mahomet and with the Papists: he hath proved them to be Hypocrites, and not true Protestants, and no true Christians, and no true Followers of the Lord Jesus Christ, no Soul-Savers by their Carnal Weapons: and proved them Disobedient to the Commands of Christ Jesus from his Thundering, Heavenly Mouth, as he calleth it. For have not the New-England-Men forced and compelled by the Sword to Religi∣on? let their WHIPS, STOCKS, their GALLOVSES, their BANISHINGS upon Pain of Death, their Cutting off EARS, their BVRNING and BRANDING with an Hot Iron speak their Hypocrisy, and declare, that they are no True Fol∣lowers of Christ Jesus, nor no True Christians, nor no True Protestants,R. W. proveth himself and his New-England-Professors no true Christians. but Destroyers and Ma∣kers of Hypocrites: nor no Soul-savers, (ac∣cording to R.W. his own Doctrine) and he amongst them; who would have the Magistrates to PVN∣ISH us. (pag. 200.) And is not this Destroying Tool still in your Hands, by which ye make Hypocrites, and no true Protestants, nor Christians, nor Followers of the Lord Jesus? And our VVeapons is the Sword of the Spirit, the VVORD of GOD: and this R. W. calleth Phan∣tastick, and VVeakness and Madness. And thou say'st— R. W. Thou knowest, that the true Lord Jesus, his Holy Father and Holy Spirit is as odious both to Je∣suits,p. 174. and most Papists and Quakers, as the Devil, yea, infinitely more than the Devil himself. Answ. R. W. These are Horrid Lies, and thou hast spoken thy own Condition, who callest the Light of Christ Frantick▪
Therefore thou art not like to know Jesus Christ, nor the Father, nor his holy Spirit. And as for the Papists, they may Answer thee themselves: Thou dost not matter, what thou sayst, thou think'st, Thy Tongue is thy own: who vent'st all those Lies against us. For had we not Loved Jesus Christ, and the Father, and been in his Holy Spirit, we had never had such Language from the Evil Spirit in thee. And Fisher, Stubs and Pennington, and Bishop, their Words and Books will stand as a Testimony against thy persecuting Spirit in New-England, and for the true Lord Jesus. AND who are they, that Kill with Tongue, Pen and Sword, &c. that the Inheritance may be theirs, but even R. W. and his New-England-priests? But let the Pharisees and the Jews Judge∣ment Answer them. And the True Lovers of the Lord Jesus Christ will shine forth more and more, and the Lamb and his Fol∣lowers will have the Victory, but not with Carnal VVeapons. R. W. Thou say'st, That the Sufferings of the Quakers are no true Evidence of the Truth of their Religion. Answ. R. W. hath marked himself, and his New-England-Priests and Professors. For did ever such as persecuted the Prophets, Christ and his Apostles, persecute them as true Men, and as their Religion was True? And have ye New-England-Priests and Professors persecuted us with Tongue, Hand and Sword, as True Men? or looking upon our Religion to be True? Now, have not they clearly de∣monstrated themselves to be of the Lying Birth, born of the Flesh in a blind Zeal? And the Apostle saith, It was not only given us to believe, but to suffer for the Name of Jesus: So this doth Evidence the True Belief, which doth not persecute any for Religion. R. W. And thou say'st, Thou could'st find no Jews, Papists or Protestants, that did so magnifie and so exactly insist upon their Sufferings, as the Quakers did. And yet thou contra∣dict'st thy self and say'st,p. 175. That Paul did more particu∣larize his Sufferings, then any other Saints in the Scrip∣ture. Answ. Here thou hast contradicted thy self, and wrongest us: for we do not Magnifie our Sufferings; we Magnifie the LORD, that upholdeth us in our Sufferings. But it's like, it troubleth thee and the New-England Men, that our sufferings are drawn up, and that ye are made manifest, that ye are no True Christians, nor True Followers of Christ Jesus. And it's like, ye would not
have had us to print our sufferings, that it might not come to the Light, which ye did in the Dark. And we know, the End of Paul's speaking of his sufferings was, to manifest them that were not Real; but they were not Persecutors, as the New-England-Priests are. But thou would'st have told the Prophets, Christ and his Apostles, Their sufferings for their Religion for the VVord of God and for Jesus sake were no true Evidence of the true Lord Jesus Christ, of the Word of God, and of the true faith or true belief. R. W. And the Quakers Sufferings (thou say'st) are not to be compared with Paul's. Answ. And why? And yet we set down exactly every hour's Im∣prisonment, every Stripe in VVhipping (as thou say'st?) But this proveth, that ye are the Birth of the Flesh, and NO TRUE CHRISTIANS; but persecute with an outward Sword, accor∣ding to thy own Judgement. R. W. And thou say'st. We publish our Sufferings to the VVorld in print, as if they were a Sign hung out, with this Inscription, &c. and then scoffest. Answ. It is a Certain Evidence, that thou and you are in a Persecuting Spirit, and the Lord supported us over your Mur∣thering Spirit. AND thou art offended, because G. Bishop hath printed so much: Nay, thou wilt have more, as long as thou continu∣est in this Birth of Persecution, and calling Christ's Light an Idol, Frantick and a Fancy: here ye not only do persecute, but blas∣pheme. And what G. Bishop hath writ, it was not in a Childish Vapor, Ostentation and Vain Glory (as thou say'st) but to mani∣fest your Un-mercifulness and Cruelty: which seemeth, it trou∣bleth thee and the New-England Persecutors, that true Christians and the VVorld should know of your BLOODY Persecution. But why doth R. W. write such a Catalogue against the Pope, and yet would not have a Catalogue of their own BLOODY doings manifest? who are ound in one Spirit, drinking of Blood. But read, what the Apostle saith: Even after that we had suffered be∣fore, and were shamefully entreated (as ye know) at Philippi, we were bold in our God to speak unto you (1 Thes. 2.) So that we our selves glory in you in the Churches of God for your Patience and Faith in all your Persecutions and Tribulations (2. Thes: 1.) And did not Jeremiah and all the Prophets Record their Sufferings? and the Apostles Record the Sufferings of John, and Christ and their own? (as ye may see in Acts)▪ though (I say) not all; and we have
not Recorded all our sufferings in New-England. AND (Act: 5, 40.) when such as your Spirit in New-England had called the Apostles, and beaten them, they commanded, that they should speak no more in the Name of Jesus Christ: And they departed, re∣joicing, that they were counted worthy to Suffer for the Name of Jesus Christ: And yet they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ. R. W. would have said, They glory in their Sufferings; Nay, they are Blessed, that Suffer for Christ, for theirs is the Kingdom of God; We know it: but they that persecute, have not this Blessing, nor the Kingdom. And all these Sufferings We have suffered both for Christ within & Christ without.p. 176. Neither are our sufferings like either to Papists, nor you in New-England; for all ye (I know) will persecute others, though ye Suffer your selves. And it's known by many, that our sufferings are, as the Primitive Church's sufferings, who do persecute none, and make none to suffer; but only we suffer as Lambs. And it's known, that never a Lamb worried or tore a Dog, or a VVolf or a Fox; and therefore they are VVolves and Foxes, that may suffer, and yet make others to suffer: and this is nothing. Yet in all our Sufferings we have Love still to our Enemies, as the Disciples of Christ, and true Christians; and do pray for our Enemies, who persecute us: And here in this we dif∣fer from all the Persecutors or Suffeers in the World. And though we do give our Bodies to be burnt, and our Goods so the Poor; yet still we retain the Love, which is the Supreme over all, or else our sufferings are nothing. But this doth not clear R. W. and the New-England-Priests and Professors, but that they are the Birth born of the Flesh, and that they are no true Christians, no true Protestants, no true Followers of Christ (as R. W. confes∣seth) but Hypocrites, and Makers of Hypocrites, (p. 173.) And R. W. bringeth E. B.'s Epistle, (G. F. Fol. Epist. to the Reader, p. 12.) which speaketh of the Cruel Persecutors and Professors, Priests, and Magistrates in Oliver's Days, whom the LORD hath over-turned according to our Prophecies to them. And Going NAKED —As VV. S. went Three Years Naked; sometimes in Sack-cloth and Ashes, and his Face all Black; and so Black should be the Persecutors; and so should they be stript, as he was: which came to pass. (And Paul Number'd his Stripes (as 2 Cor. 11.) but it would be hard to Number ours, that we received in New-England.) And the Mayor of Cam∣bridge
received him in (and Several Persons of Quality took him in) and put his Gown upon him; and did see, there was more in the thing, then the blind, dark Spirit in R. W. that prints it over and over in his Book: who remaineth still in his Envious spirit. Which some in New-England have done the same, and have gone as a SIGN, and a Shame of your Nakedness of that which ye professed; yet in the Innocency of God's holy Spirit: Which they rather had chosen Death in their own Wills, then to have gone, as they have done. And God▪ Almighty will Judge R. W. for his Hard Speeches against them. AND yet for all these Sufferings and Persecution (Pharaoh like) as the Jews Outward did grow, so the Jews Inward do grow for all the Persecutions of the Spiritual Pharaohs: And Christ Jesus, the Captain of their Salvation, doth lead them in the Land of the Living; whose Praise is of God, and not of Man. And we would have all the VVorld to know, and all the New-England-Professors with R. W. that we seek not the Praise of Men: and do expect no other, but that they should speak all manner of Evil of us; that they might fulfil Christ's words. R. W. But we do perceive, that R. W. is troubled, That we should print our Sufferings, and give forth such a Ca∣talogue of them.p. 177. Answ. To evidence God's supporting Power and Hand, that doth support them: and to manifest New-England's BLOODY Hands; though we Appealed Three-Times to England, but ye BLODY Persecutors regarded it not (although R. W. now in his Epistle seemeth to Flatter the KING) yet in time ye may be reckon'd withal, when ye have fill'd up your Measure; the Al-seeing God will Reward you! And the LORD GOD alone, who hath been our Protector, and Helper and Supporter, (and we had none in the Earth to help us, but him; and) HE is the Re∣venger of our Cause: And so we leave it to him. And Deut: 13: The false Prophets with the Signs and VVon∣ders R. W. with his New-England-Priests may keep at home, with all the rest, that is got up since. Yet the Christians were not to do unto the false Prophets and Blasphemers, as they did in the time of the Law; which was, To run them through, and Stone them to Death: If so, Christ and the Apostles might have Run many false Prophets and Blasphemers through, that blas∣phemed against him. But he told them the Judgements, and Con∣demnation
and the Misery, that would come upon all them, that sin against the Holy Ghost: as R. W. is found in Blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, and the Light of Christ, and calleth it an Idol. Christ came not to destroy mens Lives but to save them. And — R. W. Bringeth (G. F. fol. p. 64:) Jerem: Ives saying [The Writings of the Scriptures may be burned; but the Word of God con∣tained in them may not b burned.] G. F.'s Answ: [If he had said, The Word, that it speaketh of, or testifieth of, he had spoken proper, like Scripture; but to say, The Word of God is contained in the Writings, and the VVritings say, It testifieth of Christ the Word, there is a Proof to thee, that the Quakers are sent of God, who speak to thee of the Scriptures right as they are.] So R. W. hath taken a few of G. F.'s words, and left out the Ground and Reason of the Matter. And R. W. bringeth his words to no purpose, meaning to maintain his false Position by. And then thou tellest a Story of the Jews, Papists, Manasse Ben-Israel: and Paul in his mad Conscience, &c. (p. 178.) Answ. And in Paul's mad Conscience thou and the Priests and Professors in New England, and the Papists are in, who beleve not in the Light of Christ, that ye may become Children of Light: And so ye are in the Vnconverted State, like Saul. R. W. And then thou tell'st a great Story of David slaying Uriah, and the best Kings of Judah suffering the High-places and Asa's Imprisoning the Prophet, &c. Answ. But did not that Prophet Suffer truly for the sake of the VVord of God? And so did the Apostles: And have not we a∣mongst you? Yet we tell you, the VVord of God is not Bound. R. W. And then thou tellest us of Peter's rash Vsing the Sword (to wit, the Outward.) Answ. But Peter did not Vse it always: it hath been the De∣vil's Aim in you all To Afflict, to Punish one another to Death,pag. 179. and Destroy about Religion; which was not the Practice of Christ and his Disciples. And how can we slight the Saints, or Fellow-sufferers in all Ages, when our Brethren Souls cry under the Altar (as the Martyrs of IESVS did of Old) whom ye have HANGED and put to Death? And— R. W. bringeth G. F.'s Fol. (p. 51, 253, 99.) Who forbids to receive into their Houses —
Answ. Such as bring not the Doctrine of Christ, as John saith Who-so-ever transgresseth, and abideth not in the Doctrine of Christ, hath not God. Therefore if any come unto you, and bring not this Doctrine, receive him not into your Houses, neither bid him God speed. Now, how can we Bid R. W. and the New-Eng∣land-priests GOD SPEED in their Persecutions with Pen, Tongue and Hand? Yet we can receive them as Men, but not as Christi∣ans in the Doctrine of Christ, nor his Believers in the Light, as Christ commandeth; for that he calleth an Idol. And how canst thou be Received in our Houses as a Christian? And how can we Receive any of the New-England-Persecutors as Christians, which have so persecuted with the Sword, which thou say'st, are no true Christians nor Followers of Jesus? yet as Men we can, but not as Ministers of Christ. And had'st thou been in the Days of the Sufferings of the Martyrs, thou would'st have spoken then as much against John Fox and the Martyrs, as thou dost against us: as the Papists now speak against them, and would not look upon them then, as true Sufferers, no more then thou and the New-England-priests and professors look upon Us now, as true Sufferers. R. W. And whereas thou say'st: As it is possible for God's own Children to hold (and that obstinately) false Principles, so it is pos∣sible, for other of God's Children as obstinately to afflict and punish those others to Death, &c. Answ. This is contrary to Scripture to affirm, That any of God's Children, who are born of the Spirit, can be found in such a Practice, as to punish God's Children, and true Christians with Death (according to thy own Assertion) or any other upon a Religi∣ous Account. For though the Apostle saith; He that was born af∣ter the Flesh, persecuted him that was born after the Spirit; yet we never read, that he that was born of the Spirit, did persecute him, that was born of the Spirit, that was a Child of God: And so in this thou hast affirmed a false Assertion. And so our Sufferings differ from the Persecutors, as Light from Darkness: For we maintain the Purity of the holy Scriptures and the Words of God there, against all the vain Traditions, vain Mean∣ings and vain Imaginations of Men, and say, They are plain to all, that have an Understanding of them by the Spirit of God. And we have not suffered, as for Childrens Baubels, Fantasti∣cal Traditions of Men, Inventions and Dreams, nor Earthly▪ Dig∣nities,
&c. but for the Pure Life of Truth and the Name of JE∣SUS (the Lord knoweth it!) by such, as got the Form of God∣liness, and the Sheeps-Clothing; and persecuted the true Sheep, that heard Christ's Voice. And we do not Endevour to Tram∣ple (as ye and the Pope do) the Bodies of Saints under Feet. And John (in Revel.) he speaketh of his Sufferings and Tribulati∣ons, which we hve a Fellow-Feeling of: which our Persecutors,pag. 180. that cannot own the Light of Christ IE∣SVS, have not, who scoff at us: and so he would have done at the Apostle John, if he had been in his Days. And so as for Fierce, Heady, Proud, Conceit R. W. might have kept at home. R. W. And thou say'st: No question, some of them have a No∣tion of Wrath yet to come: and therefore rather then to endure Fire of Hell, they will give up their Lives to the Flames, and others of them Fast 40. Days, &c. Answ. R. W. thou hast manifest thy persecuting Birth and Ig∣norance both of us and the holy Men of God: for it's not in Wrath we suffer, but in Love to God and his Son. And ye Foul and Adulterous spirits would make Rapes of his Virgins; and be∣fore they will loose their Dignity and their Testimony of IESVS, they will DIE in Love to their Saviour, that died for them And why dost thou scoff at Fasting? many of us have Fasted 30. or 40. Days together. And thou often tellest of a John Fox; but I must tell thee and the New-England-Men, ye have no Lot nor Part in that neither, who are Persecutors, in the Spirit of them that persecuted them. And did not the Martyrs turn their Suffer∣ings unto the Glory of God? and so have we; though Ungodly Men, (like Wolves,) have hunted us (like) Innocent Lambs and Christ's Chick∣ens. And when ye have done, we have said, The Lord forgive you, if it be his Will! And have not ye been Vnthankful for your Peace and Liberties, and forgotten the time, when ye were called to an Account? And now ye are at Ease your selves, persecuting others with Pen, Tongue and Hand. And it's known, the Quakers have Confess'd their Sins to him, that is able to forgive and pardon them, and hath died for them; therefore they do not come to the New-England-priests and R. W. and make them Popes to Con∣fess their Sins to them: who are Miserable Comforters, and will tell them, They must have a Warfare with their Sins, while they Live, till they go to the Grave.
R. W. And thou say'st: Some of them say, they can sin no more against God, then God can sin against them. Answ. It's like, this is some of the Ranters; had it been the Quakers, R. W. would have told their Names in print. But (however) R. W. might have put their Names in print, and where they lived, then we might have known the truth of his Asser∣tion, and where they had been: for we deny all such Blasphe∣my and Blasphemers. But doth not R. W. say often, That Repentance is a turning the Soul to God as God from all Sin? (in his 6. false Charge) But is not your Confessing of Sin like Pharaoh's and Judas's? For have not ye been Confessing these 20. or 30. or 40. years, but when will ye Forsake? Pharaoh was such a Confessor, as ye are, and yet per∣secuted, so your Confession is Just like Pharaoh's.— But hath R. W. and the New England-Priests and Professors shewed any Meek or Patient Spirit, or Thankfulness either? But we do not say, but they said over these Words, (and so R. W. saith) as the Papist Parrot said over the Pater Noster; but ye have Per∣secuted the Meek, Patient, Thankful Sufferers of Christ Jesus: And ye like a Frozen, Hard-hearted People have not been Sensile of his People, nor God's Mercies to you. And as for a People (thou speakest of) professing Christianity, so Fierce, so Heady, High-minded, Hardned, Censu∣ring, Reviling,p. 181. Cursing, Damning, Savage, Barbarous, &c. R. W. might very well have kept this at Home. And G. F. and G. B. do not Spit out Fire and Brimstone against New-England-Persecutors; but tell you, what will be your Por∣tion: and our Desires are, that you might Repent. R. W. And thou say'st; Some of their Predictions have and may come to pass, as do also of Conjurers and Witches. Answ. Nay R. W. ye shall find it the True Spirit and Power of God, and the New-England People; and not like Saul's Cause, that went to the Witch. But R. W. we do very well remember▪ how the New-England-Professors Searched Two Women of the Servants of God, under pretence of being Witches, to the Shame of all Modesty and Christianity. But the Proverb concerning the Cow with Short Horns, we have found the New-England-Priests and Professors Horns Long enough; but thine is Short enough, because thou livest under a Government, which doth not Perse∣cute for Religion. But it hath pleased God to put a Hook in
your Jaws, that ye take no more the Lives of the Saints of God. And — R. W. Thou say'st: VVhen the Devil is a Fisher, longing for troubled and bloody VVaters; yet God hath graciously proved so many of the bloody Prophecies of thse VVaspish Prophets and Pro∣phetesses, &c. Answ. R. W. might have applied this at home, and his New-England-Priests, and his Sister with him (as in p. 114. her Pro∣phecy there.) AND what hath R. W. and New-England-Priests and Professors been Fishing in? and whose Fishers are they? let their BLOODY hands and GALLOVSES speak, to be Persecu∣tors of the Lambs of Christ Jesus, and Kickers against the Pricks (Saul-like) they prickt their own Heels. R. W.'s Thirteenth false Charge [These many Books and VVri∣tings are extreamly poor, lame and naked, swell'd up only with High Titles, words of Boasting & Vapour.] I could never pick out any Wheat (of solid, rational heavenly Truth) out of their Heap's of Chaff, and Dreams and Fancies of New Christs, New Spirits, &c. Answ. No more then the Chief Priests could pick out of Christ's and the Apostles Doctrine, who looked upon him as a Babbler and pestilent Fellow, and a Setter-forth of New Gods. And we do believe, that those Persecutors never read our Books for any Good, with any good mind, but that which is Chaffy: It was not like, that the Persecutors with tongue, pen and hand should read the Per∣secuteds Books for any Good. R. W. And W. E. said; The Word was as a Fire, and a Hammer,p. 182. &c. and thou say'st: The Word, that we meant, was but a Painted Fire and Hammer, and never broke, nor burned up Sin. Answ. It's like, R. W. never Felt nor Heard the Word of God yet, at least, Received it: and it's not like, when he is plead∣ing so much for his Hat and Knee, and his Honor. But the Say∣ing of Christ is come upon thee; I know you, that ye have not the Love of God in you; and ye have not the Word of God a∣biding in you: for whom God has sent, him Ye believe not: (John 5.) But thou wilt feel it a Hammer and a Fire, the Pha∣risees and all. The Jews might have said so to the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles, who preached the Word to the Persecu∣tors; they might have said, It is a Painted Hammer, and a Pain∣ted Fire; for it doth not burn us, nor it doth not break us: But
what is become of those Jews? And what will become of R. W. and of those New-England-Priests, who do not Resist only, but Persecute? And Peter and Jude telling the Saints of Clouds without Rain, and Trees without Fruits, and Wells without Water, and Wandring Stars, and Waves of the Sea casting up Mire and Dirt; This R. W. and the Church in New-England might have kept to themselves, and truly applied: For what else have they brought forth? And he might have put in Korah, Balaam and Cain, who Killed his Brother about Religion. And the Reader may see, what Abundance of Mire and Dirt he hath Cast up in his Book against God's People from the Wave of his Sea. And we do believe, Christ and his Spirit is New to him, who cal∣leth his Light an IDOL. R. W. And again thou bring'st Theora John, and say'st; Let that Monster of Delusion be viewed, whose Bodily Raptures and Frantick Writings of the Quakers Principles, and of the Jews, &c. Answ. R. W. hath brought this Man oftentimes over to stuff up his Book, as though he wanted matter: and it's known to all in London, that knew him, that he was never a Quaker. And yet this R. W. (who hath sold himself to work Wickedness, and given up himself to Lie) often bringeth this Theora John as a Quaker; which is known, he was no such Man. So with one Lie he bringeth to prove another: But R. Williams, the Lord will reward thee! And as for John Chandler, thou hast produ∣ced nothing out of his Writings. R. W. And thou sayst, Thou hast read Nicholas and Naylor, Howgil, Burrough, Farnsworth, Fox, Dewsberry, Pennington, Whitehead and Bishop.— Answ. It's like, for an Evil End: out of them and G. F.'s thou hast not proved thy false Charges. And so, the Old Serpent (thou speakest of) hath been too Crafty for thee, and brought thee to the Brim of the Lake, that burns with Fire and Brimstone (which thou appliest to us) and thou hast Stuff enough to kindle it R. W. R. W. And G. F. saying Fol. p. 282.) You where you are,pag. 183. Sees him not, instead of See: (and page. 19.) The Churches Was to hear, instead of were. — Answ. What a great piece of Business of one Word, was for were, and one Letter [s] is too much: And this R. W.
hath found out in a Book of 374. pages. This was, and the single s he hath made a great Clamor about it up and down the Book (though he hath committed the same Error (in his Twenty Nineth page of his Book) where he saith: Till these Gusts was over, instead of were over:) And R. W. dost thou not think, that these two small Faults might haue been overseen in the Press? Which had'st thou had either Modesty or Charity, thou might'st have past it over, and not cried out against it in thy Book so often over, Lame, Non-sense, Silly, &c. And we could make a Catalogue of Errors and Gross Errors in thy Book, both of False Spelling and Non-sense, and let thee see, how thou hast Spelt several of our Friends Names, and other Names and Mat∣ters in thy Book (as instead of Jerem. Ives thou hast spelt Jewes: here are two Letters wrong in one word, which hath but four in it, p. 178.) Which are so many, that we shall not trou∣ble the Reader with them. But let the Reader read, and he may find enough: whether it be his own Fault, or the Printers, we shall leave that. — AND for these Two small things, that thou hast found out in his great Book, thou scoffingly callest Proud Brute, Proud insulting Souls and Spirits, and Boys English, and G. F.'s Ignorance of English. And this thou hast publish'd to the World, that all may see thy Folly. But we shall not rail so at thee. I will Instance one or two Passages in the same page, where R. Williams is reproving of G. F. for false English with all those foul Expressions, where thou say'st (speaking of the Kingdom of God) It consists in Peace and Joy in the Holy Spirits; Where it should be Spirit. And in the same Line thou say'st: As they Impiously and simply speaks [instead of speak.] We instance but these, because it is the very same page, where R. W. is throw∣ing all those Names upon G. F. for Two Literal Mistakes. And so thy Proud, Insulting Soul and Spirit is thwarted and crost in thy own page: and whether this be oys English or no, let the English Judge. — And what thou bring'st from page 300. and 110. (of G. F.'s Fol.) is false; for there are no such Scrip∣tures in those places. BVT thou hast not only wronged the English, but the He∣brew and the Greek (which thou boastest so much of) and more Materially, then G. F. As the Reader may see (B. p. 112.) Where instead of Metapuroteresios (which is alse Greek) thou should'st
have said, Meta parateresios ( —) — And whereas thou say'st (in the same page) viz. [The Greek word  in some of the Margents is rendred Among, that is▪ Unto you, Upon you: as Luke 11. If I by the Finger of God cast out Devils, surely, the Kingdom of God is come upon you.]— But the word  is not in that place cited by thee (to wit, Luke 11.) but ( or ) And the proper Signification of the Word  is Within, and not Among. Sca∣pula in his Dictionary bringeth divers Authors proving, Within that it signifieth INTRA, that is Within, but none, that it signifieth Among. &c. — And thy Ignorance of the Hebrew thou hast shewed (pag. 200, &c.) asserting, That the He∣brew and Greek signify no more Thou than You, &c. Whereas it is known, they both distinguish the Singular from the Plural, and do not mean ye or you, when they say thou; nor thou, when they say, ye or you, as those that skill those Languages, do know, &c. AND it is not proved, that G. F. or we ever despised any that were Good or Godly, as the Scripture speaketh. R. W. Thou say'st: There is no God, no Christ, no Spirit, but what is within them. Answ. Thou say'st so often over and over in thy Book but these are not our words; but thy own Forgeries. For we own One God (as we have often said) the Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all (Ephes. 4.) And G. F. and we are in the True Love and Fear of God, &c. and do not puff at any, that be in the Knowledge of God, and the Lord Je∣sus Christ: but we would haue them to mind the Grace of God, that hath appeared to them, and the Light and his good Spirit, that they have grieved; and believe in the Light of Christ, which thou callest an Idol. And we know, Sweet Odors cannot come from a Spirit of Persecution. But — R. W. saith:p. 184. But — G. F. will be found to adore an Image and Crucifix for the true Lord Jesus, &c. Answ. Nay R. W. thou art nearer that Condition, who callest the Light of the true Lord Jesus an Idol; which we never heard the Papists, that adore Images and Crucifix, did: He is better built upon the Foundation of the Prophets, Christ and the Apostles. R. W. Thou say'st: For doth not this proud Censor know, that Men may be true Saints in their persons, — Answ. So not in their hearts: if they be true Saints in person, is that Sufficient?
R. W. — and yet be subject to sudden Falling Fits? Answ. But R. W. and the New-England-Priests, did David walk with God with a perfect heart, when he committed Adulte∣ry and Murther? And whether these Actions did not defile his Persn? And if so; then how can they be True Saints in their Persons? Surely, R. W. would be a Saint and a Ranter (and the rest of the New-England-Persecutors.) And R. W. was finding Fault with the Ranters; but I never heard any bring such Say∣ings of the Ranters before R. W. AND thou speakest of Peter denying, &c. But the Scripture saith, If the Righteous fall, they shall rise again: but the Wicked shall fall into Mischief. And R. W. it appeareth, that he was never out of the Fall yet, who saith; There is no Motion, nor Voice to be heard within of Hea∣venly things and supernatural Light: and calleth the Light, which John bare Testimony of, a Frantick Light and an Idol. R. W. And thou say'st: After Christ's Ascension Peter played the Hypocrite, and the Dssembler. Answ. But where doth Paul call him a Hypocrite and Dissem∣bler, as thou dost? Read Gal. 2. and let him see, if Paul there calleth Peter Hypocrite? And — R. W. Thou bringest the Fathers in Godliness, and famous Kings in God's Church, of their Incivilities of many Wives, and Impiety of Worshipping, &c. Answ. How canst thou say, these are Fathers in Godliness, when thou chargest them with Incivilities and Impieties? For Godli∣ness cannot be Impiety, and Vncivil thou canst not make Godly, when they acted these things. But the Prophets writing these things (as the Apostle saith) were writ for Examples and Warn∣ings, that we should not follow such things: for the End of the Prophets and Apostles Writings of such as fell and rise, was, that God's People should shun such Impieties and Evils; and not for the Wicked to make use of the Scriptures to plead for Sin and say, Such a one did such a Sin, and strengthen themselves in the Evil. But the Apostle saith, They were for our Examples, to the Intent, we should not lust after Evil things, as they also lusted. So here the Apostle doth not grant any Allowance for the Best to Sin: as thou by the Conparison of the Goldsmith seemest to infer, who giveth his Allowance (as thou say'st) to the best Gold, &c. But God giveth no such Allowance, Christ's Com∣mand is to the Contrary.
And G. F. in all his Book never called them, that were truly Humble and Able, Godly and Conscientious, Vipers, Serpents, Cains, false Prophets, Pharisees, dumb Dogs, &c. Reprobates, &c. But must we not tell a Pharisee, that he is a Pharisee? Persecutors, they are Persecuting, like Uipes and Serpents? did not Christ call them so? Yea, such were the Great Church of the Jews, (like the New-England-Church.) And doth not the Apostle say, Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates? And thou, that callest the Light an Idol, and Christ within a Fancy, and so, art not thou a Rprobate? And have not the New-England-Priests and Professors manifest themselves, to be like them, that Killed their Brethren for Religion and about Sacri∣fice? And greedy, dumb Dogs, doth not Isaiah call them so, that can never have enough? the Shepheards, that cannot under∣stand? they all look to their own Way, every one for his Gain from his Quarter? Let all People look, whether all the New-England-Priests do not seek for their Gain from their Quarter? And are not they Dogs? and have not they TORN the FLESH of the Lambs of the true Lord Jesus? And are they not Dumb as to God? for thou say'st, There is no Voice nor Motion with∣in in Heavenly things, in matters of Supernatural Light to be listen'd to or hearken'd to? R. W. Thou say'st again, That G. F. denies the Scriptures to be the Word of God. Answ. This hath been answered over and over. We tell thee, what the Scriptures say of themselves, to wit, The WORDS of GOD: (Exod. 20. Revel. 22.) And thou therefore say'st, Thou can'st not prove them in plain words of Scripture, that they call them∣selves the WORD. And if thou wast an Orator (as thou say'st) thou would'st not speak such a thing over so often, because of which we are fain to Answer thee in so many pages: And do not Scriptures signify Writings. R. W. And thou say'st: G. F. saith, that every Man in the World hath that Spirit, that gave forth Scriptures — Answ. This is Answered over and over. But R. W. doth not the Holy Spirit, that leadeth the Saints into all Truth, reprove the World of Sin? &c. (John 16, 8.) though they do not or will not receive it. R. W. —And that all Saints are Acted by the Spirit Imme∣diately, that moved the Prophets and the Apostles.
Answ. And what then? will R. W. deny the Saints from hav∣ing the Spirit to Act them, as the Apostles and Prophets had? R. W. Thou say'st: All this tends to nullify and vili∣fy the Holy Scriptures.p. 185. Answ. This is thy Ignorance: Can any Confirm and E∣stablish the Scriptures without the Spirit, that gave them forth? But what must we Infer from R. W's. words? That he and his New-England-priests have not the Spirit, as the Prophets had, that gave forth the Scriptures, to lead them into all truth? And That the Holy Ghost doth not reprove the World? And this to prove himself and his New-England-Teachers degenerated from the Doctrine and Spirit of Christ and his Apostles; and only to have the Form of Godliness, and denying the Spirit and Power thereof? R. W. And thou say'st again: G. F. saith in his Book, The Scriptures are not the Word of God; and speakest Concerning e∣very Word, that proceedeth from the Mouth of God. Answ. Then they are Words, if they be Every Word: and E∣very Word of God is fresh Food to us. And his Saints we know; but your Imaginations we cannot feed upon. And— R. W. Also the word Trinity, and Sacrament, Oh! how Zealous is this Fox for the purity of Language! Why may not the word Humane be used, as well as Sabboth? &c. which are Hebrew words, as well as the word Bapism, &c. which are Greek words. Answ. But where doth thou read in the Scripture, the word Humane and Trinity? Let's see, where it is written? for thou say'st, It's the Rule and Touch-Stone, give us Chapter and Verse, that we may Touch it. And so, it's thou, that hast Catched here and there G. F.'s Sentences, like a wild Indian (as thou speakest of) but in all thou hast done, thou hast not proved thy false As∣sertions. And— R. VV. saith: Any sober Soul may read in most of their Books, and in G. F.'s Book such Tautologies and needless Repetitions,pag. 186. that may even turn the Stomach, and make him abor to touch a Quakers Book. Answ. Truly R. VV. of all the Books that ever we have read, we did never read so much of Tautologies over and over the same thing (and so much of false English, whether it be the Ignorance of R. Williams the Orator, or the Printer, we shall leave it) and therefore we are fain to Answer thee over and over the same thing, as we were to Answer the priests in Oliver's Days
the same thing over and over. And therefore in this if any one is to be found Fault withal, it is the priests and R. VV. But— R. W. saith: G. F. had many Bullets flying about his Ears, &c. Answ. But none of those Persecutors Bullets (nor thine) touch∣ed him nor us neither; ot we were (and are) Arm'd with the Breast-plate of Righteousness, and with the Armor of Light, and the Shield of Faith, and the Helmet of Salvation, and the Sword of the Spirit, the WORD of GOD: and the Armor of Light, which thou say'st, is simply called Light: R. VV. can scarcely speak of the Light of Christ without scoffing (at it.) R. VV. saith: He cannot but observe, that all along he notori∣ously nibbles ar words, and quarrels at words. (p. 185.) Answ. Now R. VV. Is this good English, Nibbles a words? And so R. VV. might have applied this at home, This proud Blad∣der is big with Simon Magus: And High and Haughty R. VV. might very well have applied this at home also, who is Puffed up and Swell'd up against the true Lord Jesus Christ, and his Light and his people, in whom Christ ruleth. And — R. VV. bringeth Henry Haggar (G. F. fol. p. 253.) saying, [You call all Men Dead and Carnal in the Serpent's Nature, in what Form soever they differ from you.] G. F. Answereth: [All that are not in the Light (to wit, of Christ, that Lighteth every Man, that cometh into the World, which is the Way to the Fa∣ther) Differ from us: such be Dead, such be Carnal in the Ser∣pent's Nature: For none cometh to the Life, but who cometh to the Light, in what Form soever they be. And such as Differ from us, Differ from Christ: For none cometh from under the Serpent's Head and Nature, but who cometh to the Light (to wit, of Christ.] For how can they be in Vnity with God and his People, and hate the Light, and call it an Idol, as R. VV. doth? But R. VV. falleth a railing and saith: This proud Soul —What Julian the Apostate, what Duke D' Alva, what Wolsey could have spoken more Imperiously, Insultingly and Bloodi∣ly, then this Wild Fox hath done against all the true Servants and Witnesses of the Most-High, &c. Answ. Let the Reader see the Railing of this Orator. But who are these Witnesses, that R. W. speaketh of? Such as are not in the Light of Christ Jesus, which enlightens every Man, that cometh in the World, They are not in the Way to the Father, which is
CHRIST the Light; then they must be such, as Differ from Christ and his Saints in the Light: and how can these be True Witnesses? but must be like R. W. that saith, The Light of Christ and the Light within is a Fancy, a simple Light, a frantick Light, an Idol. So R. VV. might have kept his Flood of Fire and Brimstone at home, for it toucheth us not. And G. F. plainly maketh a Distinction of such as hate the Light, hate Christ; that have Errred from the Light, and quenched the Spirit: They have the Name and Titles, that Christ gave to them.p. 187.188. And 1 Cor: 6: 1 Tim: 9. are owned, as they speak: And the Dreadful Voice of God in Job hath not knock'd out our brains, but opened our Understandings. And we do not make a Noise about our Bibs, and Aprons and Muckingers; These words thou might'st have kept at home, who findest Fault with us, be∣cause we own the Apostle's Doctrine: and so thou might'st as well have found Fault with him, who taught the Saints Con∣cerning Apparel; but this Doctrine R. VV. slighteth. R. VV. And thou say'st again: God is not properly a Spirit, no more then he is Light. pag. 189.Answ. Yet Christ saith, The Father is a Spirit, (Joh. 4.) And that Message the Apostles bore of God, they said; In him was Light, and no Darkness: In this thou art Erred from Christ and his Doctrine (Joh. 1.) R. VV. And 1. Cor: 6: Eph. 2. These we own, as they speak: And thou confessest, That God dwelled in his Temple of Old, as a Man in his House, and a King in his Palace. Answ. And doth not he Dwell now in his Saints by his Light and Spirit? But the Quakers never said, That the House, the outward Man is God: But how canst thou say, That God or Christ dwelleth in Man, when thou call'st his Light an IDOL? — But Henry Haggar is fully Answered in the Answer to the Appendix (p. 163, &c.) where he bringeth him. And— R. VV. bringeth Sam. Eaton (G. F. Fol: p. 2.) saying [That the Scripture is to Judge of Doctrines and Manners.] G. F. Answ. [The Jews had not an Infallible Judgement, that had Scriptures; but stood against Christ the Light, and Judged him to be a Devil: and that Judgement was not Infallible. And that Doctrine and Manners of theirs was not Right, which stood a∣gainst
Christ, the Light.] And R. VV. thou bring'st David's Saying, The Word is a Light to our feet, and a Lanthorn to our paths. Answ. But R. VV. was the New Testament written then, and many of the Prophets? And if not; What Word was it then, that was a Lanthorn and a Light to David? Was it not the same Word, that came to Jacob, before Scripture was written? Why doth Christ say, Search the Scriptures, for in them ye think to have Eternal Life; and they testify of me: but ye will not come to me that ye might have (Eternal) Life? And were not the Jews in the Ditch, and are still with R. VV. and the rest of Persecutors of Christ the WORD, that became Flesh? And did not the Apostles preach the Word, that was made Flesh, to the Jews and Heathen? And were not the Jews mad against the Apostles, that preached the Word, and had Scriptures? and against Christ the Word? And did they not say, Christ was a Deceiver? (as thou say'st now, his Light is a Fancy, and a Whimsical Christ within?) SO we may see through all Scriptures of the Prophets, in the Days of Christ and the Apostles, in what a Rage they were against the Word of God, though they had Scriptures, which testified of him, the WORD. And we bid you, Search the Scriptures, and see, if they do not Testify of Christs the WORD. And could the Jews try the Prophets, and Christ's and the A∣postles Spirit by Scripture, that would not come to Christ the Word?p. 190. May not the Devil, and Anti-Christ and all the false Prophets of the World get Scriptures; and persecute Christ and his Followers? R. VV. bringeth Priest Eaton (G. F. Fol. p. 3.) saying [That God did not intend Immediate Teaching, nor to give out any Im∣mediate Voice in After-ages, which should direct and guide Men in the way of Salvation.] G. F. Answ. [Which is contrary to Scrip∣ture, which saith; All the Children of the Lord shall be taught of the Lord: and (Joh. 8, 47.) He that is of God, heareth God's Word; and that is Immediate, and liveth and abideth for Ever. And there is no Fallibility nor Delusion in the Revelation of God, but all Fallibility and Delusion is out of it.] And R. VV. replies and grants, That God speaks Mediately unto us by the Light of Nature within us. Answ. And R. VV. saith: (p. 38. in his Book) There is no Voice nor Motion within to be hearken'd unto or listen'd to in hea∣venly
things, &c. But R. W. where doth the Apostle say, That God speaketh Mediately to us by a Light of Nature within us? And Eph. 4. proveth it not, and Job 33. But — R. VV. Thou say'st, The Private Prayers, and Fastings and Meditations of the Saints Day and Night are Holy Means,p. 191. in and by which the Eternal God speaks Peace, &c. Answ. And what! No Motion and Voice within heard of Hea∣venly things in the dark Heart R. W? How dost thou Contra∣dict thy self! What are all thy Prayers and Meditations and Fastings good for then? And Paul heard a Voice and saw Light; and the Goaler knew the Earth-quake: And Cornelius heard a Voice. R. VV. And thou say'st: The Immediate Teachings of God by Dreams, &c. and by Voices and Motion, the holy Scripture mentions many, before and since the Coming of the Lord Je∣sus, &c. Answ. Here R. VV. confutes Samuel Eaton the Priest, and confutes himself, which saith, There is no Voice nor Motion to be heard within of Heavenly things: And then how can he say, The Immediate Teachings of God by Voice, &c. before the Coming of Christ and since the Scripture is full of; and yet nothing of it him∣self? And then, whether to these Voices people must not hearken, which thou callest the Immediate Teaching of God? For thou say'st — R. W. But whether it be a Christian Obedience, or Diabolical Laziness to fling off all Means (as G. F. all a long teacheth) to sit still and listen to an Immediate Teaching, that is (I say) to the Devil's Whisperings, &c. Answ. R. VV. Art not thou Lazy, and followest a Diabolical Spirit, and followest the Devil's Whisperings, that Obeyest not the Immediate Teaching of God by his Voice, which thou confessest, before Christ's Coming and since? And what! dost thou call the Immediate Teachings the Devil's Whisperings? Which we deny. And G. F. doth not deny all Means, nor Cast it off; for if No Man knoweth the things of God, but by the Spirit of God, Then this must be the only Means. And (1.) We do not say R. VV. That all, that pretend to Revelations, are the Revelations of God. (2.) And we do not say, That all that pretend Light, that it is the Light of Christ;
but Diabolical Darkness, as R. VV.'s is, who calleth the Light of Christ a Fancy. And (3) Thou canst not Receive any true Reve∣lation and Teaching of God without hearing Voice or Motion: neither canst thou weigh them with thy Natural Reason; For the Natural Man doth not perceive the things of God: For the Pro∣phets, that taught the things of God, were looked upon as Mad, as thou dost upon us. And ye cannot Try Revelations nor In∣spirations by the outward Letter, no more than the Pharisees, which judged the Revelations of the Son of God, and persecuted his Apostles, who preached the Revelation of the Gospel. And how dost thou differ from Mahomet or the Papists, and the Powhows, that hast No Voice or Motion within in Heavenly things in matters of Supernatural Light? And seeing, thou hast No Voice nor Motion in Heavenly things within thee, how canst thou do otherwise,p. 192. but to take the Whispe∣rings of the Devil within thee? — And yet thou bringest Scriptures to make use of for thy own Ends, as the Devil and Anti-Christ dos, to MVRTHER and Destroy the Lambs of Christ with his Murthering Spirit: and from that he hath Motions enough within, and Voices to do Wickedness. And what Voice or Motion was that in R. VV. to have us to be PV∣NISH'D? or Voice or Motion in the New-England-Priests, that WHIPT and put some of us to DEATH? Is not the same in Mahomet? but is not the Voice of Christ, that Came to SAVE Mens Lives, and not to destroy them. R. VV. bringeth Samuel Eaton (G. F.'s Fol. p. 4.) saying, [The Gospel is the Letter, &c.] G. F.'s Answ. [The Apostle saith, It is the Power of God unto Salvation to every one that be∣lieveth; and The Letter Killeth: and many may have the Form, and deny the Power, and so stand against the Gospel, which is the Power of God.] But why did not R. VV. put in Priest Eaton's Saying, That Timothy was Commanded to preach, and yet had not heard, nor seen, nor handled any thing of Christ? (Fol. p. 4.) And why did not he put in those words of the Priest, There is an Immediate Voice within, which we have never heard, and do not know it within our selves Experimentally; and we believe and hope, that we shall never know it? (Fol. p. 5.) AND then ye shall ne∣ver know it.— And R. VV. replieth and telleth us, What the word Gospel signifieth, English and Saxon [This is nothing to the purpose:] And further he saith: This Wise Cunning Man,
(G. F.) &c. and saith, I know the trick of these Old Cheaters and Jugglers, &c. Answ. And what R. VV! Was the Apostle a Juggler and a Cheater, who said, The Gospel was the Power of God unto Salva∣tion to every one that believeth (Rom. 1.) and a suttle Deceiver? (as read thy page 192) And is not this Good News Glad Tidings to every Believer, that knoweth the Gospel to be the Power of God unto Salvation?p. 193. And R. VV. dost not thou call the Light, which Christ hath enlightned us and every Man, that cometh into the World, withal, a Fancy and an Idol? R. VV. And then thou say'st; These bewitched Souls will not own Figurative Speeches. Answ. Yes; this is false: for we own all, which the Scrip∣tures call so; but doth the Apostle call the Gospel, which is the Power of God unto Salvation, a Figurative Speech? and if so, what did the Power of God Figure forth? prove it by Scripture. And can the Jews receive the Gospel, but by the Power of God? and then by Revelation: And we question, whether R. VV. and his New-England-priests ever knew the Gospel; for if he did, we should not have such foul Language of him. And we own the Gospel (Rom. 2.) as the Apostle calleth it, (Rom. 1.) For the Gospel is not called the Power of God Figuratively, but Properly, according to the Apostle's words: and if the Declara∣tion of the Gospel can be called the Gospel, that is Figurative; as when the Description or Map of England is called England. And G. F. had good Reason to oppose the Priest calling the Letter the Gospel, because thereby they would assume to them∣selves the Priviledge of being Preachers of the Gospel, because of their preaching the Letter (which at best is but Figuratively so, while they are both Strangers and Enemies to that, which is re∣ally the Gospel, to wit, the Power of God.)— AND as for Paul's calling the Gospel HIS GOSPEL, it maketh nothing for R. VV.'s purpose; no more than David, calling God HIS GOD; which any Saint may do: For David meant God Really there, and not Figuratively. And Paul was a Minister of the Power of God, and of God and Christ, and the Spirit, and therefore God and Christ, and the Power, and the Spirit may in a true Sense be said to be HIS, as freely given him of God. And the Story of the Three Foxes is wholly Impertinent, and serveth only to show thy Folly and Malice. Where did we de∣ny
a Distinction in such a Case, that Fox a Beast, should be distinguished from Fox a Man? And how appliest thou that to the present Matter? And is not thy Malice great to upbraid G. Fox with his Name, while thou commendest John Fox as an Heavenly Man, having the same Sir-Name? How is it a Re∣proach to the one, and not to the other? Thy Comparison of the Traitor and the King's Pardon, as ap∣plied to the Gospel, &c. is Lame and Silly, because thy Pardon to the Traitor is positive and particular; and there needs nothing further, but the Writing and the Seal to make it Effectual. But the Letter is General and Conditional, and a Testimony only of the Gospel, which is the Power of God, which bringeth the true Pardon, where it is received in the Soul, which the Letter doth not. R. VV.'s Example of G. F.'s writing News to his Friends, may be the same way Answered, and shews his light and ma∣licious Mind. And whereas thou acknowledgest, That some may have the Let∣ter and Form without the Power (as G. F. affimeth there) thou hast thereby over-turned thy self: For so some may have the Letter,p. 194. and want the Gospel, which is the Po∣wer of God: and such (what-ever they pretend to,) are but still Pictures, and not Members of Christ. The rest of thy work to thy Fifth Instance (pag. 195.) is no∣thing but Falshood and Malice, as to say, That G. F. preacheth an Imaginary and Allegorical Christ; That he accounts himself or others call him the Only True Christ: Which is returned upon thy head as Lies. Neither do we Divide the Letter from the Meaning, nor the Instrument from the Husband-Man; We refuse not to call Good News, Good News. But we know, it is one thing to talk of good things, and another thing to enjoy and possess them. And as for thy malicious Talk, That we would be glad to have the Bible Burned; We return it upon thee as a malitious Lie, and dare thee to prove it. We honor the Scriptures in their Due Place, and by them can prove R. VV. and such as he, to be false Teachers and Enemies to Christ and his Gospel.] And — R. VV. Bringeth in John Bunyan (G. F. Fol. p. 10.) [It is not Faith and Works,p. 195. that Justify in the Sight of God; ut it's Faith and Good Works, which Justify in the Sight of Men only, &c.] And G. F. Answ. [Abraham was
not Justified to Men only by his Obedience, but to God; and where Faith is, there is Justification, which worketh by Love. And the Saints Faith and Works were not only to Justify them in the Sight of Men; but the Work of God is to DO what he saith, and his Will: which who do not, are not Justified in so doing; but to be beaten with Stripes. Who seek to be Justi∣fied by their Faith and Works in the Sigt of Men, are in a Dead Faith and Works both] — This R. VV. hath brought in his Book p. 150. and 195. and also he brings it p. 125. and 126. in the same Book (which is fully Answered pag. 142, 143.) — And in p. 125. he calls him John Bunyar; and pag. 195. he calls him John Bunian, and yet they are both one Man's Sayings (as the Reader may see in G. F.'s Fol. p. 110.) and he himself quotes them both of this page. And if G. F. should have said Bunyar for Bunyan, as R. VV. (who calls himself O∣rator) doth, he would have cried Simple, and Lame, and Tau∣tologies, to Answer the same Man's words Twice over in one and the same Book.— And R. W. thou say'st: For what is Justification, but a Pardon written, and sealed and declared from the King of Heaven to poor, condemned Traitors? That this Pardon may be merited by any Price, that either we or any in the World can offer, is denied by true Protestants, &c. Answ. What must we understand from R. W.'s words? but that Every one (Protestant,) Papist, Arminian, as he crieth a∣gainst, &c. that hath the written Scripture (which they may pur∣chase for a small Price) hath both Pardon and Justification without Faith and Spirit. And then the Papists, Arminians and Socinians (that he crieth so much against, as well as us) have the Justification, and written Pardon and Seal, though they know not the Son and Father, but by Revelation. Then why doth the Apostle say, They are Justified by FAITH? and what is this, to over-throw James's words, that saith; Our Father Abraham was Justified by WORKS? Was this in the Sight of Men R. W. or in the Sight of God? Which Works were wrought by Faith. And the Apostle telleth thee, that As the Body is dead without the Spirit, so is Faith without Works (Jam. 3.) And the Apostle saith (Rom. 3, 28.) Therefore we conclude, that a Man is Justified without the Deeds of the Law; being Justified freely by his Grace: But this doth not prove Abraham's being Justified by his Works only, but by his Faith: And doth not the Apostle say; Have ye received the Spirit by the works of
the Law, or hearing of Faith? Now, where is this Voice to be heard, if not within? And many may cry out of their Sins, and may have the written Pardon or Justification; and may have the outward written Pardon (which thou callest Justification) and some may cry out of their Sins, and some may not be sensible of their Sins. But thou confessest, it was the Lord, that opened Lydias Heart, to give Attentions unto the Gospel, and so receive a Pardon: There∣fore, as the Apostle saith, No Man knoweth the things of God, but by the Spirit of God; nor the Son, nor the Father, but by Reve∣lation, Christ saith. But do any receive that Pardon, but who re∣ceive the Light, which Lighteth every Man that cometh into the world, by which they see their Sins, and him, that pardoneth them? Seeing the Pharisees and the Jews this Day, who have the Scrip∣tures, do not receive this Pardon; seeing the Jews have the Scrip∣tures now, or may have them. And the Pharisees in the Days of Christ would not receive this Pardon or Justification, who did not believe in the Light of Christ, as he taught, as ye may see it; see∣ing Christ said to the Jews, If ye continue in my words, &c. and, Ye shall know the Truth, and the Truth shall make you Free: And so they are so now. And those professing Jews could say to Christ's Face, They were of Abraham, because they had the Scriptures; but Christ told them, They were of (their Father) the Devil, and his Lust they would do: As R. VV. and his New-England-Priests say, They are Christians; but whose Works have they done, and still do? But If the Son therefore shall make you Free, ye shall be Free In∣deed. And if all the Righteousness of the Best Men (as R. VV. saith) to wit, good Thoughts, good Words, good Actions, Alms, Prayers, Preachings, Sufferings, be but as Womens Menstruous and Filthy Clouts, then why doth Christ say; Let your Light so shine before Men, that they may see your good Works, and glorify your Fa∣ther, which is in Heaven? And doth not the Apostle say, He hath Created us unto Good Works? And what! are the Works of the Saints in the New Covenant so bad, as the Transgressors were in the Old Covenant (seeing thou hast made no Distinction, but Jum∣bled all together?) But these are thine and the New-England Persecutors Best-Mens Works. R. VV. bringeth Enoch Howet's Saying (Fol: G. F. p. 16.)
It is an Expression of a dark, deluded Mind, to say, that God is not Distinguished from his Saints.] And G. F. Answ: [But God and Christ is in the Saints, and walketh in them: and he is a Reprobate,pag. 196. and out of the Apostle's Do∣ctrine, that denieth it.] And R. VV. saith: I Re∣ply to this Canting Gypsie; Answ. And that is all that he saith here, who cannot endure to hear of God and Christ dwelling in his people. But may not he as well call the Apostle Canting Gypsie, who preached this Doctrine? (as 2 Cor. 13: and 1 Cor. 6. and 2 Cor: 6.) And — R. VV. bringeth in Ralph Farmer p: 74. [That God the Crea∣tor is distinct from all Creatures: That Christ being God only in One Person, remaineth distinct from all Men and Angels.] Let the Reader read G. F.'s Fol. p. 74. and there is no such thing in that page: And therefore he hath not done, as becometh an Ora∣tor, as he calleth himself to the King. Nevertheless R. VV. hath given an Answer to these words (which are not found in the page in G. F.'s Book, that he quoteth) and saith; Is there no Distincti∣on between Infinite and Finite? Answ. We never said, that the Finite was the Infinite; but this doth not prove, that God and Christ is Distinct from his peo∣ple, and doth not dwell in them. And — R. VV. saith: G. F. saith, his Opposite is a Reprobate: R. VV. asketh Why? And he saith; The only Reason G. F. gives, is, because he licks not up the filthy and Hellish Poison of Fox's Chil∣dish and Hellish Blasphemy against the Eternal Godhead; and crieth, poor Dust and Ashes. Answ. And let the Reader see, It is, because G. F. saith, God and Christ will dwell in his Saints, and walk in them, according to the Apostle's Doctrine. Aad this Doctrine of Christ and the Apostle he calleth Hellish Poison, Childish and Hellish Blasphemy against the Eternal Godhead: Now let the Gentle Reader see, how this Man raileth and doteth against the Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles with a Venom under his Tongue! And again — R. VV. bringeth Joseph Kellet (G. F. Fol. 22.) saying [They be all aliented from God, and Enemies unti Faith [but these are R. VV.'s words instead of until; this should be Non-sense in G. F. but with R. VV. (who calleth himself the King's Orator) it must be Good Sense: who found fault with G. F. because
there was an [] to much; though this might be the Printers.] G. F. Answ. [So they have denied their School-master, which is until Faith; which will keep them out of the Alienation, which is the Law, as Paul speaketh of.] And R. W. replieth and falleth a-railing with many Filthy Words, — Answ. Which are not worth mentioning here. And Paul Rom. 8. Is not this, as Solomon saith, The Legs of the Lame are not Equal, to Contradict thy self? (Gal. 3.) And then thou goest on in a kind of Preaching, but nothing to the purpose; who cavil'st against the Apostle's words, and manifestest another Spirit, and canst not disprove them. And where-as thou alledgest, That G. F. his words are uncertain, as Whether the Alienation is the Law? &c. If thou werest not willfully Prejudicate and Blind, thou might'st understand, that the last word [Which] is Relative not to the Word Alienation, but School-master: for Paul saith, The Law was the School-master unto Christ: and who were under this School-master, were not in the Alienation, because they had a Be∣lief in him to come, although not, as when he was come. R. W. Thou bringest (G. F. Fol. p. 27.) Baxter's Sayings [To say, that any is Perfect and without sin, is the Devil's Speaking in Man.] G. F. Answers [Contrary to the Language of the Apostles and Christ,pag. 197. who bid them, Be Pefect: And the Apostle spake Wisdom amog them that were Perfect, and said, They were made free from Sin, And it is the Devil's Speaking in Man, that speaketh for Sin, while Men are upon the Earth; for the Devil holdeth him up, that maketh Men not Perfect: which Truth maketh Men Free again from the Devil, and speaketh in Man, and saith, Be Perfect.] Here R. W. saith, [that Be Perfect] and G. F. saith [that Are Per∣fect:] but is, that Be Perfect, according to the Grammar, seeing, thou findest so much Fault with G. F?] And R. W. saith: The Per∣fection signifieth no more, then Sincerity and Uprightness. Answ. Then is R. W. or any of his New-England-Priests and Professors Perfect in Sincerity, and Vprightness and compleat Ful∣ness in its Kind? What Fulness is this? R. W. And thou say'st: Sometimes it's Fortified, Strong and Armed, and sometimes its the Fulness of the Godhead, to whose Incomprehensible Ocean not one drop can be given, nor one drop can be taken from him. Answ. And doth not the Apostle say, Of his Fulness we have
received Grace for Grace? And, Grace, and Truth cometh by Je∣sus Christ; and is not this in the Hearts of God's people? And Christ saith, Be ye Perfect, as your Heavenly Father is Perfect. And then thou say'st — R. W. We are not exhorted to be Equal with God in Holiness,pag. 198. for this is to be Equal with God our∣selves. Answ. But Christ, who said, Be ye Perfect, as your heavenly Fa∣ther is Perfect; and the Apostle said, Be ye Perfect, In his saying so, he doth not say, that they should be Christ themselves, and sit down in the Throne of God or the Godhead, and thrust out the Eternal God. Ah! poor Mortal, in the Imaginary Fancy! (as I may well say) can the Eternael God be thrust out of his Throne? Is not this Blasphemy to say, that the Eternal God can be thrust out of his Throne? If this be R. W.'s and the New-England-Priests Doct∣rine, that the Eternal God can be thrust out of his Throne, if ye hold such Principles of God, the Eternal, Living God,R. VV.'s Blas¦phemy. before whom all Nations are but like a Drop of a Bucket (and if they are but a Drop, and yet if he can be Thrust out of his Throne by so few people, this is gross Ignorance and Blindness to mention any such thing. And thou say'st— R. W. There is a Generation, that are pure in their own Eyes, yet are not cleansed from their Filthiness. Answ. Roger, this is thy own Condition: And what! Dost thou bring this to oppose Christ, who saith, Be ye Perfect, as your heavenly Father is Perfect? And the Apostle saith, We speak Wis∣dom among them that are Perfect, 1 Cor: 2, 6: And Paul doth not contradict himself in Phil. 3. R. W. And thou say'st: G. F. and we do not know the Battle, &c; between the Old Man and the New; for Satan having pos∣session, all is in peace. Answ. This R. W. might have applied to himself, who know∣eth not our Condition, which we have gone through, nor the New Man, that is born after God: for how can he, when he believeth not in the Light, by wich he may become a Child of Light, but speaketh evil of it? And therefore he is not like to know the bat∣tle betwixt the New and the Old. And— R. W. Thou say'st: It hath been ever known, that all God's Chil∣dren
are like High and Glorious Queens and Empresses, who wit∣tingly endure not (as the holy Scripture speaketh) that such an Vg∣ly Fiend as the Devil should touch them, no, not in an Evil Thought. Answ. R. W. why dost thou deny here the people of God called Quakers, who witness Sanctification and Redemption by Christ Jesus, and Freedom from Sin here? But Roger, How can those high, glorious Queens and Empresses, which thou callest God's people, who cannot endure the Evil Fiend, the Devil, to touch them, no, not with an Evil Thought (how canst thou say then, they) have a Combate or a Battle all their Life Time, and Cry out like Paul, Who shall deliver me? And make good the great Mystery (Ap∣pend. p: 6.) How the Seeds of all Sin are in the New-born, and the Seeds of all Grace. And G. F. and We have Esteem and Love to all that profess Holiness and Sincerity, who are begotten of the holy Spirit. R. VV. bringeth (G. F. Fol. p. 28.) Rich: Baxter's Saying, where G. F. telleth [How the same Author preacheth an External Word.] G. F. Answ: [Which the Scripture speaketh nothing of, nor the Prophets, nor Christ; but saith, The Word that liveth, and abideth and endureth for Ever: and of the Scriptures of Truth, that cannot be broken; and of God's Words and Christ's Words, and that is not External. This is not agreeable to Sound Words, that cannot be Condemned; but that is like his Do∣ctrine, that knoweth not the Eternal. But the Ministers of Christ did not tell people of an External Word, but of an ETER∣NAL WORD: but ye being made by the Will of Man, speak to the people of an External Word.] NOW whereas R. VV. in Answer to this saith, That the Word (whether External, Inter∣nal or Eternal) is a Simitude, because God hath no Mouth, nor Tongue nor Words,— Answ. He sheweth his Ignorance of God and Divine things: for God in his Words is more truly Real, then those things of Man, that are obvious to the outward Changes; and therefore are rather to be called a Similitude of God's words, then God's a Simi∣litude of Man's words. The like Ignorance he sheweth in his Comparing of Kings and Generals of Armies;p. 199. which Comparison is Lame: For God as an Omnipresent Being, can and doth signify his Mind unto all his Children Inward∣ly by his Spirit, which the other cannot do; and therefore must of
necessity make use of outward Words and Writings. The like gross Ignorance he sheweth, in stretching this Comparison to a Sentinel's making the General stand, if he forget his Word; Which cannot be applied to God without great Blasphemy. Neither do we deny, but that the Mind of God is outwardly express'd in Words in ma∣ny things in the holy Scriptures; and therefore, as R. VV. saith, That Christ, and Paul and Apollo spke and Disputed from the Scriptures (neither do we deny, but the same may be done, as we our selves oft do) which yet will signify nothing without the Lea∣dings and Guidings of that Spirit, from whence the Scriptures come. By which Spirit we are fully satisfied, they were guided in their Testimonies and Disputing from the Scriptures; and so are the Faith∣ful in this Day. R. VV. bringeth (G. F. Fol. p. 32.) Ellis Bradshaw saying [The Quakers Spirit doth teach them to honor no Man.] G. F. Answ. [That is a Lie: for it Teacheth them to have all Men in Esteem, and to Honor all Men in the Lord. Yet they are convinced by the Law to be Transgressors, if they Respect Mens Persons: And the Saints are not to hold the Faith of our Lord Jesus Christ with Respect of Persons, as ye do.] This last Sentence, which was the Reason of G. F.'s Assertion, he hath deceitfully kept out; and yet now hath little to say, but his Saying, That is a Lie. Answ. Which being Really a Lie (in Ellis Bradshaw) it is nei∣ther contrary to Christianity nor Civility to say, it is so. But Rea∣der, mind but, how often R. VV. useth the Word Lie? And yet he findeth Fault with G. F. It is also false, that ever the Quakers were against Taking by the Hand, or true Courtesy; though to Bow, and Vnco∣ver the Head (whether half or whole) they are against,pag. 200. and look upon as in Apostacy, if done by any of them: Neither can R. VV. prove, that so to do is true Civility.— It is false in him to insinuate, that to assert, That in Christ there is neither Bond nor Free; as if used by us to destroy the Mutual Relation of Master and Man, Father and Child: Which is false, and might the same way be alledged upon the Apostle. — Such Respective Words and Titles, as the Scripture owneth and commandeth (especially under the New-Covenant) we deny not; if R. VV. thinketh we do, let him prove it. And as for his Charges of our Vncivil and Inhumane Behaviour, he only affirm∣eth it, saying, God knoweth it: but giveth no manner of Proof for his Calumny,
And if the English Bibles and Grammar (as R. VV. confesseth) make use of Thou to a single Person; why should R. W. quarrel with the Quakers for following the English Bibles and Grammar? —With the like Confidence and without Proof he doth affirm, That the Hebrew and Greek signifieth no more You then Thou: For all those, that understand those Languages, know, that they distinguish the Singular and the Plural, as well as the English. And albeit Every Nation, &c: have their particular Proprieties of Speech; yet that doth not destroy the Real Distinction of Sin∣gular and Plural, universally acknowledged in all Languages. And therefore to accuse those as Ridiculous, that use this Distincti∣on is in R. VV. but a manifesting of his own Folly; as likewise a sufficient Evidence of his Mlice and Wickedness to declare, It's no Persecution, to punish Men, who for Conscience sake cannot comply with his mind or Corrupt Custom in these mat∣ters. R. VV. undertaketh to prove, That the Spirit of the Quakers tends (1) to reduce people from Civility to Barbarism. (Answ.) And albeit he braggs here,pag. 201. that W. E. and the rest in the Dspute stood upon Coles, and overdrive him, for fear he should prove it; yet now he hath Leisure e∣nough, to write what he pleaseth without Interruption: He pro∣duceth no solid Reason for it. The words of Paul (Ephes. 4.) and Peter (1 Pet. 3.) Be Pitiful, be Courteous, we own; neither doth he prove, that we are otherwise. But did the New-England-Priests and Professors obey this Command, when they HANGED, &c. the Innocent? Were they led by the Spirit of Christ Jesus, which R. VV. saith, leadeth to Courteousness, Gentleness and Sociableness to the greatest Opposites? Did they not in so doing behave them∣selves more like the dogged, proud, sullen Pharisees, R. W. speaketh of (and also like himself in his Book) then the Disciples of Jesus? With the like foolish Confidence he affirmeth, — (R. W.) That the Quakers Spirit leads to bring into that Barbarity, which the English were wearing out among the Indians; and that,pag. 202. because they past by people sometimes with∣out speaking to them, saying, They are like the Popish Saints in a Procession. (Answ.) But is Silence become such a Crime amongst the Christi∣ans, who know, that they shall be brought to an Account for every Idle Word? If this were all, for which the Indians are to be
blamed, it were no hard matter, to prove them therein to be more Innocent, then many of those Idle Talkers, that go under the Name of Christians. And it remains yet for R. W. to prove, That Silence in such Cases, or a Refusing to comply with Men in the Common Sort of Salutations, proceeds from a Brutish Spirit: which for R. W. to affirm, and not to prove, is pitifully to Beg the Question. AS for his Story of the Quakers Nakedness, the Account he himself giveth of W. Edmondson and J. Stubs, their Answer for it shows, there is nothing of Barbarity or Immodesty in the Case. And for as much as — R. W. saith, That such a thing cannot now be admitted as a Sign, because Signs and Figures are ceased under the Gospel. Answ. The Objection is no ways valued: For that will not hold forth, as if we were under a shadow of Dispensation, ty∣pifying some other Dispensation to come; but only a particular Sign by a particular Mattr of Fact by way of Prophecy: As the Case of Agabus (Act: 21, 11.) taking Paul's girdle, and binding himself▪ as a Sign of his Bonds to come. Which Instance R. W. confesseth J. Stubs gave, doth sufficiently witness. The Second Branch of — R. W.'s Fourteenth Position or Charge is this: The Spirit of the Quakers tends to bring in an Arbitrary Government. His Proof consists in these Three things,p. 203. 1. That God wrote Laws for Israel some by his own Inconceivable Finger, and some by Moses his Inspired Pen-man: for that it pleased him, not to leave their Wisest Kings and Governours without Written, Known Laws, with Rewards and Penalties anexed. Answ. What then Roger? Did not God promise, That in the last days he would pour out of his Spirit upon all Flesh? and That all should know him from the Least to the Greatest? Is thy Eye E∣vil, because God's Eye is Good? Is God's Promise become Er∣roneous and the Compleat Liberty and Freedom of the Gospel-Spirit Offensive and Dangerous to thee? Or wilt thou compare the State of the Law with that of the Gospel? Is not a greater than Moses, come? Is not he the great Pen-man of the Gospel? Doth not he write his Heavenly Law in the Hearts of them that, believe in him? R. W. But thou say'st: The Finger of God, that wrote these Laws, is Inconceivable. [How then canst thou understand it or
them?] But thou further arguest; If the Quakers are guided in all they say and do, by the Immediate Spirit of God (as I proved, Fox maintained) then if they obtain Higher or Lower Governours of their Spirits, surely it shines clear, that there is no need of Laws for them to Rule and Act by; they have the Holy Scriptures with∣in them, their Teacher within them, and all that they speak, the Voice within them, &c. So, I said, much more might be said of Mens Laws and Writings, that surely they had no need of them. Answ. When and where did G. F. say, That every thing, that was done by a Quaker, was done by the Immediate Motion of the Spi∣rit of God? and when and where did he maintain it? For there are many outward, indifferent Matters, which true Christians called Quakers, have a true Understanding and Liberty from God to do; and not to place those things upon the Immediate Moti∣on of God's Spirit within them, which yet is not against the Mind of God: (See what Paul saith 1 Cor. 7, 6, 12.) — But a vain and foolish Argument hast thou brought, indeed no Argument; but rather a Repetition of thy Charge. Howbeit this I say; Christ never leads his people to disobey Just Laws, but to fulfil them (and Vnjust Laws are to be obeyed at no times; yet all true Christians do patiently suffer, when for good Consci∣ence to God they are oppressed by them, according to the Con∣mand and Example of Christ) And how doth this destroy Righte∣ous Government and Laws, that fulfilleth all Righteousness? Law is added because of Transgression; where Transgression is remo∣ved, the Law has no power: And is this thy Evil and Arbitra∣ry Government, thou chargest upon the Quakers, when To take a∣way Sin, and finish Transgression, is the very End of Christ's Com∣ing? Roger, what's become of thy Wits? Is Not to need the Law, to Rebel against and break the Law? and to Obey Christ the great Law-giver, the way to Destroy Free Government, and to set up an Arbitrary and Oppressive Government? The Law is a School-master, and it leadeth to Christ; and all Just Govern∣ment is owned in it's place. But are those, that are come to Christ (and to God the Judge of all, and the Spirits of the Just men made perfect, and to the General Assembly of the First-born) against Free and Righteous Government, which is the End of all Just Government, and the Perfection of all Just Government? Nay, they do and leave undone the things commanded or forbidden in
all Righteous Laws by the Divine Nature, which they are Par∣takers of. And Roger, we must tell thee, that all those, that obey the Spirit of God, and keep to Christ, their Law-giver and Teacher, are in that Love, that fulfills the Law; because they are in that Image, which was before Transgression was, for which the Law was added. And art not thou a Wicked Man (yea, and God will recompense it upon thy Head, if thou repentest not) to make our Fulfilling all Just Laws a Subverting of Just Laws, and a Destroying of Just Government! as if we were for a Boundless, Lawless, Wicked Life, and not, that we were Come to him, by whom Princes Reign, and Kings decree Justice. (R. W.) But upon W. E.'s Saying [What dost thou R. W. fill peoples Ears with strange Notions, as if the People of God cal∣led Quakers, were a Lawless people? We are for Righteous Government and Righteous Laws; we are not for any to rule by Force.p. 204.] Thou repliest, That W. E. mistook Thee; thou did'st not intend a Government by Force, but by Will or Pleasure, as Arbitrium signified. (Answ.) To which we say: That where there is no Force, there is no Fear of Slavery; and such an Arbitrary Government no body was ever afraid of. But it was an Arbitrary Govern∣ment with Force, Roger, that used WHIPS, and an HOT IRON, and HALTERS and GALLOVSES in New-England. O thou Wicked Man, look at home, and do not thou bespatter the In∣nocent, who hast Joined with Persecutors, and taken part with the Blood-thirsty Generation! The Lord give thee Repentance, if it be not hid from thine Eyes for Ever! — But Roger, dost thou not accuse the people called Quakers, for holding, That they are Acted by the Spirit of God, and not by their own Spirit? If so, it is the Arbitrium, or Will and Pleasure of their God, and not by their own Wills and Spirits, that they are Acted by: And what Harm is this to Just Government? or how doth this set up Man's Will and Power? O thy Blindness! thy Darkness! and thy Confusion! (R. W.) Now to the Third Branch of thy Fourteenth Positi∣on, viz: That the Quakers Spirit tendeth to the sudden Cutting-off of people, yea Kings and Princes, that oppose them. (Answ.) But what Proof hast thou for this? Answer us. Thou tellest us▪ Thou cravest our patience, that thou must profess thy
Fears — And what have we to do with thy Fears? What Proof is this, that we are Guilty? If we should say, R. W. is a Thief or a Drunkard: And when we are called to prove it, we tell him, We fear, he is a Thief or a Drunkard; We ought ra∣ther to fear, he would Take the Law of us for a Scandal against him. But — (R. W.) Thou clearest us presently after in these words, viz: I told them, I thought, they had no such thing in their Thoughts or Eye at present; but if Power of the Sword come into their hand, it was easie to imagine, that whom their Spirit (infallible) decreed to Death, Peasant or Prince, if it were possible, he must be Exe∣cuted. (Answ.) Now all people behold, where is the Charity, the Justice, the Reason of this Man! He Chargeth our Spirit with Death of Prince and Peasant, Which taketh in all Mankind from the Throne to the Dunghil: when he cometh to prove it, He Feareth so, and, It is easie to Imagine so: But it is beyond a Fear or Imagination either, that R. W. would (if he could) expose us to the Club of the Peasant, and to the Sword of the Prince, and render us unfit to live in the World; as hath been already hin∣ted. But Roger, do the Magistrates, called Quakers, where thou livest, give thee any Proof for this Charge? or any Ground for this Vgly Fear and Bloody Imagination? No such matter: How∣ever, thou hast no Ground for So Fearing and So Imagining in these words, viz: — (R. W.) For why might they not say, that Abraham with an Impulse was killing Isaac, Moses the Egyptian, Ehud Eg∣lon, Samuel Agag,p. 205. and Paul Ananias and Sapphira? &c. Also the wonderful Actings of Tho. Munster, J. Becold, Pseiffer and Knipperdolling in Germany. (Answ.) When did ever any of the people called Quakers, do any of these things, or follow any of these Examples? which thou might'st have better applied to thy own Spirit and the New-England Professors. Must thy Fear and thy Imaginations serve thy Turn? Is it a good Argument, Because Evil Men have pretended God for Evil Actions, therefore All that act in the Name of the Lord, must needs be Guilty of the same Designs, and their Spirit tend to the same Evil Consequences? THEY that have not the Spirit of Christ▪ are none of his; This is according to Scripture: Now, how knowest thou, that we have not the Spirit of Christ? Thou canst
not tell by the Visible Fruits (for thou say'st; I Charge the Qua∣kers with no Matter of Fact: Nay, thou further say'st, Thou did'st, not Think, We had any such thing in our Thoughts or Eye at pre∣sent?) The Spirit of God never Revealed it to thee, for thou de∣niest Revelation: The Scripture tell's thee no such thing; and thou confessest, that no such Fact or Fruits appear? What wicked Pre∣sumption is this to Judge an Innocent people with thy envious Imaginations of thy own Heart? But Roger, how comest thou to jumble Abraham and Munster, Mo∣ses and Knipperdolling together? Did they proceed upon the same Authority? Hast not thou served Abraham and Moses, as thou dost Vs (in Joining Abraham with the Wicked) with thy false Cain's Fears, who thus enviest thy Brother, and hast proved thy self a Man-sayer (1 John 3.) Is this good Equal Measuring, Weighing and Joining? Abraham in that Case gave one of the greatest In∣stances, and of Self-Denial and Obedience to God; was that Mun∣ster's and Knipperdolling's Case? Again, Art not thou an Unrea∣sonable Man, that under the pretence of Confuting Mens Principles, makest Principles, that thou may'st Confute them, which are not theirs? Dost thou not know, that it is one of our Principles, That he, that killeth with the Sword, shall perish by the Sword? That Men ought to Love their Enemies? Yea, that it is a stand∣ing and Foundation-Principle of the Gospel, to SVFFER, and not to Revenge? And that it is not the Way of the Spirit of God in these Gospel-Days, to Exercise the Children of God in such things, as either were connived at, or suffered or commanded, before Christ Came, the Heir and Lord of all things, that brought Life and Immortality to Light: Who is greater than Abraham, or Moses or Samuel, yea, all the Prophets and all the Apostles too. But Roger, we never read yet, That Paul killed Ananias and Sapphira, nor yet, that they died by a Visible Force; but by that Power and Spirit, which Early or Late will over-take thee for all thy Vngodly Speeches and Calumnies, if thou repen∣test not. But Roger, thou hast writ thy own State, and the State of the New-England-Priests: And it is a Wonder, ye do not Kill one another, as ye have done the People of God called Quakers; for Thou and They, that own the Scripture to be your only Rule, and eny the Eternal Spirit to be necessary (which alone giveth to sa∣vor
Spirits) ye may in your Imaginations to Imitate▪ Abraham, offer up your Children, and think, Ye Act Moses upon the Egyp∣tian, when ye kill those, that are not of you. And no questi∣on, but ye made the poor Quakers the Egyptians, and the A∣gags, when you WHIPT them, and BVRN'D them and HANG∣ED them, to Justify your selves in your Wickedness: But the Lord hath Discovered you, and he will Reward you! As for thy Charge against James Parne (which thou bring'st over and over) viz: That he was moved to fast 40 Days, and perish'd the 11 Day: It is utterly false, there was no such thing. But after some of thy Generation about Colchester (for all their Cries and Pretences for Liberty of Conscience, and after all the Blood, that had been Spilt in the Nations about it) had beaten him, and bruised him, and shed his Innocent Blood, and cruelly intreated him (as hath been already said) he like a Lamb laid down his Innocent Life. O! this Harlot's Spirit, that would kill the Living Child, to be Revenged on the true Mo∣ther! which would lay it's own Abominations to the Charge of God's Elect, and suggest that against the Innocent People of God, which daily leads those into, that Partake with it, and are Joined to it. For thy Story of Henry the Fourth of France, that was stabb'd by a Friar pretending a Vision of Angels, What is that to us? who deny Friars, false Visions and all Stabbings to Death what-ever; yea, and maintain, that God's Spirit leadeth no man to any such Work: But Roger, Let thou, and the New-England-Priests and all your Brethren else-where look at home.pag. 206. For thy Story and Anger against William Harris (who is thy Neighbour) he is of Age, and able enough to Answer for himself. (R. W.) The Last Point and Branch of thy 14. Position is this, viz: Their Persecuting Spirit. — The Proof thou bringest for this Accusation,p. 107. is a passage out of G. F.'s Book (p: 170: Fol:) viz. That the Magistrate ought to subject the Nation to his Light, else he is not a Faithful Magistrate. (Answ.) But Roger, Though thou hast given his words very Imperfectly, this proves nothing of thy Charge. And to the end the Reader may see, that thou hast here-in used thy Fears and Imaginations (as before) and not in a Real Proof, here are
all G. F.'s words in that page upon that Subject follow∣ing: The Magistrate of Christ, the Help-Government for him, he is in the Light and Power of Christ; and he is to subject all under the power of Christ, into his Light, else he is not a faithful Magistrate: And his Laws here are Agreeable, and Answerable according to that of God in every Man; when men act contrary to it, they do Evil. So he is a Terror to the Evil-Doers, discerneth the Pretious and the Just from the Vile: And this is a Praise to them that do Well. Now is there one word of Persecution here? Or can R. W. think himself a Christian, and look upon it to be Persecution for Christ's Magistrate by Christ's Light and Power to subject all under the Power of Christ, and to bring all into this Light of Christ, Or can he think such an one an Vnfaithful Magistrate? Or are those Laws and the Execution of them Persecution, that are A∣greeable and Answerable to that of God in every Man? These are G. F.'s words: Such Magistrates, such Laws, such Power, and Light and Subjection is G. F. for, and no other. And O Ro∣ger! Canst thou expect to escape the Judgment of the great God, when the very words of G. F. relate not to Opinion, Re∣ligion, and Faith and Conscientious Worship (which Persecutors employ their Power to Impose or Restrain) but to Well or Evil-Doing, Common Justice, Righteousness, Truth, Industry, and those Vertues, that are so necessary and commendable between Man and Man. Wherefore (saith G. F.) The Magistrate is a Ter∣ror to Evil-doers, and a Praise to them that do well: who dis∣cern the Just from the Vile. And thus do G. F.'s own words at length prove the Innocency and Soundness of his mind in writing them; And the Malice and Envy of R. Williams in mis-represen∣ting and mis-construing them. But Roger: How doth Terrifying Evil-doers destroy Govern∣ment? When we speak of Punishing Evil-doers, then thou turn∣est it to Persecuting Conscientious Dissenters: And when we speak of being made Free by the Light and Spirit of God from the Impositions and Traditions of Men, thou construest it presently, that we are against Law and Government, and set up an Arbitra∣ry Government of our own: And thus To the Vnholy all is Vn∣holy. One while we are accused of being against Magistracy, another while for being for Magistracy: But the Lord hath de∣livered
us out of thy Hands, and in some measure out of the Hands of thy Generation; and will do more and more for his own Seed's sake. (R. W.) The 2. Proof thou givest, that we are of a Persecu∣ting Spirit, is this; Was there ever any known (professing the Fear of God in so high a Measure) so sharp and Cutting in their Tongues even to Eminently Knowing and Conscientious Persons,p. 208. Thou Liar, Serpent, Cain, Judas, Hy∣pocrite, Devil? (Answ.) The Tongues of God's People have in all Ages been as a Fire and a Sword to the Wicked; and if thy Eminent Per∣sons were as well Known, as thou say'st they are Knowing, we knew what to say to thee. For since thou hast thought best to conceal them, we shall only say, that Liar, Serpent, Cain, Judas, Hypocrite, Devil are Names given to the Evil One and his Chil∣dren by the Spirit and People of God; Yea, they are the Form of sound Words, which thou and thy Generation wince and spurn at: And therefore many of our Dear Friends, Men and Wo∣men have been bitterly Bruised and Beaten by and at the Instiga∣tion of such Professing Priests, as thou art, when they have been so called. And we do believe, the Word of the Lord hath Cut you, which maketh thee to cry out, They are CVTTING Words: But the Spirit of the Lrod will Cut you more, and will Answer the Witness of God in you, and make you to Confess, GOD is IVST. And R. W. and his New-EnglandPriests need not to fear Carnal Weapons, to be hurt by from us. Well, but thou proceedest in these bitter words and sayst: — (R. W.) Shall we rationally question, whether their Hands (like Simeon's and Levi's) will not be as Fierce and Cruel, if the Most-Holy and Only Wise permit Whips and Halters, Swords and Fag∣gots so fall into their Hands? (Answ.) It may be as Rationally question'd of the People of God in this Age, as of God's people in former Ages: And God will reckon with thee, thou Vngodly, Vnjust Man, that insinuatest these wicked things against a Suffering as well as Harm∣less People! This Spirit, thou art led by in Writing against us, would BVRN us, as it led thy Fore-Fathers to Burn the Mar∣tyrs in Smith-field: For ye are all of CAIN'S Race, and ye are found in his Steps, and shall have Cain's Reward, if You repent not.
Nevertheless thou Instancest Sam. Fisher and Edw. Burrough, to prove this most Uncharitable Saying of thine. But this thou might'st have applied to the New-England-Professors, who have been in the Practice of it; their Fruits have discovered them to the World: and so it's like, they are afraid, the same Mea∣sure to be measured withal, as they have measured to us; but Vengeance we leave to God for him to repay it. — And is this a Proof, that we would Whip and Hang, and Burn and Destroy people for their Religion? Did S. F. and E. B. men∣tion Whips, Halters, Swords and Faggots? Were the Soldiers to over-come the Pope and his Followers with such Tools and Instruments, as they are? Or was it not rather to destroy those destroying Courses? But Roger, if this be the Sign of a False Religion, what hast thou to say for thy New-England Brethren, into whose Hands the Only-Wise God hath permitted Whips▪ Hal∣ters and Swords to fall? What Use have they made of them? Is not this to measure us by your selves? Because ye have been False to God, your own Consciences, and your own Principles, therefore we must be so too? Witness thy following words, which are the last Proof alledged by thee, to manifest our Per∣secuting Spirit; they are these: (R. W.) Have we not known the Deceitfulness of Mens Hearts fly out into greater Matters than Persecution? Hasael earnestly asked, whether the Prophet thought him a Dog, that he should do such matters? &c. (Answ.) What is this to the Business Roger? Are we Hasaels? or art thou the Prophet? or hast thou a true Prophetical Spirit, that thou canst tell us, We shall be, what thou thy self (pag. 204.) twice confessest, we are not? But thou hast another In∣stance to prove us Persecutors, saying: (R. W.) Pendleton vow'd, his Collops should fry, ere he would to Mass, in Q. Mary's Days; and yet to Mass he went, and Persecuted others also, that would not bow to the Image, as he had done. (Answ) What Proof is this, that we must Change our Prin∣ciples, and turn Persecutors? Either this Instance concerns us not at all, or else it must be applied thus: Persecution is no more our principle now, then it was Pendeton's, when he was a Pro∣testant; and as he turned not Persecutor, till he turned to Mass, so we shall not turn Persecutors, till we turn to thee and the
New-England-Professors: For the plain Meaning of this Instance of thine is, That though we have good Principles, and resolve to stand by them; yet we may turn from them, and Persecute our own Friends, who keep to them: which thou say'st, was Pendleton's Case. But Roger, is not this thine and the New-England-Priests Case? And is not this Measuring us by your selves (as before mentioned) with your false Rule, your false Yard, and that R. W. though he is not a Thief, yet he may be a Thief? Which he may be, before the Quakers turn to their Principles and Practice: For we see them plain enough; and had they any Good in them, we should never have forsaken them. For did not ye (Pendleton like) renounce and deny the Hierarchy of the Church of England, and severely plead against the Persecution raised by the Bishops against you in former Times? And did not ye Vow, If God gave power into your hands, ye would not do, as ye have been dealt by? And have not ye done the same things, and far Worse? Bitter∣ly WHIPT, BEATEN, BURN'D with an HOT IRON, BA∣NISHED and HANGED a poor and Conscientious people, (which are the Christians in Nature, and the Followers of the true Lord IESUS Christ) because they would not bow to your Image in New-England, after ye had fled from the Bishop's I∣mage in Old-England? Like to the Scribes and Pharisees, that praised the Prophets, and blamed the Fore-Fathers, and commit∣ted greater Wickedness themselves, by putting to Death the LORD of LIFE and GLORY? O Roger Williams! That thou might'st yet know the things that belong to thy Eternal Peace! That thou might'st yet find a place of Repentance for thy poor Soul, and feel the Mercies of the Lord in thy Eternal Salvation! O that thou had'st been Wise, and had'st not done these things! Verily, thou art Treasuring up Wrath against the Day of Wrath! And if thou comest not down into the Dust, and mournest for these things, thy Day will always be Darkness, and thy End EUERLASTING DESTRUCTION. G. F. I. B.

A NEW-ENGLAND▪ Fire-brand Quenched: Or, an Answer to Roger Williams APPENDIX. Wherein he hath taken and pickt up some of G F's. words, and some of G. F's old Persecutors here and there, that Writ against him, and the People of God call'd Quakers, what he thinks he can pick out for his own Advantage, who is of the same Spirit, as they that Writ against us, and Persecuted us in Oliver's days. R. W. IN the 2d. page of the Appendix thou say'st, that G F. writeth, that the Saints know all things as God, &c. And then thou tells,p. 2. what the Devil pretends he doth, and offers to reveal so much to some Conjurers: And then thou say'st, What hinders, but if the Quakers be Omniscient, and know all things, but they should be also Omnipotent and do all things? for Paul so writes, Phil. 4. &c. And R. W. saith, I know, they say, they are one with God and Christ, and they know all things, and can do all things; and yet this sense which literally is so proud and Blasphemous &c. Answ. Roger, Why dost thou abuse the Quakers? For where doth G F, or any of the Quakers write and say, They know all things as God? or, that they are Omniscient, or Omnipotent? And why dost thou find fault with G F, who brings the Apostles words to the Saints; But ye have an Vnction from the Holy One, and ye know all things, &c. and, Let that therefore abide in you, which you have heard from the beginning: and, If that, which ye have heard from the Begin∣ning, shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in the Fa∣ther. And, These things have I written unto you, concerning them that seduce you; but the Anointing which you have received of him, abideth in you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same A∣nointing teacheth you of all things, and is Truth, and is no Lye; and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him, &c. Here John ex∣plains his own words better than R. W. can do; and such as conti∣nue
in the Son of God, they continue in the Father, and know the An∣tichrists and the Seducers, to shun them, 1 John 2.— And dost thou not wickedly bring, That the Devil pretends, that he knoweth all things, and offers to reveal so much to his Conjurers? and dost not thou bring this in Opposition to John's words, who exhorted the Saints to the Anointing within them, which will teach them to know all things? and had'st thou been in John's days, thou would'st have said as much in Opposition to him, as thou hast done to G. F. who bringeth but John's words. And John saith, That which we have seen and heard, declare we unto you, that ye also might have fellowship with us; and truly, our fellowship is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ: and must not this Fellowship be witnessed by the true Believers in Christ Jesus? But it's like, thou art more acquainted with the Devils pretences, and what he reveals to his Conjurers, then with that, which the Apostle John did declare, which he had seen and heard: and therefore I believe, if R W. declared nothing, but what he hath seen and heard from the beginning, as John did, he would have little to say, 1 John 1. And as for Paul's saying, I can do all things, as R. W. brings; but R. W. has left out Christ: for the Apostle saith, I can do all things through Christ, who hath strengthened me; and so can all that walk in his Spirit: for without Christ they cannot do any thing that is good. And Christ saith, I am the Vine, and ye are the Branches; and he that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit; for without me ye can do nothing, John 15, 5. And thou say'st (to take the Apostles words) he can do all things, &c. and the Saints know all things (according to John's doctrine) and say'st, Yet this sense, which literally is so Proud and Blasphemous, &c. Here thou hast judg∣ed the Apostles to be Proud and Blasphemous, which directed the Saints to the Unction within from the Holy One, which taught them all things. And the Apostle could do all things through Christ that strengthened him. R. W. And thou say'st, Doth not the Spirit of God (Prov. 28.) open this to us, saying, Evil men understand not Judgment, but they that seek the Lord, understand all things, (ver. 5.) that is, God Answers their Prayers, and enables them to do all, that he calls them to, when the proud and scornful are rejected. Answ. It's well thou wilt confess so much, though thou hast added to Salomon's words: But I question much, whether ever thou heard God, or Christ's Voice immediate from Heaven by his Spiit? For Salomon's words are true, as he speaks, and gives a better sense, then thou canst.
R. W. Thou say'st, Therefore (I believe) it is, that the most Holy, most Just, and Wise Lord leaves these poor, proud, scornful souls to seek Wisdom, and not to find it; to be ignorant, knowing nothing, as God's Spirit speaks; and to discover their ignorance in so many fundamentals of Christianity, and in so many practices immodest, irrational, more then Savage, as I have proved against them. Answ. No such proofe hast thou proved. And here thou fall'st a railing in thy false judgment: but as Christ saith, With what judg∣ment ye judge, ye shall be judged. Thou think'st, thou art plucking a Mote out of our eyes, but sees not the Beam in thy own: and truly Roger, thou hast hit thy own Condition, and mist us. As for proud, scornful and savage, &c. and immodest practices, these are but thy rail∣ing Expressions, a wave of the Sea, which thou had better have kept at home, and applyed to thy own Spirit; for we can praise God through Jesus Christ, for what he hath revealed unto us: And I strange, that thou darest take the most-Holy Just Lord in thy mouth, and utter such foul Languages against his People. And who those many are, that practise Immodesty, which thou tell'st the World of, thou hast neither mentioned their Names, nor their Immodest practices; there∣fore it is a slander. And wherein are we Ignorant of the fundamentals of Christianity, seeing we believe all that is written in the Scriptures concerning God and Christ? R. W. And thou say'st, The Quakers confest their Light to be Con∣science, and J. Bunion denyes plainly, that Conscience can justifie. And R. W. replyes and saith, That Conscience looks back of a mans mind or spirit upon it self in point of justification or pardon of sin; and Conscience looks upon a cursed rotten nature: And J. Bunion calls the Light Conscience, A poor Dunghill-Creature, that will convince of sin (as in G.F's Folio, pag. 10.) [Oh how doth R. W. & J. Bunion contra∣dict each other! the one says, It will not justifie; the other says, In point of Justification or pardon of sin.] And thou says, that Adam and Eve's Conscience condemned them,p. 3. & they confest the Fact: and thou say'st, That poor Conscience, which every man, Jew or Gen∣tile, Civilized or Pagan comes into the world with, &c. and the first man and woman their Consciences condemned them, &c. and thou further say'st, Could this their Condemning Conscience (especially with mincing of sin, as all natural mens Consciences do) I say, could tis Conscience or Confession pardon their Sin, renew their Hearts, and be their Justifi∣cation (or clearing) and Salvation?
Answ. Hast not thou Answered thy self in the Second page? Do'st not thou say, that Conscience in point of justification looks upon a mans mind and spirit, &c. in point of Justification or pardon of sin, and yet thou call'st it a Natural Conscience, and Adam, and Eve, and every man has it? & thou say'st, that Abimelecks Conscience justified him from the Fact of Abraham's Wife; and Joseph's Conscience justified him &c? And thou wrong'st the Quakers in saying, that they confess their Light to be Conscience: In this thou perverts their words, and thou would'st have it so; for G. F's words are, The Light, which you call Conscience, which is the Light of Christ, as you may see all along in his Book. And thou calls Conscience Natural; and J. B. calls the Light (wherewith Christ enlightens every man that comes into the world) Conscience, and a poor Dunghill-Creature; which never doth G. F. nor the Quakers call it Conscience, nor Natural, but as you call it. And where did ever any of the Apostles call the Conscience  poor Dunghill-Creature, or that was Natural, that Condemned Adam and Eve? and is the Light, which Christ said Believe in, and that the Apostle turn'd people to from darkness, a poor Dunghill-Crea∣ture, and a Natural Conscience? is not this your ignorance of Christs and the Apostles Doctrine? And if Conscience stands in point of Justi∣fication or pardon of sin, hast not thou here set it up in the room of Christ and his Blood? for we say, it is Christ, that justifies and pardons sin, and his Blood, that sprinkles the Consciences from the dead works to serve the Living God. And G. F's. words will stand, which the Apo∣stle brings, Rom. 2. and that which will accuse them, or excuse them in the day, when God shall judge the secrets of all men by Jesus Christ according to my Gospel, that was that, which may be known of God, which was manifest in them, which God had shewed unto them. So, this was not a Natural Dunghill-Conscience, but it was something of the Spirit of God in them, that brought them to do the Law of God: For the Apostle saith, He is not a Jew, that is one outward; but he is a Jew that is one inward: and sets up Circumcision in the Spirit, and the Heart above that in the Letter (Rom. 1, 19. cap. 2. through∣out) And the Apostle saith, In the Beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; the same was in the Be∣ginning with God, all things were made by Him, and without Him was not any thing made that was made: And in Him was Life, and the Life was the Light of Men; and the Light shin'd in Darkness, and Darkness comprehended it not. And John said, He was not that Light, but he came for a Witness to bear Witness of that Light; and that was
the true Light, which lighteth every Man, that cometh into the World: and the Word became flesh, and dwelt amongst us, &c. Now, you bear witness against this Light, and some of you calls it a Natural Consci∣ence, and some calls it a Dunghill-Creature, and some a Created Light; and R. W. calleth it an Idol, and a mad frantick Light. And John the Divine saith, In him was Life (to wit, the Word, by which all things were made and Created) and this Life is the Light of Men; and he bore witness to it, that all Men through him might believe. And Christ saith, Believe in the Light, that you may become Children of the Light, John 1, 12, 36. and we must tell you, that this Light is the Condemnation of them that hate it, and whose Consciences are eared, and doth evil. And so, the Light of Christ Jesus is a fur∣ther thing, then Conscience, for it lets a Man see his Sin, and his Savi∣our Christ Jesus, that saves him from Sin: and they that believe in the Light, as Christ commands, are grafted in Christ, and are past from death to life, and have the Witness in themselves, as 1 John, and Rom. 11. And after Adam was condemned for Sin, and the Jews were condemned by the Law of God for their Transgression, yet Christ was promised to Adam, that the Seed of the Woman should bruise the Serpents head, that led them into Sin: which came according to the promise of God, and the Prophesies of the Prophets; and as the Apostle saith, When the fulness of time was come, God sent forth his Son made of a Woman, made under the Law, to Redeem them that were under the Law, &c. And so there is no Salvation by any other name, but by the Name of Jesus, who suffered for our sins, and rose a∣gain for our justification, Rom. 4, 25. Rom. 5. And we are justified not by the works of the Law, but by the Faith of Christ Jesus, which Faith he is the Author of, Gal. 2. and, we are justified by the Grace which comes by Jesus, Tit. 3, 7. and, we are justified by the Blood of Christ, Rom. 5, 9. And so, Christ is our Justification, Sanctification, and Redemption, Glory to his Name for ever. R. W. says, That after Abimelech's and Joseph's Conscience was justified, &c. and further he saith, Was this the pardon of Abimelech's Sin, his Justification, after the canting Language of this poor Fox? and all the Foxians that I have seen, (and I have read all that I could come at) Oh! how little do these poor Beasts seek, what infinite Justice, infi∣nite Punishment, infinite Payment is? what Conscience truly pacified is upon true pardon of Sin, and true peace of Conscience sprinkled with the Blood of that only Lamb of God Christ Jesus.
Answ. God said unto Abimelech, that he should restore unto Abra∣ham his Wife, and Abraham should pray for him, and he should live: and he did restore Abraham his Wife, and Abraham did pray for him, and God did heal Abimelech and his Family, as in Gen. 20. And thou art made to confess, that his Conscience justified him from the Fact: and this was before Christ was come in the Flesh, and Crucifi∣ed, and shed his Blood for the Sins of the world; which sprinkles the Consciences and the hearts from dead works to serve the Living God, and whose Garments are made white with the Blood of the Lamb, &c. And we having an High-priest over the House of God, Christ Jesus, let us draw near with a true heart (the Apostle saith) having our hearts sprinkled from an evil Conscience, and our bodyes washed with pure water, Heb 10, 20, 21, 22. and Elect, according to the fore∣knowledge of God the Father, through Sanctification, through the Spi∣rit unto Obedience, and sprinkling of the Blood of Jesus Christ. And we are come to Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the Blood of Sprinkling, Glory to his Name for ever: and hearken to him, who speaks from Heaven, who is our Shepheard.—But what is G. F's. or the Quakers canting Language, which thou Scoffingly calls Poor Beasts? thou hast not instanc'd it. But thou hast read our Books with an evil eye, by which thy body is full of darkness, or else thou might see, how often we mention in our Books, that Christ hath bought us with a price, which is his Blood; and how that all dyed in Adam, and how that Christ dyed for all, that they that live, might live to Him; and that all might believe in Him, who dyed for them; and if they do not, they are Condemned with the Light which they should believe in. For it is Christ, that Lighteth every Man that cometh into the world, and saith, he is the Light of the World, and is to be fol∣lowed in his Light; and thou and they that hate it, and give it other names, with it are Condemned. R. W. And then thou tell'st a story of the Indians, how they will confess, when they are falsly charged of stealing, &c. And then thou say'st, If this be all G. F. saith, he beats the Air, and hath no Enemy: and say'st, No, no, it is a Conscience, Justification within, a. Christ shedding his Blood within (in a subtil Oposition to a pardon without, from the King of Heaven, for the sake of his Son without us) and this is the business, which these Traytors to the King of Heaven aim at &c. And this their present honesty shall pay the old score of a cursed Na∣ture, and millions of Treasons and Rebellions in Omissions and Com∣missions against the God of Heaven.
Answ. Roger W. What an envious, malicious Spirit appears in thee here, and what wickedness hast thou uttered forth to the world! When did ever any one hear any of the Quakers, who confesse the Blood of Christ sprinkled in their hearts, and Christ reigning in their hearts by Faith, say this in opposition to Christ, that dyed at Jerusa∣salem, and shed his Blood there for sin, who is our Justification, Sancti∣fication, and Redemption? But this I say to thee, Thou that art a∣gainst Christ's being within his Saints, and he sprinkling their hearts with his Blood, by which they are washed, as the Apostle saith; so I say to thee, Thou art a Reprobate. And so for Traitor, and Treason, and Rebellion, &c. I say, thou may keep them to thy self, in whom reignes a Rebellious Spirit. For the Apostle bids the Corinthians Exa∣mine themselves, &c. and, Prove your own selves, how that Jesus Christ is in you, except you be Reprobates, 2 Cor. 13. now, the Apostle here did not deny Christ dying and shedding his Blood without the Gates at Jerusalem, no more then the Quakers: and thou may'st read thy Condition in Heb. 6. of such as Crucified the Son of God a∣fresh, and put him to open shame. And as for the Indians Plea, I believe many of them are more In∣nocent, than thou art, and have less to answer for at the day of Judg∣ment. And as for thy telling of G. F's. beating the Air, thou might very well applyed this at home, in whom the Prince of the Air rules, which has led thee to utter forth so many Slanders and Lyes against God's People, and Christs true followers. And if all be justi∣fied, that confess Christ dying at Jerusalem, without he be manifet within them; and yet the Apostle saith, They are Reprobates, if Christ be not within them; come R. W. how canst thou answer the Apostle here? And the Apostle saith, By one Offering Christ hath perfected for ever them that are Sanctified: and so it is Christ, that doth perfect and sanctifie, who offered up himself without the Gates of Jerusalem for Sin; who rules in the hearts of his People, Glory to God for e∣ver. And so, He it is, that hath bought us with his price, his Blood. And as for all thy Lyes and Vnsavory words, that thou hast mentioned here, indeed they are not worth mentioning: and it would be well, if thou did see thy self in that Cursed Nature thou speaks of; but thou art so full of Enmity, which blinds thy eyes, that thou cannot com∣prehend the Light, though it may shine in thy darkness. R. W.p. 4. And then thou tells us of a Story or Similitude of Q. Elizabeth; and then in thy Application thou say'st, The old Friend is Conscience, who will go with us, but can be a thousand Wit∣nesses
against us, &c. It followes then clearly, that the young Prince is the true Lord Jesus Christ, and not vanish'd away in a Light in every dark Dungeon in the world; but Conscience saith, he is literally as∣cended up into Heaven, and will as literally make his speedy return a∣gain to judgment. Answ. Here thou hast extoll'd Conscience very highly. But what will a ear'd Conscience do? will a ear'd Conscience do this? or the Jews Conscience? or all Mens Consciences in the World? or a poor Dunghill-Conscience, as J. B. speaks of? and hast not thou set up Conscience here above the Light of Christ, which lighteth every Man that cometh into the world, which Christ saith, is the Condemnation of them that hate it? — And is it not Blasphemy in thee to say, That the Light of Christ may vanish away in every dark Dungeon in the world? For as the Apostle saith, The Light, which shines in their hearts, gives them the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus: which Light is Life in Christ the Word, and by it Christ is known, and it comes from him the true Lord Jesus, who suffered and rose again, and remains in the Heavens, till all things be restored, as the Apostle saith. And as John in his Revelation (speaking of Christ) saith, Behold, I come quickly, and my reward is with me, to give to eve∣ry man according to his works. And so it is clear, that the same Christ is seen by the Light, that suffered and is risen, who will judge the world in Righteousness: and so take heed Roger, for the Judge stands at the door, Jam. 5, 9 for he will return to judge thee for all thy hard speeches. And the Apostle saith, He commanded us to Preach to the People (to wit, Christ) and to testifie, that it is he, that was ordain∣ed of God to be Judge of the quick and dead, Act. 10, 42. because he hath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in Righteous∣ness by that Man, whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given Assu∣rance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead (to wit, Christ) and we have this Assurance, Act. 17. And this Light is the condemnation of the world, of them that hate it, and do not be∣lieve in it: and this thou shalt know to thy Condemnation, though thou may'st Blasphemously call it an Idol, and say, It will vanish away. R. W. And thou say'st, that G. F. takes not the Light in the same sense his Opposite doth (to wit, J. B.) (the common trick of Cheaters;) and further saith, that I. B. (his Opposite) takes it not for the Hea∣venly Light, Sun, Moon, &c. nor the Earthly Light, nor Fire, &c. nor precious Stones, &c. nor a Metaphorical Light in Peoples minds,
differing from Beasts, &c. nor the Light of Peace and Joy &c. called in Scripture Light, &c. nor the Light of the Holy Scripture and Preaching,p. 5. and Offering of a Saviour to poor lost Sinners; but for that awakening and saving Light, convincing all Mens Conditions to be Miserable and Damnable; of Grace and Mercy offered and applyed to a Soul by the good News of a Saviour some-way heard of, and the holy Spirit, the Finger or Power of God. Answ. Here thou seems to help off thy Brother J. B. but thou hast made it worse with thy Confusion. Thou say'st, He takes it not for the Light of Peace and Joy &c. called in Scripture; nor the Preach∣ing and Offering of a Saviour to poor lost Sinners &c. and here thou mistakes thy self and J. B. For it was the true Convincing and Saving or Condemning Light, which lighteth every Man, that cometh into the world, which John came for a Witness, to bear witness unto to poor lost Sinners; and the Light which Paul turned People to from dark∣ness, that our discourse was about. And is not the Awakening and saving Light, the Light of Peace and Joy, and Prosperity called in Scripture Light? And is there any Light, but the Light of Christ, that lets people see their miserable Conditions, and their damnable state? by which Light they see their Saviour, that saves them from their Sin? and by believing in the Light, they are grafted into Christ, that dyed for their sin? And doth not the Scripture say, As the Law came by Moses, Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ; and is not that within in the heart? And thou say'st, Of Grace and Mercy applyed to a soul by the good News of a Saviour some way heard of, and the holy Spirit, and Finger, or power of God. And what must we understand from thy words here? Thou hast heard of the News of a Saviour, and the Finger or Power of God: and this must be applyed to a soul. And wilt thou come no nearer to Christ, nor his Grace, Mercy, nor the Spirit, nor the Power of God, but thy Applying? But doth not the Apostle say, He that hath not the Son of God, hath not Life? and doth not he say, If any Man hath not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his? and They that are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God? And as many as receive Christ, he gives them power to become the Sons of God? And it was Grace, that established their hearts, and seasoned their words; and it was the Grace, that was their Teacher, and brought their Salvation: And may not all the Papists, and others that thou speaks of, apply to themselves as much as thou do'st, and yet be Reprobates, and hear the News of a Saviour, &c? For first People may hear the News of a Saviour; but then to receive him, as Christ saith, He that re∣ceiveth
me, receiveth him that sent me. And John saith, He that hath the Son, hath Life; and he that hath him not, hath not Life: and then what good doth thy Applying the News of a Saviour to thy lying slan∣derous Spirit? And John saith, The Son of God is come, and hath given us an understanding; and we are in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ: and this is the true God, and Eternal Life; Glo∣ry to his Name for ever. R. W. And thou say'st, that G. F. saith, That the saving Light is in all Man-kind, only persons do not mind it; and so, Jesus Christ is Crucified and Slain in them, and God, and Christ, and Spirit, and Light, &c. are all captivated and hindred from working, yea, altoge∣ther Killed and Slain in them, because the Soul doth not mind them, and hearken to Christ in them. And then R. W. (when he has invented the aforesaid words himself) cryes; Ah poor, simple, bruitish Ima∣gination, that ever it should enter into the thoughts of Men professing to be Christians, or of Men professing to know more, then the Wolves or Foxes in the Wildernesses! Answ. Christ Lighteth every Man, that cometh into the world, with the Life in him, the word, and saith, he is the Light of the world; and saith, Believe in the Light, that ye may become Children of Light, and he that believeth, is saved, and he that doth not, is Condemn∣ed. And the Condemnation is the Light, that is come into the world; which Light is Saving to them that believe in it, and Condemning to them that do not believe in it, but hate it; whose deeds be e∣vil, &c. Joh. 3. But R. W. is a Forger of many Lyes: for where ever did he read in any of the Quakers Books, or in G. F.'s Answer to J. B. that the Quakers should say, that God, and his Spirit, and his Light, &c. and Christ (who has all power in Heaven and Earth given to him, and fits at the Right Hand of God, and dyes no more, and death has no more dominion over him) that we say, That God is Slain and Crucified, and Christ, and his Spirit, and Light is slain and Crucified, yea, altogether kill'd and slain in us, &c. and Captiva∣ted, and hindred from working; and the reason is, that the Soul doth not mind to hearken to Christ within? Now, we charge these upon R. W. to be Horrid Lyes. For Christ was Crucified according to the flesh; but the Scripture doth not say, that the Eternal God dyed, nor his Eternal Spirit. And David, when he sinned, was afraid, that God would take his holy Spirit from him: and therefore we charge R. W. with these Lyes and Slanders, which were never in our thoughts▪ And Christ saith to John (Revel. 1.) I am he that liv∣eth, and was Dead; and behold, I am alive for Evermore, and have
the Keys of Hell and Death: though we say, as the Apostle said of some, that Crucified to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put him to open shame, like R W; and as Christ says to Saul, why persecutest thou me? &c. and as Christ saith, Math. 25. I was in Prison, and na∣ked, and sick, and hungry, &c. and I say unto you, In as much as you have done it unto one of the least of my Brethren, ye have done it unto me, &c.—And as for poor, simple, bruitish Imaginations, and Men professing Christianity, or Men professing to know more, then the Wolves and Foxes in the wildernesses, These Expressions R. W. may keep at home; for it suites his own Abusive spirit the best, and not the Peo∣ple of God called Quakers. And R W. confesses, that there is some∣thing of God in the Disobedient and Reprobates: we do believe, it doth Judge him sometimes; and its like it might struggle with him, before he brought forth this Birth of Confusion. R W. Thou say'st, There is something of God, that is from the power and wisdom of God in the fallen Spirits the Devils themselves. Answ. But R W. has not proved this doctrine of his by Scripture. The Wisdom of God is gentle and pure, and the power of God, is pure and holy; and something of God is pure: Is this something of God of his divine being, wisdom, and power in the fallen Spirits the Devils R W? for thy words are, There is something of God, that is from the power and wisdom of God in the fallen Spirits the Devils themselves; but no proof from Scripture thou hast brought. For Christ said unto the Jews, Ye are of your Father the Devil, and the lusts of your Father ye will do; he was a Murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him (mark, no truth in him, to wit, the Devil) when he speaketh a lye, he speaketh of his own; for he is a Ly∣ar and the Father of it. Mark this R W. Christ saith, there is No Truth in him (to wit, the Devil) and God is the God of truth; and that which is of him, or of his power and wisdom is True; which thou say'st, There is something of God, that is from the power and wisdom of God, &c. in the fallen Spirits, and the Devils themselves (mark, in them) and Christ plainly saith, There is no truth in the Devil: Is not something of God (to wit, his power and wisdom) Truth? so do'st thou not here oppose Christ's doctrine, as well as ours? and we charge him and the N. England Priests, to make this good by Scripture. R W. And whereas thou say'st, G F. meanes God himself (pressed down as a Cart with sheaves) the holy Seed Christ Jesus (under the clods) the holy Spirit in Prison: for the Soul is a part of the Essence or being of God himself. But that there is here a word or title of colour to any of this dirt, and filth flung in the face of the Majesty of Heaven?
Ans. Here R. W. surely wants matter, when he gives his meanings to G F's words: and when he has done, he says, This dirt and filth flung in the face of the Majesty of Heaven.— R W, This is thy own dirt and filth: but in the face of the Majesty of God in Heaven thou cannot fling it; he is too high above thee, or any one else to fling so far dirt and filth in his face. Oh R W, that ever thou professing thy self to be a Christian, should'st utter forth such words! And it may be seen Amos 2, 13, how the Lord said to the transgressing Jews, I am prest under you, as a Cart is pressed, that is full of Shaves; and this was not Flinging dirt in the face of the Most High: and may not the same be said to the Christians, and to you Priests & professors in N. England that rebell against Gods Spirit, that they press it, and quench it? And doth not Christ say, I was in Prison, and ye visited me not (to wit, in his members) and what, must not these Scriptures be owned?— And doth not Christ say, he is the Seeds-man, thas Sowes the good Seed in all grounds: and is not the same Seed Sown upon the Thorny ground, &c. as well as the Good? and doth not this spring through the goo Earth, and bring forth 30, 50, &c?— And did not God breath into Man the breath of life, and he became a Living Soul, and is not that part of his breath? &c. R W. And thou say'st, This Scripture Rom. 1, 2. speaks of the works, or working of the written Law in their hearts [here thou art made to confess the truth.] But (thou say'st) What is this to the se∣cond writing, or the holy Scriptures, or writing inspired into the hearts by the most Holy Spirit? yea, or what is this to a third writing of their names in Heaven in the Lambs book of Life? and what is this to a fourth writing of the New Covenant consisting of sin, and a new heart, a heart of flesh, in which the Law was written, as formerly in tables of stone? Ans. The New Covenant doth exceed the Old; for the one was in Tables of Stone: and they had their Offerings and Sacrifices, &c. and the Priests Lips were to preserve the peoples knowledge. But Christ is come, our High-Priest, which ends the Priesthood of Aron: and so, he is the New-Covenant promised (Heb. 8) And the Lord saith, (Jer. 31, 33.) I will put my Laws in their minds, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a Peo∣ple [and this writing is with the Spirit or Finger of God.] And they shall not teach every man his Neighbour, and every man his Brother, saying, know the Lord; for all shall know me from the least to the
greatest: And I will be merciful to their Vnrighteousness, and their Sins and Iniquities I will remember no more. So, the First Covenant waxeth old, and decayes; but this is an Everlasting Covenant, the New Covenant; and Christ is an unchangable Priest, [who is holy, harmless, separate from Sinners, and made higher then the Heavens. And so they that know Christ to be their High-Priest know him to be a more greater and perfect Tabernacle, then that made with hands: & all the true believers in him can say, he is the Treasure of Wisdom and Knowledge. And such as be in Christ Jesus are New Creatures; and the old things passe away, whether they be Jewes o Gentiles. And the Church of Christ, which is in the New Covenant, the true Be∣lievers, is come to Mount Sion, and unto the City of the Living God, and to New Jerusalem, and to Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant, and to the blood of Sprinkling, &c. and to the ge∣neral Assembly, and Church of the First born, which are written in Heaven: and here the Saints did, and do know the Heavenly Genea∣logies, and their Names written in the Lambs book of Life before the foundation of the World, glory to his Name for ever. And such can say, that the Blood of Christ ends the blood of Bulls and Goates; and he, the offering, ends the offerings in the times of the Law: and so, Christ is the end of the Law for Righteousness sake to them that be∣lieve — And the work of the Law written in the hearts, which doth the work of the Law, is not opposite to the written Law; for it Judg∣ed them, that had the written Law, and did not live in it. And the Children of the New Covenant can say; If the Ministration of death written and graven in stone, was glorious, &c. how shall not the Mini∣stration of the Spirit be rather glorious? for if the Ministration of Con∣demnation be glorious, much more doth the Ministration of Righteousness exceed in glory: for even that, which was made glorious, had no glory in this respect, by reason of the glory that excells it, &c. 2 Cor. 3. So, we can praise the Lord through Jesus Christ, who is come, and has ended the Priesthood of Aaron, and his Temple and Tythes, and his Services; who said to his Discipls and Ministers, Freely ye have received, freely give. And Christ is our New and Living Way to the Father; praises be given to the Lord God for ever. And what dost thou talk of these 4. Writings, and hast No motion in Heavenly things within thee R W? —And then thou tells us of a New Covenant consisting of Sin, and a new heart, and a heart of flesh. Answ. All the Believers in the New Covenant have a new heart, and a heart of flesh; and Christ takes away the stony heart, and the Sin. And as Daniel
saith, He shall make an end of Sin, and finish transgression; and bring in Everlasting Righteousness, and make reconciliation for Iniquity, &. Dan. 9. R W. And then thou say'st; And yet we poor men of Jabesh Gilead must leave the Testimony (as Gilead imports) and suffer Nahash (the Serpent) to put out our Eyes— Answ. This is thy own Condition, if thou could'st see it: and truly R W. thou art blind enough without putting out of thy eyes. R W. And further thou say'st,—and must believe, that every man hath the New Covenant Christ Jesus, and the Kingdom of God with the Pharisees in every mans heart; and yet he never knowes of it. Answ. Nay, thou do'st not believe this. Neither do the Qua∣kers say, that every man hath Christ Jesus, the New Covenant: for them that hate the Light of Christ, hate him, the New Covenant; and do not believe, that it is he that doth enlighten them, and hath dyed for their sins without the gates of Jerusalem. And Christ saith to such; If ye do not believe, that I am he, ye shall dye in your sins: and that is a sad dying; for such are they, that hate his Light, &c. And Christ said to the Pharisees (Luk. 17.) when the Pharisees de∣manded of Christ, when the Kingdom of God should come? he an∣swered them, and said; The Kingdom of God cometh not with Observa∣tions, neither shall they say, Loe here, or Loe there; for behold, the Kingdom of God is within you. Now, says R W, the Pharisees, &c. never know of it; and therefore Christ has taught them, where to know it. But we do not read, that the Pharisees made such slighting words against Christs doctrine, as R W. doth: but we must believe Christs words before his. And we do charge R W. and his N. England Priests to make it good by Scripture A New Covenant consisting of sin. R W. And thou brings J. Bunion, who saith, It is a Counterfeiting of the new birth for men to follow the Light within, wherewith men come∣ing into the world are enlightned withal. And then R W. goes on, and sayes, There is two Opinions of the Light, and saith, it is not enlight∣ning Every man [but let him look in his Latine, how it sayes there?p. 6.] And then he saith, There is two Opinions, how Christ lighteth every man: First, as God in the Creation; Secondly, as God Man and Mediator. And again thou say'st, that it must be read in this sense, that Christ Jesus the True Light coming into the world lighteth every man, that is in the world, freely, that will re∣ceive him; even as many (whomsoever) look up to him: the stung Isra∣elites to the brazen Serpent, &c. And that the meere phrase imports no
more, then a Light held forth to all the world; as the Sun in the Heavens; and Christs followers are called by Christ the Light of the World. Answ. Why dost thou abuse the Scriptures and would'st o about to darken them with thy Meanings and Opions and thy dark Sense? For though thou take this Scripture, as it speaks [The followers of Christ are the Light of the world] yet thou would not take Johns words (chap. 1.) as he speaks them. For thou say'st, he lighteth every man &c that will receive him, even as many (whosoever) took up to him [which is true in a sense] These are thy words, and not Johns. For John saith, That was the true Light, which Lighteth every man, that cometh into the world; and the Light shines in darkness, and darkness comprehends it not; and they that hate the Light, and love darkness more then Light, and will not come to the Light, because it will reprove them, these are enlightned with the same Light, as they that loves it, John 3. But dost thou see thy own Contradiction? for thou say'st, Christ Enlightens every man, as God-man and Mediator, &c. and then thou say'st, That he enlightens every man, that will receive him, even as many as look up to him: and therefore by thy words, they that do not receive Christ, and look not up to him, are not en∣lightned by Christ. So in this thou contradicts thy self, and speaks contrary to the Apostles doctrine, who saith; That was the true Light, which lighteth every man, that cometh into the world; that in'd in darkness, and darkness comprehended it not. And therefore in thy darkness thou canst not comprehend the Light: so, for shame give over abusing the Scriptures. —And how is the World Con∣demned with the Light, if it be not enlightned? The Sun is a Light or a publick Minister to all men; except they be blind, they may see it: but Christ enlightens every man, and is the Covenant of the Light, which God hath given to be Salvation to the ends of the Earth. But they▪ that love the darkness rather then Light, it is their Con∣demnation, as before: and them that receive Christ, he giveth power to become the Sons of God. And thou say'st The ord Every man, &c. is used not Absolutely but Comparatively &c. so taken in many places. and bringst 1 Col. 28 which the Apostle speaks of; We warning e∣very man, and teaching every man in all wisdom▪ that we may present every one perfect in Christ Jesus, and say'st; which cannot Literally be true. And yet thou takest [That the followers of Christ are the Light of the world] to be literally true, and not the other: and this is thy Ignorance of the Scriptures, and the power of God. For the Apo∣stle
saith; We warning and teaching every man, &c. For did not Christ bid his Disciples Go, and Preach the Gospel in all Nations unto every Creature Matth. 28, 9. Mark. 16, 15? and wilt thou say, that this is not Literally true? thou, that lyes at home and opposes Christ and the Apostles doctrine; who warned every man, and taught every man, that they might present every man perfect in Christ Jsus? And this they laboured, and strove and travelled for, that were imper∣fect in Old Adam, to present them perfect in Christ Jesus: and the Apostles words are true and plain to the understanding of them, that hath the Spirit, that gave them forth; but not to thee. And so John's words are true (Joh. 1.) Christ enlightneth every man, &c. R W. And thou say'st; Christ as a Mediator enlightens none but the Elect: and art finding fault with the word [All] and say'st: Fox runs, &c. willingly ignorant about the word [All] And thou say'st; That Christ as a Mediator of the New Covenant enlightens none, but whom the Father gives him, unto whom he gives repentance, and opens the door of Faith and gives them to believe, &c Answ. Here still thou art in opposition to the Apostles doctrine, and Contradicts thy self. For dost not thou say a little before, How that Christ enlightens every man, as God in the Creation? 2dly. as God man and Mediator: and now thou say'st; Christ the Saviour, enligh∣tens none, but whom the Father giveth him? &c. And how now R W. what a Babilon art thou building here in thy Contradictions? but still the Apostle of Christ his words will stand over thy head, Christ is the Light of the world, and the True Light, which lighteth every man, though they hate it, and the darkness cannot comprehend it. And they that hate the Light, hate Christ the Mediator, and the New Co∣venant, from whence it comes: and they that love the Light, which Christ enlightens them with all, they Love Christ, and believe on the Light, and become Children of the Light, and come to Repen∣tance: and come to Christ their Mediator, who is their Door, and the Author and Finisher of their Faith. And such Believers in the Light, as Christ Commands, become Children of the Light, and are grafted into Christ, and suffer with Christ: and such are the Elect. And so G F. doth not Confound the Elect and the World to ether, and doth not bring in a Counterfeit New Birth, nor a Counterfeit Christ, nor a Counterfeit Salvation, as thou falsly charges; but this is thy own; and belongs to thy self, who speaks falsly of the Scriptures, and contrary to John 1. and preaches another doctrine then he hath done; which the world may believe thee, but the Elect will not.
R W. And thou say'st, All Man-kind being fall'n from God, God gve the word to Abraham, &c. and made promises both to his Natural and Spiritual Seed:p. 7. hence came the distinction of the Jews and Gentiles, &c. And then thou say'st, It pleased God to make two Bargains or Covenants, the first ws of Justice, &c. and the second was of Mercy and Pity, &c. Answ. But where dost thou read in the Scripture of Bargains? why can'st thou not keep to Scripture-Language? But here thou confesses, that the promise of God is general, both to the Spiritual and Natural Seed. The first Covenant is plainly to be understood; and so is the second with them that be the true Believers in Christ Jesus, and Children of the New Covenant: and they that dis-obeyed the Law in the Old Covenant, received punishment; and so do they that dis-obey the Gospel. For the Apostle saith, When the Lord Jesus shall be Revealed from Heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, taking Vengeance on all them that do not know God, and that obey not the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall be punished with everlasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power 2 Thes. 1. And so thou call'st the Old Covenant and New Covenant, Bargains: and yet thou'I say in another place, the Scripture is thy Rule; and yet canst not speak Scripture-terms. And then thou say'st, It is common with the holy Spirit to speak figuratively in the holy Scrip∣ture, &c. But the Spirit that gave forth the Scripture, has not called the two Covenants, as thou do'st, Two Bargains. For we know, the one Covenant is of Works, and the other is of Grace: and the A∣postle speaking of the two Covenants▪ saith, The one is from Mount Sinai, which gendereth to Bondage, &c. but Jerusalem which is above, is the Mother of us all (true Christians). Thou may'st read Gal. 4. and the Hebrews, and see there, how he describes the two Covenants better then thou can'st. R W. And thou say'st, It is one thing for God to offer this Covenant or Bargain (where-ever the sound of this Gospel or glad News comes) and another thing, to receive and embrace it, as all the Elect do; and a∣nother thing, to work freely, and give freely the Means and Power to fulfil this Covenant, as God doth by the Merits of his Son, and his own powerful working of Repentance and Belief in the hearts of all his Chosen. Answ. What! will R W. lay the fault upon God concerning all the rest of the world, that disobey his Gospel, and hate his Light, and turn his Grace into wantonness, and quench his Spirit, and make
Shipwrack of Faith and a good Conscience; and disobey the Gospel, and deny the Lord that bought them, and Crucifie to themselves the Son of God afresh? Had not these the free Gospel and Mercy of God? if not, how will God Judge the World in Righteousness by Christ Jesus according to the Gospel, which the Apostle calls the power of God, &c. Rom. 1? And how will Christ beat them with many stripes, that know the Will, and do it not? — And they are the Elect, that receive Christ; whom he has given power to become the Sons of God: and are grafted into him, and walk in him. R W. And then thou goes on, and tells of the King pardoning, and of a Bargain between two Chapmen, &c. and of a Marriage of a man and a woman,p. 8. though they be absent each from other, and may in a figurative sense be called a Bargain or Covenant, and yet not literally, and properly, as the Quakers would have their Christ to be. Answ. What dark stuff is this? For the Saints, that are Marryed to Christ by his Spirit, and receive him, they are his Sheep, that hear his Voice; and according to his promise, he will dwell in them, and walk in them. And, the Saints are grafted into him: and, Abide in me, and I in you, faith Christ, John 15. And Christ saith; I in them, and thou in me: and Father, I will, that they also, whom thou hast given me, be with me, where I am, that they may behold my Glory, which thou hast given me, John 17. And the Apostle saith, that Christ rules in their hearts by faith; and he will come and Sup with the Saints, and the Saints shall Sup with him. And the Apostle saith (Ephes. 5.) As the Husband is the Head of his Wife, so is Christ the Head of his Church: as there is a nearness in Nature, there is a near∣ness in the Spirit; and he that hath not the Spirit of Christ, is none of his. And Christ Jesus is our New Covenant, and Pasha-Lamb, our Pass-over, which has ended the Jews; and is our hope of Glory, and Mediator to God, who pardons the Sins, and blots them out: through whom we can praise God. And as for thy two Chapmen, and Bar∣gains, and absent Marriage▪ thou may'st keep at home, for they that are Marryed to Christ, do enjoy him in his Light and Spirit. R W. And whereas thou speakest of Gods Inviting gently to come to his Heavenly Wedding and Supper, &c. and the Kingdom of Heaven is taken by Force, &c. it is not him that willeth, nor runneth, but in God that sheweth mercy; and the rest he justly hardeneth, that God may be All in All. Ans. We are sensible of Gods tender Mercies to all Man-kind in his Gospel, and how he Invites to his Wedding-supper. But the Rich
Professors think, they have enough, that they have gotten by their willing and Running: but we know, it is not him that wills or runs; but the Election obtains the promise. And Jacob was the Second birth, and Esau was the first birth, hated: and let R W. look into himself, and see, if there be not the Nature of Esau and Pharaoh in him, that is hardned? And how must God be all in all, and invite them to his Supper, if he doth not enlighten All? R W. And then thou tell'st of God walking in the midst of his Cre∣ation with his two feet of Mercy and Justice; and how he wrote the Covenant of Justice in Tables of Stone, &c. and how he writes with the fingers of his Mercy and Grace his Mind and Will in the Tables of flesh, and hearts of his Chosen. And, Many offers of Bargains and Marriages are made, which never are embraced, &c. but in the New Covenant God gives a new heart to his Chosen; and gives not, and is not the Covenant to any, but his Chosen all the world over, even to the ends of the Earth. Answ. If God walketh in the mid'st of his Creation, where is it, if it be not in the mid'st of the hearts of people in his Light, doing Justice upon the Unrighteous? and if he writes his will in the Tables of the fleshly hearts, then therein they do know his will; and then that Scripture or writing must be in them, according to thy Assertion, which I question, whether thou wilt own thy own words again, or no.—And thou say'st; Many Offers of Bargains and Marriages are made, but never embraced. With what are they made? with the Spirit of God, and never Embraced?—Thou say'st; A Marriage may be between a man and a woman, when they are absent each from o∣ther. But can a Marriage be made with Christ without his Spirit, and belief in him? and he that believeth, is grafted into Christ: and he that hath not the Spirit of Christ, is none of his; and then how is he Marryed? And we know, that God hath given a New Heart to his Children in the New Covenant of Light▪ but they that hate the Light, hate the Covenant. R W. And thou say'st; It is a monstrous dream of the Quakers to say, That God, and Christ, Spirit and Covenant is in All Man∣kind. Answ. And yet thou say'st, that God is All in All. And thou say'st, God walks in the mid'st of his Creation with his two feet of Mer∣cy and Justice, and therefore I query, where it is, that God walks? whether it be not in the hearts of the Creation (to wit, his people)? and if so, who is the Monstrous Dreamer? is it not R W? And we
must tell him and them, That hate the Light of Christ, hate Christ, though he stands at their doors, and knocks. And thou abusest the Doctrine of the Prophets, and the Apostles, who say'st, Christ is not the New Covenant of Light, given to none but the Chosen, who en∣lighteneth every Man, that cometh into the world, to the Condemnation of them that hate it, and the Salvation of them that believe in it. R W. Thou say'st, It's true, if G, F. mean, that the knowledge of God in a sense is offered to each mans Conscience in the world; though more expresly and gloriously, where he sends his Messengers, Wisdoms Virgins, &c. Answ. G.F. means as he saith, according to the Scripture as he brings. But if it be profered to each mans Conscience in the world by his Messengers, is not there then the Light of Christ in the Conscience, for them to understand Wisdoms Virgins, or his Messengers, that be full of the power and Spirit of God? or else how will God judge the world in Righteousness, according to the Gospel, the power of God? And dost not thou contradict thy self here again, that say'st, He giv∣eth none the New Covenant, but to the Chosen? R W. And then thou say'st, But to say, the Covenant or Bargain, and the Mediator of a New Bargain, and the Applyer of it, the holy Spirit is in every of Man-kind, and if they will turn to it, &c. and yet persons know no such thing, nor never heard of it; and none never had it so, as to be saved by it, but these Foxians, &c. Answ. How now R W. had none never the New Covenant, but we (whom thou scornfully calls Foxians) as to be saved by it? I cannot believe thee, but that Christ sent his Disciples into all Nations to Preach the Gospel, and the New Covenant: and yet thou say'st, That none never had it so, as to be saved by it, but we? And again thou say'st, Yet persons know no such thing, nor never heard of it: and be∣fore thou say'st, That the knowledge of God in a sence is offered to each mans Conscience in the world; and what! never heard of it R W? But is not the Mediator of the New Covenant, Christ (which thou call'st New Bargain?) were not the Disciples to Preach him to all Nations, and to every Creature? who dyed for their Sins, and was risen again for their Justification; who enlightens every man that cometh into the world, that they might see him their Mediator? R W. And then thou tell'st a story of a man having fits of the Gout, and a woman having the pangs of Child-bearing; yet neither of them knowing any such matter, or how she had any such Marriage, Covenant, or Husband, &c.
Answ. And truly, thou might very well applyed this at home. And why should not every man that cometh into the world, be enlightned with Christ the New Covenant, or Bridegroom, according to John 1? And the Lord saith (speaking of Christ) I have called thee in Righte∣ousness, and I will hold thine hand, and will keep thee, and will give thee for a Covenant of the people: for a Light of the Gentiles, &c. and they that love the Light of Christ, that shines in their hearts, it will give them the knowledge of Christ their Husband, and become Children of Light, and do know, how they are Marryed to him in truth and righteousness. But they that hate this Light, which light∣eth every man, &c. they are not like to come into the New Covenant, nor to the Marriage of Christ. R W. And thou say'st, G F. cares not for the Jews, nor Gentiles, no more than the Fox careth for the Lambs and Chickens, but to make a prey of them;p. 9. though he pretends Love to all Man∣kind, and tells them, they have Christ and the New Covenant, and the Spirit within them, &c. and he means not the Covenant of works, but of grace, &c. he means that Christ, that dyed at Jerusalem, &c. but when it comes too, they mean no other Christ but a Spirit; this Spirit will be found to be an Evil Spirit, &c. (as one saith) upon them. Answ. Here thou hast published more of thy Lyes and Slanders a∣gainst us to the world, the Lord God knowes. For our Love to Jews, and our Love to Gentiles hath been manifest; and our labour in the Lord has been much for them, and to them, and to all Man∣kind, and not pretence (as thou scoffingly say'st) but in real truth. And as for Caring no more for Jews or Gentiles, than Foxes for Lambs and Chickens, to make a prey of them; and our pretences of Soul-kind∣ness to be Soul-cruelties; this R W. thou might'st have kept at home, and the New-England Priests. —And for telling all Man-kind, that they have Christ in them, &c. in this thou wrongest us. For we turn them to the Light, which Christ has enlightned them withall, that they might with it see Christ, and receive him, and come into the Cove∣nant of grace: and so we turn them, as the Apostle did, from Dark∣ness to Light, &c. And where was this Darkness? and where was this Light? for did not the Apostle, which turned both Jews and Gentiles to the Light, turn them to the Covenant of Grace? And the Lord saith; I will give thee for a Light to the Gentiles, that thou may'st be my Salvation to the ends of the Earth; and doth either Jew or Gentile know their Salvation, but by this Light of Christ? —And
where thou slightingly say'st twice, he means the New Covenant, and he means Christ that dyed at Jerusalem; and when it comes too, he means no other Christ, but a Spirit: and then thou bring'st in Humphry Nor∣ton, but bring'st no proof what he saith; therefore that is turned back upon thee. But where did'st thou ever read in any of the Quakers Books, that they said, That it was a Spirit, that dyed at Je∣rusalem, as thou say'st we mean? And then thou say'st, This will be found an Evil Spirit (as one saith, &c.) and this is thy own lying Evil Spirit, that is out of the truth: for Christ Jesus, that was born of a Virgin, the man Christ Jesus, who suffered according to the flesh, and dyed without the Gates of outward Jerusalem, and was buryed, and rose again, and sits at the Right Hand of God, and yet manifest in his People by his Spirit; is gathering us by his Spirit to his Hea∣venly Jerusalem, Glory to his Name for ever. R W. And thou say'st, That G F. slights the Scripture with a But; It is but a Declaration of the Saints Faith; and, he slights he Novelty of it, saying, There was Faith, before there was Scripture: and then thou say'st, It's wonderful, what an aking Tooth against the holy Writings of God, the old Serpent, and all the Wolves and Foxes of this world have ad, who have more or less damned and cursed it, and longed to have it out of the world. Answ. We own and esteem the Holy Scriptures of truth, which the holy Men of God were moved to give forth by the Holy Ghost; but we cannot own them to be the means and Author of our Faith: for Christ Jesus is the Author and finisher of our Faith, which is the Gift of God; as they that gave forth Scripture, said. And thy Slanderous tongue belyes us in saying, What a Tooth-ach we have against the Scripture, or the Holy Writings of God, or that we would have them out of the world, or ever cursed them, or slighted them; but we E∣steem them, and can bless the Lord for them. For the Jews had Scrip∣ture of the Old Testament, who were not in the Faith of Moses and the Prophets; and Christ bid them Search the Scriptures, for they testi∣fied of him, (Joh. 5, 39, 40.) but they would not come to him, that they might have Life, who is the Author of their Faith. But they thought to have had Life in the Scriptures, as I K. and R W. think, the Scrip∣ture is the means of Faith; and then do not you throw out, and leave off God and Christ, and holy means, and Author of Faith, &c? And doth not the Apostle bid them Look unto Jesus, the Author and Fi∣nisher of their Faith, Heb. 12, 2? and God deals to every man the mea∣sure of Faith, Rom. 12, 3. so let God and Christ have their Glory.
And had not Abraham and Enoch Faith, before the Scripture was writ∣ten? and is the Scriptures the means of Faith, or Christ? or but a De∣claration of Faith? or is it Faith it self, R W? R W. And thou say'st, The Jews, Turks, and Papists, &c. and Quakers make use of it (the Scriptures) for their ends. Answ. But why did'st thou not put in thy self, and the New-Eng∣land Priests? thou might have left out the Quakers, for thou belyest them. For do not your Priests make a trade of them for their Bel∣lies, or their own ends? for if the Priests Means were taken away, there would be little Vsing or Preaching of the Scriptures by them. But all that fear God, know that thou wrong'st us in saying, that we make use of them for our own ends; as the Lord God knows. For we prove by Scripture, that Jesus is the Christ, and Preach him freely, as the Apostles did; and have suffered Persecution, and Spoyling of Goods, and Death it self amongst you New-England Priests and Professors: and yet thou would'st have the Magistrates to Punish us, manifesting thy Birth of the Flesh, as it's said before. R W. And further thou say'st: None can rightly use it but as a Blessed Candle, Lanthorn, or Torch sent down from Heaven into this dark Dungeon of the world, to guide us out unto the saving knowledge of God, and Eternal Blessedness with him. Answ. Where doth the Apostle call the Scripture of the New-Testament, a Candle, a Lanthorn, or Torch? I say, that none can Vse the Scriptures aright, but with that Holy-Ghost, that leadeth into all the truth of them, and gave them forth through the Holy men, which received them from God, and spoke them forth, as they were moved by the Holy Ghost: and we can praise God for them, who have the com∣fort of them, and the Holy Ghost through Jesus Christ. And hast not thou here set up the Scriptures instead of Christ, for Saving know∣ledge, and a Guide, and instead of the Holy-Ghost? and the Jews which had the Scriptures, resisted him that gave the Saving know∣ledge. R W. saith: How doth this follow, that if God hath appointed the Holy Writings as means, that God and Christ are thrown out? Answ. As being the Author and Finisher of the Saints Faith, when as you make them the Means, and not God and Christ. And if the Scriptures be the Means of Faith, then what Means had Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses, before the Scripture was written, if the Scripture be the means of Faith?
R W. Thou say'st. Cannot there be a Harmony between the First, and all Subordinate Causes? Answ. Yes, if thou meanest the Scriptures of Truth. R W. And further thou say'st: Did Moses throw out God, because he took the Rod in his hand, when he wrought all those Wonders? and did Solomon, because he used so many Means in Rearing the Temple (as Moses about the Tabernacle?p. 10.) Or Samp∣son, when he used the Jaw-bone of an Ass? or Christ throw out his Father, when he made use of Clay and Spittle? Answ. Solomon's Temple, and Moses's Tabernacle, and the Jaw-bone of an Ass were not the Author and Finisher of their Faith, nor a Means of their Faith: for had not they Faith in God before? and Solomon and Moses did that, which God commanded them. And wilt thou say, that Clay and Spittle was the Author of the Faith of Christ, and none of these threw out God, or the Father, as being the Author of their Faith? for those things were done by Faith. R W. And thou say'st: O what a throwing Spirit—who toss and throw the Eternal and the Invisible God, and his only begotten Son in their wild fancies, as if they were Wool and Feathers of Lambs and Chickens, which these Foxians have devoured. Answ. As to Devouring Lambs and Chickens of Christ, thou might have kept this at home, for it's thy own work. And we must tell thee, that the Eternal Invisible God cannot be tossed; nor his only be∣gotten Son, who sits at his Right Hand, cannot be tossed at all, much less like Wool and Feathers, as thou wickedly speakest: and in this thou hast manifested, that thou hast little knowledge of God, or Christ, who say'st, They can be tossed like Feathers. And is this the Mad Doctrine of the Priests in New England? let the Reader see, if Ne∣buchadnezar, and Darius had not more Knowledge of God then R W. who saith, God may be tossed like Feathers, read Dan. 4, 3, 34. and c. 7, 14, 27. Isa. 40, 28. Psal. 41, 13. Psal. 19, 2. 1 Pet. 1, 11. 1 Tim. 6, 16. And as for thy Throwing Spirit, and Wild Fox, thou may'st keep it at home; for our desires are, that all may come to Christ, their Saviour and Salvation, and not have them devoured by such a Spirit as thine is. And thou must not think, that the Eternal God can be tossed like thy self, this is a base Language; but the Lord will rebuke thy Spirit: and it is a shame to the New-England-Priests (if they have any) to encourage this Orator in Printing this Unworthy stuff.—
And the Quakers do not deny, that the Scriptures are a Record of Hea∣ven, and a Record of the being of the Eternal Power and God-head, & of the Practice of the holy men of God, and the death and sufferings of Christ, and of the holy Men of God, &c. And is not the Scripture a Declaration of the Faith of God, and of Christ, and the holy Men of God? Luk. 1. R W. And thou say'st: For, is it not a writing, or Record of Hea∣ven? Answ. These are thy own words. For the Quakers say, The holy men of God spoke forth the Scriptures, as they were moved by the Holy Ghost: and they do believe, that the Scriptures are a True Record of the glorious works of his Creating and Forming the Earth, and the Sea, and all things therein, and of Making Man and Woman in his Image; and of the Fall of Man-kind from their glorious First State in Paradise, which, R W. saith, some talk Idly to be Every day; Roger, go and tell them of it to their faces, and not backbite them. R W. And thou say'st: Which mysteries the Quakers have only from the Scriptures. Answ. For the Apostle saith: Through Faith we understand, that the Worlds were framed by the word of God; so that things which are seen, were not made of things which do appear, Heb. 11. now, what will R W. and his Company say to the Apostle here? And we say, that the Scripture doth declare of the Promise of the Father of Mercies, and of Christ a Restorer & a Redeemer of fallen Man-kind, who is a Maker-up of the breach; and how that the Seed of the Woman should bruise the Serpents head, that made the breach. And the Scriptures are a Re∣cord of all the Travails of the Children of Israel, with all their Types and Figures, which Christ is the Substance of; who set up his wor∣ship in Spirit & in Truth above 1600. years ago, Joh. 4. And we say and believe, that the Scriptures are a True Record of Christ's fulfilling the Promise of the Father, and Prophets, and of his Birth, Life, Doctrine, Miracles, Death, Resurrection, Ascension of the Son of God, the Man Christ Jesus. And it's a true Record of the Believers in the Light of Christ, before he was Crucified, and after his Ascen∣sion; and of his glorious Church in the Primitive times, which he was the Head of. And we believe, it's a true Record of the Aposta∣cy, of such as are err'd from the Faith, and from the Spirit, and in∣wardly ravened, and become Anti-Christs, and went forth from the Apostles: and such as went in Balaam's, Cain's, and Korah's way, and became Raging waves of the Sea, casting up mire and dirt (like R W.)
spoken of in Jude; and became Gain-sayers of the Truth, and Killers about Religion, like Cain, and the New England Priests and People. And R W. &c. would have us punished: and here you appear with your Horns, like them that are spoken of in the Revelations, against the Lamb and his followers; but the Lamb will have the Victory, Glory to God for ever. And the Writing in the Revelations is a true Record of the Whore drinking the blood of the Saints, and the Beast making War with them; which Beast rise out of the Sea, and out of the Earth, and so not from Heaven: and the Beast received his power from the Dragon (and so not from God nor Christ) by which he persecutes his Saints. And of the Witnesses Rising, and of the Church's going into the Wilderness, and of the Beast taken, and the Dragon, and the false Prophet cast alive into the Lake of Fire, and of the burning up of the Whore, and of the Marriage of the Lamb; and the Everlasting Gospel Preached again to all Nations, Kindreds, Tongues, and People: and of the Heavenly Jerusalem, and of the Nations of them that are saved, shall walk in the Light of the Lamb, &c, And doth any come into this City, but by the Light of Christ? and the Scriptures are a true Record of such as are without the City, Whoremongers, Dogs, and Lyars, &c. like R W. that hath so belyed the People of God. And the Spirit, and the Bride saith, Come to this City and Tree of Life; and Let him that heareth, say, Come: let him that is a thirst, Come; and whosoever will, let him take of the wa∣ter of Life freely. And we believe all that is written in the Scriptures of Truth, and can sing Hallelujah, and praise the Lord for all his Mercies, that he hath revealed to us through his Son. And the Scrip∣ture is a true Record of the Joys of the Saints in this life, and after this life; and of the Torment of the wicked, as Christ saith, Go ye Cursed, &c. in his day of Judgment. p. 11.And thou say'st: It may be, G F. and the Quakers will say, they grant all this. Answ, Yes, and more too, which is not mentioned here. R W. Saith: I question, whether you speak bona fide and in truth, without Jesuitical Equivocations. Answ. We abhor thy words; and thou may'st keep thy Jesuitical Equivocations to thy self. For we speak the Truth, as it is in Jesus, and in the Faith, that he is the Author of: and we do believe in our hearts, that we have more Esteem for the Scriptures then thou, or any of the persecuting Priests in New-England, or their Professors. For how can you have an Esteem on the Scriptures, and be in a perse∣cuting
Birth and Spirit, which they were not in, that gave them forth. R. W. And thou say'st: What meaneth this But (The Scriptures is but a Declaration of the Saints Faith?) O blind Guides, that under∣take to guide men through the Washes upon Life and Death. And then thou tell'st a Story of K. John of England's Treasure, which thou may'st apply to thy self: and thou say'st▪ what is your But, but the Jews, and Papists, and Quakers Cry, Crucifie him, hang up Christ Jesus; burn up the Scriptures, and all Bibles, Old and New Testa∣ment, &c. Answ. Here thou rankest us amongst the Jews and Papists, who art nearer them thy self. And it is thou, that guidest People into the Washes, as thou call'st them, if thou say'st, the Scriptures are the Means of their Faith, and not Christ, who is the Author and Finisher of it: and we say, the Scripture is a Declaration of the Saints Faith, (and not the Means, and Author, and giver of their Faith) and how they received it; though the Scriptures declare of many more things then the Saints Faith, both of God and Christ, &c. which the Saints be∣lieved. And we abhor thy words in saying, That we Cry, Crucifie Christ, or hang him up, burn the Scriptures, and all the Bibles, the Old and new Testament; We abhor thy thoughts and thy words. The Lord of Heaven knows, that we have an Esteem of the Scriptures, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, and have bowed to his Name, and can say, There is not Salvation by any other Name under the whole Hea∣ven, but by the Name of Jesus, who hath bought us with a price, his Blood: who is alive again, and lives for Evermore, and is ascended above all at the Right Hand of God, too high for you to Crucifie, or hang him up; though you may Crucifie him in his Members, and to your selves afresh, as the New-England Professors have done. But we Challenge R. W. and the New-England Priests, to prove it by Scripture, that Christ can be Crucified and Hanged up again: and whether this be not contrary to Scripture, which saith, He is alive again, and liveth for evermore? R. W. And whereas thou say'st, what is the Saints Faith? you ac∣knowledge none, but the Faith of the wild Souls, called Quakers, &c. Answ We acknowledge the Faith, which Jesus Christ is the Au∣thor and Finisher of, and contend for it, which purifies our hearts, and is our Victory: in which we plese God, which gives us access to God.
R. W. We poor Jews, and Papists, and Protestants, though we own the Scripturs, some a part, and the rest all; yet we are all but Infidels, Devils, &c. Answ. The more is the pity: but take heed Roger, lest thou be not wilfully so. And what! do the poor Jews and Papists own the Scip∣tures? and before thou said'st, The Jews and Papists, &c. cryed, burn up the Scriptures, and all the Bible of the Old and New Testament, and yet Own the Scriptures some a part, &c? Here Roger gives himself the Lye in his Contradictions. R. W. And thou say'st again: What is this Saints Faith? this Fox's and the Quakers Faith? is it any thing else, but a meer Babel and Confusion of God and Faith, Christ and Faith, Spirit and Faith, Light and Faith, Justification and Faith, Sanctification and Faith, Salvati∣on & Faith, &c. and this is in every one of Man-kind in the world, if they will believe it? Answ. Thou hast made a Babel here, and say'st, it's the Quakers; but it is thy own: and thou art a Scoffer at the Saints Faith, which Christ is the Author of. And none knoweth Christ, nor their Sancti∣fication, nor their Justification, nor their Salvation, but by believing in the Light of Christ Jesus, who is the Author and Finisher of their Faith: and the Quakers do say; Such as hate the Light of Christ, which they should believe in, they hate their Sanctification, and Justi∣fication, and Salvation, and Christ, the Author and Finisher of the Saints Faith. So, thou speakest falsly of us, if thou say'st, that we say, It is in all Man-kind: for they that hate the Light, receive not Christ the Author and Finisher of their Faith. R. W. And thou say'st, Neither Abraham, nor any Man had Faith, before it pleased the Eternal and Invisible Deity to disclose himself by Word, or Sight, or Dream, or Motion, &c. at several times it pleased him to spek, and last of all by the Best and Clearest of all, his only Begotten Christ Jesus. Answ. So thou do'st acknowledge, they had Faith from God, be∣fore the Scripture was written. And thou do'st grant, that they had Motions, Sights, and Dreams then; is not God the same now, who speaks by his Son, whom the Saints are to look unto for the Author and Finisher of their Faith?R. W's. Contra∣diction: and the Saints had Faith before Scripture was. and if the Scripture be the Means, they are to look to the Scripture. For the Apostle saith, The Righteousness of God is revealed from Faith to Faith: so, can'st thou know Gods Righ∣teousness or Faith without Revelation? But hath God spoken to thee by his Son? hast thou heard his Voyce Im∣mediately
from Heaven? and yet thou say'st afore, That the Scrip∣ture was the ground of Christs and the Saints Faith. R.W. And thou say'st, When it pleased the Incomprehensible Majesty to command his appearances by Words, Visions and Dreams, &c. to be written to stnd upon Record (for all Generations) shall we be such Fools and Franticks, as to say, It was his word, when God spake it to and in his Prophets;p. 12. but now it is written, it is but Pen, Ink, and Paper, it is now but a dead Letter; it is not Gods Word, God hath but One Word, Christ, and the Scriptures are his words? Oh the Audacious blockishness of the foul Spirit in these wild, mad fan∣cies of the Quakers. Answ. Is not God the same now? do not his Young men see Visions, and his Old men dream Dreams? and his Sons and Daughters Prophe∣sie, as in Joel and Acts? And when Moses Recorded, what God had reveal'd to Abraham and others by Visions and Dreams, and said, (Exod. 20.) God spake all these Words; and do'st thou say, Moses was Audacious and blockish, and a wild mad fancy, because he did not call them the Word of God, but words? And Jerem. 35, 13. Hearken to my Words, saith the Lord; Isa. 51, 16. I will put my Words in thy mouth, Jer. 5, 14. I will make my Words in thy mouth Fire: and Mark 10, 24. The Disciples were astonished at Christs Words: Luk. 24, 8. and the Believers remembred the Words of the Lord: and Christ saith, Vnto every man that heareth the Words of this Prophesie, if any man shall take away from the Words of this Book. So, were all these Auda∣cious and blockish, in a foul Spirit, and a mad, wild fancy, that called them words, and not the Word? For the Scripture saith, In the Begin∣ning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and God was the Word: and Christ his Name is called the Word of God, Joh. 1. Rev. 19. therefore let God and Christ have their Due, and the Scriptures have its due, which are recorded by the holy men of God, and are profi∣table, &c. And the Saints that have Christ, have the comfort of them. And doth not the Apostle say, That they were made able Ministers not of the Letter, but of the Spirit; for the Letter killeth, but the Spirit, giveth Life? and doth not the Apostle say, If the Ministration of Death written & graven in stones, &c. and further the Apostle saith, For as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the Epistles of Christ, written not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the Living God, not in Tables of Stone, but in the eshly Tables of the heart? and dost thou call those Blockish Expressions, which we have often used? Poor man, thou knowest little of the Saints Conditions. And we have an Esteem of the Scriptures: blessed be the Lord for all his Mercies.
R. W. And thou say'st, They dare not (though what dares not thei Hellish Spirit against the King of Heaven, &c?) and many words thou usest to prove the Scriptures to be the words; and usest the Kings Name and Declarations, &c: and then thou say'st, The bottom, and the truth is, the Spirit by which the Quakers are acted, would be glad, that there were not such a Person called the Word of God, nor such a writing, declaring so sweetly, so plainly, so fully, and so Heavenly of him. Answ. These be all Lyes of thy own forging. And as for Hellish Spirit against the King of Heaven, it's within thy own breast: for we can praise the King of Heaven, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, and own the Person of Christ by the Spirit of Christ, that he hath given us as fully and plainly, and as Heavenly as the Scriptures declare him; whose Name is called the Word of God, but not the Scriptures, Rev. 19. And we are built upon him, who was the Foun∣dation of the Prophets and Apostles, and all Believers; praises to the Lord for ever. R. W. And thou say'st: G. F. is in his burrough of the various sense of the word Form. Answ. Because G. F. saith [The Apostles work was to bring Peo∣ple off the Form (to wit, the Jews) to the Substance Christ, and they that keep People in the Form without the power, was an Error, and was not in the Apostles work] Which is true. And as for thy vari∣ous sense of the word Form, which hath respect to Nature, to Arts, to Civil, Natural and Divine matters, G. F. mentions not such things: and the Apostle would have them to live in the power of the Form of Divine Matters. R. W. And thou say'st, Shall I now (like a Fool, or a Mad Man) cry down all Natural, Civil and Divine beings? are not all the Inter∣nal and External Forms, Shapes, and Beings of the Creation in Hea∣ven, and Earth, and Sea, of Angels, Sun and Moon, Men, Birds, Beasts and Fishes, &c. glorious—? Answ. Doth G. F. cry down any of these Forms or Shapes? I say, thou art a Mad Man, if thou do'st. And what is all this to the A∣postle's saying, who saith, Having the Form of Godliness, but deny∣ing the Power, from such turn away; that they might live in the Sub∣stance Christ Jesus. And yet the Form of Godliness the Apostle doth not bid them turn away from. R. W. Thou say'st, G. F. runs to the Picture, or Forms of these forms, and saith Childishly, That the Form or Picture without the Life is nothing. And then thou say'st, Who knoweth not that?
Answ. And then thou hast answered thyself Childishly, as thou Scoffingly confesses. But doth G. F. mention Picture in his Answer? R. W. Thou say'st: But to come to worship, was there not a Form, or manner of Circumcision? the Pass-over? the Tabernacle? the Temple? Answ. Yes, among the Jews. But do'st thou follow that Form? and must the Christians follow that Form, or Christ? and doth not the Apostle say: If you be Circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing Gal. 5? and is not the Jews Temple and Tabernacle abolished by Christ? R. W. And whereas thou say'st: Did ever the Servants of God, when they inveighed against the Customarines, the Carelesness, the Pictures, and the meer formality of the worshippers (Jews or Christians) inveigh against the worship it self, and the Appointments of God, and of his Son Jesus Christ? Answ. The true Prophets judged the Jews, when they lived in the Form without the Power, and told them, their Service was no more then Cutting off a Dogs neck: though the Prophets owned their wor∣ship, till Christ came. And then the Believers in Christ denyed the Jews worship, and Altars (which they offered upon) when Christ was offered up once for all: and denyed the Circumcision; though it was death to a man, that was not Circumcised among the Jews. And they that have the Form of Christianity, and deny the power, though they turn away from them, they do not turn away from Christ Jesus, nor from the worship, which Christ hath set up in Spirit and in Truth; nor from the Christians Form of Godliness. And it was the Labour of Gods Servants, to bring People to the worship of God it self; and to bring them off their dead and meer formalizing of them without the power, and their Pictures. R. W. And thou say'st: What a shameless falshood is it, that any of Gods Messengers brought Gods people off from those Heavenly Fabricks,p. 13 which God erected by their Ministry, or Service all the world over. Answ. Those Services and Offerings in the time of the Law, it was no Shame nor falshood to bring them off them to Christ the substance. And it is no Shame nor Falshood to turn away from them, that have the Form of Godliness, and deny the power now among Christians, as the Apostle commandeth. R. W. And thou say'st: May not Gods Messengers now cry out a∣gainst the Apish Imitations, and the Formalities of the Papists (so hor∣ribly
and bloodily) abusing Prayer, and Preaching, and Baptisme, and the Lords Supper, &c. but like the Assyrians or Babilonians, all these Christian Appointments must be broken and tumbled down with Axes and Hammers, &c. Answ. The Axes and Hammers, as thou speakest of, are the New-England Priests and Professors Weapons, with their Whips and Goales, and Gallowses. For, have the Papists been more bloody in this Age, then you have been? or the Babilonians? or Assyrians? and though you cry against the Papists, yet you use their Weapons, which you call Apish Imitations and Formalities. But God's Messengers Wea∣pons are Spiritual, who declare against the vain Formalities either in Prayer or Preaching: yet they own the true Preachers (which are a∣ble Ministers in the Spirit) and true Prayng in the Spirit; and the One Baptisme, Ephes. 4. And as the Apostle saith to the Corinthians, They were Baptized by one Spirit into one body, 1 Cor. 12, 13. R. W. And thou say'st: This is Treason and Rebellion in any A∣theists, or whomsoever; but more abominable Hypocritical in these Pha∣risaical Quakers, who cry out against the Apish Imitatours, and yet themselves practise Preaching, Praying, Congregations, Singings, Conventings, and Addings to, Castings out, &c. full well (as the Lord Jesus speaks) abrogating the word and appointments of God, that they may set up and establish their own Traditions, &c. Answ. Thou hast not told the Reader, what our Traditions are? which Christ told the Jews. But here of all thy Abusive Expressions we are clear of, thy Treason and Rebellion, and abominble Hypocri∣tical and Pharisaical; which words suit thy own Spirit, and thou may'st apply them at home. And our Religion and Way, and Preach∣ing and Praying, and Singing is according to Scripture: and we are gathered in the Name of Jesus Christ, where we find him in the mid'st of us a Prophet, a Priest, and a Bishop, and a King to rule in our hearts; who exerciseth his Offices in his Church. And if any pro∣fesses the Truth, and doth not walk in it, such we deny: and the Believers are Added to Christs Church daily, praised be the Lord. And why dost thou, and you Priests of New-England separate your selves from the Papists, and call her the bloody Whore of Rome, when you are found in her Spirit, and not in the Spirit of the First Primi∣tive Christians? R. W. And whereas thou say'st: G. F. crys out against all Scrip∣tures and common Sense, and against all Forms. Answ. These are more of thy Vntruths. For he owns all Holy
Scripture, and doth not cry against all Forms: but such as have the Form of Godliness, and deny the power, turn away from such. And he, and the Quakers own God's ways, and manners of Gods worship in Spirit and Truth. R. W. And thou say'st, G. F. cryes up a Christ within, a Scripture within, and a Church within, and Ministers within, and Baptism and Supper within, yet practises the most of these (so many as their Idol re∣quires, & will serve his turn) as outwardly & visibly, as any in the world. Answ. Is not Baptism of the Spirit within, that burneth up the Chaff within? how dark art thou! and have not the Ministers of the Spirit the Spirit within? And doth not the Apostle Preach Christ within the Saints? and doth not Christ say: I stand at the door, & knock, and if any man will hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will Sup with him, and he with me, Revel. 3? But where did ever the Quakers say in any of their books, that the Church or Congregation was within them? and these are thy own forged words, not ours: and is not the Spirit and the Truth within, in which God is worshipped? R. W. After thou hast commended R. Baxtr, our old Persecutor, thou say'st: It hath been his Observation (viz.) that the Churches of the Independents and Baptists have been the source and spring, whence have flown the Generation of the Quakers. And then thou contradicts him, and say'st; For my self I have observed the contrary in these parts. Answ. Nay, the Quakers spring is from that Fountain of Life, which the Primitive Church was in, Glory to the Lord God for ever! who are built upon the Rock and Foundation Christ Jesus. And R. W. do'st thou say, That the Quakers sprung from the Ranters and Grindletonians? what Babel is this! R. W. And whereas thou say'st: Although some rotten Professors, or weak souls, though true, have been bewitched by these Soul-Witches,p. 14. yet generally (where they have any Liberty) the Na∣tional Church fills up their numbers. Answ Here thou judgest others as well as the Quakers: but it is best to pply it to thy own Spirit, and to see thy self first, and your own Rotten profession at home. And where they have any Liberty, thou say'st; but we know thy Spirit, and the New-England Priests and Professors, that call Light Darkness, and persecute the Truth: that is it, you would not have to Have Liberty, and call it the Soul-witches; and therefore the Soul-witches thou may apply at home. R. W. And thou say'st: W. Edmonson boasted of their Numbers
(viz.) their Religion is so Easi, never coming near the Roots of Rotten Nature; but so wonderfully agreing with it, and changing one Devil for another. Answ. If the Quakers have Changed one Devil for another, as thou say'st, they are changed from your Religion of New-England, and them that upheld it, and from thee; then thou do'st acknowledge, that thou and the New-England Profession was a Devil, and the Inde∣pendents, and the Baptists according to Baxter: but thy Fore fathers the Jews said, That Christ Jesus (our Lord and Master, whom we are Changed to) that he had a Devil, and by the Prince of Devils cast out Devils. And as for the Roots of Rotten Nature, that thou and you may apply to your selves, which your Religion is made up of, which thou would'st accuse the People of God withall, which are in the pure Religion, James 1, 26, 27. but thou hast manifested thy Re∣ligion with thy Unbridled Tongue. And W. Edm. did not boast of our Numbers, for that is the Abuses of thy Tongue: but we can praise the Lord through Jesus Christ, who adds to his Church daily. R. W. And then thou say'st, Thou adorest the Infinite power, &c. that they were not ten thousand-fold more, &c. then they are: and then thou say'st, I can demonstrate, that if G. F. (for all their Hypo∣critical prating against Carnal Weapons) get a Sword (as Mahomet did) most of the Popish and Protestant and Pagan-world will easily be brought to dance after him. Answ. This is from thy Evil Thoughts, and Cains Fear; G. F. and the Quakers abhor thy words. But this is your Condition in New-Eng∣land; and because the People of God will not dance after them, there∣fore they have Hanged them, and Banished them, and Spoiled their goods. For the Lord and his Son knoweth, that Our Weapons are Spiritual, that he hath armed us withall: and if ever thou had'st set foot in the pure Religion, which the Primitive Church and the Qua∣kers walked and walk in, thou would'st not say, It is so easie. But thou speakest Evil of that which thou knowest not, and utterest forth the malice and envy of thy heart. And we do pray to the Father to send forth Labourers into his Vineyard; and that is his Work and not Mens: and can praise the Lord at the Conversion of Sinners. And as for Hypocritical prating, that is thy own. R. W. And thou say'st to M. B. Was there ever a Child of God in this world, but he was a Nazarite, separate from worldly persons, &c. as he comes to see them, and endureth not, that the Evil One should touch him?
Answ. If this were your Faith and Practise both of New-England, and all our Old Persecutors, then we should be One with you. But have not all our Opposites both here and in New-England persecuted us for worldly Maintenances, which Christ nor his Apostles never did; who said, Freely ye have received, freely give? And if you could not endure the Evil One to touch you, then you would be a People free from sin. R. W. And then thou makest a great Ramble, and call'st it Consi∣derations touching the Seperate Churches: and say'st, Hath not Gods Jealousie raged against the Jewish Whore-mongers, who defiled his first Bed? and will he wink at the Christian-Adulterers and Adulteresses ei∣ther in worship or Conversation? Answ. Nay: therefore hath the Lord sent forth his Servants to bid you Repent; whom you have persecuted: for you are fallen from the Tenderness you were in at first, that the Lord knoweth. R. W. Thou say'st: With what Conscience can I (a National Pro∣testant) separate from my Father the Pope, or my Mother the Church of Rome, and my Brethren and Sisters the Papists, &c. and yet must not be a Christian for other Souls to see further degrees of that Separa∣tion necessary; I must bring up the foot of every mans Light, Sight and Conscience to my last. Answ. Here thou acknowledgest The Pope to be thy Father, and the Church of Rome to be thy Mother, and not the Primitive Church or Jerusalem that is above, which is the Mother of us all: but thou would'st bring all to thy dark Last; and so would every persecuting Spirit, and dark Conscience. And why do you talk of Separating from your Mother or Father the Pope, when you are found in their Spirit? but the Quakers would have every Man and Woman to turn to the Grace and Light of Christ Jesus, and not bring them into a Form with∣out the power, as your New-England Professors have done. And we labour to bring all People to Christ Jesus; and if thou callest him the Last, thou hast given him a New Name: but the New-England Priests bring People to their Last and dark Conscience, as is manifest. R. W. Thou say'st: This is my main ground of my Controversy with the proud Quakers in themselves, and condemn others. Answ This is false: for we tell them, the Light is their Con∣demnation that hate it. But we must walk in the Light, as Christ Commands, who hath enlightened us; by which Light we see you, where we have left you. R. W. And thou say'st: But they magnifie (with the Papists and Ar∣minians)
Cursed rotten Nature, their Converts and Prose∣lytes have but a painted,p. 15. Formal Repentance, Faith, &c. only if they can come to their Church, and Thou and Thee, and dis∣respect all Superiors, then are they high Saints, and cannot sin. Answ. All these be Lyes, and it's thy own Condition. And as for the Papists and Arminians, they may answer for themselves: for Re∣pentance, which is a Returning from Sin to the Lord, is not Formal, and the Faith, which Jesus Christ is the Author and Finisher of. And we do not say, Such as can say Thee and Thou, are free from Sin; neither do we say, that they are High Saints, that dis-respect all Superi∣ours: for we say as the Apostle said, We must honour all men; and, They that rule, are worthy of double honour. And we do challenge thee, and all the Priests in New-England, and all our Opposites that thou hast quoted, to shew us, Where ever Christ or his Apostles for men to keep on their Hats, and say Thee and Thou to them, dishonoured them, and dis-respected Superiors? so, the ground of thy Controversie is false. And whether that is the Honour and the Respect, that they must shew to all men, and to Superiors, as to say You to a single Per∣son, and put off his Hat to him? and whether this be the Honour from above? and whether the Honour the Pharisees looked for, was not some Outward Gesture, so distinguished from the Christians Ho∣nour? — And as for Converts of Cursed Rotten Nature, thou might have kept that at home; for the Converts that we own, are such as are turned from Darkness to Light, and from the power of Satan to God. R. W. And whereas thou say'st: This was the Heavenly principle of those many precious gallant Worthies, the Leaders and Corner-Stones of New-England, they desired to worship God in purity, according to those perswasions in their Consciences, which they believed God had light∣ed up. Answ. Here thou flatterest New-England Persecutors, who have drunken the Blood of Gods People, Whipt, Banished, and Spoiled their goods, because they would not follow their Bloody Spirits Wor∣ship out of Truth: for thou might have said as much for the Spirit of the Church of Rome. For the Professors of New-England have lost their Tenderness, that was first in them, and despised that Birth∣right, Esau-like; and their Written and Printed Laws against the People of God are abhorred, and make their Names stink in Europe, yea, and in America. For thou wilt confess, the Devil is a Murderer, and Christ is a Saviour, and did not come to destroy mens Lives, but to save them: and therefore it is manifest, whose Work thy Gallant
Worthies and Leaders have done, and Thou, who art joyned in a Con∣federacy against God's People, uttering sorth thy Lyes against them in a peaceable Government, where thou hast not power to Persecute them. R. W. And thou say'st; They desired such for their Fellow-wor∣shippers, as they (upon a Christian Account) could have evidence of to be true and real Worshippers of God in Spirit and Truth also. Answ. The New-England-worshippers, and the Joyners with them, their Practice Evidenceth them in their Persecution not to be in God's Spirit nor his Truth. R. W. And thou bringest Priest E. B's. words, which saith [The Spirit of God doth not teach to judge before the time] and others say [Saints shall not judge, while they be upon the Earth.] And G. F. An∣swering saith, [But the Spirit did teach the Apostle to Judge, and his Time was come; and he told some that they were of Old ordained for Condemnation, their Damnation slumbred not: and then it was their time to Judge.] And because the Printer mistook, and put in [high] for [their] and [not] which should not have been in, but [then] which was the Printers mistake, therefore thou cryest Non-sense, &c. But (thou say'st) to the point: The great Jugler hath taught G. F. and his Foxi∣ans to out-face Death and Judgment, to keep the great Sessions, and call all the world to their Bar and Judgment. Answ. Let the Reader see, if there be any such words in G. F's. Answer? but repeating of the Apostles words, that makes him to break out into such an Outrage and Gust (as he calls it.) Therefore was the Apostle a Cheat, or a Jugler, and out faced Death and Judgment, &c. because the Spirit of God did teach him to Judge as before? And as for his terming of us like Mugleton with his Curses; when a little be∣fore in the same page he saith, A Cursed Rotten Nature are the Qua∣kers Converts: and art not thou of the same Spirit as Reeve and Muleton, who have been as great Enemies to the Quakers, as thou art? R. W. And thou say'st: It's true, there is a Lawful judging, not ac∣cording to the rashness, or pride (as the Quakers is) but according to the righteous Judgment. And say'st, The Spiritual man judgeth and discerneth all things, that looketh into the Cause and Nature of things, Times and Persons: but what is this to the Natural Death of all Man∣kind? Answ. Reader, hath G. F. mentioned any thing but the Apostles words? doth he mention the Natural Death of all Man-kind? or
shewed any Rash Judgment here? or called the World before the Bar of Judgment, as R. W. saith, who hath puft out a great deal of Air a∣bout it, and when he has done, he beats it? But it seemeth he grants, That the Spiritual Man judgeth and discerneth all things (but who it is, and where he judgeth, he hath not manifested or declared) and yet he findeth fault with G. F. for saying so (page 80.) And as for Pride and Rash Judgment, he might have kept that at home, and not applyed it to the Quakers. And the Apostle said, O Death where is thy Sting? O Grave, where is thy Victory? the Sting of Death is Sin, and the strength of Sin is the Law: but thanks be to God, who hath given us the Victory through Jesus Christ. R. W. And thou say'st: I know, the Foxians will turn this Scripture,p. 16. and that Golden Chain, Heb. 6. the first Christian principles and Eternal Judgment into Mysteries. Answ. Here again thou wrong'st us. For we own Heb. 6 as it speaketh; and we do believe, they are Mysteries to thy Lying Spirit. For sometimes thou say'st, we take them literally; and now thou say'st we turn them into Mysteries: thus thou Contradicts thy self. R. W. And that they now judge the secrets of Men by Paul's Gospel, Rom. 2. Answ. Is there any such word in G. F's. Answer to E. B. Priest? For the Apostles words are, In the day, when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ, according to my Gospel: and this thou wick∣edly applyest to the Quakers out of thy dark, airy mind, and then thou beatest the air. R. W. And thou say'st, Therefore by looking on a man (to wit, the Quakers) they can discern the Inward parts, what each person is. Answ. The least Child of God may easily discern, what thou art, by what cometh out of thee, what is in thy Inward parts. And doth R. W. think, that the Saints did not know one anothers hearts, when they were of One heart, mind, and soul, &c? and were the Epistles of Christ, &c. written not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the living God in fleshly Tables of the heart? &c. and God that given his Church a Discerning with the same Spirit in our day, as he did in the Apostles. R. W. And thou say'st: The Lord is no come (saith Enoch, and Jude) in Ten Thousand of his Saints; and now is the day appointed, in which God judgeth the world by that Man Christ Jesus [which Man they are] of which the Word of God hath approved, in that they are raised from the dead in souls and bodies to keep the Eternal Judg∣ment: though thou say'st, some of their young Schollars will not be∣lieve
it; but they spare not to own their High Court of Justice. Answ. Where did'st thou ever read in any of the Quakers Books any such Language, that say, the Quakers are the Man Christ Jesus? this is thy Forgery: for let the Reder see if there be any such word in G. F's. Answer to E. Bradshaw in thy 15th page? And thou say'st, They are the Man Christ Jesus (to wit, the Quakers) but hast shewed no proof for it: but how canst thou make the Saints to be the Man Christ Jesus? Yet for all thy Lyes we cannot deny, that Christ is in us. and has quickned us, which were dead in Sins and Trespasses (as Ephes. 2.) and Christ quickning our mortal bodies by his Spirit, that dwelleth in us, Rom. 8. and by his Spirit we can judge of such a Spirit as thine is, by its fruits; whose Spirit is Eternal, which we received from Christ, which thou Scoffingly callest High Court of Justice. And Christ that ruleth in the hearts of his Saints, he giveth them a Judg∣ment and Discerning to forsake the Evil, and cleave to the Good. R. W. And then thou tells a Tale in Hartfordshire, and termest us, Like a Company of Drunken Sots, that kept a Court there, and had like to have brought themselves to the Gallowes. Answ. But this may sute thine own and the New England Spirits best, that have been Drunk with the Blood of the Saints: the Quakers are clear from thy Lyes and Slanders, and they do not touch them. And thou shalt know Christ coming to Judgment; who will reward thee according to thy works. R. W. Thou say'st, That the Quakers confess, that Christ was a Real Man, as any of us, &c. and thou say'st, They could not give an account, what was become of him, at Newport. Answ. There are more of thy Lyes. For we tell thee, as we told thee, He is risen, and at the Right Hand of God, Luk. 22, 6, 9. Act. 2, 25, 23. Act. 5, 31. Act. 7, 35, 36. Rom. 8, 34. Ephes. 1, 20. Col. 3, 1. Heb. 1, 3, 13. Heb. 8, 1. Heb. 10, 12. 1 Pet. 3, 22. and if thou wilt not believe those Scriptures, thou wilt not believe us, where the Man Christ Jesus is: and yet Christ ruleth in the hearts of his Saints; and this is a Mystery to thee. And it's like he is not Come unto thee; for how should he? when thou art so Ignorant of his Light, which he ligheth every Man that cometh into the world withal: for how can any come to Repentance and be Converted, and hate the Heavenly Light of Christ? R. W. And then thou runs on, and hast proved nothing, and say'st, That their Pride, Scornfulness, rash Revilings, rash Cursings, Supersti∣tion, new Inventions, their Blasphemies and Hypocrisies, Inhumanities, Impudencies, &c. are such—
Answ. This R. W. and his Fellow-Priests might have kept at home; for he hath made a great Noise with words, but nothing sig∣nified. Did not the Patience of the Lambs of Christ manifest other∣wise, when they Hanged them, and Burned them, and Cut off their Ears, and Whip'd and Banish'd them? did they not suffer like Lambs? What was their Reviling Languages? why did'st not thou and the Priests of Boston Print them? for if they had Reviled, it's like we should have heard of it before now. R. W. And thou say'st:—such, that render them so far from be∣ing the High Saints and Judges of the World, that they fall under the Judgment of all sober and modest persons. Answ. Nay Roger, they must be such as thou and the New-England Professors are, that Judge us and not the Modest nor Sober persons neither in Old England nor New: and thy Judgment and the Perse∣cutors Judgment toucheth us not. And the Apostle tells thee, The Saints shall Judge the World. 1 Cor. 6, 3. R. W. [On G. F's. Answer to T. C.] If God please to appoint the Words the Apostles used, to be still the Means of Con∣version to the end of the World,p. 17. that then he hath thrown out himself? &c. Answ. What! can any come to Conversion with the words of the Apostles without the Spirit? may not all the Wolves in the World, false Prophets and Anti-Christs get the Sheeps-Cloathing on the Out∣side, and use their tongue and say: Thus saith the Lord and the Apo∣stle? like R. W. and those that would have cast out Devils in Christ's and Paul's Name? But doth not the Apostle say, He that hath not the Spirit of Christ, is none of his, Rom. 8, 9. and therefore how can any Convert any person with the Apostles words, and they having not the Spirit of Christ are none of his? I confess, R. W. and the New-England-Priests may bring them into a Form without the power; from such People are to turn away, as the Apostle saith to Timothy. R. W. Thou say'st; Is not this God's Covenant with Christ and all Christians, that his Word and Spirit should be in their Mouths to all Generations? Wo be to all these wild, frantick Inferences, which disjoyn and separate, what the Most-powerful and Wise and Holy hath joyn∣ed together. Answ. We witness, that the Word and Spirit was, and is, and shall be in the mouths and hearts (which thou hast left out, and can'st not endure to hear of it there) of all true Christians to all Generations; but what is this to Convert People with a Means without the Spirit
and the power of Christ in their hearts to Salvation? But thou think∣est to joyn the holy Men of God's words with thy dark Spirit, which were not given forth from it: and wild frantick Inferences thou may'st keep at home. And we do not Dis-joyn the Word, nor the Spirit from the Scriptures; for it will own its own Words, and hath Unity with them, as thou falsly chargest us to Dis-joyn or separate: and all your Converting of people with the Saints words without the Spi∣rit of Christ in their hearts, is but to make Proselites like Parishes. R. W. And thou say'st: May there not be many Agents imployed by one glorious Efficient? as in Moses building the Tabernacle, &c. and A∣braham sending his Servant to Espouse a Bride to his Son, &c. Doth not rather this mad Soul throw out Abraham and Solomon, &c. yea his own brains (in a mad, proud frolick) all over-board together? Answ. Because Moses builded the Tabernacle, and Solomon build∣ed the Temple, and Abraham did such and such things, and Circum∣cised, therefore must all Christians do the same? yea, and without the Spirit, as Moses, and Abraham and Solomon was in? and thou that art without this Spirit, that they were in, art in thy Mad frolicks thou speakest of, and Throwest thy own Brains over-board, and not the Quakers, that would have people to be led with the Spirit of Christ to Conversion; who is the End of Solomn's Temple, and Moses Tabernacle, and maketh his People his Temple, &c. R. W. And as for that of Paul telling the Corinthians, that they were Gods Husbandry and Building, &c. and as thou say'st, That Paul was a prime Husband-man, and a Master-builder, &c. and that they were Messengers, and Co-workers, and Labourers together with God. Answ. We know this; but it was not without the Spirit of Christ: this was not Saul, when he was a Literal Professor, like you. R. W. And Paul Preaching, the Lord opened Lydia's heart; and Philip Preaching, and the Lord opened the Eunuch's heart: and thou quotest John 14. for Barnabas, that a great Multitude of Jews and Greeks believed. Answ. What is all this to the purpose? All that have been, are, or shall be Converted since the Gospel's Ministration, are Converted by the Apostle's Words without his Spirit, as thou seemest to say, are they? for we know, that Philip, Paul and Barnabas were in the power and Spirit of God, and able Ministers of the Spirit. And thou bringest John 14. and Barnabas, that A great Multitude, both of Jews and Greeks believed; and there is no such saying in John 14. for if G. F. had done so, thou would'st have cryed, Lame, Silly and
Non-sense; but if the Fault was in the Printer, we have so much Charity as to over-look it. And then thou say'st; The Lord opened Lydia's heart: Then it is not the Apostles words without the Spirit. And then thou bringest Paul planting, Apollo watering; which we do believe, with the Spirit of God, and wrought those Miracles by the power of Jesus: but what is this to Plant or Water with the Apostles words without the Spirit of Christ? for God giveth increase to them that are in his Spirit. R. W. And thou say'st; G. F's. his throwing God over-board, and his own Reason and Sense. Answ. Thou hast not proved G. F, throwing out God; this is Blas∣phemy to say, That God can be thrown over-board, who hast over-thrown thy self. But thou and the Priests, that would Convert people with the Apostles words, and leave out the power and Spirit of God, do but beget people into a Form without the power: and because G. F. saith [That they cannot Convert people without the power and Spirit of God, &c. though they may have the words of the Apostles] and the Priest saith [That they are Converted by the Words of the Apostles] and G. F. saith [In this they throw out the Spirit and power of God, by which the Apostles did Convert] and about this thou makest a great Rail against G. F. and say'st, G. F. is throwing out God over-board, and his own Reason and Sense; and yet thou confessest, The Lord o∣pened Lydia's heart, and the Lord opened the Eunuch's heart: so here thou Contradicts thy self. And we own God and Christ, and use their Words and the Apostles by the Spirit, that leadeth into all Truth, and do succeed them in the Spirit: and so are the Living Stones, and built up together in the Church of God, which Christ is the Head of. R. W. Thou say'st, There have been many Conversions to the Christian Name in these parts of the world called Christendom:p 18. and then thou Instancest, These (Conversions) the Papists brag to have effected in all the 4. parts of the world; and how these were brought in sometimes by the Sword, and sometimes by Marriages, &c. Answ. How is it you N. England Priests & Professors would Convert the Quakers? is it not by the same Bloody Way? as Instance, Whips, and Stocks, and Swords? and are not these the Beast's Horns, and the Whore from the true Church, and not Christs Wife? R. W. Thou tell'st us of the Waldenses, and Wicklevists, and Hussires in Bohemia, and Lutherans and Calvinists, &c. that came out from this Bloody Romish Whore (144000. Virgin Protestants thirsting af∣ter the Blood of Christ only for Salvation.)
Answ. What is all this to R. W's. purpose, That people should be Converted with the Apostles words, and leave out the power and Spirit of Christ, according to G. F's. words to T. C? And Roger, why do'st thou cry out against the Romish Bloody Whore, when thou and the New-England-Spirits, that thou Commendest, are the same? for, where did ever Wicklff and Hus Hang any, or Cut off the Ears of any, as your N. England Professors have done? And you that would have us punished, are you like Virgin-Protestants, who thirst after the Blood of Christ for Salvation? what! can you both thirst after the Blood of Christ and after the Blood of his people, as the New-England Priests have done? R. W. And thou say'st, The Father of Spirits has stirred up some Wit∣nesses in all Protestant-Nations, to Preach against Formal, National Conversions, and against the Formality and Prophaneness of the com∣mon Protestants. Answ. Then why art thou against G. F's declaring against Conver∣sions without the Spirit of Christ, and power of God, as he doth to T. C? hast not thou all along been Contradicting thy self? and fightest against that which thou here professest, like a blind Man, or one that doteth? And wast not thou Bragging a little before of the Church in New-England? and now thou tell'st of the Papists bragging? and are not all these (thou speakest of) Formal Conversions, brought into the words without the Spirit and power? for there is no true Conversion, nor Translation, but from Death to Life; and that is by the same power and Spirit of Christ, that the Apostles were in, and the Church in the Primitive Times. R. W. And thou say'st: The Formality and Prophaneness of the Com∣mon Protestants (all one in Life, and sometimes worse than the Papists) &c. Answ. Roger, thou and the New-England-Priests & Professors may take it, and apply it at home, and see, if you can find a place of Repen∣tance; for yet you hate to be Reproved.—And as for the One hun∣dred-forty-four-thousand spoken of in the Revel., that sung the New Song, &c. which no man could learn, &c. which were Vndefiled, &c. which were Redeemed from the Earth, and which followed the Lamb, &c. is R. W. and the New-England-Priests, and our Opposites (that he bringeth) like unto these in the Lamb's Spirit? no such matter: for if they were, they would not Persecute, Imprison us, & Cut off our Ears for Visiting our Friends in the Prisons, and not bowing the Knee, and the Hat, and saying You to them; and Persecute us, because we could
not put in their mouths, and give them Maintenance. So, here they manifest, that they are of the Earth, and of the Bloody Whore that R. W. speaketh of: so, they are not of their Purity (which is spoken of in Revelations) neither in Life, nor Doctrine, nor Worship, nor Church, nor follow not the Lamb, who saith, Freely ye have Re∣ceived, freely Give. R. W. Thou say'st (after thou hast told a Story of the Jesuites) The Pharisees,p. 19. who by Land and Sea sent forth their Emissaries to make Converts to God, &c. Answ. Is not this your own Work? seeing that G.F. saith, Th. Coll. hath thrown out the Spirit and power of Christ, which is to Regenerate and Convert; and say'st, That you can no more Convert by the Apo∣stles Words, then the Pharisees without the Spirit of God, and Power of Christ, that the Apostles were in? and yet thou railest against G. F. for saying so. But hast not thou Contradicted thy self in say∣ing, How the Pharisees Converted? when they in their Conversion op∣posed Christ the Light? R. W. Thou say'st, That Christ sent forth his Messengers with Glad News of a New Bargain or Covenant of God with the Sons of men, viz. It pleased the God of Heaven not to be thrown out (as this Fox frantickly barks) &c. Answ. Where doth G. F. say (if it be him thou meanest) That God did throw out his Apostles or Messengers with the New Covenant and Glad Tydings, which Christ sent forth? And hast not thou been barking against Papists and Pharisees, and Formal Professors Converts? and are not they brought into a Form of the Apostles words without the power? and into a Profession of Christ without the Possession of him, like you Priests and Professors of New-England? And G. F. saith; The true Conversion is by the power and Spirit of Christ, [which T. C. leaves out] and so, do'st thou not see how thou Contradicts thy self? for were these Virgins (thou speakest of) Converted with the Apostles words without the Spirit and power of Christ? Dare any of the New-England-Priests or professors, or R. W. say, That you are sent out Immediately by Christ, as the Apostles were? nay, Priests will say, They have No Call to this work to go Freely: but they would find a Call to great Benefices. R. W. And thou say'st: For slighting of this Pearl of this Glad News or Gospel pubished by God to the world by Writing, or Preaching, Professing, Suffering, &c. Answ. This is from a false Birth: for we slight not the writings of
the Gospel, &c. nor the Preaching, Professing and Sufferings of the Apostles, but receive them with Joy in the Spirit of God; &c. But it is you that slight them, that do not Obey them, and persecute with Tongue and Hand them that do obey them. R. W. And thou say'st: It hath pleased his Infinite Justice to Plough the world with Popery, a Religion (a Bastard-Christianity) suited, &c. Answ. Look thou and the New England-Priests at home, and shake hands with them Roger: and let New-England read their Laws, and read thy Book and theirs, and see, if you have not Ploughed worse then they these late years. R. W. And as for thy saying (A Bastard-Christianity) suited (as the Quakers is) to Rotten Nature, and sit to carry the world after them, as Mahomet and the Pope have done. Answ. Nay Roger, you in New-England have the Weapons, as the Pope and Mahomet have in your Rotten Nature, your practice plainly declareth it. For the Quakers Weapons are Spiritual and not Carnal; and therefore thou do'st abuse them, though it doth not touch them. R. W. And thou tells of Two great Worders in the world (pretending to be Christs Messengers to the Nations) the Jesuites and the Quakers: their faces look divers, but they both carry Fire-brands in ther Tails, to burn up the holy Scripture, all truly holy Christians, &c. and thou say'st, We are like Absolom Beautiful, and fit to play Soul-Thieves, and steal the hearts, &c. from the true David, the Lord Jesus Christ. Answ. Thou might'st have kept a great part of this at home, for we do abhor thy Lyes. For whom have we wronged? or whom have we Burnt? except it be the Fire of God's Word that is Entered a∣mong you, and burneth your Esau. stuff. And as for Burning the Scriptures, we abhor thy words: and did'st not thou say, The Papists Owned the Bible, and the Jews part of it? and now thou fay'st, Thy Burn it? how do'st thou Contradict thy self! But Gods Living Free Messengers we have been to New-England, &c. but you have Spoyled our Goods, Banish'd, Whip'd and Martyred to death, and Burnt our Books, which quote a many good Scriptures. And as for Absolom's Beauty, you may look at home among your Whited Walls, and fair Out-side Professors: but they begin to look black with your Murder∣ing Laws. And it's thy own Spirit's work to draw Souls from the Lord Jesus Christ with thy Lyes, as the Old Serpent drew Adam and Eve from God's Teaching: and you exceed Sampsons Foxes, that carryed Fire-brands in their Tails, for you have Carryed them in your
Hands, by which you have Branded the people of God. And we do Esteem the Scriptures, and the Practice of them better then you. R. W. And thou say'st: They are fortified with the Faces of Men, and the Hair of Women, like the Locusts, Rev. 9. such Pretences, and such Illuminations, and Appearances, and Assurances, and Confi∣dences, and Feelings of Experiences, &c. that it is God's Infinite Power and Wisdom, &c. to preserve the Scriptures a Standing Record, of what the first Messengers and Churches, and first Doctrine, and first Christi∣ans were; or else the world would fall down and adore Images, &c. Answ. It is by the Lord's Power and Wisdom, that the Scripture hath been preserved; yet we see such that have the Scriptures, and fall down to Images, and others to the Imaginations of their own hearts, that are not in the Spirit, that gave them forth. And as for those Locusts, that came out of the smoak of the Bottomless-pit let R. Wil∣liams and the New-England Professors keep that at home, & apply it and their Experiences at home: but as for the people called Quakers, it is that, which the Lord has wrought in them by his Spirit, and open∣ed to them by believing in the Light; that so they are become Chil∣dren of the Light, which you were and are Strangers to, and hate. And God hath Sealed us, and set his Mark in our Fore-heads: but your Mark is easily seen to be of the Beast's, that maketh War with the Saints. And did Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob fall down to Images, before Scripture was written? for, as the Apostle saith, None can call Jesus Lord, but by the Holy-Ghost: and though some people have the Scriptures, yet they fall down to Images. But it is the Holy-Ghost, that brings them to fall down to God, and bow to Jesus their Lord, that leads them into all the Truth of the Scriptures, that brought the Pro∣phets and Apostles to testifie against them that Bowed to Images; yea, though they had the Scriptures▪ as in the days of Jeremiah, and Eze∣kiel, and other Prophets. And our Experiences and Assurances are of the Lords Christ. R. W. And thou say'st: Thou knowest, the Counsels of the Father of Lights are very deep; yea, the Revelation needs a Revelation, and the Prophets, and Canticles, and Daniel, &c. Answ. And thou confessest, this must be by the Spirit of God, &c. and in this thou confounds thy self, who hast been Railing against G. F. and the Quakers, who saith: T. C. hath left cut the power and Spirit of God to Regenerate and Convert, and that the Scriptures can∣not do this without the Spirit or power of Christ; and that it is the Spi∣rit, that doth Convert both Jews and Gentiles to God: and this is the
Quakers principle, according to Christs words; I will send you the Spirit of Truth, that will lead you into all Truth: as you may see in John. And so it is all this while, thou hast been Confounding thy self, and Beating the Air. R. W. And whereas thou speakest, How that Jews and Gentiles must yet enquire with Tears of Blood after the Blood of a Saviour:p. 20. sure they shall not awake out of their pits of Rot∣tenness without some Means and Messengers, &c. Answ. And yet these have the Scriptures, and are not Converted: and yet thou railest against G. F. because he saith, They cannot be Converted and Regenerated by the words of the Apostles, but by the power and Spirit of God; and because that G.F. saith, That I.K. in saying [The Scripture is the Means] he throweth out Christ and God, the Author and Giver of Faith (as pag. 9). Yet now R. W. saith, There must be a Messenger from Heaven to awaken Jews and Gentiles; surely, this must be a Spiritual Messenger then: and here he Contra∣dicts himself, and throweth down all his Railing stuff against G. F. as afore-mentioned. And yet There is no Voice and Motion to be heard of Spiritual things within? R. W. And thou say'st: Surely, there shall be no other Words in their Mouths, then what were in the Mouths of the first Messengers, and ac∣cording to Christs prayer, &c. Answ. We answer, Nay; The very same Word and Words, both in thy and your Mouths, when you are Converted (if ever you be Converted) which now thou hast a Form of without the power; and Holdest the Truth in the Unrighteousness: and so that in John 17. and Isa. 59. and Act. 26. we own. And the Apostles which Preached Christ Jesus, said no other Words, then what Moses and the Prophets fore-told, Act. 26. That Jesus Christ should come according to the Pro∣phets: and He is come, and hath given us an Vnderstanding, and we are in him. R. W. And thou say'st: Therefore Fox and his Foxians, that tell us, They have all by the Spirit, and need no Record, are Thieves and Robbers, whom Moses and the Prophets, &c. and the Apostles ab∣horred to think of. Answ. Moses and the Prophets were led by the Spirit of God, and saw Christ, who fulfilled the Scriptures of the Prophets, &c. and the Apostle said: No man knew the things of God, but by the Spirit of God: are not the Scriptures the Things of God? And why do'st thou belie G. F. and the Quakers (if it be them thou meanest) and say'st, that
they say, They need no Record? which is false: for There are Three, that bear Record in Earth, and Three, that bear Record in Heaven, which they have need of. And there is a Record of the Son of God, and there is a Record of John concerning Christ: John bore Record, saying, I saw the Spirit descending from Heaven upon Christ, Joh. 1, 32, 34. and the Father bore Record of the Son, Joh. 8. and God is the Record of his people, Phil. 8. Joh. 1, 5, 7. And there is a Record of the Old and New Testament, which we have the Comfort of: for we never read, that either Moses, the Prophets or Apostles did abhor the Spirit of God to be their Leader, and call them Thieves and Rob∣bers: but those are Thieves and Robbers that do not hear the Voice of Christ, but climb up another way to know the Scriptures, then by the Light and Spirit of Christ. R. W. And thou bringest I. Deacon, who saith [The Enjoyment of Immortality is not, till they have put off this body: G.F.'s Fol. pag. 40.] And G. F. Answereth, That [Immortality was brought to Light through the Gospel, and the Word of God: and Christ was in them, and was not that Immortal? And the Apostle saith:—Christ Jesus, who hath abolished Death, and hath brought Life and Immortality to Light through the Gospel, 2 Tim. 1.10.] — R. W. (Upon G. F's. words) saith: That G. F. affirmeth an Immor∣tality (that is, A Not-dying of the Soul and Body.) Answ. Now, let the Reader see, if he have not abused G. F's. words? and whether he saith any such thing, or no? for Christ saith: They cannot kill the Soul, though they may kill the Body. Yet R.W. saith again, that the Quakers and others say, All flesh is grass (speak∣ing of the body) and yet he saith, that G. F. affirmeth, The Body cannot dye: what Contradictions are these R. W? R. W. And whereas thou say'st: As for the Body, the Quakers say, When the Soul is gone into God (yea, the Soul of Judas, as well as the Soul of Peter, as some of them say,) &c. Answ. But what some of them are, thou hast not quoted; though over and over thou maliciously speakest this in thy Book. Neither do I believe, that ever thou heard any of them say so (may be, some Ranters said so, which he Fathereth upon the Quakers,) for if thou had'st, thou would'st have quoted the Book, or have named their Names, as thou hast done G. F's. and belyest his words: therefore we have good ground to believe thou wrongest others. And thou usest many words to no purpose, about that what others say.
R. W. And thou say'st:—What-ever these Foxians bru∣tishly fancy of no distinction between God and themselves,p. 21. their Light and his, &c. Answ. This is a False Charge. For we make a Distinction betwixt God and our selves; for by his Gospel and Power Life and Immorta∣lity is brought to Light in us, by which we see over the Devil, that hath darkned us: so, In the Light of Christ we see Light. R. W. And thou confessest, That Christ hath brought Life and Im∣mortality to Light through the Gospel [In this thou contradictest I. D. the Priest] and say'st, But this is but the joyful Condition of the Souls and Bodies of the Godly, their Souls and Bodies raised up with Jesus to a spiritual holy Life in this world, and the Souls going to Jesus, and their Bodies sleeping in Jesus, &c. Answ. Here thou hast made a pretty good Confession in words, if thou knewest, what thou say'st. But how do'st thou mean, when thou say'st, The Body sleepeth in Jesus; and yet, It turneth to Rottenness? doth that which sleepeth in Jesus, Rot? And the Apostle saith: Thou Fool, that which thou sowest, is not quickned, except it dye: and that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that Body, which shall be, &c. but God giveth it a Body, as it pleaseth him, 1 Corinth 15. Thou con∣fessest, That Life and Immortality is brought to Light through the Gospel; and because G. F. saith so, thou say'st, He affirms an Immortality, that is, a Not-dying of the Soul and Body: The Soul is Immortal; but G. F. doth not speak of the Body there. R. W. saith: As to this Immortality of G. F. all that can be known of his mind, is H. Nichol's and the Nicolaitans mad fictions and fancies of their becoming God and Christ. Answ. Reader, see, if there be any such words in G. F's Answer to I. D. that he should number us with the Nicholaitans mad fictions and fancies, as he calleth it; he had had better to have kept it at home, if this be his Charity. And this Love, that he hath to some of us, is not like the Love, that David had to Absolom, but more like A∣hitophel's, (which thou speakest of) who neither Loved David nor Christ Jesus; this Spirit of thine cannot in Sincerity, that hath spoken so Evil of God's people. R. W. And thou say'st: I fear, instead of their fancied Im∣mortality before the Grave, they will meet with a dreadful Mor∣tality, or Death of Soul and Body to all Eternity. Answ. This thou fearest not for good, as thy words do manifest
in thy 119. page.Here R.W con∣fesseth Immorta∣lity in this Life; and yet he deny∣eth it unto us. But do'st thou not say before, That the Souls of the Godly, going to Christ Je∣sus, &c. and now do'st thou fear, the Souls of the People of God, called Quakers, shall meet with a Dreadful Mortality, or Death of Soul and Body to Eternity? It's like thou would'st have it so: but we tell thee, and all our Envious Persecutors with tongue and hand, That Christ hath brought Life and Immortality to Light through the Gospel; and our Souls rejoyce in him, and can magnifie God our Saviour, blessed be his Name for ever, Hallelujah! But Roger Willi∣ams, take heed, that which thou fearest of the Quakers, come not upon thy self; for it will be much, if it do not, for thou wilt find Misery, before thou dye, for thy hard speeches against God's People. R.W. And thou bring'st I. M. which saith [The wise Heathen-Philosophers had a greater measure of Light in them (which is the first Adam) then I can think any man hath now.]— And G.F. Answereth [Which sheweth, that he knoweth no∣thing of Christ, the Second Adam, the Quickning Spirit. He know∣eth no New Creature; for they, who are in Chirst, are New Crea∣tures: nor None of Christ the Covenant of God, of Light, of Life, of Peace, who was Glorified with the Father, before the world began; which is beyond the first Adam: and hath shut himself forth, not to be as high as his Heathen-Philosophers. And many witness Christ In them, in this Age, as in the days of the Apostles; which is above the Heathen-Philosophers.]— And R. W. replyeth to G. F. and saith: It pleased God (in all Ages) to stir up the spirits of some Men (as the Philosophers amongst the Greeks, &c.) to improve that Excellent Light of Reason &c. above o∣ther men. Answ. What is this to the Light of Christ, in Opposition to the Second Adam in this Age? R. W. And thou say'st, The Question then followeth: If this Light of Knowledge were Christ,p. 22. as God, and King, and Mediator, why is it, that None of these Excellent men knew Nothing of God, nor Christ, nor Spirit, &c. but only of the first Cre∣ation? Can such a Court be kept, a Palace furnished, and such Royal and Heavenly Guests be Entertained, and no body know any thing of it? &c. Answ. What are all these words to the purpose, but that thou grantest I.M's. Argument, That the Wise Heathen-Philosophers had a
greater Light (which is the first Adam) then you, or any man can have by the Second Adam? if not, why do'st thou Oppose G. F? And thou confessest, that All Jerusalem was moved, and on an uproar, when Christ was born, or came to Jerusalem: and doth not the Apo∣stle bid the Saints, Beware of Philosophy? &c. And the Apostle saith al∣so: Certain of your Poets have said, that we are of his Off-spring (to wit, God's) and Act. 17. Then certain Philosophers of the Epicure∣ans, and of the Stoicks encountred with Paul, and some said; What will this Babler say? and others said, He seemeth to be a Setter-forth of strange Gods, because he preached Christ Jesus and his Resurrection: Now, if R. W. and I. M. have no more Knowledge of Christ, then these Philosophers, &c. in their Light of their Carnal Reasoning, (which was Darkness to the Light of Christ) they may give over talk∣ing of Christ. And these knew not God, nor Christ as King and Me∣diator, which is known by his own Light: and such Philosophers or others, if they did Know God or Christ, it was by his own Light. For that which G. F. doth affirm, is true, as concerning of Christ and their Knowledge in the New-Covenant: and Christ Enlightneth every man, that cometh into the world, as he is the Word, God. And the Spirit of man being the Candle of the Lord, he Enlightneth their Spirit, their Candle, by which they might see him, as he is: and as Christ saith, No man knoweth the Father, but the Son, and he to whom the Son Revealeth him, &c. R. W. Thou say'st: The utmost Reason of these Excellent Men (to wit, the Philosophers) it is known I say, that the Activity of the high∣est Reason in this world falleth short in two grand particulars. (And thou say'st) 1. As to the Creatures: for some of them must needs fall short, when Plato granted a Creation, and a kind of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in the Creation of it. Aristotle pretendeth to see further then Plato and all his Arguments, and Asserteth, The World to have no Beginning nor Ending. Answ. What must we Infer from this, but that thou settest up the Knowledge of the Philosophers above thy own and others, and main∣tainest I.M's. Principles and his Doctrine [That the wise Heathen-Philosophers had a greater measure of Light in them, (which is the first Adam) then I can think any man hath now, saith I.M.] And are not these Philosophers contrary to Moses in Genesis, who said, In the Beginning God Created the Heavens and the Earth? and thy Philosophers, that thou bringest, say, That the World had No Beginning nor End∣ing, &c. and doth not this oppose Christ's words? and 2 Tim. 9. Be∣fore
the World began? and Tit. 1, 2. Before the World began? And Christ saith, The Harvest is the End of the World, Math. 13, 39, 40. Math. 24, 21. Since the World began. Now, let R. W. and the Philosophers read these Scriptures, and see what work they are making about their great Knowledge? but if any of them did know the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, they knew it by the Spirit, and had it by Revelation, as some of the Heathen had: but it's very like, that Many of the Heathen-Philosophers had more know∣ledge in the Creation, then R. Williams. —And then thou goest on & tellest what the Philosophers say of the Sun, and of the Globe, &c. but we tell thee, the Scriptures are a better Book, then their Books concerning God and his Son, and his Creation. R. W. And that which Paul speaketh, Rom. 1. thou say'st, That by the Creation some come to know, there is an Eternal Power and God-head: and thou say'st, that Paul tells us, the World by wisdom knew not God, which must he Expounded (or else swallow a Contradiction, as the Quakers guise is), &c. Answ. Thou can'st hardly speak without Railing. For these Scrip∣tures (1 Cor. 1. and Rom. 1) need no Expounding; for they are plain, as they speak: for its true, That the world by their wisdom knew not God. Some knew the Eternal Power and God-head: for the Apostle saith, Because that which may be known of God, is manifest in them, for God hath shewed it unto them; though they glorified not God, &c: so with This of God in them, which God had shewed unto them, they knew Him, and his God head and his Creation, Rom, 1, 19, 20. So, the Guise thou may'st apply to thy self, who hast lest out That of God, which he hath shewed unto people, who was their Teacher. Are these the wise Philosophers of R. W. and I. M. that have more Light then any man now, that say, The world hath No Beginning nor Ending? and is this your Court and Palace furnished with such Heavenly guests? &c. but to know God and Jesus Christ, that he hath sent, is Eternal Life. And then thou confesseth, That a Natural man cannot perceive the things of God; and yet, The Philosophers had a greater measure of Light, then any man now? R. W. And thou say'st, Yet this Foolish man maketh every mans heart in the world a Court of Heaven,p. 23. a thing which all men may abhor to think of: and yet thou confessest, That there is that of God in the Children of Disobedience and Reprobates. (Appen. p. 5) Answ. But let the Reader see, if there be any such words in G. F's Answer to I. M. as, The Court of Heaven is in every mans heart? But
for all R. W's. Railing, we cannot deny Christ's Doctrine, who said, The Kingdom of Heaven was in the Pharisees: and Christ enligteth every man, that cometh into the world, Joh▪ 1. And it's very like, thou do'st Abhor to hear or think of this, whose Foolish heart is darkned, and thy Wisdom is Enmity, hating God himself, as the Scripture concludes, which thou may'st apply to thy self. Yet we believe, Christ hath en∣lightned thee, which will to be the Condemnation of them that hate it. R. W. Thou say'st: Moses built the Tabernacle, and Noah the Ark, and Solomon the Temple, &c. which thou confessest, were the gifts of God to them. Then thou callest them the Excellent gifts of Nature, that reach not Heavenly and Spiritual things, and say'st, What are all these to the Enlightning of my soul with my Natu∣ral, Vndone and Damned Condition? to a sight of Sin as Sin? &c. Answ. Noah by Faith builded the Ark (as in Hebrews) and Moses saw Christ the great Prophet; and God spake to Solomon and David, who saw Christ, and called him Lord: and if thou do'st con∣fess, that this was a Knowledge beyond the Heathen-Philosophers, yea, and such as said, The world had neither Beginning nor Ending, then thou hast overthrown thy own words, which thou hast been opposing G. F. withall. And was it by a Natural gift, that Noah built the Ark, and Moses the Tabernacle, and Solomon the Temple? was it not by the Faith and Command of God? were these done with Natural parts and good Education, as thou speakest of? how dark art thou in the Scripture!—And the Temple, and the Ark, &c. were Figures of the things of the Law, which Christ is the substance of, who enligh∣eth every man, that cometh into the world: and thou art as dark a∣bout Christ, that enlightneth every one that cometh into the world, as thou art about the Temple, who callest them Excellent Natural gifts in Noah, Moses and Solomon. R. W. And thou goest on, and say'st, What are those to a sight of my utter Inability to pay (or all the Creation for me) one farthing to God's Justice, &c? Answ. It's Christ, that hath Shed his Blood, and Tasted Death for all men, and Enlightens all men; and he is above the Heathen Philo∣sophers in the first Adam: and so, all must believe in him the Light, (who hath enlightned them) for Life and Salvation. And many more slighting words there are in thy pretended Answer, which are not worth mentioning. And how do'st thou Magnifie the Gifts of God to many, whom thou say'st, neither thou nor G. F. is worthy to
hold the Candle to; when thou art setting up the Wisdom of the Hea∣then-Philosophers, with the Light in them (which is the first Adam) above, then any man hath now (as I. M. thinketh)? And what is this to know Christ and the New Creature, and he the Quickning Spirit, and the New-Covenant? for they that Magnifie Christ, will do as John did, Bear witness to Christ, who enlightens every man that cometh into the world. R. W. And thou say'st: Who knoweth not, how full the world is of Admirable men and women, that are not Christians? and yet what a base Esteem hath this proud Spirit of all men, yea, of all Christians too, that dance not after his foolish pipe, &c. Answ. Here thou abusest G. F. and the Quakers again (if it be them thou meanest) who hold forth the Universal Love of God to all Man-kind through Christ Jesus, who shed his Blood and dyed for all, and enlightens all, and his Grace hath appeared to all: and we exhort them to Believe in the Light, that they may become Children of the Light. And the Grace of God will teach them, and bring their Salvation, if they do not turn it unto Wantonness: and do'st thou call this sound Doctrine Foolish Pipe? R. W. And whereas thou bringest I. M's. words [The Prophets are more certain, then any other Revelation.] And G. F. Answers [Was not the Son of God Revealed?p. 24. &c. and did not he Come in the Volumn of the Book to do the will of God? and so they that had the Prophets and the Law (to wit, the Jews) knew not the Son, &c.] And R. W. Answereth and saith, To pass by G. F▪s. Un-English and Non-sense, &c. Answ. It's like, this may be Non-sense to him, though there may be some fault in the Printer; but Charity would have past this by, as I have often done in R. W.'s. Book. R. W. And thou say'st, that G. F. knoweth not, that the Question is not here, whether Christ be the End of the Law and the Prophets? &c. and whether Christ was not more Revealed at his coming? &c: but whe∣ther the Written Word of the Prophets, of which Peter speaketh, be not a more sure word of Command and Comfort to us, then any now to be ex∣pected? &c. Answ. I. M. says, The Prophets are more certain, then any other Re∣velation; and what is this to R. W's Questions? And I say, Christ be∣ing revealed, which is the End of the Prophets and the Law, &c. He is a More and a Certain Revelation, &c. for he is the Salvation and the Foundation that the Law Typed forth, and the Prophets Prophesied
of; for he is the Substance. For many may have the Law and the Prophets in words, as the Jews had, and not receive the great Reve∣lation of Christ Jesus: and many have the New Testament of the Apostles and Christ; but Christ says plainly, None knoweth the Father, but the Son, and to whom he Revealeth him, though they may have the Prophets, like Jews, and know him not.—But thou say'st: But whether the Written words of the Prophets, of which Peter speaketh, be not a more sure word of Command and Comfort to us, then any now can be ex∣pected? What is this to the Revelation of the Son of God? And thou wrongest Peter's words; for Peter saith also: We have a more sure word of Prophecy, (not of the Prophets, as thou hast thrust in) where∣unto you do well, that you take heed unto, as unto a Light that shineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day-Star arise in your hearts. And is this Sure word of the Prophets of Command and Comfort to you, more then any can be expected? what! do'st thou not own Christ the End of the Prophets, a greater Comfort and a Revelation then the Pro∣phets, who is the Foundation of the Prophets and Apostles? But what dark place is this, that the Light shineth in, that people must take heed unto, until the day dawn, and the day-Star arise in their hearts? for we say, that all the Prophets of God did fore-tell of Christ, which the Apostles and Peter preached, Christ the Fulfilling of them, praised be his Name for ever! R. W. And thou say'st, That God called his Mind his Word, his works his Word, his writings his Word, and his Providence of Mercy and Judgment his Word in a way of Condescension to our Capacity, &c: And this thou comparest with Rulers and Masters of Ships word, &c. or Records and Deeds with Hands and Seals, &c. And then thou say'st, The word of God in the mouths of the Prophets, written for after-genera∣tions, &c. and then thou tellest, that the Jews have their Talmud, and The Turks their Alcoran, and the Pope his Decretals, and the Pro∣testants the Written Word or Scriptures. Answ. Thou hast made many Words here, if God's Work (his Cre∣ation, &c.) be his Word, and if Scriptures (which signifieth Writings) be his Word: and thou confessest, the Word was in the Prophets; which is true, none opposeth that. But the Scriptures of Truth are called the Words of God (as Exod. 20. and in the Revelations) and Christ calleth them Words, Joh. 5, 47. And if any man hear my Words, Joh. 12, 47, 48. 14, 23.—John 15, 7. My Words abide in you: Jer. 5, 14. I will make my Words in thy mouth fire. Isa. 51, 16. I will put my Words in thy mouth. And Job. 42, 7. After the Lord had spo∣ken
all these Words. So here you may see, they are called the Words of the Lord; and Christ's Name is called the Word of God. Now the Apostle saith, Through Faith we understand, that the worlds were framed by the Word of God; but where doth R. W. prove, that God's Works are called his Word? he hath given no Scripture for this. And why do the School-Masters make Books for Children, and tell them, that Scriptures signifies Writings (as in the English School-Master, and other Books)? and you say, They are the Word, and give them the Title, that belongeth to Christ: and why cannot you give them the Title, that the Holy Men of God gave to them, which gave them forth, who called them the Holy Scriptures of Truth? And thou needest not tell us, What the Pope, and the Jews and the Turk have: and the Jews had the Scriptures of Moses and the Prophets, but would not receive Christ the Word. R. W. And thou tellest of a written Pardon, sealed with a broad Seal of a King or State,p. 25. and say'st; What a fancy is it for a Condemned wretch first to hearken to a Pardon within, to a King within, a Writing within, a Seal within, and to slight the true Pardon in the King's way to be Conveyed from without to the Mind and Spirit within? and to lose his pardon and deliverance, as thousands of poor cheated souls must do. Answ. The King's written Pardon to Condemned men setteth them free, but the Written in Scripture doth no set men free, nor Pardoneth mens Sins and Trespasses: but it is Christ, that dyed for their sins, and shed his Blood for them; and this the Scriptures testifie of, that he hath purchased them with his Blood, and he is the Offering for Sin. And if the written Scripture be the Pardon of Sin of the Condemned World, as the King's written Pardon is for Condemned persons, then all that have the Scripture, have their Pardon by thy meaning: but pag. 64. thou say'st, The Scriptures avail nothing, without the Spirit of God set it home upon us; so here thou contradicts thy self. And Christ saith, Search the Scriptures, for they testifie of me, and in them you think to have Eternal Life, but you will not come to me, that you might have Life. So the Life is in Christ, and he that hath Christ, hath Life; and they that have not him, have not Life: and they that have not the Spirit of Christ, are none of his, though they may have the Scriptures. And they who had their Garments made white, it was by the Blood of the Lamb, and not by written Pardons: and they that are the true Believers in Christ the Light, and are in the New Covenant, as Heb. 8. he blotteth out their Sins and Trespasses, in
whom God writeth his Law in their hearts. And 1 Cor. 15, 3. Christ dyed for our Sins according to the Scripture: so it is not a written Pardon, though the Scriptures declare this. And Christ dyed for the Vngodly, Rom. 5, 6. Christ dyed for us, 1 Thes. 5, 10: So he it is that Pardoneth. And the Apostle said, This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all Acceptation, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save Sinners, of whom I am chief, 1 Tim. 1, 15. so it is God and Christ, that doth Pardon and Forgive Sin, Col. 2, 13, and Luk. 5, 20: and they that witness this, their Sins are forgiven them. For the true Believers are Sealed with the Spirit of God (and the Spirit of God is within) and hear the Voyce of Christ their Shepherd, Thy sins are forgiven thee; and so have their Testimony of pardon within: and so come to be built upon Christ the Rock and Foundation. So it is one thing to have the Writings, and another thing to have the Seal of the Spirit of Christ, as they had that gave forth the Scriptures: and they that are Sealed with it, have the comfort of God and Christ, and the comfort of the Scriptures, &c. R. W. And thou bring'st R. H. which saith [It is against the Light of Nature for Women to preach, &c.] And G. F. Answers R. H. and saith [Contrary to the Apostle's Doctrine, & the mind of God and the Prophets, who said, God would pour out of his Spirit upon All Flesh, and his Sons and Daughters should prophesie. So that he is a Limiter of the Holy One, & a Quencher of the Spirit, & in Dark∣ness: and this is above the Light of Nature.] And R. W. Replyeth and saith, What is the Light of Nature, but that Light, in which eve∣ry man cometh into the world with (as the Quakers speak) which differeth from the Light of Beasts, &c. Answ. What is this to G. F's. Answer? for G. F. and the Peo∣ple of God in Scorn called Quakers (which thou in Scorn callest Foxi∣ans) do not say, That the true Light, which is the Life in the Word, which enlightneth every man that cometh into the world (which is a Light to be revealed to the Gentiles, as Simeon speaketh) is a Natural Light, or Light of Nature. For this is the Super-Natural and Light from Heaven, which John speaketh of in the Scripture; and as God said, I will give him for a Covenant, and a Light to the Gentiles, and he shall be my Salvation to the ends of the Earth: and where doth John or the Apostles call the true Light (which is Life in the Word, which Lighteth every man that cometh into the world) a Natural Light or Light of Nature? And then thou goest on, and tellest a great Tale of the Natural Light in man, which is nothing to the purpose to G. F's Answer.
R. W. And then thou say'st; It's true, that in Religious and Christian matters there is no respect of persons with God,p. 26. as of man before the woman: otherwise then to Order Natural and Civil. And thou say'st: It's true, the Wisdom of God preferreth some Women before thousands of men, &c. as Lady Jane and Q. Elizabeth, &c. And (thou say'st) Christ appearing to Mary Magdalen, and other Women, and sending them to carry the first Tydings of his Resurrection to his Apostles, &c. and Mirjam and Huldah, &c. Prophecying before Christ's coming: and at his coming (according to Joels Prophecy) his Spirit on his Daughters as well as his Sons, &c. & yet this favour of God towards Women destroyeth not the Order, which the God of Order or Nature hath set in those Bounds, Limits and Distinctions between Male and Female, &c. Though the Holy Scripture were silent, yet Reason and Experience tells us, that the Woman is the weaker Vessel, that she is more fitted to keep and order her House, &c. And the Lord hath given a Covering of longer hair to Womn, as a sign of covering Modesty and Bastfulness, Silence and Retiredness, and therefore not so fitted for Manly Actions and Employments. Answ. Here doth not R. W. contradict himself? Though the A∣postle doth say, That the Woman is the weaker Vessel; and it is so known: yet is not Christ and his Spirit as strong in the Female, as he is in the Male? For thou say'st, There is no respect of persons with God, as the Man before the Woman; and God preferreth some Wo∣men before thousands of Men, as Lady Jane and Q. Elizabeth, and Deborah: and yet thou say'st, Women are not so fitted for Manly Actions and Employments; These were Manly Actions, and Godly of Q. Elizabeth and Deborah. &c. And then thou sayst, She being the weaker Vessel, she is more fit to keep and order her House and Chil∣dren, &c, in Silence and Retiredness, &c. but in this thou confound∣est thy self; for these were Fitted with Manly Actions: and Mary Magdalen, and other Women that first declared the Tydings of the Re∣surrection of Christ to his Apostles, those were Godly Actions. Nei∣ther was Mirjam and Huldah forbidden in the time of the Prophets, nor Philip's four Daughters in the time of the Gospel; neither did any say to them (as R. H. doth) It was against the Light of Nature for Women to Preach. And the Spirit of God, by which these Famous Women were led then and now, doth keep Gods Order and Distincti∣on in the Sex of Male and Female; and they know a time to speak, and a time to be silent: and it teacheth them Modesty, and to know the Fruits of the good Spirit, which leadeth them to Prophecy.
R. W. And thou say'st, Therefore, because of Joels Prophecy, or because we must not limit or quench the Spirit, as G. F. saith, there is no ground in Gods ordinary course of Nature to permit Women to pretend to be Apostles and Messengers to the Nations, or Preachers and Tea∣chers in the publick Assemblies. Answ. And Reader see, if he hath not abused G. F's. words, who bringeth the Apostle's, and the Holy Mens Doctrine. I say, All those that Quench the Spirit, and hate the Light of Christ, and have the Form of Godliness, and deny the power, they are to be turned away from; they are not Fit to preach neither in Nations, nor in publick Assemblies: but those that are led by the Spirit of God, Male or Fe∣male, are not to be Limited and Quenched.—And were not Mir∣jam and Huldah Prophets in the Assembly? and to whom did Philip's four Daughters Prophesie? and did not Mary Magdalen Preach Christs Resurrection to the Assembly of the Apostles. And the Apo∣stle saith, Every Woman that Prayeth and Prophesieth with her head Covered, &c: where did these Women Prophesie and Pray, if not in the Assemblies of the Corinthians? 1 Cor. 11. And yet R. W. (in his 140. page) justifieth a Baptist-Woman (she being his Brother's Wife) her Loud speaking or Preaching in the Assembly at Newport at the End of the Dispute, she saying; R. W's. words shall judge you at the Last day. So he Contradicts himself. R. W. And thou say'st: Because we find no such Commission (to wit, Women-Messengers and Speakers in Assemblies) given by Christ Je∣sus, or any such practice amongst the first Believers. Answ. What! No such Commission given by Christ? had not Ma∣ry Magdalen and other women Commission? and such as Prophesied? as 1 Cor. 11: and Phebe, a Servant to the Church? and Priscilla? do'st not thou Contradict thy self here again? And thou sayd'st be∣fore, A Woman was not so fit for Manly Actions; and yet thou bring∣est Lady Jane & Q. Elizabeth whose Actions were Manly & Godly: and do'st thou not Contradict thy self here again? for thou do'st not make a Distinction of Women here in this Head. R. W. Thou say'st, The Lord hath set a preventer, &c. with the Reasons to the Corinthians, and to Timothy to Answer those Scriptures with a flam, viz. That Eve the Transgressor, and Women that be Tatlers,p. 27. are forbidden, and the Woman Jezabel, &c. And, why may not Women be Lord Mayors, and Bayliffs, and She∣riffs, &c. and Generals and Commanders, &c. Answ. What is this to the purpose? because Eve the Transgressor, and Tatling women and Jezabel are forbidden to Teach, doth the
Apostle forbid Sons and Daughters to Prophecy? doth not the Apostle Preach to the Jews of Sons and Daughters Prophesying, which was the practice among the true Believers, though not among you? And do'st not thou say, There is no Respect of persons with God, as of man before a woman; and yet thou say'st, The Lord hath set a Preventer to prevent the Women of such unnatural boldness? and Eve in Trans∣gression, and Tatling Women and Jezabel, that disobey the Lord; such are Forbidden; for, are they like to exercise the Office of the Spirit of Prophecie?—And Women-Mayors, and Bayliffs, and Sheriffs (as thou Scoffingly bring'st) what is this to Sons and Daugh∣ters Prophesying? for thou darest not say, but that Deborah and Q. E∣lizabeth were Commanders and Rulers, which the Lord called them to: which is not very common to Women. And R. W. why had thy Sister such Vnnatural boldness to Preach so loud, and pass such a Sentence without thy Reproof at the end of the Dispute at Newport? which Vnnatural Boldness thou hast justified, and put her in Print. R. W. And thou say'st: That Reason, that the Spirit giveth to the Corinthians for the Vailing of Women in publick Assemblies, maketh much more for their Vailing and Silence in matter of Prophesying and Praying, &c. Answ. The Apostle saith no such thing, (1 Cor. 11.) that women should be silent either in Praying or Prophesying but he sheweth them, how that they were to Pray and Prophesie Covered: and therefore thou wrongest the Apostle and the Scripture in saying, It maketh much more for their Vailing and Silence in matters of Prophecy, and Preaching and Praying. For the Apostle there maketh a distinction of men and women exercising their gifts, and the Man praying Vnco∣vered, and the woman praying Covered: he giveth the Reason, and explaineth it himself to him that hath an Ear. R. W. And thou tellest the world a Story of Two Maries, that came from London, and bid thee Repent, and Hearken to the Light within, &c. And thou askest them the ground of their Travel and Employment; and they alledged Joels Prophecy, &c. And thou say'st, These Women animated the Sea-men to Fight, and Prophesyed, that an hair of their head should not perish; and then thou say'st, They were slain, and Tydings came on this whole matter, &c. Answ. But R. W. who told thee this Story? for their Names thou hast not declared to the World. And if Two Maries did bid R. W. Repent, and hearken to the Light of Christ within him, he standeth in need enough of it; for had he Repented, and come to the Light of Christ, he would have been out of this Evil work. And as for his
saying, the two Marys told him the ground of their Travel, they alledged was Joels Prophecie: and this is like unto that, They Animating the Sea-men to fight, &c. but these are Scoffing words, which do not become an Old Man, much less a Christian, to tell such Stories to the world. R. W. And then thou say'st; In some extraordinary Case, as in A∣braham's Case with Isaac, &c. but we must not tempt God. But if God hath poured out his gifts of Knowledge and Vtterance upon some women more then others, they have three large Fields to walk in mentioned in the Scripture, (viz) Of their Instructing their Children. (2.) As occasion justly calleth them from home, of Instructing other women, espe∣cially the Younger. (3.) Of confessing boldly the Name of Christ, when he suffereth Tyrants to bring persecution on them. Answ. Are these the Large Fields the Scriptures mention for Sons and Daughters Prophesying? and must it be the Occasion, and not the Spirit, to cause the Elder women to Instruct the Younger, as Occasion calls them from home? and is it not their Duty? and do'st thou make this a Comparison with Abraham in the Case of Isaac, as thou say'st? surely no; for it is the Duty of all Christian Women in their Fami∣lies, To instruct their Children. But what is this to Daughters Pro∣phesying? for did not Priscilla Instruct Apollo as well as Aquila? and doth not the Apostle speak of Women that Laboured with him in the Gospel? (Phil. 4) and were these only their Families, or as oc∣casion justly called them from home? Did Mary Magdalen and other Women preach Christ's Resurrection, As occasion called them from home, or as Christ sent them? and did not they confess and preach Christ at other times, as well as in times of Persecution? and all true Christian Believers, that Believe in the heart, with the mouth they will make Confession unto Salvation, Rom. 10. R. W. And thou bringest T. H. that saith [The Sight of the God-head without Faith in Christ,p. 28. is the foundation of all false Worships.] And G. F. Answers to T. H. [Can any see the God-head, or have a sight of the God-head, and not see Christ, and have Faith in Christ? and who hath Faith in Christ, do not they see the fulness of the God-head, and dwell in Christ? And were not their minds turned To that of God in them, which declared the Invisible things of him from the Creation of his Eternal power & God-head, which the Apostle found fault withal, &c. Rom. 1? let all Examine and Judge, & Read the Scripture and try.] —R.W. Replyeth to G. F. and saith, I have Conversed with all the Indians of New-Eng∣land, &c. and I have read Rom. 1. often, and I find, that first ther∣is
generally in all Man-kind in the world a Conviction of an Invisible and Omnipotent, and Eternal Power and God-head: and thou say'st, That this Conviction doth arise from the Creation, &c. And then thou tellest what men hold, &c. Answ. Do'st not thou here speak contrary to the Apostle's Doctrine? for doth not the Apostle say, Because that which may be known of God, is manifest in them, and God hath shewed it unto them? why do'st thou speak contrary to the Apostle's Language, and say'st, It riseth from the Creation? And must not that, which Is general in all Man∣kind in the world, be the Spirit of God, which Convicteth them of the Invisible and Omnipotent, and Eternal Power and God-head? (and yet thou say'st, There is no Voice nor Motion to be hearkned to in Hea∣venly things, in matters of Super-natural Light. p. 83.) for the Apostle saith, That, which may be known of God: so it is Of God, which God hath shewed unto them; therefore God will Judge the world in Righte∣ousness, who acteth contrary to that, which he Sheweth them, Rom. 1, 19. R. W. saith, I find not, that every man or men (by all their Natural Light or Wit, or Christ within) could find out, how the world, or him∣self, man or woman were Created; though]. Naylor telleth us in Print, that if never a Letter of the Scripture had been writ, yet their Spirit could tell them all things. Answ. We do believe thee, that thou and All men in their Natu∣ral State, or Natural Light cannot find out the worlds, nor how they were made, &c. because that Solomon saith, The world is set in thy heart, &c. Eccles. 2. And whereas thou say'st, Nor the Light of Christ within; In that thou speakest Ignorantly: for the true Light of Christ, which is Life in the Word, by which All things were made, this Light, that shineth in their hearts, giveth them the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Christ Jesus the Word, by whom All things wre Created.—And as for I. N's▪ saying, that If they had not had the Scripture, yet the Spirit of God teacheth them all things; and why not? Did not the Spirit of God teach them all things. that gave forth the Scripture? and is not the Spirit of God the same, which led the holy men of God to give forth Scriptures, which the Holy Ghost now leads into the Truths of them? —And the Apo∣stle saith, By Faith we understand, the worlds were made by the word of God, &c. Heb. 11. and so by the same Faith it is understood now: in the same Faith Moses describeth it, who saw him that was Invisible, and saw Christ, who is the Author and Finisher of this true
Faith; which Faith thou and the New-England-Priests are erred from, as is manifest. R. W. Thou say'st, All men confess, that the Will or Mind of God is pure; and as they could come to know it, it is to be adored and kept and observed: and that it was ever, and is wickedness to sin against it. Answ. Then must not this be the pure Spirit of God, that maketh them to confess to his pure Will or Mind? and to confess, that it was ever sin and wickedness to sin against it? R. W. And thou say'st, None (for all the Light and Spirit in every one) could ever find; how Sin, and Death and Sorrow came into the world? nor how such Inclinations and Dispositions of sin came into them∣selves? Answ. Then thou art out of the Faith, and Spirit and Light, that Moses was in, and the Apostles; for the Apostle, that turned people from the Darkness to the Light of Christ, Explaineth it (Rom. 5.) And do'st not thou think, that he saw it with the Spirit of God within, and the Light of Christ which lighteth every man, that cometh into the world? and that Moses did not see it with the same Light of Christ, and the Spirit of God, because thou say'st, None (for all the Light and Spirit in every man) could find it? And such that did understand Visions and Dreams, and the Scriptures, &c. it was by such, as O∣beyed the Spirit of God; and the Spirit of God Revealed such things to them. R. W. And further thou say'st, Thou findest in all Men a Conviction,p. 29. that God is just and powerful, and doth bring Plagues and Punishments upon persons for gross sins, as Adulte∣ry and Murder, &c. Answ. And before thou confessest more General, That it was ever, and is wickedness to sin against it (to wit, the Mind of God, pag. 28.) And will not this Teach them to Resist the Devil, that Teacheth them to Forsake sin? and will not that Teach them to Glorifie God, as he is God, if they obey it? and what is all this, that thou hast spoken in thy Answer here to the purpose? for sometimes thou grantest what G. F. saith (in Rom.) and then thou speakest slightingly of the Light of Christ, and callest it Natural, which is from the Spiritual man. But all that see their Happiness, and their Blessedness in the world, that is without End, they must see it by the Divine Light of Christ and do Resist the Devil with the Faith, that Christ is the Author of. R. W. And thou say'st Hence (according to G. F.'s Opposite) all Man kind have invented so many false Gods, false worships, &c. yet
out of no more Love to God, then the Lamb beareth to a Lyon, &c. and then thou quotest the Philistines, Samaritans and Sechemites, &c. Answ. Thy words are General, All Man-kind all the world over. What! did Methuselah, and Jared, and Lamech, and Abraham, and Moses, and the Prophets and the Apostles Invent? did they In∣vent any False Gods? for thy words are, All Man-kind have In∣vented so many false Gods and Worships all the world over. What! is there no part of the World free? hath not God his Seven Thousand still, as he had in the days of the Prophets, that Do not bow their knee to Baal? 1 King. 19. And did not all those that Invented all those false ways and worships, go from that of God In them, which God had shew∣ed unto them? R. W. And then thou say'st: The Sechemites for fear of Lions, or hope of Gain will be of any Worship or Religion, as most this day in the World will be; yea, all and every soul, except to whom (in and from the Holy Scriptures) the Holy Spirit Revealeth the Incomprehensible Mystery of a Mediator. Answ. Then they are not All Man-kind. And as for Being of any Religion for hope of Gain, that thou and the Priests might have kept at home: for the Gain that Gods Servants got, that were sent to preach the Gospel among you, was Gallowses, Whips, Prisons and bad Language. And they that own the Holy Spirit to Reveal Christ the Mystery, the Mediator (which Holy Spirit leadeth into all Truth) they will own us, and not them that talk of it, and live out of it. R. W. And then thou bring'st I. H. his saying [The Justification and Redemption by obeying the Light within is a Mystery of Iniquity] G. F. Answ. [He that believeth, is justified from all things, and cometh not into Condemnation; for he hath the Witness in himself: and that lets him see (to wit, the Light of Christ) the Redeemer the Saviour; the Light, which walking in it he is cleansed from all sin. So no Mystery of Iniquity; for the Mystery of Iniquity is out of the Light: and none seeth Justification and Redemption, but with the Light which cometh from Christ, who hath enlightned them] To this R W. Replyeth, and beginneth with his Foul Language, and saith, This is subtle; but being examined, it will be a Mystery of Hellish Ini∣quity, and lighter then Vanity it self. Answ. Poor Man! he might very well have kept this at home. And then he goeth on and saith, G. F. confoundeth Justification, and the Light of Christ, and Faith and Obedience (after his Babilonish
wont) all in a Juglers Box within together; so that the English of it is, Faith is Christ, Obedience is Christ, Justification is Christ, &c. And then thou say'st, It is true Figuratively. Answ. If it be True Figuratively, why do'st thou call it Babilonish and Juglers Box, and Lighter then Vanity, and Hellish Iniquity? but G. F.'s words are plain enough, as they speak; but thou, that art in the Hellish Iniquity, and the Juglers box, &c. may'st Cavil at them. R.W. And because that G.F. saith [None see Justification & Redemp∣tion (which cometh from Christ, who hath enlightned them) but with the Light within] R. W. saith, That G. F.'s words may be in plain English thus rendred [None sees Christ and Christ,p. 30. but with the Christ within, which cometh from Christ, who hath Christed him. Answ. Now Reader see, if G. F.'s words speak, as he Maliciously saith. For, can any see Christ Jesus their Sanctification, Justification and Redemption, but by the Light, which Christ hath enlightned them withal? for with the same Light they see their sins, and Christ their Saviour and Redeemer, &c.—And thou say'st, It is a Mystery, or a subtle Trick of Hell, to call Faith Obedience, and Obedience to the Light Justification, &c. Reader, read G. F.'s words, and see, if G. F. hath either mentioned the word Obedience, or Faith (p. 29.)? So R. W. Inventeth words, and then he called them a Mystery, and a subtle Trick of Hell, to call them, as he hath invented them; which is his own subtle Trick of Hell, for there is no such word in G. F.'s An∣swer. And then he calleth it True sense, and saith, True Sense (as Mo∣ny) answereth all things; but we cannot deny the Apostle's Doctrine, how that Christ is made unto us Wisdom and Righteousness, Sanctifica∣tion and Redemption: and thy Distinguishing of Heavenly matters is like thy Distinguishing of G. F.'s words, as hath been shewed before in thy Contradictions. R. W. And then thou say'st, It is another Gospel, and yet not ano∣ther: but is a Dream and dead Picture of an Image or an Idol, to put-in our Obedience and Working. Answ. What Contradictions and Confusions are these! and what work makest thou about Obedience! for G. F. hath not mentioned the word Obedience; but thou fightest with thy own words: but see∣ing thou makest such work with Obedience, read Rom. 1, 5.6, 16.16, 19. and 2 Cor. 7, 15.10, 5, 6. 1 Pet. 1, 2. R. W. And then thou say'st, I know, they Father this Bastard upon the most-Holy God himself, saying, It is His Obedience, His Righ∣teousness
and His Working in the room of the Death and Blood-shed∣ding, the Sufferings and Merits of the Lord Jesus. Answ. I did never hear so many foul words, and such Perversions from any man in my Life! the Reader may see in R. W.'s own Book, there is not the word Obedience in G. F's. Answer, which he replyeth to. And we do say, that Christ Jesus was Obedient unto Death, even the Death of the Cross, Phil. 2: and the Apostle saith, As by the Dis∣obedience of one Man many were made Sinners, so by the Obedience of One (to wit Christ) many were made Righteous. And the Saints are Obedient to Christ's Faith and Spirit, &c. R. W. And then thou goest on, and tellest of Laban changing wages, &c. and then thou tellest us of the Papists and Jews &c. and the Bargain of Do this and Live; and a Bargain of Saving our selves, and a Bargain of Flying out of our selves only to Gods Mercies in the Mediation of Christ Jesus: and then again render our selves so Holy, so Obedient, so Righteous, so Loving, so Chaste, so Meek, so Patient, so Temperate, that in thought, word or deed we sin not. And this our Holiness is Christ, and God, and Spirit, and Justification, &c. Answ. Reader did'st thou ever hear, how he hath jumbled things together here? Where did Christ and the Apostles use these words, as Making of Bargains with his People? it's like, R. W. thinketh, he is Wiser then they, that gave forth the Scriptures, and their words are too simple for him to speak: but R. W.'s Scoffing Expressions here do not touch us; he may apply this at home. And this we say, E∣very one that followeth Christ, must Take up his Cross, and deny him∣self, he that will be his Disciple: and they must Die with Christ, if they Live with him; and suffer with him, if they Reign with him: and his Spirit teacheth Temperance, Patience and Holiness, yea, to deny that which is Unholy both in Word and in Thought. And the Righteousness of Christ Jesus is our Fine Linnen; and it is God and Christ, that doth justifie by the Spirit, who art thou that dost Con∣demn? And where did we say, that Our Holiness is Christ and God? though we cannot deny Christ to be Our Holiness, &c. who deny Self-holiness. R. W. And thou say'st, I know, the Writers of the Quakers make this high Obedience to be the Crown of some high Saints among them, as the Papists do; and that others come not so high, are taken by the flesh∣ly Spirit, and Repent and Confess, and be more watchful, as they say, in a Contradiction of J. Naylor. Answ. These are most horrid Lyes; and Reader see, if G. F.
speaketh any of these words in his Answer to T. H. as to the Crown∣ing of high Saints (like the Papists) for their Obedience, or Making their Obedience a Crown: for it is the Lord Jesus Christ, that Crown∣eth his Saints, that believe in his Name, and grow up in his Grace and Truth. And as for a Fleshly Spirit, and Repent, and Confess, this you may apply at home; for we own no Repentance nor Confession. but what is made by the Spirit of God, in which we have Unity: and for Exhorting to the watchful, that is Christ's Doctrine. And it is no Contradiction to say, He that is born of God, cannot sin: for the Apo∣stle John explaineth this in his Epistles better than thou can'st, which the Quakers own; which thou makest a great Jumble about. For the Apostle saith, He that believeth, is born of God, and overcometh the world: and is not that the world in mens hearts? and he writeth to Young-men and Fathers, which had Overcome the Wicked one; and to Little Children, that they sin not: and if any man sinneth, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous, and he is a Pro∣pitiation for our sins; and not for our sins only, but for the sins of the whole World, 1 Joh. 2. R. W. Thou say'st, Yet again (in a horrible Mystery of Iniquity) they exclaim against the Protestants for saying, A Child of God can∣not fall from the true Grace Finally or Totally. Answ. Here are no such words in G. F.'s Answer to T. H. Or how hangeth this together? thou say'st, They say, He that is born of God, cannot sin; then how Can they Fall from the true Grace? But what say'st thou to them, that Crucifie the Son of God afresh, and do despite against the Spirit of Grace, and turn it into Wantonness? and these are such, as do not Own the True Grace of God, which is their Teacher, though it hath appeared to them; nor do not Believe in the Light of Christ Jesus, but hate it. And If the Righteous Fall, they rise again; but the Wicked Fall into Mischief. R. W. And thou say'st, Here is a Mystery of Hellish Iniquity, in that they confess, such a Man, Christ, to have been, and his Blood-shedding,p. 31. the Types, and real Predictions and Fi∣gures of him, a real Death, Resurrection and Ascension; yet upon the point (by a Devilish Chymistry) evaporate all these, and leave nothing but a Christ within, as God and Man, whose Name is now Light, &c. Motions within—. Answ. As for Hellish Mystery of Iniquity, and Devilish Chymistry, thou may'st keep at home: for according to the Scriptures of Truth we do believe Christ Jesus his Birth, Sufferings, Resurrection,
and Ascension; who fulfilled the Prophets, and the Types and Shadows of him. And what! must we not call God and Christ, as the Scrip∣tures call them? for God is called the Light; and Christ saith, I am the Light. And though Christ is Risen, and Sitteth at the Right hand of God, yet he doth dwell In his Saints, his Temple, according to the Apostle's Doctrine, as you may see, 1 Cor. 6. and 2 Cor. 6.— And what! must not God's people Obey the Motions of the Spirit of Christ and his Light, and to take heed to it? by which they may see Christ their Saviour, and Justification and Salvation, and the Lord their Righteousness? and the Apostle stirred up to Perfection and to Holiness, which all the Saints are to follow. R W. And thou say'st, It is a Hellish Mystery of the Devil, to Cosen poor souls with a Notion of the Difficulty and Hight of their pro∣fession, and of Worshipping God in Spirit and Truth; which they say, no body in the world doth, but they.— Spirit within —. Answ. Our good Profession, which we make, is of Christ Jesus our Lord and Saviour, who hath enlightned us to follow him and his Worship▪ that he hath set up in Spirit and Truth: and they that quench the Spirit, and hate the Light, and will not come to Truth, cannot worship God in Spirit and Truth, John 3.4. And this Truth and Spirit of God is Within people; and thou or they, that draw peo∣ple from the Truth in the Inward parts, and Spirit within, you draw them into the Hellish Mystery, and Cosen poor souls (as thou speakest of) for coming to Christ and his Worship. —And whereas thou say'st, Thou toldest them of an Image in the Bed, but David was gone &c. but this is thy own Condition. And then thou say'st, That their Religion is one of the Easiest in the world. Nay, thou never trod the Path, thou do'st not know what it is; the Gallowses, and Goals and Whip-Stocks manifest, whether Our Religion be Easie. R. W, And whereas thou tellest us, What will delight our Ears and Minds, to wit, various Tunes of Musick, &c. Answ. But that which Delighteth Vs, is the Lord Jesus Christ, and his Holy Ghost: and the Joy of the Lord is our Strength. And that which thou applyest to Us, thou may'st keep at home; it's thy own, and none of ours. R. W. And thou say'st, If a poor soul give way an Inch, and lets in one thought of yielding to the Voice of a Spirit within, they are filled and ravished with Curious Notions of Justification, Holiness and Righteousness, God and Christ, and the Spirit within them. Answ. How endlesly do'st thou speak against the Voice of the Spirit
of God in his People! And the Apostle exhorteth, Not to walk after the Flesh, but after the Spirit, Rom. 8, 1, 2, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 13, 16, 26, 27. Rom. 12, 11. and 1 Cor. 6, 20, 34. 1 Cor. 12, 13. Gal. 5, 5, 16, 18, 25. Eph. 4, 3, 5, 9. Phil. 1, 27, That you stand fast in one Spirit: Phil. 2, 1, If any fellowship of the Spirit &c: and those are the Poor souls, that do not hear, what the Spirit saith to the Churches. And they that Obey the Voice of God and Christ, must Obey the motions of the Spirit: and the Holy Spirit leadeth to Holiness, and to him that Justifieth freely by his Grace; and without Holiness none shall see the Lord. And doth not the Scripture say plainly, that God saith, I will be your God, and ye shall be my People, and that he would dwell in them, and walk in them, 2 Cor. 6? and doth not the Apostle say, that None can call Jesus Christ Lord, but by the Spirit? and is not that within? R. W. And thou say'st, They can now Thou the King, and they need no Scriptures, nor Teachers. Answ. May be thou art offended, because we say Thee and Thou to thee; for I never heard the King was. And such Teachers as thee, we have No Need of, we can praise the Lord: and the Scriptures we have the Comfort of them, and can praise God for them. R. W. And thou say'st, Thus, as in a Dream, their great Debts of Thousands and Millions are paid and dis-charged. Answ. Yes, by the Blood of Christ Jesus, who dyed for our Sins; and is risen again for our Justification. And we can praise God, that we are come out of your Cage (that thou speakest of) and can say, The Turtle-Dove is heard in our Land: and Christ doth Deliver us from the Devil, of Hell and Death, and giveth us the Victory.—And what, if some have been Rapt up into Paradise (as Paul was) and speak and see Unutterable Joys (which thou Scoffingly speakest of the People of God) and what is this to them, that Followed Absolom? And thou speakest of Jewels fallen into the Dirt; truly this is thy own Work, that art flinging thy Dirt at God's People▪ R. W. And then thou say'st, As I hope in the Parishes of the Protestants and Papists also, who being only Ignorant, (as the Disciples were) of main points of Christianity, yet aim uprightly at God, truly love him, and labour to increase in the Knowledge and Grace of Christ. Answ. How now R. W. What! art thou now flattering the Pa∣pists and the Parish-Protestants? and before The Papists would burn the Bible? And do'st not thou say, Old and New-England may flourish, when the Pope and Rome are in Ashes? and such, as have True Love
to God, and labour to increase in the Knowledge and Grace of Christ? and yet, The Papists will burn the Bible? And as for all the sober Pro∣testants, they will be ashamed of thy foul words; and if they read thy Book, they will see, how thou hast abused us with foul words, the Lord knows. R. W. And thou bring'st Jer. Ives's saying, [There may be a Light to Convince of Sin, and not yet within man]— G. F. Answ. [There is no people Convinced of Sin, but they are Convinced within themselves, and with the Light within them.p. 32. It is the Light, which maketh manifest to a Man, when he is Convinc'd: it answereth to something, and reacheth to something in their particulars; though the words be spoken without them from the Light]. R. W. Replyeth a∣gainst G. F.'s words (which are very good Truth) and cryeth; It is doleful Business to read and hear, how Satan (in his Chains of Darkness) yet hath Liberty to appear abroad, as an Angel of Light from Heaven, thus Vaporing and Swaggering under the Cloak and Co∣lours of Light—. Answ. R. W. cannot endure to hear talk of the Light of Christ; but like the Jews, who said, That Christ by the Prince of Devils cast out Devils. And how doth R. W. prove, that it is the Devil, that is as an Angel of Light from Heaven in his Transforming, and not the Light of Christ in us? for Christ saith, he is Out of Truth; but we know, that this Light and Spirit leadeth Into all Truth. And we do believe (according to the Scriptures of Truth) that the Light (which enlightneth every one, that cometh into the world) is the Life in the Word, by which all things were made: and Christ, who said, I am the Light of the world, was Glorified with the Father, before the world bgan. And they that believe in the Light of Christ, do be∣come Children of the Light, and no man can Come to God, but by Christ the Light, and to Salvation, but by the Light of Christ, which giveth them the knowledge of it. — And this Light of Christ R. W. calleth a Devil in Samuels Mantle, and a Dragon, and a Devil of Darkness, the God of this world, Vapourings, Crackings and Cheat∣ings; and, He laboureth to keep all in Blindness, or to beat out the Eyes of those, whom God hath truly enlightned: this is thy own Con∣dition R. W. And thou say'st, That God was Light, &c. then why do'st thou rail against the People of God called Quakers, for pro∣fessing, That God and Christ is Light? R. W. And thou Scoffingly say'st, That the Quakers confess, That
the Natural Man perceiveth not the things of God; only they say, that beside Natural Light and Reason; there is the Holy Seed, God and Christ within every Son; and to this Spirit and Seed in Prison they preach. And Fox in our Discourses alledgeth and affirmeth, God (in every man) to be a Cart loaden with Sheaves, prest under, and as it were in Prison, &c. Blasphemous wretches, &c. Answ. Reader see, if there be any such words in G. F.'s Answer to Jer. Ives, as R. W. bringeth here? And whereas he saith, Fox in our Discourses alledgeth, &c: G. F. had never no Discourse with R. W. And whereas he saith, That God and Christ is the Seed within in all men, Those are not our words: for we say, that Christ is the good Seeds man, that Soweth the good Seed on all sorts of ground. And to say, That the Eternal God is in Prison, these are his own Blas∣phemies: and, The Natural man perceiveth not the things of God, that is true; and is his own Condition.—And as for the Lord's saying, He was prest under the Transgressing Jews, as a Cart with Sheaves; and therefore R. W. saith, that the Quakers say, God was in Prison: which is false. And we say, That which may be known of God, is ma∣nifest in Every Man, which God hath shewed unto them: which we tell all people of, as the Apostle did, and turn them to the Light and Grace, that cometh from Jesus, that they may turn to God and Christ, from whence it cometh. And thy Vngodly, Railing words touch us not. R. W. And thou confessest, All Light or Truth Natural, Civil or Divine, it cometh from without, and is received by an In∣ternal Faculty,p. 33. according to the Capacity &c. of it: from thence it is conveyed to the Court, &c. to be Examined. Answ. What! is not this Court (or Guard, or Captain within) the Light of Christ within to know Truth from Falshood? And then thou say'st, That G. F. urgeth [There must be a Receiver, and something that Answereth,] and thou say'st, That Natural Truth, or Moral &c. are soon received by Moral Vnderstandings. G. F. doth not speak of Morals here, but the Light of Christ, which Convinceth, which is Super-natural, that bringeth the Christians (that love the Light) to Discern Spiritual and Heavenly things from Natural. And there∣fore Christ said, The Spirit of Truth should lead them into all truth: and the Apostle saith, Whatsoever doth make manifest and reproveth, is Light. And what is all this to the purpose that thou speakest (pag. 31, 32 & 33)? and who denyeth, but that the Natural re∣ceiveth Natural, and the Spiritual Spiritual? for thou seemest some∣times
to grant, and sometimes to oppose: for that, which G. F. speak∣eth, is concerning the things of God. R. W. And then thou tellest us, How that Christ asked his Disci∣ples, how many Loaves they had? [But what is this to the Light of Christ? those are Natural things]. And then thou tellest us, How that Christ ask'd his Disciples, whom say they that I (the Son of Man) am? and thou say'st, This was a Divine and Supernatural Question; and for the out-side and truth of the Fact, the Devils could answer as well as the Disciples. Answ. This R. W. might very well have kept at home, and his New England Professors. For had R.W. & them known, that there had been a Christ, if the Scripture had not declared it? for, have they the same Revelation, as Peter had of Christ, Beyond flesh and blood? And was not this Revelation Within Peter by the Spirit of God? and did not he see it with the Light of Christ, and with that, which thou confessest, that will say, The Mind of God is pure? &c. (as in thy 28. page) and then thou Grantest the Quakers Principle, which thou do'st Oppose. And thou say'st, All true Believers hearts do receive and wel-come all truly Divine and Heavenly Doctrines; Then there is the Light of God within to receive them, if they do not hate it: and if they quench the Spirit, they are not like to receive them; but chuse the evil, and hate the good. R. W. And then thou say'st, G. F. talketh of something within, which is preached to. Answ. Thou abusest G. F.'s words, for G. F.'s words are, Reached to, as the Reader may see. R. W. And thou say'st, That the Natural Man perceiveth no Spiri∣tual matter; but when he is born again, then he acts and works, &c. Answ. Here again thou abusest the Scriptures, and Christ's words, and contradictest thy self. For thou say'st, There is a Conviction in all Man-kind in the world of an Invisible, and Omnipotent, and Eternal power and God head (pag. 28.) And Christ saith, Believe in the Light, while ye have it, that ye may become Children of Light; and he that believeth, is born of God: which Christ sheweth, that they have the Light, before they be born again; or else how can it be the Con∣demnation of them, that do not believe? And Natural men, that hate Christ's Light, and grieve his Spirit in them, they are not like to perceive the things of God.p. 34. And then thou ramblest on and tell'st, what the Protestants say, but to no purpose to G. F's. Answer.
R. W. And thou say'st; G. F. saith, There is a Some-thing, a Seed, though but as a Grain of Mustard-Seed, a Seed of God, of Christ, of the Spirit, to which Christ the Word is preached: and then thou say'st, Horribly abusing the Scriptures. Answ. Now Reader see, if there be any of these Words in G. F's. Answer to Jer. Ives? and see, if he hath not abused G. F's. Words? And why doth he scoff at the Preaching to the Spirit? for, did not the Apostle Preach to the Spirit? and sow to the Spirit? and of the Spirit reaped Life Eternal? and was not this within People? And is not Christ the Seeds-man, that soweth his Seed upon all Grounds? And doth not Christ compare the Kingdom of Heaven to a Grain of Mustard-Seed? read Matth. 13. R. W. cannot endure, that G. F. should speak Scripture. R. W. And thou say'st, They maintain, though Men be dark and dead; yet Christ within is Light and alive in them, and them only. Answ. Here again thou wrong'st our Words; though we say, That Christ enlightneth every one that cometh into the World, which is the Life in the Word: and this is the Condemnation of them that hate it. And they that receive the Light, receive Christ; from whence it cometh, that hath Englightned them. R. W. And thou say'st, G. F. his lying Cheats of a Sufficient Light within to lead to God and to Salvation, a Teacher within &c: And thou further say'st, It is a simple Superfluity, to hold a Candle of Out-ward Words to awaken and englighten such a glorious all-suf∣ficient Sun within. Answ. Here thou dost not know what thou say'st; thy Enmity against the Light of Christ hath blinded thee. We say, The Light of Christ is no Cheat; it is Sufficient to believe in: for, He that believeth, is Saved. And the Light that shineth in the Heart, giv∣eth the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Christ Jesus; and it is Sufficient to take heed unto, Until the day dawn, and the Day-star arise in their Hearts. And the Jews, though God poured out his Spirit upon them, and they transgressed, God sent his Pro∣phets to turn them to his Spirit, which they had grieved and erred from, and so to God. And Christ sent his Apostles, to turn them to the Light &c; and so do God's Messengers now (though they hate them and it) to the Intent, that they may turn to Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, from whence it cometh. And all the Believers in the Light are in fellowship with it, and can declare, What Christ hath done for their Souls; and praise God in the Assemblies.
R. W. Thou askest, Where is this Something of God (yea, God and Christ?) and say'st; If he Answer in the Vnderstanding, he grants it Dark &c; if in the Heart and the Affections &c, he con∣fesseth, all there is hard and dead. Answ. They that hate the Light, and will not come to the Light, because their Deeds be evil, and because it will reprove them; they Know all this with the Light. And they are like to have their Vnderstandings darkned and hardned, when they hate the Light; that should soften them; so, their Vnderstandings are darkned: and Christ doth quicken them, that are Dead in Sins and Trespasses, that believe in this Light. And thou say'st, It is God and Christ, which the Quakers do not say; but it is the Light of Christ, that they may believe in it, and be graffted into him. R. W. And thou say'st, Christ the Sun of Righteousness arose with saving rayes or wings of Salvation; but the blind Jews could not own him for their Messiah. Answ. This is thine and your own Condition, Transgressing Chri∣stians, who will Not own Christ the Light, who enlightneth every one that cometh into the World. And thou say'st, Though no Man sees it [to wit, Christ that lightneth every Man, that cometh into the VVorld]: Though R. W. and the New-England-Professors Sees it not (because their Darkness cannot comprehend it), yet the Believers in the Light See it, and Christ, the Sun of Righteousness, from whence it cometh; and receive him, the Messiah, though thou, and the Jews will not. And they that come to the Light of Christ, they See how Christ enlightneth all Men, that come into the VVorld, by the Life in the VVord; and how the Word was made Flesh. R. W. And thou say'st; VVhat is this to a mixture of Light and Darkness? Answ. Nay, we must tell thee, that the true Light doth not Mix with Darkness: though it shineth in darkness, darkness doth not com∣prehend it; but the Light comprehends darkness. And what was that the Pharisees closed their Eyes to, and stopt their Ears, and prickt Saul, and made him kick again? R. W. And after thou hast rambled to no purpose, thou say'st; VVhen God in his own Means ordinarily works the Will to hear,p. 35. to turn, to believe, to pray &c. And being thus turned with Ephraim &c. Answ. The Apostle saith; It is not him, that Willeth. And is it the VVill of Man, that heareth? and was it not the Spirit of E∣phraim
that Heard, seeing God had poured out his Spirit upon the House of Israel? and Christ saith, He that hath an Ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the Churches. And thou hast not seen thy Vndone Condition yet! And if thou wast in a Mourning lamen∣ting state, thou would'st not be in this Work; who say'st, When he turns our Wilderness &c, into a Garden: it seemeth, It is Not Yet; which we do believe thee. R. W. And thou say'st; Then we bring forth sweet Fruits, Flowers &c: and, When he turns the Wolf into a Lamb, then we are meek, innocent, and patient. Answ. Mark, When; it seemeth, it is Not Yet: and therefore, have these Weeds and Wolfish Nature appeared &c. in New-Eng∣land, that have Worryed the Lambs; who have shewed forth such an Impatient, Vnmeek, and Vn-innocent Spirit, not to be the Spirit of Christ; and so, No true Christians. R. W. And thou say'st; But to talk of the Preaching to the Spirits in Prison &c: and the Seed of God in Prison &c: when the Lord speaks of his warning and moving Men by Noah's Preaching in the Old World (as may be evidently evinced) is like the prophane Teach∣ing of Parrots to prate of Grace &c: and as the Parrot in France could say her Pater-Noster, her Creed &c: and yet knew as much of the working of God in the Soul, as the Popish Teachers. Answ. Dost thou think, the Popish Teachers knows no more of the Grace of God, which hath appeared to all Men, than a Parrot? and dost not thou Contradict thy self, and say'st, That the Papists aim uprightly at God, and truly love him, and labour to increase in the Knowledge of Grace? (Pag. 31.) And (in thy Epistle to the King and Baxter) wouldst thou not have the Papists &c. in Ashes, burnt with Fire and Brimstone? and now, That their Teachers know but as much as a Parrot, of the Grace of God working in their Souls, (and that is) Nothing at all? — And why dost thou shew thy self so dark, and so envious against the Seed of Christ being in Prison? for, doth not Christ say [I was in Prison &c?] and was not that his Seed? and [Why persecutest thou me?] and was not that Christ in his Members? And why dost thou compare Christ's Preacking to the Spirits in Prison by his Spirit in the dayes of Noah, to a Parrot? like unto the Parrots profane Preaching in France &c? And all may read (1 Pet. 3, 18, 19.) how Christ preached to the Spirits in Prison by his Spirit in the dayes of Noah; Peter doth not say, that it was Noah, but it was Christ: and the Prisoning cometh
by Disobedience. And doth not Christ say to the Prisoners, Shw your selves forth? and so, it is not Means Ordinary (as thou speakest of) for People To Believe in the Light, but a great Work of God; and that maketh you so stumble at the Light. R. W. And thou say'st; They often say, God is All. Answ. Doth not the Scripture say the same, That God may be All, and In All, 1 Cor. 15? and Ephes. 4. One God the Father of All, who is above All, and through All, and in you All? but thou canst not speak our Words right. R. W. And thou bringest Jer. Ives's Words, who saith; [It is a known Error to say, That a Man was in Hell, and in Heaven] And G. F. Answ. J. I. and saith [Who in this sheweth his Ignorance of Scripture▪ For it giveth Testimony of Men, that did witness, that they had Been in Hell, in the Nether-most Hell; and witnessed again, that they were In Heaven, and Sate in Heavenly Places in Christ Jesus: and such were In Heaven, as is spoken of in the Re∣velations.] And this Truth according to the Scriptures, R. W. calleth a Lame, cheating Answer, who cannot speak without Revi∣ling: but let the Reader judge. And R. W. saith, That G. F. and Millions more, talk of Heaven, as the Parrot; but this he might have applyed at Home. R. W. And whereas thou say'st; They talk as the Parrot of our Fore-Fathers, some from the Scriptures, and some out of Reasons Light talk of Places of Joy Eternal for the Righteous, and Misery for the Wicked. Answ. What R. W! hast thou a Parrot, that hath as much Light and Reason to talk of these things, as G. F. and Men? And didst not thou say before, Thou findest all Men to confess, that the Mind or Will of God was pure, and to be observed? and that it is ever wickedness to sin against it? and now to say; G. F. and Mil∣lions talk like a Parrot? what! is not Reason and Light in Men be∣yond the Parrots Knowledge? Truly, Enmity hath darkened thee, and thou art ignorant of thy own Condition; therefore, thou judgest others with thy Contradictions. And thou tellest the Para∣ble of Dives and Lazarus (Luk. 16.); but take heed, thou dost not know, how soon thou may'st be in Dives's state, who art so much against the poor Lazarus's, that believe in the Light of Christ Jesus, and have no Helpers, but God and Christ: and thou needs not tell us, what the Intent of Christ's speaking of Dives and Lazarus was &c.
R. W. And thou says, He knows (to wit, G. F.) the state of Sorrow and Bitterness is called Hell, and the state of Death and the Grave is set out by the Word Hell &c: and so to either of these he wickedly applies the Third state, of which the Lord Jesus so clearly speaks,p. 36. viz. the State of the Ungodly after this Life, in the Life and World to come. Answ. Here thou pervertest G. F's Words. For, in his Answer he doth not speak of the World to come▪ and the Wicked are turned into Hell,Psal. 116. Psal. 139. Jonah 2. after they die; but as David spoke, Though the Gates of Hell took hold of him; and as Jonah cryed out in the Whales Belly in Hell, in Misery. For thou say'st; G. F. knows, the state of Hell is Sorrow and Bitterness, and Death and Grave; and yet thou say'st in thy Contradiction, G. F. talks of Heaven and Hell, as the Parrot: R. W. doth the Parrot know, that Hell is called Sorrow and Bitterness, Death and Grave? R. W. And thou say'st; That he (G. F.) knows, the Visible state of the true Profession of Christ is called Heaven. [But can every Visible Eye see this Heaven?] And thou say'st, Such as have an Interest in Christ Jesus, have sitten down with him in those Heaven∣ly Mansions, into which he is entered bodily, and gone to prepare for their Reception and Coming. Answ. If thou and the New-England Professors were in this which thou speakest of, they would not persecute the People of God called Quakers. And then thou tellest of the Third Heaven, the Place of Paul's Rapture of Joy and Blessedness &c, when these Heavens and Earth are burnt up and consumed. What! are the Heavenly Mansions and Glories to be burnt up, which they that have an Interest in Christ, have sitten down in him in those Heaven∣ly Mansions? for we know, what Heavens and Earth the Apostle telleth of, that must be Burnt up and Consumed. R. W. And thou say'st; It's like, G. F. hath been occasioned to these thoughts by the Papists Fables about Heaven, and Hell, and Pur∣gatory. Answ. No such matter. R. W. And then thou goest on with a great Story of the Papists (which thou hadst better to have kept at home), and thou say'st; G. F. knows, how that the Papists get a great world of Money of these Notions of Heaven and Hell &c. Ans. And G. F. knows, that the New-England Priests get a great
deal of M▪ as well as the Papists, by telling People of Hea∣ven and Hell; and make a trade with the Scriptures, as the Papists do, with their Inventions. R. W. And thou say'st, G. F. not believing these Fables, he fan∣cies, that Hell is some Apprehensions in the Mind of Wrath to come, and that is Hell and Wrath it self: and having had flashies of Pride and Peace in their Minds, these are the Joys of Heaven. Answ. Then this is above the Parrot taking of Heaven and Hell; for hath the Parrot had such Apprehensions? And as for Pride and the Fables, keep at home Roger; for we have known (as David and the Holy Men of God did) what Hell is? and the Righteous passeth through in this Life: and it is well, if thou have have not made Agreement with Hell, Isa. 15.18. And hath not Hell enlarged her self by thee, and such as speak so much Evil against the Light of Christ, and the Believers in it? and see, if thy TONGVE BE NOT SET ON FIRE OF HELL, Jam. 3. and the Wicked, that Christ speaketh of, That must go into Hell, thou shalt know that (I warrant thee) except thou Re∣pent, Mark 9, 43, 45, 47. And thou, and the New-England Priests and Professors, may read your Conditions Matth. 13, 15. how the Jews compassed Sea and Land to make a Proselyte; and when he was made, they made him two-fold more a Child of Hell &c▪ like you New-England Priests: and was not this to get him into a Form of Godliness without Life and Power, and oppose Christ in his Light? But we can say, The Lord Jesus hath delivered us from the Wrath to come, 1 Thess. 1, 10: and, God hath not ap∣pointed us to Wrath, but to obtain Salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ, who dyed for us, awd we shall be saved from Wrath through him, (and so from Hell) who are justified by his Blood, Rom. 5, 9: and therefore, do not thou Treasure up Wrath unto thy self against the Day of Wrath &c, Rom. 2. And the Believers in Christ do Enjoy in this Life an hundred-fold, and in the World to come Life Everlasting: so, our Joys are not Flashies of Heaven and Hell; neither do we Cheat poor Souls (as thou falsly accusest us) with such Flashies; but do believe according to the sound Doctrine of Christ and the Apostles. R. W. And thou say'st (after thou hast rambled a great whilet no purpose) They do allow a time more or less, before they come in∣to the perfect Heavenly State, &c. Answ. We say, There is a Growth from a Child to a Young-man,
and to a Father in the Truth; and God accepteth of the Faithful∣ness of all. And as for Satan enticing into proud vanities, thou might'st have kept at home. R. W. And thou say'st;p. 37. They have a mad Fancy of their Souls going into God, and becoming more God &c. Answ. This is thy own mad Fancy: and let the Reader see, if there be any such thing in G. F's. Answer? But this is a Word of thy own forging, and not ours, to say. Our Souls becoming more God; but to say, Our Souls go to Christ, who is the Bishop of them, that is true: and why should they not, who hath Bought us and them with his Blood? And dost thou not Contradict thy self, in saying, Their Souls go to Jesus? (pag. 21, and pag. 37.) R. W. And thou tellest of a State of Eternal Joy to the Righ∣teous after this Life, and a State of Eternal Misery, to the Vn∣godly &c. Answ. Thou needest not to tell us of this; though thou say'st, The exact Knowledge of Particulars exceeds the present Sight of our Mortal Eys, and the Hearing of our Ears &c. Can these things, or the Joy of the Holy Ghost be Seen with Mortal Eys, or Heard with Mortal Ears? for doth not Christ say, He that hath an Ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the Churches? And is it by the Sight of the Mortal Eye, and the Hearing of the Mortal Ear, that seeth and heareth the Joy and Comfort of the Holy Ghost, or the Spiritual Ear in this Life? And the Apostle saith, Ye have your Fruits unto Holiness, and your End everlasting Life: now, did not the Apostle See and Hear this with a Spiritual Eye and Ear, what the Saints did Enjoy both in this Life, and in Everlasting Life, Rom. 6? for what canst thou See with thy Mortal Eye, or Hear with thy Mortal Ear, but that which is Mortal? A Natural Man perceiveth not the things of God (as thou hast confessed) but the Apostle saith, The Eye hath not seen, nor the Ear heard &c. the things which God hath prepared for them that love him; but God hath re∣vealed them unto us by his Spirit: for his Spirit searcheth all things, yea the deep things of God. R. W. And then thou runnest on and say'st, The first Fruits▪ and a Tast both of the Heavenly Joys, and the Torments of the damned are given by God in this Life; to the first in that Solid Peace and Joy, which they have in God; to the other in that Horror and Despair, and Enmity against God.
Answ. This last R. W. may apply home to himself. For if ever he had known the First Fruits of the heavenly peace, which God's peo∣ple hath in God, he would never have written such a book against his people: but it is like, his Torments are begun in this Life. R. W. And thou sayest, There is three sorts of men especially will seek, there is an Hell to come, above other sinners: The Voluptuous and Luxurious &c: whose God is their belly &c. the devourers of the poor &c: The proud pufft up with foolish confidences boldly crying, Lord o∣pen to us &c. Answ. R. W. might have applyed a great deal of this to himself, who hath Hell so often in his mouth against the Redeemed of the Lord. R. W. And thou bringest Jer. Ives, who said: [The Pharisees were far enough from having the Kingdom of heaven within them]. And G F. Ans. [Contrary to Christs words, who said, It was within them.] And R. W. replyeth and saith, The Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of heaven is one. Answ. Who saith to the Contrary? And then thou say'st, Of the Kingdom or Government of God and Christ in the Soul, and the Govern∣ment of God in his holy Providence in the World, and his Government in the Churches and Saints, and the Glorious State to come after this Life. Who saith to the Contrary of this? not the Quakers. R. W. And then thou sayst, That his Journey-man G F. is a sit In∣strument to destroy all these, and to erect in their steed a dull, proud, dogged Confusion or Babel within under the Name of God, Christ, Spi∣rit, Light, Faith, Righteousness, Resurrection. Answ. All these be Lyes. For let the Righteous and Honest Christi∣an Judge, can the Government of God in his holy Providence be de∣stroyed? or Christ's government in his Church be destroyed, when Christ saith, The Gates of Hell shall not prevail against his Church? Can Gods Glorious government and state after this Life of his people be destroyed (which R. W. saith, His Journey-man G F. is a fit Instrument to de∣stroy all these)? We say, Nay: But thy Antichristian Religion may be destroyed— And as for dull, proud, dogged Confusion &c: under the Name of God, Christ, Spirit, Light, &c: which thou talkest of with∣out Life, is thy own Confused Babel, that may be destroyed. But Christ, who is the Quickning Spirit, and the Author of Faith, and the Lord of Righteousness, and the Resurrection, him thou canst not destroy; he dieth no more: and he hath enlightned us, and given us Faith, who is the Lord of Righteousness and our Resurrection yea, now and at the last day.
R. W. And then thou tellest us, Christ knew, That the Jews and his own Christian Followers were leavened with a Worldly Noti∣on, that their Messiah should be a Glorious Temporal King &c; and he tells them, That they were mistaken; and saith, That his Kingdom should not be such a Kingdom;p. 38. but that it was within them. Hence the Kingdom of Heaven is a spiritual, inward, and soul-Kingdom concerning God, and the Soul and Spiritual matters. Answ. And this thou confessest, was to the Jews and his Chri∣stian Followers, which were Leavened with a worldly Notion: And why dost thou oppose G. F. there for bringing his Words, who said, The Kingdom of Heaven was within the Pharisees? R. W. And thou runnest on and say'st; Sometimes it was In them, and sometimes (thou say'st) it was Among them in the Streets; and makest a pitiful Jumble about Christ's Words in his saying, The Kingdom of God was within them. And thou say'st, That the King∣dom of God, that is, God and Christ, and the Spirit were litterally in the Pharisees, and so in every Hyprocrite in the World &c. though they know it not. Answ. Didst no thou say before, That the Kingdom of Heaven is spiritual, inward, and a Soul-Kingdom? and that Christ said, It was within the Jews, as thou say'st? And doth not Christ say, That the Kingdom of Heaven is like unto Leaven, or a Grain of Mustard-Seed? and cannot this Kingdom be in the Pharisees, ex∣cept (as thou say'st) God and Christ must be litterally in them? — And whereas thou say'st, Though the Pharisees knew it not; No more does thou, (though it be in thee, as it was in the Pharisees) who jumblest things together in this manner: and is this the Di∣viding the Word aright? R. W. And then thou say'st; What Agreement is there betwixt Christ and Belial, Light and Darkness, Righteousness and Vnrigh∣teousness? Answ. No, there is no Agreement, nor the Spirit with the Flesh. Yet we must not say, That the Light and Spirit is not within Man; for we do believe, thou, that hast not known this, hast known little War in thy self. R. W. And thou say'st; Whereas it is most improperly and impiously objected, That the Light shineth in Darkness &c. Answ. Here thou chargest John and the Translators to be improper and impious, not only the Quakers: here thou railest against John the
Evangelist, (besides thy Railing against the Quakers) that he speak∣eth Impiously and Improperly; who saith, The Light shineth in Dark∣ness, and the Darkness comprehendeth it not. And there thou, that abusest John and the Scripture, what are thy Words good for? R. W. And then thou ramblest on in thy Confusion, and say'st; But the Light is at the Window, and the Eye &c; but the Eye, the Door is shut: and the Man within is not only a sleep, but dead and rotten in Nature's Filthiness and actual Transgressions and Abo∣minations. Answ. This is thy own Condition R. W. who hast read it, whose Darkness cannot comprehend the Light; but it comprehendeth thee in thy Darkness. But what Man is this within, that is dead (to wit, within Man) and is rotten? how dost thou describe him? and him, that he is within? but thou, that hatest the Light, then Christ may knock at thy door, when Sin is gotten in, in thy Heart; and thou lovest it better, than the Light of Christ. And John doth not say, That the Light is at the Window or Eye (as thou dost) but In shineth in Darkness: and thou in thy Dark∣ness thinkest to give a better Meaning of John's Words, that he himself; No, no. R. W. Thou say'st; It is against all Colour of Reason to ima∣gine, that the Lord Jesus should tell the Jews and Pharisees, and the rest of his bloody Enemies (who some weakly, and some malici∣ously opposed his Kingdom and Coming to rule by his Grace over them) that his Grace was King within them, what ever their Hearts or Tongues said, or Hands did &c. Answ. This is R. W's. Sense, who is confounded, as the Pha∣risees were with Christ's Doctrine. And yet before he contra∣dicteth himself, and saith; That the Kingdom of Heaven was in the Pharisees, and Jews and Disciples a Spiritual, inward and Soul-Kingdom &c: and thus he confoundeth himself with his own Colours and easons. R W. And thou say'st; It is contrary to what G. F. and his Clamour, that the Kingdom of God consists in Righteousness, and Peace, and Joy in the Holy Spirit, as opposite to the King∣dom in the Pharisees and all Hypocrites,p. 39. as Hell to Heaven. Answ. And why so? why may not the Kingdom of Heaven be compared to Leaven, and a Grain of Mustard-Seed, as the
Kingdom of God, which the Saints are Heirs of, that standeth in Righteousness, and Peace and Joy in the Holy Spirit? Darest thou say, That the Kingdom of Heaven that was within the Pharisees, was of the Nature of Hell, or as Hell to Heaven? prove this by Scripture. And where was that Holy Ghost, that Stephen told the Jews, they did resist, as their Fathers did? and what was that, that prickt Saul, and made him kick again? But thou Contra∣dictest thy self here again, to what thou say'st (pag. 38.) That Christ's Kingdom in the Jews, Pharisees and Disciples was an in∣ward Soul-Kingdom within them, thou say'st there R. W. R. W. thou goest on, and makest a great Gust (as thou callest it) but to no purpose; and thou say'st, The thing is so notoriously childish and ridiculous, that a King should affirm, He was an Actual King in his Enemies Country, where the Whole was up in Arms against him &c. Answ. What Childish talk is this? Is not a King a King, though the Country be up in Arms against him? and is not Christ King, though all do not obey him? and did not Christ shed his Blood, and dye for all Men, though all Men do not live to him? And doth not the Reign, who saith, All Power in Heaven and Earth is given to him? and the Apostle saith, They that Suffer with him, shall Reign with him, 2 Tim. 2? And dost thou not wickedly charge Christ to be Notoriously Childish and Ridiculous, for saying, The Kingdom of Heaven was within the Pharisees? (and thou say'st the same, pag. 38.) For thou and the Pharisees being blind, would not receive Christ, the King, to Rule in their Hearts: and therefore saith the Apostle to the Saints, Let Christ Rule in your Hearts by Faith. — And then thou tellest a Story of a Lamb and a Wolf, and a Man pretending to love a Woman in the way of Marriage, and she abhors to hear of the Motion: This thou may'st apply at Home. For, God so loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son; that whosoever believed in him, should not perish, but have Everlasting Life. R. W. And then thou goest on, and Contradictest thy self, and say'st; It's true, the Motions of War and Love are made and offe∣red from the King Warring &c. Answ. But they rejected these Commands of Christ. And then thou say'st; But that this Government and Kingdom should be within them, is nothing but impious, impudent and childish Prating. But what are thy Words to the purpose here? Christ doth not
say, That he Governed in the Pharisees, as he Governed in the Saints: but it is Wickedness in thee to say, That Christ's Words are Childish prating, and impious, which said, The Kingdom of Hea∣ven was within the Pharisees, Luk. 17. And this Childish prating is thy own, and Contradictest thy self, who saith, That the King∣dom of Heaven is a Spiritual, inward Soul-Kingdom, and was in the Pharisees, Jews and Disciples: So, thou hast been Fighting a∣gainst that, which thou hast granted. R. W. And thou bringest Thomas Weld's Saying, [How clear the Scripture is, Faith comes by Hearing, and not by Minding the Light within.] And G. F. Answ. [Doth any Man know Christ but by the Light within? And is not Christ the Word? and can any see without Christ the Word? Doth it not make manifest? nay, doth it not give the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Christ Jesus (2 Cor. 4.) from whence Faith cometh? And so, Faith cometh by Minding the Light within, Christ the Author of it; and bringeth to look at him, and hear him.] Very good Truth to them that know it.— R. W. Replyeth and saith; My Eyes have seen a poor distracted aged Woman, walking in State, boasting of her Majesty, Jewels and Crown, with a Straw in her hand for her Scepter. And thus this poor and mad Soul walks even like Nebuchadnezar upon his Babel; All is Christ, and he is Christ, Christ is Faith and all. Answ. This confused Babel thou may'st apply to thy own Con∣dition, of the Distracted Woman, for it is not ours. And let the Reader see, if he hath not abused G. F's. Answer to T. W? Doth he say, All is Christ? and, He is Christ? and, Christ is Faith? for G. F. saith, Faith cometh from Christ, and the Light cometh from Christ, and Christ is the Author and Finisher of it. R. W. And thou say'st; He slights this so known and unquestio∣nable Record, Faith comes by Hearing &c, and Rom. 10. concern∣ing true Salvation, true Worshipping, Praying, Believing, Preaching, Sending; which Holy Writing Fox dares not seriously and imparti∣ally, and in the Fear of the most-High consider, as to the various means and ways of God's sending unto Man. Answ. As for God's sending unto Man, all such we own; for they Preach Christ the Word. For the Apostle saith, The Word is nigh thee, even in thy Mouth, and in thy Heart; and this is the Word of Faith, which we Preach: and thou confessest, that the Lord opened Lydia's Heart, and then she received the VVord, Christ,
which the Apostle Preached. But what is all this to your Teach∣ers, that Preach, and never were sent? and as many of you confess, you never Heard the Voice of God and Christ from Hea∣ven immediately? but thou hast wronged G. F's. Words, and hast not set them right down, as they are in the Book (Folio). And can any Man believe, preach, pray or worship God, or see their Salvation without the true Light of Christ Jesus, which cometh from him, the Word? R. W. And thou say'st; For all G. F. his Scepter of Straw, his mad Fancy of Light, that works Faith &c. Answ. These are thy Railing Language, and abusing of G. F's. Words: for his Words are not, Worketh by Faith; but Christ Jesus, who is the Author of Faith, is the Light of the World. And then R. W. asketh,p. 40. What is Faith &c? It is (I say) the Gift of God; and thou may'st see, how the Apostle de∣scribeth it Heb. 11: and Christ, who dyed for the Sins of the World, enlightneth every Man, that cometh into the World, that they may believe in him, that dyed for them. And then thou ramblest on, but to no purpose, in Reply to G. F's. Answer. R. W. And thou askest, VVhat is Preaching, but a Publishing &c, or declaring, what the VVill or Mind of the King Eternal is, which he hath revealed to the Patriarches, Moses and the Prophets from the beginning of the VVorld? and what did Christ Jesus declare to the Apostles, but that which Moses and the Prophets did say should come to pass &c? and was not this Proclamation of Good News to be made over all the VVorld, and first at Jerusalem &c? Answ. Who gain-sayeth this? the Quakers do not. But what is this to G F's Answer to T. W. or to R. W. and all his Priests in New-England? for did ever they Hear the Eternal King's Voice immediately from Heaven, and Preach this good News, as the Pro∣phets and Apostles did, freely, as they had received freely, to give, Act. 26. Luk. 24. and as you may see in the Evangelists? But they have gotten the Form of Godliness, and deny the Power there∣of, and persecute them, that be in the Power of Godliness. R. W. And thou talkest of Four sorts of Hearers of the Glad News, that received and believe with a false and overly, loose and Sandy Belief. Answ. This is thy own Condition R. W. and the Priests in New-England. And as for those, that Receive Christ by believing in the Light, are grafted into him, and united to God. And as for
the Men of Samaria hearing the VVoman, who preached Christ to them, A Man that told her all, that ever she had done; this may shame thee and the Priests in New-England, that did not receive God's Sons and Daughters, which Preached Christ to them, That told them all, that ever they had done; and would have turn∣ed them and thee to Christ: and instead of receiving them, you per∣secute them with Tongues and Hands. Answ. And thou say'st; I know, these poor Foxians do hear a kind of a Motion within them. [Then that is more than the Par∣rots, which thou speakest of pag. 35: and so in this thou con∣foundest thy self.] But thou say'st; It is but as poor VVomen, that go with False Conceptions, or with Tympanies of Wind and Water, or with the Mole, that will resemble the Motion of a True Child: but after all their Thoughts and Fancies by Day and Night, after all their Seeming Feelings, Perswasions, Experience and Pre∣parations this False Conception, False Faith, False Christ, False Light shall vanish in shame and grief, as did Q. Maries after the Thanksgivings and Bell-Ringings for her Deliverance. Answ. This is R. VV's. and the New-England Priests and Pro∣fessors Condition; he knows it better, than the Quaker's Con∣dition. For do not their Laws and Persecutions declare it to the World, to be the Birth of the Flesh, that hath so Persecuted, Hang∣ed and Whipt God's People, who are Born of the Spirit? Is not their Faith prov'd false, and not that, which Christ is the Author of, which worketh by Love? and is not their False Light, or False Christ made manifest, who destroyeth Men's Lives about Religion? for the Quakers true Christ said, he came To save Men's Lives, and bid them, Love Enemies And so R. VV. and the New-Eng∣land Professors their False Birth of all their Experiences appeareth to be but like a Tympany of VVind and VVater (as he speaketh) that vanisheth away: and all their Preparations with their Elders and Members, and their persecuting Priests, that helped to beget this Birth, is it not all passed away into Persecution with Tongue and Hand, and not the true Birth? and into Grief, and Shame, and Sorrow? and did not the Indians say, That their own God, they Professed, fought against them? And as for R. VV. bringing Q. Mary, let them, that are concerned, answer for that: and thou art not to Speak Evil of the Dead. R. W. And whereas thou say'st; (For my self) I dare these Self-Confident to particularize any one Scripture, where the Spirit
of God directs any poor Soul to listen or hearken to a Light and Voice within him, affirming, that this is the Hearing, by which Faith is wrought &c? I ask for some Solid Instances, where Souls have been truly Converted (the whole Soul unto God) by any such Notion;p. 41. and not by some External Means, and out-ward Hearing of this Glad News and Gospel. Answ. In this thou hast shewed thy Ignorance of the Scriptures, and the Holy Men of God Conditions. For did not the Jews hear the External Means and outward Hearing of Christ and his Apostles, and yet were not Converted to God? Now, we Chal∣lenge thee, and all the New-England Priests, Where ever any one was Converted to God by an Outward and External Hearing, to answer this by plain Scripture? And whereas thou hast said, Listning to the Light; but our Words are commonly Take heed to the Light (as the Apostle doth) until the Day dawn, and the Day-star arise in your Hearts: and was not the Light the Means to take heed unto? And what External Means had Abra∣ham, that saw the Day of Christ and his Gospel? and what Ex∣ternal Means had Moses, when God spoke to him, or Outward Hearing of Man's Preaching to him? And what External Means had Mary Magdalen and other Women, when the Lord sent them to Preach the Resurrection? And what External Means had Da∣niel, when he Heard the Voice of God? and was not this Voice of God within? though we deny none, that God and Christ speak∣eth to and sendeth. But did not the VVord come to Jacob? and was not that the Author of his Faith? and was not he Converted? and did not all the Holy Men of God speak, as they were Mo∣ved by the Holy Ghost? And doth not Christ say, He that hath an Ear, let him hear, what the Spirit saith to the Churches? and is that an Outward Hearing or External? And doth not the Apostle say; No Man knoweth the things of God but by the Spi∣rit of God, which Revealeth them? and doth not Christ thank his Father for Revealing his things to his Disciples, and hid them from such VVise, as you are? And can any come to Christ, but whom the Father draweth? and is that by an External and Outward Hearing? And doth not the Lord say, He open∣eth the Mouth of Babes &c? And did not the Lord open Ly∣dia's Heart, to hear Christ, that Paul Preached, who was a Minister of the Spirit? and did not he and the Apostles Sow to the Spirit? and was that an Outward and External Means? And
doth not the Lord say, He will put his Laws in their Minds, and write them in their Hearts; and he will be their God, and they shall be his People: and they shall not teach every Man his Neigh∣bour, and every Man his Brother, saying, Know the Lord; for they shall all know me from the Least to the Greatest, saith the Lord: and is this your External Means (in New-England) and Outward Hearing, who persecute the Children of the New-Covenant, (that are Taught of God) for not following of you? R. W. And thou say'st: I ask, if it be not a Ridiculous Contradicti∣on, to fill the VVorld with a Sound of their New He- and She-Apostles? Answ. We say, Nay, who are sent of God, and have heard God and Christ's Voice, as the Prophets and Apostles did. And you, who are feeding of your External Means of your Outward Hearing, and hate the Light of Christ, and are Erred from the Spirit, that gave forth the Scriptures, persecute us, as your Fore-Fathers did Christ and his Apostles. R. W. And thou say'st; I ask, if this Light within (without and opposite to the Hearing without, which is the Question) be the Means of Faith, how is it possible, that so many serious, enquiring Men in all Ages should not pereive a Breath of this VVind, no, not in their own Bosoms? and that Famous Paul should be Conscientiously and fully perswaded, that he ought to do many things against Christ Jesus? Answ. Hast not thou here manifested thy Ignorance again? for the Light of Christ within is not opposite to the Ministers of the Spirit, and such, as turn them from Darkness to Light &c. And the Apostles bid the Saints, Look unto Jesus, the Author and Fi∣nisher of their Faith, not unto them: and is not He the VVord, the Apostles Preached, and told them, it was nigh in their Hearts to hear it and do it? And Moses describeth the Righteousness of the Law &c: but the Apostle saith, The Righteousness of Faith, which speaketh on this wise (mark, Speaketh) say not in thy Heart, who shall ascend into Heaven? that is, to bring Christ down from above; or who shall descend into the deep? that is, to bring Christ from the Grave &c: but what saith it? The VVord is nigh thee in thy Heart, and in thy Mouth; and this is the VVord of Faith which we Preach. Now mark, the Apostle Preached the VVord of Faith in Peoples Hearts and Mouths; and was not this VVord in Abraham's Mouth? and Jacob's Mouth? and Moses Mouth?
and the Prophet's Mouth? and dost thou say, Enquiring Men in all Ages should not perceive a Breath of this Wind? and because thou and the Priests in New-England do not perceive a Breath of it, therefore thou judgest others, like thy self. And how could all the Prophets see Christ without the Light, which was Life in the Word, by which all things were made? — And whereas the Apostle saith, How should they hear without a Preacher, and how should he Preach, except he be sent; what is this to your Preachers, that never Heard the Voice of God, and run, when God never sent them? And the Apostle saith, But have they not all heard? (mark) yes verily &c: so, Then (saith the Apostle) Faith cometh by Hear∣ing, and Hearing by the Word of God. And Paul, who was fully perswaded, he ought to do many things against Christ Jesus &c; shewing, that he had heard of Christ with his External Ears and outward Means, and had heard the Prophets, that spake of Christ; yet was a Persecutor of Christ in his Members in his False Con∣ception, like thee, and the Priests in New-England. And though Paul heard Steven's Sermon, yet he was not Converted; but at his Conversion Christ told him, It was hard to kick against that, which had pricked him: for Christ knew, what had prickt him, that made him kick again, when he was a Persecutor of Christ in his Members, like R. W. and the New-England Priests and Pro∣fessors: and it is the way of the Persecutors about Religion, to kick against that, which pricketh them. R. W. And thou say'st; Therefore it is Grace, that doth All; and yet thou say'st; This is something, but reacheth not home, [but what this something is, thou hast not told the World.] And thou say'st; If all Men in the world have this Light, (which is sufficient without Hearing) why should not some (especially the Wise and En∣quirers &c.) perceive it, or something of it? as Paul did not, until he heard something (and because God had a purpose to make an Extra∣ordinary Vse of him) &c. Answ. What is this to R. W. and the New-England Priests, who are Strangers to this Work? And Christ, who enlightneth every Man, that cometh into the world, he saith; Learn of me &c: and God saith; This is my beloved Son, HEAR YE HIM. Yea, the Saints heard the Apostles, which were Ministers of the Spirit; but was the Apostle therefore the Author of their Faith, and Finisher? or, were the Apostles the Word, which they Preached? And as for thy Wise and Enquirers, some ask and have not, because they ask
amiss: but as Christ Enlightneth every Man, that cometh into the sworld; so, if they do not hate the Light, in that Light they will ee more Light, and see Christ, their full Satisfaction. And thou say'st, It is Grace, that doth All: If so, what do the Scriptures and the Teachers do then? which are thy only Sword, Weapon, Rule &c; and thy outward Means, which thou hast been busying thy self about? — But R. W. the Scripture saith, Grace and Truth cometh by Jesus Christ, which shed his Blood, and tasted Death for every Man: and this Grace of God, which bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to all Men; and God said to Paul, It was Sufficient. So, it is Sufficient to Teach People, and bring their Salvation, if they do not turn it into Wantonness, and walk despitefully against the spirit of Grace: and such are not like (though they do en∣quire) to perceive, that deny that, which they should perceive withal. R. W. And thou bringest T. P. saying, [To say, the Officers of the Church are Invisible, it is plain of their Father the Devil]. G. F. Answ. to T. P. and saith, [The Holy Ghost made the Officers of the Church Overseers; and that made the Officers the Overseers to be Invisible. For they saw with an Invisible Eye, and so, they were in the Spirit, which is Invisible, and not in the Flesh, else they could not be Overseers in the Church of God: and you are the Visible Apostatized from them]. — And R. W. replyeth, and saith; This is one of the most impudent Fooleries, that either Fox or (as the Proverb is) any Dog could be impudent in. Answ. Here you may see, how R. W. beginneth with Railing Language, which he had better applyed to his own Spirit, which cometh from it: but he hath not proved out of the Holy Scripture his Lying Proverb. R. W. And thou sayst, G. F. acknowledgeth a publick Assembly of Christians, as well as of other pretending worshippers Turks, Jews &c. and also he acknowledgeth the Ministers,p. 42. Offi∣cers and Over-seers of their Assemblies. Answ. Doth G. F. here mention the Over-seers made by the Holy Ghost of the Turks and Jews, but them in the Apostles days? why dost thou abuse his Words? R. W. And thou say'st, G. P's. Reason is notoriously silly and im∣pudent: why? Because G. F. saith, The Church is in God, and the Overseers are made by the Holy Ghost. Answ. Doth not the Apostle say, The Overseers were made by
the Holy Ghost? and, the Church was in God, as Act. 20, 28, and Thes. 1? and is this Doctrine of the Apostles notoriously silly and impudent? why? because you are not in the same Holy Ghost, and your Church is not in God, as theirs was. R. W. And thou say'st; Are the Secrets of God always secret, and never to be Revealed? the Child in the Womb, the precious Stones &c. when brought forth, are no more Invisible, than the Sun in the Fir∣mament. Answ. Were not the Children in the Womb, or precious Stones In∣visible, before they were brought forth in themselves? how proveth R. W. and the New-England Priests that to be like unto the things of God? The Secrets of God are Revealed by his Spirit, which is Invisible: and so, they are Secrets to them still, to whom they are not Revealed by the same Spirit. And this Spirit, that doth Reveal the things of God, doth make them Overseers. R. W. And thou say'st; The Christian Profession and Professours, how-ever they were wrought and prepared, and by divers Means by God's Spirit; yet &c. Answ. But what these divers Means are, R. W. hath not told the World. But what is this in opposition, that the Holy Ghost made not Overseers in the Church in the Apostles days? it is nothing to that. R. W. And thou say'st; Yet the Lord Jesus Christ compareth them to the most Visible, Conspicuous, and Glorious Things and Persons, to the Sun and Moon in the Heavens, and the Heavens and Stars also; to Mountains and Cities &c. and to Kings, their Houses and Pa∣laces &c. R. W. What is all this to oppose the Apostle's Doctrine, and say, The Holy Ghost did not make them Overseers? which is the Consequence of R. W's. Jangling. For we do grant, what the Lord Jesus Christ doth compare his Holy People to in Scriptures; but that's not thy State. R. W. And thou say'st; Although the Lord Mayor of London, and the several Officers of the City are not made and ordained in the publick Streets; nor Generals &c. are they not therefore Vi∣sible &c. Answ. What a Story is this! who opposeth thee in this? who saith, They are not Visible? But what is this to oppose the Apo∣stle's Doctrine still, who said, The Holy Ghost (that is Invisible) made them Overseers? Will R. W. say, It is the Holy Ghost, that
maketh all Mayors, and Generals, and Officers, which are Visible Officers by Visible Commissioners? else what doth he bring this Comparison for? The Work of Christ's Overseers is Spiritual; it is with a Spiritual Eye and a Spiritual Discerning, and by a Spiritual Power, and to watch over the Invisible Spirits of People, the Souls of Men and Women. R. W. It is most true &c. that the Church is in God: [and then thou Contradictest thy self, and say'st,] And is it not also true in one Sense [that, is, thy Sense, not the Apostle's 1 Thess.] We live in God, and move in God, and have our being in God &c. Answ. What Roger! one while a Church, and not in God, and yet Live in him, and move in him, as thou confessest? Thou say'st, The whole Creation is Gloriously Visible. Who saith to the contrary of that, which is Outward? R. W. And thou say'st; The Saints, their Assemblies and Offi∣cers are in God Visible to the world &c. though in an Heavenly Spi∣ritual Sense, transcending the being of the Creation. Answ. And yet R. W. bringeth J. M. to Contradict himself; [in his Append. pag. 21.] and saith; The Wise Heathen-Philoso∣phers had a greater measure of Light in them (which is the first A∣dam) than any I can find now. And R. W. opposeth G. F. for set∣ting up Christ the Second Adam, and his New Covenant, and his New Creatures above the First Adam and the Heathen-Philoso∣phers; and now [in his 42 Page] he confesseth, This transcends the being of the First Creation: Why didst thou oppose G. F. then (in thy 21 Page) and there Contradict, what thou say'st in page 42? But where doth the Scripture say, That the Saints, and their Assem∣blies and Officers are in God Visible? for God is a Spirit, and they that are joined to the Lord, and are in the Lord, it must be by the Spirit: for none knoweth his things, but by his Spirit, that is In∣visible. And G. F. never denyed, that the Bodies of the Saints and Officers, and Assemblies were Visible now, and in the A∣postles dayes, and they were and are to be seen with Visible Eyes; or else how could they have been persecuted in the Apostles days, and in New-England? if you had not seen Quakers there, you could not have Hanged them. — And thou say'st; It is most true and most sweet; that the Church is in God: yet again, G. F's. Reason is notoriously Silly and Impudent, [because he saith to the Priest, R. W. defendeth, that the Church is in God:] So Roger, put thy Words together and see, what Sense thou canst make of them?
R. W. Thou say'st; Yea, G. F. and his &c. for all their being in God, and some of their proud and silly Answerings in Courts, that they Live in God, and Dwell in God &c. Answ. See R. W's. Contradiction before in the same page, where he saith; We live in God, and move in God, and have our Be∣ing in God &c: we must not now confess this (that he just now owned) without being called Proud and Silly. But why! must not we tell, where our Living and Being is, before your Courts? and are not they Silly and Proud (as thou speak∣est) and live not in God, that cannot endure to hear People tell you, where their Living and Being is? And yet thou say'st; They disown not their own Visible Congregations &c. Why should they disown their Visible Assemblies, or Teachers, or Overseers? which are gathered together in the Name of Jesus, and are Ministers of the Spirit; and are made Overseers by the Holy Ghost, that is Invisible: and their Singing and Praying in the Spirit they own. As for those Audible Performances thou speakest of, the Saints per∣form their Worship, Praying, Preaching &c. by the Spirit: is the Spirit and Truth Visible, in which God is worshipped? let R. W. and all the Priests prove that by Scripture, if they can. R. W. And thou say'st; VVhy doth this poor notoriously Visible Cheater thus prate of Invisibilities, especially in times of Peace and not in Elias his Case?p. 43. Answ. What! must they not talk of Faith, by which the Invisible God is seen? nor the VVord of God, which was made Flesh, by which all things were made? nor talk of the Holy Ghost, which made Overseers? And did not the Apostle say, Ye are not in the Flesh, but in the Spirit, (Rom. 8, 9.) and yet all these were upon the Earth? but thou art dark, not knowing the things of God. But you Professors, that prate so much of Visi∣bility, are Invisible enough at Times, running away and flying your Testimony: but the things that are seen, that are Temporal, your striving is in: and so thou pleadst for Visibility. And though we are for God's Invisible things, against your Carnal envious Minds; yet, have we not been visible in Tryals and Persecutions? did we hide from you? R. W. And thou bringst M. Bine, which saith [The Scriptures may be understood by the Help of Tongues.] And G. F. Answ. [All Scriptures were given forth by Inspiration: and so without the same Inspiration it is not understood. Again, Pilate had the
Scriptures and Tongues, and yet did not understand the Scriptures nor Christ the Substance of them: and this you have set up since the Apostacy, your Tongues, you Raveners from the Spi∣rit.] — R. W. replyeth and saith, That G. F. confesseth, that every Syllable or Title in the Scripture is the Word, or immediate∣ly revealed VVill of God, against his and the Quakers common Song, hath God any more Words than one? Answ. Doth G. F. speak these Words in his Answer? did ever G. F. or any called Quakers deny, but the Scripture was given forth by Inspiration, and was Revealed from God and Christ to his Prophets and Apostles, which were the VVords of God and Christ, and he the VVord? And, Thou shalt not kill, and steal &c. was not that Revealed to Moses, and the VVords of God? for Christ saith; I am the Door, and, I am the Bread of Life; he doth not say, That he is an outward Door, or outward Bread, that is made of Corn. And was not the Promise of God Revealed, and his Commands? and must they not be known by the same Spirit, to an∣swer them in Man &c? R. W. And thou say'st; I observe, the end of G. F. (and especially of the old Fox and Serpent that acts him) is, to destroy the coming of God's Holy Records and Writings to poor lost Men to their Sal∣vation. Answ. Are the VVritings to Salvation to lost Men? is not Christ their Salvation? May not the Devil and the Pharisees have the VVritings, and yet be Enemies to Christ the Salvation? did not the Jews think to have Life in the Scriptures, which testifyed of Christ, and would not come to him, that they might have Life and Salvation? And dost not thou say (in the same Page) That G. F. confesses, how all Scripture was given forth &c; and now, dost thou Contradict thy self, and say'st; His end is, to destroy the Scriptures? No, no; We love the Scriptures: and thou mightst have kept all thy bad Words at Home. — And thou say'st; He may foist and whisp in, what his Hellish Malice pleaseth to their Damnation. — Roger, this is thy own Condition, and not the Quakers, as thy Lyes have manifested. R. W. And whereas thou say'st; If no Knowledge of the Tongues, in which the Most-wise, Holy Lord pen'd his Letters or Writings to us, then no Preaching of the Doctrine in them to the world without some New miraculous way, then no Translating and Reading of them, which is, that the Devil in all Ages and at this day aims at with all his might.
Answ. Doth G. F. deny Tongues in themselves here, which are natural things? and what must be inferred from thy Words, but that Men may understand the Scriptures with Natural Tongues? then I query; How was it, that the Pharisees, and the Grecians, and all other Languages did not understand them? and how is it, that Christ saith, He thanketh the Father, that he hath revealed these things unto Babes? And the Apostle saith, No Man knoweth the things of God, but by the Spirit: and G. F's Answer is, That all Scripture was given forth by Inspiration; so without the same Inspi∣ration it is not known: and if this be to deny the Scripture, let the Righteous judge. And as for all thy bad Words here against us, thou mightst have kept them at home. R. W. And whereas thou say'st; I charge upon this proud Igno∣ramus, and all his blind Disciples &c. the horrible Crime of Un∣thankfulness and Ingratitude; for were it not for Tindal burnt to Ashes, and other Heavenly Spirits set on work from Heaven to dig out the Knowledge of Hebrew and Greek, and turn it in∣to French,p. 44. Dutch and English &c, how should these Sera∣phical Doctors know, whether there were such a Creation of Heaven and Earth, and a Man and his VVife, which we talk of. Answ. Dost thou not Contradict thy self (in thy 22 Page), when Plato granteth a Creation, and a kind of Father and Son, where thou settest up the Heathen-Philosophers? and dost thou not say, what Aristotle confesseth of the God-head? and what Scripture had they? and dost thou not say, Thou findest in all Mankind a Conviction of the Eternal Power and God-head? And doth not the Apostle say, He understood by Faith, the World was made or framed by the Word of God, Heb. 11? and doth not John say the same Joh. 1? And is not God the same now to his Peo∣ple in Christ, as he was to Moses? and doth he teach his Peo∣ple in the New-Covenant short of Moses? And as for thy Charge of Vnthankfulness &c. keep it to thy self: for we can praise the Lord for the Scriptures, and such as honest Tindal, that did translate them; who was burnt and persecuted by the same Bloody Mur∣dering Spirit of New-England, that kill'd our Friends. But what hast thou to do with W. Tindal? hear him in our Defence against thee and thy Brethren, saying: It is impossible to understand in the Scriptures more than a Turk, for who-so-ever hath not the Law of God writ in his Heart to fulfil it. Again: VVithout the Spirit
it is Impossible to understand them (W. Tindal's Works p. 319, p. 80). What is this, if People have the Scriptures in all the Languages, and yet oppose that, which must lead them into the Truth of them, or inspire them to know them? and though they have the Scriptures in all Languages, can any know Adam and Eve's State in Paradise, except they be brought thither by Christ? And it's true, they may have an outward Knowledge by reading of Adam and Eve &c; but in this thou confoundest thy self, and say'st, A Parrot may talk of Heaven and Hell, and the Grace, and so, may not a Parrot be taught to talk of Adam and Eve? (read thy 33 Page). And then R. W. telleth of a Question put to a Soul, and the dreadful end of that Party; but he hath particularized no body: so, it is like the rest of his Stories. R. W. And then thou chargest the Quakers with Laziness, be∣cause they do not study the Original Language themselves, saying; It is a shameful Trade, and deceitful, when Persons have money in their hands, to take up all on Trust. And further thou say'st, I never knew any of these Foxians so inclined; but according to the Lazy Fool under the Fig-tree &c. Answ. R. W. Contradicteth himself: he saith, (pag. 43.) John Stubs vapour'd and said; He understood as many Languages as I: [and in another place] That he understood the Greek, Hebrew, and Latine. And the Quakers have their Schools, that teach all these Naturals: but what is all this to know Christ and the things of God, which are Revealed by his Spirit? And Christ saith, Flesh and Blood had not revealed him to Peter, but his Father: and was not Peter's and the Jews Language Hebrew, that opposed Christ? And as for all thy foul Words, thou mightst have kept them at Home▪ for they are not worth Answering. But we challenge R. W. and all the New-England Priests to prove by Scripture, where-ever Christ or his Apostles charged one of their Believers with the Hor∣rible Crime of Laziness, for not studying the Original Languages, as the means, by which they might know the Scriptures and Christ, with∣out the Revelation of Christ and his Spirit? R. W. And thou say'st; I judge, that G. F. with his Wild Spirit cannot prove, that Pilate had the Hebrew, Greek and La∣tine. Answ. That is not the Matter in hand: for G. F. his proof was, That the Scriptures are known again by the same Inspiration: and that is thy part and the New-England Priests, to disprove,
that Pilate had not the Hebrew, Greek and Latine, which he caused to be set up upon Christ, when he Crucifyed him. R. W. And thou say'st; Thou knows, that the Devil abounds in Tongues, and can speak all Languages; and I know and have seen his Inspirations, Three thousand Verses, in a shew very Heavenly inspired by him, by an English VVoman of this Country. Answ. But what this English Woman is, thou hast not named in thy long Story of her. And it's like, thou art more acquain∣ted with the Devil and his Works, than with Divine Inspiration: and if he knoweth all Languages, what is this in opposition to G. F, that saith, The Scripture is known by the same Inspiration, that gave them forth? But I believe, the Devil and thee art little acquainted with this Inspiration; if thou werest, thou wouldst not give G. F. so much foul Language, that holdeth it forth. And it's like, this VVoman thou speakest of, is one of your own People; for if she had been a Quaker, we should have had her Name in Print before now. And the Apostles were Inspired by the Holy Ghost with Tongues: and if the Lord should Inspire any now, I question not, but you would say, It was of the Devil. But we charge thee and the New-England Priests, to shew us by Scrip∣ture, where Christ or his Apostles commanded to set up Schools, and to Study Tongues and Languages, and then go to Preach? for the Scripture saith, That they had sometimes Interpreters (as 1 Cor. 14): and if they had not, they were to be silent. R. W. And whereas thou say'st; Thou art sure, that we talk (like little Children) without the least Knowledge at all (gene∣rally) of any thing but ther Mother English;p. 45. and yet so proudly and imperiously vapouring and triumphing &c: and yet thou say'st; I perceive, that John Stubs was a Scholar; and had Hebrew, Greek, and Latine; [He was a Quaker, that disputed with thee.] Answ. And what Contradictions are these R. W! And what canst thou tell, what they do in their grave Consultations? what doth Roger make himself here? But what is all this as knowing the Scriptures again by Inspiration? and the Quakers can praise God, for what they are through his Grace. — And then thou tellest a Story of Theora John, and say'st; The Quaker's Inspi∣rations are like unto his: Nay, this thou might'st have kept at home; for we own no Inspiration, but by the sam Holy Ghost that gave forth Scriptures.
R. W. And thou say'st; G. F. is no wiser in affirming, that the Tongues came in place f the Spirit since the Apostacy: for be∣fore the Apostacy the Lord furnished his Servants with the Vnder∣standing of several Languages miraculously; and with the Apostacy those Heavenly miraculous Gifts ceased. Answ. And therefore you have studied the Tongues in the Apo∣stacy, and set them up in place of the Spirit: but are not the Gifts of the Spirit known again out of the Apostacy? And is In∣spiration known by studying Natural Languages? and what is this to the purpose of the Apostles knowing Tongues by Inspiration? G. F. opposeth not that; by which Inspiration they gave forth Scriptures: which Inspiration maketh wise. And thou confessest, The Devil can speak all Languages: so if you study to know all Languages, they are but Natural things, and are you any thing wiser with your Natural Languages than he? for can any know the Prophet's, and Christ's and the Apostle's Words, and Christ, but by Revelation of the Holy Spirit and Inspiration — the things of God? R. W. And thou say'st; In the Apostacy the Father of Spirits gave to his Two Witnesses Power, and Authority, and Abili∣ty &c. Answ. But prove this out of the Revelations, that the Lord Commanded them to set up Schools and Colledges to learn Lan∣guages to set up Ministers: for the Papists (that thou speakest of) had Schools and Colledges to make Ministers, before Calvin and Luther rose; and so have you. And as for the true Protestants and Martyrs, that suffered Persecution (as we have done by the same Spirit of New-England) we own all those true Protestants▪ and how the Lord upheld them in their Testimony: and this is nothing to you Proessors of New-England, who are found like these Foxes and Popish Spirits, worrying the Lambs, and speaking e∣vi of things you know not. R. W. And thou say'st; Thou wilt not discourage the weakst Eng∣lish Man or Woman (in Christian Humility) to sound forth the Praise of God in Writing, Speaking and Printing in English, what they have Experimented of the Son of God &c: And then thou Contradictest thy self, and hast been speaking against He-Apostles and She-Apostles of the Quakers, speaking by the same Spi∣rit: and thou say'st; But when they lift up their Horns on high (or their Bruitish Ears, as Foxes do, instead of Horns) then I
must tell G. F, that although he prattles amongst the English, and they be cheated with his dying Spirit &c. Answ. As for Cheating and dying Spirit, R. W. may keep at home, with the Bruitish Ears thou speakest of, and his and the New-England Men's Horns. For it is with the Holy Spirit of God, that we do exalt the Horn of our Salvation; through which Spirit we have had Experience of his Son, and of his Light, Faith, and Mer∣cy and Grace manifested to us: and this we have been moved of the Lord to Speak, VVrite and Print; which hath made the dark Spirit in thee and the New-England Priests to rage and per∣secute. And it was not a Simple Pretending (as thou scoffingly say'st) of some of our going to the Turk and Pope; but a Motion of God, whether they will hear or forbear. But R. W. may Rail against them behind their Backs in his Tongues and Languages, but before their Faces he dare not shew his Face: and therefore the Laz Spirit he had better applyed at Home. R. W. And then thou say'st; They must either be furnished with the Gifts of Tongues Miraculously &c; or else they must fling off their Lazy Devil, and Study the Tongues of other Nations, to whom they carry their (pretended) Glad News. Answ. Is the Devil Lazy, and can speak all Languages, as R. W. saith? Must the Quakers study the Tongues to Preach the Glad News? and what, if they have them already? Did none speak by Interpreters? read 1 Cor. 14. And what, if they can speak all these Tongues, and be out of the Spirit of Inspiration, that gave forth Scriptures, and Revealeth the Son, it would but bring People into a Form, like the New-England Professors and others, and to speak of Heaven, and Hell, and Grace (as thou say'st) like the Parrot (in thy 35 Page). So, compare this with thy 45 Page and see, what a great rambling thou hast made against G. F.'s. Words to no purpose, who saith, [The Scripture must be known by the same Inspiration, that gave them forth]; and for all thou hast said, thou hast not disproved it. And the Glad News of Christ and his Gospel was and is Preached by his Spirit: for the false Christs and VVolves may get the Sheeps-cloathing, as you Priests have done, and have worryed the Lambs in New-England. R. W. Bringeth M. Bines (fol. 86.) saying [Notwithstanding thy passing through the First and Second Resurrection (as he saith) there remains a Torment for thee at the last Day,p. 46. and Woe. And G. F. Answ. [They are blessed, that
have Part in the First Resurrection, the Second Death hath no Power over them; but are made free from Wrath that is to come, and are passed from Death to Life: and are translated into the Kingdom of the Son of God; and are in Union with the Son of God and the Father both]. R. W. replyeth and saith; G. F. arrogates to himself and his Foxians, a passing through the First and Second Resurrection; he triumphs in their Blessedness pronounced to their First Resurrection, viz. of Communion with God, and Freedom from VVrath to come. Answ. The Reader may see, how R. W. falsly applyeth the Priest's Words to G. F, which speaketh of the First and Second Resur∣rection: but doth G. F. mention the Word of passing through the Second Resurrection? For doth not John say in the Revelations (and is it Arrogancy in him?) Blessed and Holy is he that hath part in the First Resurrection, on such the Second Death hath no Power; for they are Priests of God &c, (Revel. 20)? And doth not the Apostle say (Rom. 5, 9,) We shall be saved from Wrath through him (to wit, Christ &c)? and, Thanks be to Jesus, which hath de∣livered us from Wrath to come (1 Thess. 1, 10)? and (Chap. 5, 9) God hath not appointed us to Wrath? And the Saints had Fellowship with the Father and the Son (1 John 1)? And R. W. saith; That G. F. is in his Burrough of Words of di∣vers Significations &c. Nay Roger, G. F's. Words are plain; and thou art in thy Burrough, that seest them not. And then thou say'st; G. F. wrests and winds, what is for his wicked Ends. This is false, and thy own Condition; and wherein doth he wrest, when he speaketh plain Scripture? R. W. And thou say'st; You shall never take him in distinguishing and defining, what is the First and Second Death, and what is the First and Second Resurrection. Answ. What need he, when John hath plainly deined and distin∣guished it in his Revelations? R. W. And thou say'st; The Truth is, as soon as they hearken to this Familiar Spirit, they are so elevated, that they be in Heavenly Glory: the Resurrection is past, and (with K. Agag's Dream) the Bitterness of Death and Wrath is past for ever with them. Answ. This thou mightst have applyed at home, with thy Fa∣miliar Spirit, thou speakest of. And dost thou not here again a∣buse G. F's. Words? doth he say here, That the Resurrection is past? and are they not the Priest's M. B's. Words of Passing
through the First and Second Resurrection? But where doth the Scripture say, They that have part in the First Resurrection, there remaineth a Torment for such at the last day and VVo, as the Priest saith? thou shouldst have made this good by Scripture. And as for the Thorns and Thistles, thou may'st keep them at home, which grow in thy own Nature. R. W. And thou say'st; If we talk of Escaping Wrath to come, and of Enjoying Blessedness, we must prove it to others, as well as to our selves. Answ. Roger, thou and the New-England Professors have no more Ears to hear it, than the Jews had to hear Christ and his A∣postles, who said, Chirst had a Devil: and Paul was a Babler, and a Pestilent Fellow. R. W. And thou tellest us; That the Expectation of the Jews and the Mahometans expecting a Catnal Blessedness to come, is false: and We must prove, Papists and Common Protestants (for all their Prayers and Alms &c.) are under that Sentence, Depart from me, ye Workers of Iniquity. Answ. Thou didst very well Roger, to confess thy self (at last) to be One of them; and we do believe, thou hast spoken forth thy own Sentence. But dost thou believe, that none of the Pa∣pists and Common Protestants will repent? and Jews and Mahome∣tans? Cold Charity, Roger! R. W. And thou say'st; The Lord Jesus being ask'd about the great Point of Salvation, he seems to answer two things, 1. That the Most will hang their Souls upon the Hedge, and venture like the High∣ways and Hedges &c. Answ. We do charge R. W. and the rest of the Priests in New-England to make this good by Scripture, where ever Christ said, They hanged their Souls upon Hedges, and ventur'd like the High∣ways ways and Hedges? or else acknowledge, thou hast abused Christ's words, as well as G. F's. R. W. And thou say'st; Some will endeavour to seek to enter (I judge) both ews, Mahometans, Pagans, Papists and Protestants, and shall not be able. Answ. And why did'st thou not put in thy self and the perse∣cuting Professours in New-England? And why shall they not en∣ter? is it not, because they do not believe in the Light, as Christ commandeth? therefore they do not Enter into the Rest because of Vnbelief (as in Hebrews)?
R. W. And thou say'st Of such, as are sensible of the Narrow∣ness of the Way, and Streightness of the Door, and the Infinite Necessity incumbing,p. 47. and the Infinite Excellency inviting, that fling away Preferments, Profits and Pleasures, and chuse to enjoy the Mediator, as lost and damned in our selves, and follow him from his Cradle and Manger to his Cross and Gallowses, and labouring to draw other poor drowning Souls out of the Pit of Eternal Rottenness and Howling with us. Answ. If R. W. and the New-England Professors were in this, as he saith, he and and they would never have been so Envious (as they have been) against the People called Quakers; for R. W's. Words, and the New-England Priests and Professors Acti∣ons give them the Lye. For he is persecuting God's People with his Tongue, and desireth, they may be punished: and the others have Haged them upon their Gallowses, and Banished and Whipt, and Spoiled Goods. And if this be a Spirit, that followeth Christ in his Cross, in his Straight way from his Manger, and Cradle and Cross to the Gallowses, who rebuked them, that would have had Men's Lives destroyed; and told them, They knew not, what Spirit they were of, and said, He cometh not to destroy Men's Lives, but to save them; let all the Sober Christians judge. R. W. And thou say'st; The Spirit of God tells us of three sorts of perisht Souls, 1. Those without the Law, of which are Millions of Millions innumerable. And yet thou say'st (Append. p. 28.) There is generally in all Mankind in the world a Conviction of an Invisible, and Omnipotent and Eternal Power and Godhead; and thou findest, all Men will confess, that the Mind of God is pure &c. that it was ever and is wickedness, to sin against it. All Mankind having the Law &c. Answ. How stand these together Roger, and with Rom 1, and 2, which thou say'st, The Spirit of God tells thee, that those without the Law are Millions of Millions innumerable? For if thou mean∣est the Outward written Law, whether that of God in the Gen∣tiles was not one with it, which did the things contained in the Law? R. W. And then thou say'st; 2. Such as had the Law and VVill of God revealed to them in the Covenant of VVork &c. 3. Of such, to whom Infinite Pity hath vouchsafed the Joyful Tidings of the Son of God his Mediation and Intercession &c. Answ. Art not thou and the New-England Professors like unto
the Jews, that had the Law of God, and did it not? that have the Joyful Tydings of the Son of God, his Mediation and Intercession &c. who dyed for Enemies, and ye persecute his Friends, like the Jews, that persecuted the Prophets, that had the Law? But what is all this to G. F's Words, [Blessed are they, that have part in the First Resurrection]? thou hast gone beside the Mat∣ter, which thou took in hand to reply to; for thou findest fault with G. F. for not defining and distinguishing, what the First and Se∣cond Death is; and yet thou hast not done it thy self. R. W. And thou tellest us of a Story of the Papists, and Prote∣stants against the Papists &c. Answ. This thou mightst very well applyed to thy self and the Professors in New-England, that are crying against the Bloody Pa∣pists, and ye have been as Bloody in this Age, as they. R. W. And thou say'st; These Quakers pretend the Highest, but no otherwise, then Thou O Capernaum, which art exalted &c. And thou say'st; Tyre and Sidon, Sodom and Gomorrah, and the poor Jews and Mahometans, yea the Papists and Common Prote∣stants shall have an easier Cup to drink, than these (thou here and often else-where callest Foxians) that are so high, pure and lofty, yet abound with Luciferian Filthiness. Answ. R. W, as thou Judgest, thou wilt be Judged; thou wouldst have it so: but none of these things thou hast proved, but mis∣applyed Christ's Words; which is to thy self. And as for Caper∣naum, Tyre, Sidon and Sodom &c. it may be well said to thee and the New England Professors, who would neither hear Christ nor his Servants, but slew them. And as for our Cup, trouble not thy self with it, who know the Cup of Christ's Suffering, and the Cup of Salvation; who learn of Christ to be Meek and Low, and to deal truly with Hypocrites. And as for Luciferian Filthiness, thou mightst have kept that at home. And Christ doth teach and exhort, and maketh his People Clean by his Blood; and they can praise God for it, though thou scoffest at God's Work and them: and we know, that Christ hath taught thee none of this foul Lan∣guage. R. W. And thou bringst M. Bines (Fol. G. F. p. 89.) saying [The Saints are neither in the Fulness of the Godhead, nor in part; away with this Blasphemy, that saith, this is]. G. F. Answ. The Work of the Ministry was, To bring People to the Knowledge of the Son of God, to a perfect Man; to the Vnity of the Faith,
to the Measure and Stature of the Fulness of Christ; and Christ would dwell in the Saints, and God would dwell in them. And thou say'st, They have no part of the Fulness of the Godhead; but John saith, Of his Fulness we all have received, in whom dwelleth the Godhead bodily. And ye be all in the Blasphemy, that be out of this part of his Fulness]. R. W. replyeth to G. F. and saith; It was an Horrible Crime, which the Jews, though ma∣liciously and falsly objected against the Lord Jesus, that he being a Man makes himself God. Answ. Who denyeth this, but the Jews did so? and what is this to the purpose? but was Christ ever the worse for their Blas∣phemy? or his Servants the worse for thy Railing against them, and for New-England Professor's persecuting of them? R. W. And whereas thou say'st; VVhat shall we say to these Bruitish, Blasphemous vile Worms of the Earth, Yesterday creeping out of their Holes, Slaves, Hell-hounds (as we all by Na∣ture are) so horribly to set their Faces (as David speaks) against the Heavens,p. 48. vapouring themselves to be in the God∣head, and that also Bodily: so that what was applicable to the Body of the Son of God, is proper and applicable unto them &c. Answ. Let the Reader read G. F's. Answer and see, if there be any Colour for him to forge these Words, That which was appli∣cable to the Son of God, we should take to our selves? Or, is there any thing, that G. F. saith, The Saints are in the Fulness of the Godhead? but as the Apostle said, What was the Work of their Ministry, which was for the perfecting of the Saints &c. and the Edifying of the Body of Christ, till we all come in the Unity of the Faith, and the Knowledge of the Son of God, and unto a Perfect Man, and unto the Measure of the Stature and Fulness of Christ. And John saith (1 Joh. 16.) Of his Fulness have we received Grace for Grace. And the Apostle speaking of Christ saith; He hath put all things under his Feet, who gave him to be Head over all things to the Church, which is his Body, the Fulness of him, that filleth all in all: And the Apostle saith; To know the Love of Christ, which passeth Knowledge, that ye might be filled with all the Fulness of God (Ephes. 1, 23; and 3, 19) And the Apostle saith; In him (to wit, Christ) dwelleth all the Fulness of the Godhead bodily; and ye are compleat in him, which is the Head &c. (Coloss. 2, 9): was the Apostle a Blasphemer, and a Hell-hound &c. that spoke
these Words? and doth not the Apostle say, That God will dwell in his Saints? read Coloss. both the 1. and 2. Epist. And as for Setting Face against Heaven, with all thy bad Words and Lan∣guages thou might'st have kept at Home. R. W. And thou say'st; See the horrible Egyptian Darkness, the Lord hath justly poured upon these feigned Goshenites, they exclaim against us for using the word God-man, and ask us, where we find such a Phrase in Scripture? [and why should you not prove by the Scripture, what you do say?] And thou say'st; They rest not in the Title Immanuel, God with us; nor the Fulness of the Godhead bodily in Christ [that is Scripture-Language]. And R. W. saith; But Sacrilegious Robbers (in effect) Arrogate to themselves to be God-men and God-women, the Godhead dwelling in them Bo∣dily. Answ. We do charge R. W. or any of the New-England Pro∣fessors, to shew out of our writings, and name the Persons, that ever spoke any such Language; but as the Scripture saith▪ Christ dwells in his Saints, and they shall sup with him; and they are the Temples of God. And this the Scripture declareth, which we are Wit∣nesses of, praised be the Lord for ever. R. W. And thou say'st; Whereas G. F. here saith, The Work of the Ministry was, to bring the Saints to a Perfect Man; he grosly abuses that Heavenly Eph. 4, which concerns the Fulness and Perfecti∣on of all the Elect of God &c. Answ. Then were not the Ephesians concerned? And doth G. F. mention the Ephesians only in his Answer? are not his Words ge∣neral? so the Gross Abuse is thy own, and not G. F.'s. R. W. And thou say'st; Applying it to every particular delud∣ed Convert of theirs, as being as much Holy, as much God as Christ Jesus &c. Answ. Let the Reader see G. F's Answer, if R. W. hath not gros∣ly Abused his Words here again? for there are no such Words in his Answer of the Saints being as much God, as Christ. But doth not the Apostle say, That we may present every Man Perfect in Christ Jesus, Col. 1. 28.? And He spoke Wisdom among them that were Perfect, 1 Cor. 2, 6? And Col. 4, 12, That ye may stand Perfect and compleat in all the Will of God. And doth not God and Christ exhort to Holiness and Perfection? and Without Holi∣ness none shall see the Lord. And Christ saith; Be ye Perfect, as your Heavenly Father is Perfect, (Matth. 5) and must they not be
perfect in their Love and Measure of the Spirit of God, which they have from him the Fountain, who are Sealed by his Holy Spirit of Promise, Ephes. 1, 13: and 1 Thes. 4, 8? And doth not Peter say, Ye are a Royal Priesthood, and Holy Nation, (1 Pet. 2, 9)? and doth not the Apostle Paul call the Saints Holy Bre∣thren (1 Thess. 5, 26, 27)? And their hands were to be Holy, that they lifted up to God (1 Tim. 2). And (2 Tim. 1) the Lord cal∣led them with a Holy Calling: and (1 Pet. 1) Be ye Holy in all manner of Conversations; Be ye Holy, for I am Holy, saith the Lord. So, is not the Vessel to be Holy, and Potle, that holdeth the Heavenly Treasure of his Spirit, which they have from the Ho∣ly God, the Fountain? But to say, The Saints are as much God, as Christ,, I ask thee, how the little Vessels or Potles can contain him, who filleth Heaven and Earth? But what is thy end in all this? that thou wouldst not have God and Christ dwell in his Saints by his Spirit, and by his Faith. R. W. Thou say'st; I may use the Exprobrations of Moses against Korah, Dothan and Abiram; Is it not enough for you, but ye will seek the Priesthood also? Answ. This thou mightst well have applyed to thy self, and the Priests of New-England, and not to the Quakers: for it is through the Grace and Mercy of God, that we are, what we are. R. W. And thou say'st; Is it not enough, that the Most-High Potter hath made us Men and Women, and not Serpents and Toads, and not Pagans, Turks, Jews, Papists, but English Prote∣stants. Answ. Are not the New-England Priests and thou in the same Nature and Spirit (that the Turks, Pagans, Jews and Papists) that persecute with Tongue and Hands, yea to DEATH, as witness the New-England Laws? and did not Christ call the per∣secuting Jews Serpents, and of their Father the Devil, that did not do the Works of Abraham? and what may be said to you, that do not do the Works of true Christians? R. W. And further thou say'st; We must also be Infinites, Eternals, Omniscients &c. Answ. If thou chargest this upon the Quakers, we say, they are Words of thy own forging; and do challenge thee to make it good out of the Quakers Writings, or name the Persons that said so: which we know thou canst not. R. W. And further thou say'st; Will not the infinite Favour of
Leave, to drink of some Heavenly Drops of the Infinite and Incon∣civable Ocean of his Goodness. satisfie and content us; but we will be Gods with the Devil, and our first Parents, we will be the Incon∣ceivable Ocean it self. Answ. I never did hear such Lies before come out of a Man's Mouth, that any of the People of God used any such terms, as, They were the Inconceivable Ocean it self, and that they would be Gods. They might say, they were God's People, and he would dwell in them; and, Christ was in them, and all their Springs were in him: and this is according to Scripture. But let the Reader see, if there be any such Occasion in G. F's. Answer for him to use this forging Language. And if thou werest one of those proud Rebels (thou speakest of) that was fetcht from the Gallows by the Smile of a Prince, thou would never have used these Expressions against us. But thou say'st; They must be the Prince and King himself: Thou hast not proued this; though we must tell thee, Christ makes his Redeemed Saints both Kings and Priests, to Reign over the Deuil, and offer up Spiritual Sacrifice to God, (Revel. 1). R. W. And thou say'st; The Pagans of the World, as they are wild to all Civility, so to all Divinity, and Heavenly mat∣ters. And then thou tellest a great Story,p. 49. what they Wor∣ship, Lyons, Dragons &c. And such as cryed out of Paul and said, he was a God &c. And thou say'st; They apprehend a Doity, (it's like thou meanest a Deity, if thou hadst Printed it right) &c. Answ. And what is all this to the purpose, to prove, that the Saints did not receive of Christ's Fulness, and grow up to a per∣fect Man? For may be some of us have read the Story of these things, as well as thou: but thou shouldst have brought Paul's Answer to those. R. W. And thou say'st; It pleased the Most-High &c. often to meet with Pharaohs, Absoloms, Nebuchadnezars, Hamans, Herods of this World, with Nations, Cities, Armies for their Pride, as he did with Sodom with remarkable Strokes of Judgment &c. Answ. Let thee and New-England take heed of this, who boast your selves against God's People, Sons and Servants; take heed, that God's Remarkable Stroke do not come upon you: for be sure it will, if you do not find a day of Repentance. R. W. And thou say'st; Paul in danger to be pufft up in Voices
and Questions out ef the Whirle-wind &c. Answ. But it were well, if R. W. saw himself, then he would not be against the Quakers, who say, God's Grace is sufficient both to teach and bring Salvation. R. W. And thou say'st; Till we more and more come to see, how Perfect we are in Dirt and Stink, and Filth and Death and Hell, Crawling like Monsters of Pride and Self-conceitedness upon this Earth &c. Answ. It seemeth, you do not see your Stink to the full yet, of Filth, Death and Hell, and your Crawling, monstrous Pride of Self-conceitedness: and how should you without the Light of Christ, which giveth the Knowledge of Christ, and his Blood, that cleanseth from Sin, and maketh their Garments white. R. W. And thou bring'st M. B. (Fol. 90.) saying, [There is a kind of Infiniteness in the Soul, which cannot be Infinite in it self]. And G. F. Answereth and asketh the Question [Is not the Soul without beginning, coming from God, returneth to God again, who hath it in his hand? which Hand goeth against him that doth Evil; which throweth down that which warreth against it. And Christ the Power of God, is not he the Bishop of the Soul, which bringeth it up unto God, which came out from him? and hath this a Beginning or Ending? Is not this Infinite in it self more then all the World?] R. W. replyeth, but he doth not answer G. F's. Questions, that he asketh; but falleth a rail∣ing, and saith, That the Soul or Spirit of Man should be boundless or without limits, without Beginning or Ending, and cryeth, A blas∣phemous Monster, begotten of Hellish Pride the Father, and Hellish Ignorance the Mother: And thus Roger falleth a Railing instead of Answering. And then thou say'st; For Infinity and Infiniteness in that Sense can be no other, but the Infinite and Eternal Power and Godhead, transcending the Capacity of Men or Angels to receive it, or conceive the Nature of it. Answ. Did not the Apostles receive Christ by his Spirit, in whom the Eternal Power and Godhead dwelt? how did they preach Christ then both in his Flesh and Divinity? But what is this to G. F's. Question? he doth not say, That the Soul is God or Christ, and his Eternal Godhead; but he asketh the Question, Whether the Soul did not come out from God, that is, from his Breath, who breathed into Man the Breath of Life, and he became a Living Soul? and whether or no the Souls of the Righteous do not return to Christ and God?
R. W. And thou say'st; It is true in a Secondary way (a Po∣steriori) as they say, the Spirit of Angels and Men are as Lamps, lighted up by the most-High and Infinite Majesty never to go out or be extinguished in Joy or Sorrow &c. Answ. And dost not thou call the Spirits of Men the Soul? now if the Lighted Spirits of Men &c. by the most-High and In∣finite are never to go out, as thou confessest, that the Spirits of Men &c. are Lighted, and never go out; are they not Infinite then in a Secondary way? R. W. This Notion dazles the most sober and steady Eye and Brain &c. [If G. F's. Question dazle the Eye and Brain, it's like it doth thine.] And then thou tellest a Story of Emperours, and the Sun and Moon, and Days and Nights &c. And thou say'st; All have their Hitherto and No further,p. 50. by the Infinite Eternal Arm [The Quakers do not deny that]. And thou say'st; Of all the Opinions of the Soul's Being and Rise, this of In∣finity, making it God himself &c. and this is to destroy Souls, and the Infinite God himself. Answ. How can G. F's Question destroy Souls or destroy God? for can he be destroyed? no; he is a DESTROYER of the De∣stroyer: for G. F. in his Question doth not say, the Soul is God. Mag. Bine affirmeth, that there is a kind of Infiniteness in the Soul; but what kind of Infiniteness it is, R. W. hath not explained: whether it be Infinite in it self, or Finite. And Job. 22, 5, Is not thy VVickedness great, and thy Iniquities Infinite? R. W. will not say, that this Infinite VVickedness was God, because he useth the Word Infinite. And Habbakuk saith; Ethiopia and Egypt were her Strength, and it was Infinite (Nahum 3): now thou canst not say, that this was God, because he useth the Word Infinite: neither canst thou say, The Soul is God, because M. B. saith, There is a kind of Infiniteness in the Soul. And G. F. asketh, Whether it be not Infinite in it self, and more than all the World? And doth not Job say, In whose Hand (to wit, the Lord's) is the Soul of every living thing, and the Breath of all Mankind (Job. 12.9)? And is not Christ called the Bishop and Shepheard of the Souls of the Saints (1 Pet. 2, 25)? and if Christ be the Shepheard and the Bishop, is not he both the Nourisher and Feeder of the Immor∣tal Soul? And what! dost not thou confess, the Soul is Immortal: and that which is Immortal, is not that Everlasting? and now would it be well for G. F. to conclude and to say, that R. W. saith, The
Soul is the Everlasting God, acording to thy own Argument? nay, G. F. hath more Charity. And doth not R. W. acknowledge the Soul to be Immortal, and the Souls of the Godly going unto Jesus? and their Bodies uniting to the Spirit in Eternal Life? Well then, what doth R. W. make of the Bodies of the Saints, who is so offended at G. F's. Question, because he asketh, whether the Soul be not Infinite in it self? and yet R. W. saith; We use to say Hyperbolically, that such and such a doing is Infinite Pride. But if G. F. should have said, Thou makest Pride God, thou wouldst have been offended, who art offended at this Question, who asketh, Whether the Soul be not Infinite? and thou callest him a Blas∣phemer: and yet thou say'st, Pride is Infinite. And we know, that the Word Infinite properly belongeth to God: David saith, His Vnderstanding is Infinite: and thou say'st; God proclaims his Infi∣nite Power and VVisdom &c. Now my Question is to R. W and the Priests of New-England: VVhether the Prophets and Apostles of God did receive any of his Infinite VVisdom and Power by his Spirit from above, though God be Infinite and Incomprehensible in himself in all his VVisdome and Goodness and Justice? And did not God say, That Job was Perfect, though he abhorred himself in Dust and Ashes? And thou confessest, that God is not only In∣finite, but Infinity it self, Omnipotency it self, VVisdome it self, Goodness it self, Justice it self in all their Eminencies &c. But G. F. doth not say, the Soul is so: and if thou didst own this in deed and in truth, thou wouldst not speak against the Quakers. And a great deal of Rambling thou makest concerning the Soul, but thou hast not Answered G. F's. Questions, Whether the Soul be in God's Hand? Whether Christ be the Bishop of it? And whe∣ther the Souls of the Righteous Christ brings to God? or whe∣ther the Soul did come out from God's Breath? R. W. bringeth R. S. who saith, [The Mystical Body may be sometimes subject to Distempers, and Humours, and VVants.] And G. F. answereth,p. 51. and questioneth [Are you Judges? can you judge of the Mystical Body, which the Saints are Baptized into? are there Humours, Wants and Distempers in the Body, which the Saints are Baptized into? are not the Wants, Distempers and Humours in your Bodies? Do you here in this divide the Word aright? or distinguish things in the Ground, and speak right of things? and yet ye would not be judged, and say, Judge not: and is not Mystical Spiritual?] —
R. W. replyeth and saith, W. Edm. affirmed, God was a Spirit lite∣rally and properly. Answ. Wilt thou say, That God is not a Spirit, as literally and properly as the Scripture declareth him? And thou say'st again, That W. Edm. shewed but little Philosophy and Divinity. Doth not the Apostle bid the Saints, Beware of Philosophy? and if they had known God and Divinity by it, the Apostle would not have bid∣den them, beware of it, surely. And thou say'st, That W. Edm. affirmed, that properly and really that Scripture of Wolves coming in Sheeps-Cloathing, was to be understood Literally without Mean∣ing. And what meaning wilt thou give to Christ's Words? are not Men called Wolves really, that worry Christ's Sheep about Religion? for Christ doth not say, They are Wolves with four Feet; and when Christ spoke Parables, he said, He that hath an Ear, let him hear: and sometimes he expounded them to his Disciples. And the Scripture calling God a Father and a Husband, and Christ a Rock: and Christ's Believers are called a Body, a House, a Flock, are they not really so? for it doth not say, They are a Flock of Sheep as outwardly, or other Creatures, nor an outward House &c. — And then thou goest on with a great Tale, and tell'st, What the Papists hold, and what is amongst them. Roger, though thou and you of New-England are separated from the Church of Rome, yet you are found in the same Old Spirit of Persecution. R. W. And whereas thou say'st; By God's holy and wise Permis∣sion the Devil sends out his old known Spirit of pure Invi∣sibles, and pure Immediate,p. 52. and pure Worshippers in Spirit and Truth. Answ. Roger, do not Blaspheme against the Holy Spirit of God. For is not God's Spirit and Truth Holy and Pure, in which he is Wor∣shipped? and is not God's Holy Spirit Invisible, or is it Mediate? R. W. And thou say'st; This Spirit (to wit, of the Quakers) be∣ing Cozen German to, or Sworn Brother in Hellish Equivocation with the Jesuites &c. Answ. These are thine and the New-England Priests Conditions, as your Fruits have declared it: for the Quakers obey the Com∣mands of Christ, who saith, Swear not at all. R. W. For thou say'st; The Quakers Churches, they are (as they Childishly vapour) Bodies without Wants or Distempers &c. Answ. Reader see, if there be any such Words in G. F's. Answer: for G. F. speaketh of the Mystical or Spiritual Body, he doth not
speak of Naturals, nor Bodies of outward Families, or Bodies of Nations and Cities, or Armies: Nor Visible Churches, nor the Bo∣dy of Visible Churches, but the Spiritual Body. For doth not the Apostle speak of a Spiritual Body, and a Natural Body? and so it is God, that doth supply both. And G. F. doth not speak of the outward Bodies of the Saints; for is that Mystical? R. W. And then thou say'st; What known Divisions and Passions about J. Naylor's and others Cases? what Envyings, Cur∣sings, Apostasies and Moral Idolatry:p. 53. as that of Covetous∣ness in this Colony known notoriously? Answ. Thou hast not particulariz'd who they be, and what is their Covetousness, who is known so notoriously (as thou say'st) in that Colony; therefore we look upon this as a Slandering of thy Neighbours: for we question, whether thou hast admonished them (if it was so) before thou told the World. And as for Cursings, and Envyings and Divisions, thou mightst have kept that amongst you New-England Professors: but if any one do not walk, as becometh the Gospel, we do Admonish them. And if there be any Difference about outward Matters, according to the Apostle's Doctrine, we do end it amongst our selves, according to Truth and Righteousness, 1 Cor. 6; and God hath given us Judgment in such Matters, as well as Spiritual. R. W. And thou say'st; I have fairly Collected, that the Spirit of the Quakers tends to Incivility and Barbarisme; and to suddain As∣sassinations, Murthers and Persecutions. Answ. This is thine and the New-England Spirits, whose Per∣secution is known, for you have proved it already. And thou wouldst have us punished, and yet thou wouldst not have it called Persecution (as in thy 200 page). Is not your Law standing, by which you Murdered God's People; and do not your Laws, and thy stirring up to Punishment, Collect or declare your own Spi∣rit not to be the Spirit of Christ? for where would it have any to be punished for Matters of Religion and Conscience towards God? And so as for thy Lies and abusive Speeches, we can say, The Lord forgive thee, if it be his Will. R. W. And thou say'st; I believe, that I have, and can further make it good, that the Eternal Father of Mercies stops millions of Mischiefs in the world daily, which the Natures, Grounds and Principles of Men (and the Quakers Spirit also) now to turn and overwhelme the world withal.
Answ. Here thou hast manifested thy self to be of the Spirit of them that opposed Paul, who said, he was a Pestilent Fellow, and a Turner of the World upside down. And as for the Principles of Men beside the Quakers, they may answer for themselves: and thy Slanders may serve such, as are given up to believe Lies; but sober People that know us, will not receive nor believe thy Lies: but it will make more to believe the Truth, which thou canst not stop. But let the Reader see, if R. W. in all his Rambling Reply hath said any thing to the Spiritual or Mystical Body, which was G. F's. Question. R. W. And thou bringst J. Clapham his saying, [Men may be called of Men Masters, and it is but a Cavel to deny it: and they may deny to be called Father, as well as Master]. And G. F. Ans. [Thou hast in this denyed the Doctrine of Christ, and slighted it, who saith; Be not ye called of Men Master, for ye have all one Master, which is Christ, and ye are all Brethren: and thou hast shewed thy self out of that Brotherhood. And there is a Birth to be born, which calls no Man Father upon Earth, which thou art ignorant of]. And R. W. replyeth and falleth a Rail∣ing, and calleth it G. Foxs's lame Answer. Answ. Let the Reader see, if it be not Christ's Doctrine; which he might as well have called Christ's Doctrine Lame, which he Preached to his Disciples. R. W. And thou say'st; Among other Foolish Passions and Af∣fections haunting all Men (and the Quakers especially) these two are notorious, (viz.) Pride, and a lazy Ignorance; these two are the Sir and Dame of most of these Wild Monsters. Answ. R. W. might have kept this at home, for it is his own Condition, who kicketh at Christ's Doctrine, that G. F. brings, who saith; Neither be ye called of Men Master, for one is your Master even Christ, and ye are all Brethren. And he manifests himself to be in the steps of the Pharisees, who love to be called of Men Rabbi. And so for his Foolish Passion and Pride &c. and Lazy Ignorance, and wild, Monstrous Spirit he may apply at home; who doth not obey Christ's Doctrine. — And we know, that those Opposites have written against Christ's Doctrine, (who love to be called of Men Masters) and against us, because we hold it forth. — And is it Scornful Pride, and a Robbing all Mankind of their due, to obey Christ's Doctrine (as thou speakest of)? for thou say'st of their due Respects and favourable
Glaunces of God's Care, of Order and Prudent Distinctions and Dif∣ferences amongst the Sons of Men in Families, Cities, Nations, Armies, Natives &c. Answ. Doth G. F. mention any of these, either Families, Cities, Nations, &c? for G. F. speaketh, how Christ taught his disciples, that they should not be called of men Masters: And did Christ Rob them of all these titles, and break God's care or order, when he said, Be not yet called of men Ma∣sters? R. W. Thou sayst: Sure he cannot but Remember, and his own, and all the Light in the Quakers (if seriously minded) will tell them, that in robbing all the world of their severall due, moderate and so∣ber Titles and Respects, they do it but by a Judgling Hocas Pocas, a back door, &c. rob all others of their Points, Ribbonds and Laces &c. Answ. You may see, what work R. W. maketh here agaiast Christ's doctrine to his disciples, and how like the Scribes and Pharisees and Hypocrites he appeareth? it's like, R. W. and the New-England Priests are offended, because the People called Quakers do not call them Masters. And thou sayest; The Pope and the Quakers are compared. Nay, R. W. is nearer unto them, who pleadeth to be called of men Master, like the Papists; for their Jesuites and Priests are called of men Master, and plead for it, as thou dost, and callest them Civill Respects: and therefore it is plain, that thou art found in their Spirit. R. W. And then thou say'st; The Dogged and Scornful Qua∣kers are far from, their Spirit being prouder than the Pa∣pists. And thou Contradicts thy self and say'st;p. 54. The Pope and Quakers compared. Answ. For the People of God called Quakers, obeying the Doctrine of Christ, cannot call your Teachers Masters; and if you did not love it Pharisee-like, you would never make such work about it: and Christ hath interpreted, what the Master signifieth. And did Christ only condemn the Pharisees, and not such as your Teachers, for being called of Men Masters? did not he teach his own Disciples the contrary? R. W. And thou say'st; The Foxians itch, of being called of Men Masters &c. in Religion, undervaluing and slighting o∣thers. Answ. These are False Charges, as our Practice declareth it.
R. W. And then thou tellst a Story of James Naylor, and what one should call G. F. Answ. But who that One is, thou hast not declared. And as for James Naylor, he Repented, and the World knoweth it: there∣fore it's no Credit for thee to Publish that. R. W. Thou say'st; Half a Humane and sober Eye may see, that in all his Declamations against the Pharisaical or Popish, or Foxians Rabbies &c. Answ. These are Railing Accusations. For where do the Qua∣kers own that Title Rabbi, as they are Preachers of Christ (as thou and the Pharisees and the Papists do) thou speakest of, in a Religious Account, as they were Teachers? but in a Civil Account, as Fathers, Masters and Mothers by Children and Servants, we never deny this in a Civil account, but practise it. But what is this to oppose Christ's Doctrine, and not to obey his Command, which thou art now Fighting against? we believe, many a Priest could have wished, that Doctrine of Christ had been torn out of the Bible, it cutteth your Pride so. R. W. And thou say'st; How childishly doth Fox Answer this his Opposite, viz. That although it be unlawful to call Master, yet not unlawful to call Father: for there is a Birth, which his Op∣posite is ignorant of. Answ. We say, Yes, and thou too. But dost thou say, It is Childish for Christ to say, Call no Man Father upon the Earth, Matth. 23, 9? is not this Childishness or Ignorance in thee, to op∣pose his Doctrine? And did not the Disciples of Christ believe in the Light, and so became Children of Light? and as many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God? (John 12, Rom. 8) And this is according to true Christian Regeneration and Change. R. W. And thou say'st; Paul said, Though you have ten Thou∣sand Teachers, yet I have begotten you. Sure it is, their Immediate denyes the Mediate. Answ. What is all this to the purpose to oppose Christ's Doctrine in Matth. 23? But R. W. hath left out Paul's Instrument, through which he begot them, to wit the Gospel, which the Apostle saith, Is the Power of God unto Salvation (Rom. 1, and 1 Cor. 4, 15): and he told them, That they had not many Fathers in Christ: and why didst thou leave out that?
R. W. And thou say'st; How simple is that Consequence, that be∣cause God is an Extraordinary Father, therefore I may call all Men Fathers,p. 55. but not Masters, when God is both Father and Master; and both Titles are forbidden in a true Sense &c. Answ. And yet thou wilt not obey them thy self, but railest against the Quakers that do: and God is the Father of his People, and Christ is the Master of his Followers. But come R. W. and the New-England Priests, shew us a Scripture out of all the New-Testament of Master Matthew, Mr. Mark, Mr. Luke, Mr. John, or Mr. Peter, and Mr. Paul, and Mr. James &c? and if Roger Williams and the Priests of New-England will be called of Men Master, how is it, that they do not give the Title Master to the Apostles, when they read their Epistles, or to the Evangelists? And hast not thou written in thy Book, and applauded thy self to the World, how that one called thee Master Williams? and so hast set forth thy Title to the World, in opposition to Christ's Doctrine. R. W. Bringeth W. Thomas's saying, [Men are saved, but not by Christ within us]. G. F. (Fol. 106) Answereth W. T. [How is Man's Salvation wrought out, but by the Power of Christ within? How is the Old Man destroyed, but by Christ within? how is Justification felt, but by Christ within? Here he quotes G. F's Words falsly, saying [Seeds we manifest] to mak them Non-sense, which are not G. F's Words. And the Seed Christ made manifest, that suf∣fered without, is made manifest within, there is Redemption and Life. He that hath the Son of God, hath Life: Redemption to God out of the First Adam; and who feel Christ within, feel Salvation; and who do not, are Reprobates, though they may talk of him.] — R. W. replyes to G. F. and saith; This Subtle Fox is in his Bur∣rough, confounding (under the Term Christ) the Person of Christ, and the Love and Spirit und Grace or Fovour of Christ, as if they were all one. Answ. Let the Gentle Reader judge, Is not the Love, and Spi∣rit, and Grace and Favour of Christ to be manifest within, who suffered without? But let the Reader read my Words here, and mine in R. W's. Book, and compare them together and see, how many he hath left out. And see the Abusive Words of R. W.'s. who saith, Confounding under the Term of Christ the Person of Christ. &c.
And how can G. F. say, That Christ suffered without his Person without the Gates of Jerusalem, who yet is manifest with∣in his People, according to the Apostle's Doctrine? And it was the Favour of Christ and the Love of God, that Christ should die for Sinners; and it is the Love and Favour of God, that he should be made manifest in his People. R. W. And then thou tellest a story of a King, and General or Admiral, which is to no purpose: And the writings of G. F. where they come, there is not G. F. except he be there. Answ. But what is this to the purpose, that Christ, that suf∣fered without the Gates of Jerusalem, must not be manifest in his people by his Spirit? Many may have the Scriptures, that speak of Christ, but if they have not the Son, they have not Life; as John saith. And if thou owned'st that in the Truth, which is spoken of Ephes. 2. and Gal. 2. thou wouldst not oppose the Quakers. R. W. And thou confessest, Faith is given of God, &c. and this Faith and belief is wrought by Christ Jesus, and finished by him; and may with a good sence be called Christ himself. Answ. Let the sober Reader see, if G. F. do mention in his Answer (or any where else) that Christ is Faith; but the Authour and Finisher of it. And how can Faith be wrought in Men's Hearts, if Christ the Worker of it, be not there also by his Spirit? And then thou goest on in thy Story, and tellst us a Story of Humph.p. 56. Norton, That he resolved Christ only into a Spirit &c. This is like the rest of thy Slanders; for we do not believe thee, that Humphry Norton owned not the Man Christ Je∣sus: but the Question is, Whether R. W. and the New-England Priests will own Christ to be a quickning Spirit? And as for Paul's saying to the Corinthians, He was absent in Body, yet present in Spirit; this will prove, that Christ by his Spirit is in his People, though he be at the Right Hand of God. And then thou tellest us a Story of Souldiers to no purpose a∣gainst G. F's. Answer, of Christ being manifest in his Saints, that suffered without. And can any see Christ Jesus at the Right Hand of God, but by his Spirit and his Light within? did not Stephen see him by the Holy Ghost, and was not that within? And that is true, which was sent to them that stood gazing, As they saw him go, so should he come; (as in Acts 1, 10, 11,) which also said, Ye men of Gallilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? the same Je∣sus,
which is taken up from you into Heaven, shall come in like manner, as ye have seen him go into Heaven. And did not Christ, appear to his Disciples after his Ascension? and to Paul? and was manifest in his Saints? and will come and Reward eve∣ry man according to his Works, (as in Revelations.) And thou goest on, and usest many words, but to no purpose. And if Christ be felt in the bruised Reed, and the smoaking flax, and the poor in Spirit, and to feed the Hungry and Thirsty, is not this all within? and is not he the Hope of Glory manifested within his People? and doth not the sup with the Saints, and the Saints sup with him the Heavenly Supper? And doth not he stand at the door and knock? but you will not open, and cleave to his Light, and receive him. And without his Light you may seek Day and Night, and grope in the dark, and never find him. R. W. And thou sayst. There is a false Feeling of Christ, a false Conception in a Woman: and how many are bold to cry, Lord, Lord open, for we have Prophecy'd in thy Name. Answ. Truly Roger, this is thy own Condition and the New-England Priests and Professors, in the False Feeling and Concepti∣on, that do not believe in the Light, as Christ Commands; but persecute them that believe in the Light, and truly feel, and are be∣come Children of the Light, and have brought forth the true Birth, and are graffted into Christ. R. W. Thou say'st; I will not say as G. F. hath said, All that have not my Feeling or Working of Christ, are Repr∣bates. Answ. G. F's. Words are the Apostle's Doctrine, who saith, If Christ be not in you, you are Reprobates &c. (2 Cor. 13) and there∣fore he bids them, Prove and Examine themselves; and so it is every true Christian's Duty. R. W. And whereas thou say'st; Yet this I say, as Solomon, A Whore is loud and clamorous: [Truly R. W. thou art of her: for I never heard so many clamorous Words from a Man's Mouth in my Life, as from thine: but it is well thou hast shewed thy Spirit, which will be abhorred by all sober Men and Women.] — And then thou say'st; The Devil spoke as Holy and Heavenly VVords, as Angels could have spoken, yet it was but the Devil in Samuel's Mantle. Answ. R. W. this is thy own Condition; for thou may'st bring the Scriptures, as the Jews and the Devil did, that tempted Christ, and
oppose him, as the Jews did in they days of his flesh, as he being the man Christ: So now thou opposest his Divinity, and the divine Light, which is the Life in the Word, which Light his believers believed in, and which Light shines in their hearts, and gives them the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus (2 Cor. 4.) R. W. And thou bring'st Giles Ferman (G. F. Fol. 117.) Saying [Paul Swore after Christ, and the Angels Swore: I wonder Paul should so forget himself,p. 57. and Sin so fearfully in Swear∣ing. So the Quakers Light that denyes Swearing, is of Sa∣tan, and not the Light of Christ.] G. F. Answers to G. Ferman [Christ the Light (which Satan is out of) who is the Oath of God, endeth all Oaths Sworn by Prophets or Angels whatsoever: and who Swear, be fallen into the Condemnation of the Devil. And it is no where said, that Paul Swore; but such as thou art, matter not what you speak: So that spirit, that Preaches for Swearing, is not the spirit of Christ. But the Spirit of Anti-Christ Preacheth up that, which Christ and the Apostles Preached down, and Preached condemnation to them that Swear.] R. W. Replyeth. [though he hath left out, [Preacheth Condemnation to them that Swear] of G. F. words, and also hath left out, That which thou preachest up, to wit Swearing, Christ and the Apostles Preached down. So here and there thou hast taken some of G. F's Words] And further thou say'st, that G. F. dare not deny, but the Angel and Paul Swore after Christ; and yet thou say'st, that Christ put an end to Swearing, and that it is not said, that Paul Swore, and cal∣lest it G. F.'s old Song. Answ. Here thou contradicts thy self; for G. F. saith, It is no where said, that Paul Swore. And if the Angel did Swear, is it not said in the Scripture, I will bring forth my Begotten into the world, let all the Angels worship him; that saith, Swear not at all? But what is this to the purpose? the Command was to men, not to Swear, and to the Apostles; to whom Christ and the Apostle forbids all Swearing. R. W. And thou say'st; If the Attestation in the Name of God be the formality of an Oath, then if ever any man Swore in this world, Paul did, Saying to the Corinthians, I call God to Record on my Soul: &c. Answ. Roger doth not speak plainly, whether Paul Swore, or no, but is in his Ifs. And we know, that this, which Paul speaketh
to the Corinthians, will not be taken for an Oath. R. W. And thou tellest us, How Nations used to Swear, and ap∣pealed to the Gods &c: And how they used to put Creatures in the Room of God, as the Jews did: And some write out of a Super∣stitious Reverence, in forbearing the Name of God, and indeed the Reasons that Christ gives, look that way. Answ. Christ and the Apostles forbid all Oaths (as in Mat. 5. and Jam. 5.) not only to Creatures, but the Oathes that were to be performed to the Lord. R. W. Thou Say'st: There seemes to be a very fair Colour put on an universal prohibition of Swearing by Christ Jesus, by his Apostle James, Swear not &c. [Is it no more, but a seeming fair Co∣lour? are not Christ and the Apostle's words real?] and yet R. W. saith, I must proclaim against G. F. in his lame and simple Re∣turn to his Opposite Concerning Paul and the Angel:p. 58. and fur∣ther thou say'st, Why may not Paul and all the Apostles &c. and all the Angels of heaven, and all the Saints of God upon the Earth in Pauls words call God to Record upon their Souls &c. in case of Truth? Answ. Yes, they may, and G. F. doth not deny it: and if thou say'st, that was an Oath, thou art both Lame and Simple, and hast not proved it so. And as I said before, Christ forbidding Swear∣ing, and the Apostles, it was to men that had Oaths and Shaddows, yea and all Oaths were forbidden, as well as the true. And the Angel Swearing (in the Revelations) was, that time should be no longer &c. (Rev. 10.) but what is this to Christ's forbidding men not to Swear at all? And this we can say Instead of an Oath, and have profered to Rulers and Magistrates, that If we break our Yea, Yea, and Nay Nay, then let us suffer the same punishment, as they do, that are perjured persons: for our NOT SVVEARING is in o∣bedience to the Command of Christ and the Apostle's Doctrine, who saith, Swear not at all. R. W. And thou say'st: As the fear of God is put for the whole wor∣ship of God, so also is Swearing in the holy Scripture. Answ. This is but R. W's Saying so; but he hath brought no Chap∣ter and Verse for it, nor tells us, where it is written so? but speaketh contrary to Christ and the Apostle's Doctrine, who saith, Swear not at all. And where doth R. W. prove, that God commanded Swearing, before Moses was born? R. W. And thou say'st. Thou knowest, the Foxians make Baptisme
&c. And ere long, if they continue to hearken to Samuel within them, they will account Prayer and Preaching but Types and Shad∣dows. Answ. These are Scoffing and Jearing expressions, as any sober people may see. And John saith, that he must decrease, and Christ must encrease, that cometh after him, who is mightier then he, that was preferred before him (who is Mightier in birth and in power &c.) and he shall Baptize you with fire and the Holy Ghost, and he shall encrease. Now I query of R. W. Whether he hath known John? whether his Rough way be made Smooth, and his Crooked way straight, and his Mountain be down? and whether he doth believe, that Christ Jesus is come after John? And what reason hath R. W. to say, that the Quakers will look upon preaching and praying to be Types and Shaddows, if they hearken to Samuel within them? do these words savour of the Spirit of God, let the sober Reader Judge. R. W. And thou say'st, That Swearing is as real worship of God, as preaching &c: and the fear of God and Swearing by him is put for his whole worship. Answ. And were not Offerings and Sacrifices the Worship of God in the time of the Law? and doth not Christ say, before Abraham was, I am? who saith, Swear not at all? and doth not Christ end the Offerings and Swearing as well before the Law, as after the Law, and so all Oaths? For the Apostle that forbids Swearing, Ex∣horteth to prayer: and therefore thou Preachest a false Doctrine, to bring people into Evil and Condemnation, that preachest up Swearing, against Mat. 5. James 5. R. W. And thou say'st; It is a gross fancy to Imagine, that the Lord Jesus in Mat. 5. gave New Commands to contradict the holy pleasure of his Father Concerning Oaths &c. Answ. Christ there expoundeth the Law, and tells them, how they were not to forswear themselves, but perform their Oaths to the Lord in the Old time: and what Old time was that? But Christ saith, I say unto you, Swear NOT AT ALL: so this was the true Oath of God, that he forbiddeth amongst the Jews, which was a part of their worship. And Christ, he putteth down their Worship at Jerusalem, which the Jews went there yearly to worship; and set∣teth up a worship in Spirit and Truth: and dost thou say, that the Jews worship lay in nothing but the fear of God, Swearing, and Prayer? and were they not to obey many other things in their Worship?
And for all frivolous Oaths Christ reproved the Jews, and the Law forbad false Swearing, as well as Christ: and what the Prophet under the Law called Swearing, the Apostle under the Gospel calleth Confessing, (Phil. 2, 10, 11.) R. W. And thou sayst: A Sober Eye may see, that Christ in∣tends only to reduce them to an Holy Swearing, only by God's way. Answ. Thou hast not proved this out of the New Testament, but they proceed from thy own dark Imaginations. And are thy own Traditions contrary to the mind of Christ and the Apostle, who denys all Swearing, and setteth up Yea and Nay in the Lieu of it? and he plainly forbiddeth that Oath, that the Jews were to per∣form to the Lord in the old time. R. W. And thou bring'st F. H. and say'st; The Quakers plainly Confess Swearing in cases Lawfull. Answ. In this thou abusest F. H. and the Quakers: but to use those words, as F. H. and the Apostle do, is not Swearing. And hadst thou been in the same tenderness of Vsher or the Waldenses, thou wouldst not have pleaded so much for Swearing. And dost not thou tell in one place of thy Book, how thou Suffered'st, because thou could'st not take an Oath (but now it seemeth, thou art hardened) as in pag. 60. wherein thou say'st, thou could not yeild to the formality of an Oath; and it seemeth, now thou canst Swear, and deny Christ and the Apostle's Doctrine, and plead for it. And why should the Parliament and all Lawiers search well and appoint a Committee to examin, if their Laws upon New appearances from Heaven have not need of Rectifying?p. 60. &c. And (as R.W. saith) If Swearing be a part of God's wor∣ship &c then did not R. W. Sin in not Swearing in the Chancery in England, in leaving off a part of God's worship, which he saith, Swear∣ing is? But in this you may see, how R. W. Contradicts himself, and hath manifested, what Love he hath to Christ and his Apostles, who perverteth their words (as he doth G. F's) and Slights their Doctrine, who saith, Swear not at all. R. W. And thou bring'st T. Moor saying [It is not properly, nor in a full sence, that God is manifested in the flesh of his Saints.] (but Roger hath quoted no page for this.) G. F. Answ. [The Saints are the Temples of God, and God dwells in them: and they come to witness the Flesh of Christ, and they glorify him in their Souls and bodies, and the Lord is Glorifyed in their bringing forth
much fruit, and they witness his Seed (to wit Christ) the one Offering for Sin to be manifested within. And such are not Repro∣bates, that witness the One Offering, Christ Jesus; and they that have not him within, they are Reprobates.] R. W. replyeth and saith, A great designe of the Devil in all Ages hath been to Cavil at, and hinder God's Love to mankind. Answ. What! doth this hinder the Love of God to mankind, and to have Christ manifest within them, which is God's Love to the World? And is it not the Devil's designe, to deceive Man and keep his house, and will suffer him to talk of Christ as long as he will, but will not suffer the strong one to be bound and cast out? And they that are Married to Christ (who bruiseth the Serpent's head) are they not of his flesh and of his bones? and they that have the Son, can praise God for his Love to fallen mankind. R. W. And thou say'st: Against this Lord Jesus Christ this old Ser∣pent hisseth and rageth before his birth, at his birth and after his birth &c. Answ. We, who have Christ formed in us, have felt the Rage of the Old Serpent in this Age both in R.W. and the New England-Priests and professours, as Christ and the Prophets and Apostles did in their Age by the professors of Christ in words, as the Jews professed him to come in words. And whereas thou rank'st the people of God called Quakers a∣mongst the Libertines, Manicheans, Adamites, Ranters &c. these R. W. and the New-England-Priests might very well apply'd at home,p. 61. who have manifested your Order in the Dragon's power, thou speakest of, persecuting with Tongue and Hands, as Michael the Arch-Angel, when Conten∣ding with the Devil he disputed about the Body of Moses, durst not bring against him a Railing Accusation, but said, The Lord Rebuke thee. And now art not thou with thy Railing Accusations disputing about the Body and Flesh of Christ? as thou may'st see in Jude and Zach: 3. R. W. And whereas thou tell'st us, What the Arrians hold [But thou had'st better to see, what thou held'st and did'st possess of Christ thy self.] And thou say'st, But with Christ's Man-hood and the Scrip∣tures the Devil and the Papists and the Quakers for the most part of them could with all their heart make an Everlasting parting. The Devil's End is, to destroy this Saviour and Salvation to poor lost man; she Quakers pretend, their End to be the Exalting and Glorifying God in the Flesh of his Saints.
Answ. As for what the Papists and the Devil do, thou may'st apply that at home, who so often hast the Devil in thy Mouth. And as for parting Christ Jesus from his God-head, that is not our work; for he is called the heavenly man, the Second Adam, a quick∣ning Spirit. And the Scripture we own: and also are to Glorify God with our Souls and bodies, which are his. And we tell thee, the Devil cannot destroy our Saviour Christ Jesus, for he destroyeth the Devil and his Works: but it's like, he may destroy your Imaginary Christ or Anti-Christ, and set up another; for Christ was dead, and is alive, and liveth for Evermore. (Revel. 1, 18) R. W. And thou say'st, that G. F. plays upon the various meaning of the word Flesh; he plays also upon those holy Scriptures, viz: God is glorifyed in the Souls and bodies of his Saints. &c. Answ. As for saying, G. F. plays, that thou might'st have applyed at home; for his words are Scripture-phrases. For must not all the Children of the New Covenant witness their bodies the Tempes of God, and him to dwell in them, and wak in them by his Spirit? and they to bring forth fruits of his Spirit, and to Glorify God in their bodies and Souls &c? And we do know, what the Prote∣stants do hold, and what you do hold in words concerning Christ, who persecute us, that do possess him: and you had better possess him, and let him Rule in your hearts by Faith, and not the Dragon, the Old persecutor. For we own Christ in the promise in the prophecies, who was born of a Virgin, his Sufferings, Resurrecti∣on, in whom the fullness of the God-head dwells bodily; and of his fulness have we Received Grace for Grace (Col. 4) R. W. And thou say'st; That G. F knowes, his Opposite intends such a manifestation of God in the Flesh, that renders the one Sin∣gle person Christ Jesus the head of the Church: and that they hold, there is as much difference between that one Individual person Christ Jesus the Head, and his Followers, as between our heads and our bodies &c. Answ. If you hold this, this is a Nighness betwixt Christ and his Church; but do you possess it? And G. F knoweth his Opposites in the other Power's days; it was a wonder to them, to hear of Christ's dwell∣ing in people: so G. F. knew their meaning very well. And must not God, that was manifested in the Flesh of Christ, that one Single person, must not he and his Father be manifest in his people by his Spirit, and he to dwell in them Now, as he did in the Apostle's days?
R. W. And thou say'st; How poor and lame is it, that because the Saints are God's Temple, therefore they must be God him∣self?p. 62. Answ. Let the Reader see if there be any such words as these, in G.F's Answer: for G F's. words are, The Saints are the Tem∣ples of God, and God will dwell in them (as 1 Cor. 6. and 2 Cor. 6.) G. F. doth not say, The Saints are God, as thou hast falsly for∣ged. And doth not the Apostle Exhort the Saints▪ that Christ may dwell in their hearts by Faith? (Eph. 3.) and therefore thou say'st, They say, they are Christ himself: Let the Reader see, if there be any such word in G. F's. Answer? and whether he has not abused G. F's. words here also? Must not Christ dwell in his peo∣ple? and are not the Saints bodies members of Christ? and are they not Christ's Temple for to dwell in? And doth not the Apostle say, Ye are not your own, ye are bought with a price? &c. is this to affirm, They are Christ himself? Or doth it hence follow, That those particulars affirmed of the man Christ Jesus (1 Tim. 3.) are inver∣ted, and dreadfully turned upon their proud, devilish Flesh, because God was Manifested in the Flesh &c? (1 Tim. 3, 16.) see, what false Charges and Inferences he frameth! But doth not Christ de∣stroy the Devil, and proud Flesh in people? for doth not the A∣postle say, If Christ be in you, the body is dead, because of Sin: but the Spirit is life, because of Righteousness. (Rom. 8.) R. W. And thou say'st: The Devil is manifest in their Flesh, Con∣demn'd of the holy Spirit of God, abhorred of the heavenly Angels, the world shall abhor their Memory, and except Repentance they shall descend with all the Enemies of the true Lord Jesus into the Lake, that burns with unquenchable fire &c. Answ. R. Williams might have applyed this Judgement of his, to his own Spirit, and the professors of New-England, of the Devil being manifested in their Flesh▪ whose work of Lying, Mur∣der and Persecution they have done; and its well, if they do see a day of Repentance, that they and he may escape the Lake. Thus we do Confess with the Apostle, The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus hath made us free from the Law of Sin and death: for what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the Flesh, God sending his own Son in the likeness of Sinful Flesh, for sin Condemnes Sin in the Flesh, that the Righteousness of the Law might be fullfilled in u, who walk not after the Flesh, but after
the Spirit, (Rom. 8.) And as for R. W's. saying, The world abhor∣ring of our memory &c. we know, the World hated Christ our Lord and Master, and so it is no marvel, if such worldly minds, as R. W. is, hate us. God Loved his people, yea all his Saints are in his hand, and they sit down at his feet, and receive his words, and his Angels do pitch their Tents about them: and we know, that their Ministring Spirits are sent forth to Minister to them, that be Heirs of Salvation (Deut. 33. Hebr: 1.) R. W. And thou bring'st Tho. Moor saying [Christ is distinct from from every one of us, and without us and our particular persons.] And G. F. Answers T.M. [The Apostle saith, Christ was in them, except they were Reprobates; and they were of his Flesh and of his Bone, and they eat his flesh, and drank his blood, then it was within them. And he is distinct from none, but Reprobates, who hate the Light.] And is not this truth according to Scrip∣ture? for the Apostle saith, We are members of his body, of his flesh and of his bone (Ephes. 5, 30:) and (2 Cor. 13) Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates. And doth not Christ say, he is the Living bread, that cometh down from heaven? and Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath Eternal Life, and I will raise him up at the last day; for my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed; he that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him: and is not this Scripture? R. W. Replyeth to G. F. and falleth a Railing (as he used to do) and saith, G. F's. words carry two faces, one to God, and another to the Devil. Answ. As for that word, face to the Devil, he might have kept it at home, for it is his own. And as for the Papist's Transubstanti∣ation, which he calleth Rome on Hell, let them answer for themselves, we have nothing to do with them: and Christ saith, his words are Spi∣rit and Life, and flesh profits nothing. And as for thy saying, that the Quakers have printed, that their flesh and blood is as good as Christ's and of as much vertue &c. These are more of thy Lyes, but no book nor page hast thou mentioned for this. R. W. And whereas thou bring'st Act. 20. and say'st; Hence many of them contend, that God's blood and God's flesh redeems them.p. 63. Answ. What! must they not use the Apostle's Expres∣sions, who said, Take heed unto your selves, and to feed the Flock, which the Holy Ghost hath made you Overseers to feed the Church of God,
which he hath purchased with his own blood? And in Contradiction to thy self thou say'st, That God pay'd his blood to redeem thee (page 156): but I must tell thee, Christ as God, did not die; but Christ suffered according to the Flesh. R. W. And thou say'st, Gods Flesh redeemes us. Answ. Was not Christ God? and doth not the Scripture say (Rom. 9, 5.) Christ is God? but God is a Spirit. And where did ever the Quakers print or say, it was God's Flesh? it is called, the Flesh of Christ: but what, if the Quakers use the Apostle's words, Great is the Mystery of Godliness! God was manifested in the Flesh, justified in the Spirit &c. (1 Tim. 3). R. W. And thou say'st, That their blood and their sufferings are God's Flesh and Blood Redeeming and Saving &c. Answ. The Reader may see, there are no such words in G. F.'s An∣swer. For I say, It's Christ's blood, who dyed at Jerusalem, that sa∣veth; and yet the Saints cannot deny, but that they are Christ's, and Christ is God's, and their bodies are his to dwell in. And thou tell'st of One, that would not speak all at once; but who it is, thou tell'st us not: so its like, thou hast Abused him, as thou hast done o∣thers. R. W. And thou say'st: These Foxians are God and Christ, Spi∣rit, Resurrection, Life and Heaven. Answ. These are more of thy Lyes and Forgeries, let the Reader see, if there be any such thing in G. F's. Answer, and whether thou hast not abused his Answer. And must not Christ dwell in his people, who is the Resurrection and the Life, and his Kingdom be in them? and doth not he dwell in all his true believers? And did not Christ appear again to his Disciples according to his Promise? and Christ saith, He that loveth me, and keepeth my words, my Father will Love him, and we will come unto him, and make our Abode with him (John 14) And that of Joh. 16. is true, as Christ speaketh, and the true be∣lievers do behold his Glory (as in Joh. 17). R. W. And thou say'st, I know, these poor Foxians say, that he did come again to them (to wit Christ) and I know also, that a man may feel this Lye with a pair of Mittins: for I know, the Comforter came not unto them upon his Resurrection, (for then he was forty days with them) but after his Ascension. Answ. As for poor and Foxians, thou might'st have kept to thy self, and Lye (for thou call'st it Vncivil for G. F. to speak the word Lye, and is it Civil for thee?) with the Mittins. And
we know, that Christ after his Resurrection appeared unto his Dis∣ciples, and that the Holy Ghost came to his Disciples after his Ascension: but what is all this to the purpose, to disprove G. F's. Answer, That Christ doth not dwell in his Saints now, and that the Holy Ghost is not in them now? And we do believe of Christ's birth, sufferings, Death and Resurrection, and Manifest in people, who will Judge the world in Righteousness. R. W. And thou say'st, That we maintain Christ's Second Coming to be Spiritual. [And doth R. W. maintain his coming to be Car∣nal?] And thou say'st, They count all gazing fools, that look af∣ter a man; for Christ is come unto them in Spirit, and in them he maintains his great Assizes, and now passeth Judgment upon men by them &c. Answ. Doth not Christ dwell in his peoples hearts by his Spi∣rit? and doth not he there Judge down Sin & Evil, that is in the hearts of Men? and doth not he give a Judgement to his Saints to Judge the Evil of the world? (read 1 Cor. 5) And must the Saints deny this Judgement, that he giveth his people, because Christ will Judge the world in Righteousness, and reward every man according to his works? Nay Roger, thou must feel it for belying and vilifying his people. And if you look after Christ, as a Car∣nal Man, may they not call you Fools? who is called the Second Adam, THE LORD FROM HEAVEN. R. W. And thou say'st: If these poor, filthy dreamers lived with∣out food and Physick &c. without procreation &c. Answ. We may say to thee, as Christ said to the Devil, Man liveth not by bread alone, but by every word, that proceedeth out of the mouth of God. And as for thy saying, VVithout procreation, and bringing forth of Children without the Stinks of Nature &c. and a great deal of such Rambling stuff, which thou hast filled thy book up withall, thou may'st keep at home: and where did ever the Prophets or Apostles use such Language concerning Marriage, which is an Ordinance of God, or of Nature, which is good in it self? And as for thy speaking of Eating of the flesh of Christ, until they bcome Christ himself, which thou say'st, is Simple, Monstrous and Blasphemous &c. let the Reader see, if there be any such words in G. F's Answer, or if they be not words of his own forging, and Lyes. But we cannot deny our bread from Heaven, for all R. W's. Lyes and Slanders, for which we can praise God for it, as the A∣postles did, who are flesh of his flesh, and bone of his bone. And
thou tell'st of Manicheans, and of a Frantick Spirit: As for the Manicheans, these thou might'st have kept at home. R. W. And thou say'st, This Frantick Spirit saith, Is not Christ in us? how is he distinct from us? what need you ask me, how I do? can Christ be sick? can Christ do but well (speaking of themselves) And thou Observest God's wonderful Stroke in this world upon three sorts of persons &c.p. 64. Answ. It were well, if R. W. did see the Stroke of God upon him∣self, and let others alone, to stand or fall to their own Master. And Reader, is there any of these Expressions in G. F's. Answer to Tho. Moor? for he hath not named any, that hath spoken such words, as he hath forged here. And was that a Frantick Spirit in the Apostle, who said, Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates? but doth not Christ say, I was thirsty, hungry, naked, in prison, a stranger and sick &c. whether this was not Christ in his members? and if so; then whether R. W. and the New-England-Professors have not been persecuting him all this while, as the persecuting Jews did, who looked on him as a Deceiver? And as for the other Scoffing words, we leave them, they are not worth mentioning, (as in the 62, 63, 64 pages may be seen). R. W. And thou bring'st S. Hamond (Fol. 186) who saith, [What Warrant have you to go out to the Quakers? shall a Man go hear the Jews and Popish Mass, because Paul bids, Try all things? No, no.] And G. F. answereth, [Paul biddeth us, Quench not the Spirit; and where the Spirit is not quenched, they may try Papists, Jews, Protestants, who quench not the Spirit: But who quench the Spirit, and draw People from the Light within, they draw them from that they should See withal: then you stuff them up with Old Authors and Lying Stories, as you Print a∣broad.] R. W. instead of Replying he asketh Questions, Whether the Jews, Papists or Idolaters have the Holy Spirit? and whether they may go to hear God speaking in his Holy Promise among them? &c. Answ. Have not the Jews the Old Testament? and the Papists the Old and New, as well as thou to speak of? And do not they hate the Light of Christ, and quench the Spirit as well as thou, and persecute them that believe and walk in it? and I ask R. W, Whether he can judge of them, without hearing of them, or read∣ing of their Books? And doth not the Lord say, He would pour out of his Spirit upon all Flesh, as well as thee, though they
grieve it? and lighteth all as well as thee, though they and thou hate it. R. W. And thou say'st; May I hear a Papist, a Jew or an Ido∣later, a False Worshipper &c. when I am convinced, that they speak not from the Holy Spirit? &c. Or, May I go to worship God with them, when thou believest, they worship a False God. Answ. If thou wast convinced with the Holy Spirit of God, as we are, then thou couldst not join with any false Worship, nor hear them to uphold them in it: for with the Spirit they are tryed, and not followed, in which Spirit of Truth God is worshipped. But is it not Sam. Hamond's and R. William's Intent here, that they would not have the People to hear the Quakers, and to worship God in the Spirit and Truth? Though the Apostles went up and down into all Nations to Preach the Gospel, yet they did not join with their VVorships, and hold them up: and they that are convinced of the Falseness of them, they have tryed them. R. W. And thou say'st; May I hear a False Prophet, or be present at any False Worship, but with Actual Reproving of them, and labouring to reduce them &c. Answ. If thou werest in the true Spirit out of the false, lying, slandering Spirit, thou mightst Admonish and Reprove, if thou wast in the Spirit of God, as the Apostles were in: but how cometh it to pass, that the New-England Professors, who are the Pesecutors and False Prophets, cannot bear such, as Actually reprove them? And why do the New-England Professors make the Qua∣kers pay Five shillings a day, that do not go to hear them, when they are convinced and have proved them, and tryed them that they do not speak from the Spirit of God, and know them to be in the same Persecuting Spirit, that the Jews and Papists were in? R. W. And thou say'st; Thou wast stopt by a Sudden Spirit of Prayer in a Woman at Newport, and an Unseasonable Spirit of Prayer in a Man, which forced me to stop, and occasion'd me to take this way and Dispute with them. Answ. And why could not R. W. have had Patience to have stayed, till they had done Prayer? but he hath shewed his bad Spirit against Prayer, who calleth it unseasonable. And I do be∣lieve, that the Spirit of God, that led the Man and Woman to pray, stop'd thee, and therefore thou hast brought forth this bad Birth of Lies and Slanders, which thou hast cast upon God's People: and be∣fore
thou comest to try False Worships, or Prophets, or Preachers, thou must deny the False Spirit in thy self. R. W. And thou say'st; I ask, May any Soul out of Curiosity go to hear a Strange Preacher, in whom I have not Faith, that he is sent from God?p. 65. especially if there be not a Free Liberty for my Quaeries, and Objections and Searchings, as the Bereans did. Answ. Doth not R. W. find fault with G. F's. Sense of English, who saith, I or any Soul? but others may have Liberty to go, where thou hast not Faith. But if R. W. and the New-England Priests and Professors do practise this Question, which he asketh, then why do not they practise the Royal Law, To do to another, and let them have the same Liberty, as they would have themselves, which G. F's. Opposites (which R. W. seemeth to maintain) would not grant? for Tho. Good-year was cast into Prison for saying HVM, when R. Baxter was Preaching in Oliver's days. And why is there not so much Liberty then amongst the New-England Professors and Meeting-Places, but they must be FINED for not going to hear a Preacher, on whom they have no Faith, nor Liberty to ob∣ject and quaery, nor search, as the Bereans did? if R. W. and the New-England Priests granted this Liberty to others, as they would have themselves, their Foundation had been down ere now: and they needed not to have made Laws, to HANG, WHIP, BANISH and IMPRISON. And we do take heed what we hear, and how we hear, and what we join unto, with the Light and Spirit of God; though we are commanded to try all things, and hold fast that which is Good. And why dost thou say, it was the Vnseasonable Spirit of Prayer? because it crossed thee in thy Imaginations and Evil VVork then, which thou now hast brought forth? R. W. And thou say'st; What do we mean by the Spirit's Quenching? can the Spirit of God be Really quenched? Answ. Hast not thou often quenched the Motions of it, by fol∣lowing thy Imaginations, and thy own dark Spirit, and not being led by it? and therefore doth the Apostle Exhort the Saints, Not to quench the Spirit. And when thou comest to obey it, either in Praying or Prophecying, or Rejoycing, or Giving of Thanks, or Proving all things with it, then thou wilt know, what it is to quench it, and to see thy self in the Spirit of the Jews, who were so much against Christ and his Apostles, and thought, they did God
Service in so doing: and that Light of Christ which thou hatest, and the Spirit of God which thou quenchest, will be thy Condem∣nation, except thou Repent. But if the Thessalonians should have asked Paul, Can the Spirit of God be quenched, as thou dost? they that go from the Motions of it, quench it as to themselves, and come to be led by an Evil, false Spirit, as leadeth thee; and such come to err from it and grieve it: but they that obey the motions of it, do receive from God his Heavenly Refreshings, and are sealed with the Spirit of Promise, Ephes. 1, 11. R. W. And thou say'st; Why do these Lazy Souls so horribly slight Reading and Studying Books, yea God's Book, as one of their Chief said to me, laying his hand upon the Bible of Junius, Art not thou past these yet? Answ. What this One is, he hath not named; if this One had been a Quaker, it's like we should have had his Name in Print: and so this is like the rest of his Lyes. And we do read the Scrip∣tures (if he do mean that to be God's Book) and also may be some of us have Read other Boos, as well as he: and as for his Scornful Expressions of Proud and Lazy Souls, and Horrible Slight∣ing, these are the Fruits of his bad Spirit, which he may apply at home. And what good hath it done R. W. all this time, Read∣ing and Studying Books, or God's Book, and bring forth no better Fruits? R. W. And thou say'st; And why do they worship a Dumb De∣vil in their Dumb Meetings, and stand still and listen, and lie upon their Beds of Laziness for Revelations and Notions &c. Answ. Let the Gentle Reader see, if this be not from R. W's. malicious Spirit. For first, he hath not proved, that we VVorship a Dumb Devil in Dumb Meetings; for he saith (page 64, and 65) That at the General Assembly of the Quakers at New-port he was stopt by a VVoman's Praying and a Man's Praying: Now is not this a plain Contradiction? and hath not R. W. confounded him∣self here, and his Evil Birth he hath brought forth? We do Wait upon the Lord God in his Spirit and Light, who Revealeth his things unto us by his Spirit: and he doth Teach and Instruct us in the Night-season, and gives us of his Songs, and to stand still and see our Salvation, and to worship God in the Spirit and Truth, which thou and the Devil is out of: and to Look unto Jesus, the Author and Finisher of our Faith. And why dost thou scoff at our Listning unto the Lord? for doth not the Lord say; Listen,
O ye Isles, unto me, and hearken unto me ye People afar, for the Lord hath called me from the Womb, from the Bowels of my Mother hath he made mention of my Name &c. (Isai. 49, 1). And as for Lazy Revelations and Notions, thou must keep that at home, for they are none of ours; who are Diligent in serving the Lord. And G. F. doth not slight any Old Authors, (who hath laboured in God's Service, and broken the Ice) as thou falsly say'st; but such, as draw People from the Light of Christ within, that they should see withal, and then stuff People with Old Authors and Lies, which they Print abroad, as thine is here. And thou say'st, W. Edm. did frequently call thee at Newport, Old Man Old Man; which (it seems) thou countest as a great Disgrace to thee; but that is not to be compared with all thy soul and ungracious Words in thy Book against us. And dost thou see thy self, and how thou callest thy Neighbour White Devil? and what Abusive Names thou hast given to the People of God in scorn called Quakers? R. W. And thou bringest in John Burton (Fol. 206) saying [It is a Scripture of the Devil's making, to apprehend Christ within]. G. F. Answereth, [If there be any other Christ, but he who was Crucified, within, he is the False Christ: and the Scripture holds sorth this, and the Devil never made it; but he and his Messengers are against it. And he that hath not this Christ (that was Crucified and Risen) within, is a Reprobate; though Devils and Reprobates may talk of him without.] And R. W. re∣plyeth,p. 66. and telleth a Story of Pagans, Mahometans and Christians and Jews, of their Dispute about Christ, which is to no purpose. Answ. The Quakers do acknowledge the Birth, Death and Re∣surrection of Christ; and it's to no purpose for thee to alleadge the contrary (and his Doctrine and Preachings, and his Apostles) and all this is true. R. W. And thou say'st; Certain it is, that he that shall turn over all the former Relations and Histories, and all the Writings of the Apostles, and predicate a Christ, that was Risen within, and Cru∣cified within, in opposition to that Jesus of Nazareth without &c. Answ. Here dost not thou Confess, that that Christ, which dy∣ed at Jerusalem, must be within People, and not opposite? but what Sun of Righteousness is he▪ that shall arise with Healing in his VVings to them that fear God's Name? (Mal. 4). R. W. And thou tellest, What the Protestants do believe of the
Birth, Life and Death of Christ &c. and of applying the Promi∣ses and the New Covenant &c. and bargain in his Blood for a New Spirit and a New Heart &c. Answ. Do not ye believe, that G. F. and the People called Quakers do not know, that R. W. and the New-England Pro∣fessors and these Persecutors, and his old Opposers do apply the Pro∣mises and the New Covenant to their old Heart and their Persecu∣ting Spirit? But where is the New Heart, and where is the New Spirit? and how do ye dye with Christ, and how are ye made Conformable to his Death? do not the Children of the New-Co∣venant (that are born again of the Immortal Seed, and are Heirs of the Promise) feel the Blood of Christ in them, to sprinkle their Consciences &c. and make their Garments white? But where doth Christ or the Apostles use that Expression of a Bar∣gain in Christ's Blood? where is thy Rule for it in Scrip∣ture? R. W. And thou say'st; G. F. is believing in a Christ Crucifi∣ed within, in opposition to Christ Promised and Prophecyed of, brought forth, Living and Dying, so preached, so believed on; and what a Forehead of Hell must he have, that calls all those Reprobates and Devils, that talk of Christ without, &c. Answ. Now, let the Reader see, how R.W. abuseth G. F's, Words! For G. F. doth not say, The Devil and Reprobates may talk of a Christ without; but G. F. is proving, that it is Christ, that was Crucified, and is Risen (to wit, at the Right Hand of God); it is he, that is to be within his Saints. And we know, that the Devil and his Messengers cannot endure to hear tell, that Christ should Rule in the Hearts of his People, because he destroyeth the Devil from Reigning: and we know, that the Devil may suffer R. W. to apply to him Christ's Sufferings, Death and Resurrection and Promises, so that he will not have Christ to Reign▪ in him. And we own Christ, as was promised and prophecyed of, and his Birth, Life, Death and Resurrection, and yet manifest within us; who will Judge the World in Righteousness, and Reward every Man according to their Works, Glory to God for ever! And as for Fore-head of Hell, it becometh R. W. best; the Sober mind-minded who read his Book, may see his Fruit, (as ye may see page 66). R. W. And thou bringest The Elders and Messengers of the Churches in Wales saying, [We are Conceived in Sin, and brought
forth in Iniquity]. And G. F. answereth (Fol. 214) [And Da∣vid doth not say, YOV, who were Conceived in Sin, but [I]: and W. P. saith, John was sanctified from the Womb; and the Scriptures speak of such, as were Sanctified from the VVomb, and Children that were Clean. And so you do not speak, as the Elders and Messengers of the true Churches, or Men dividing the VVord aright; but you are one against another, though you are all against them you call Quakers, that be in the Truth.] R. W. replyeth, and falleth a railing and saith; G. F. discovers to any Intelligent and Savoury Spirit not only a weak and deluded Soul, but a Popish and Arminian Poyson about the State of all Mankind in the First Birth,p. 67. a strong Presumption, that he never felt, what the woful Estate of all Mankind by Nature is, and what to cry out in his own particular with Da∣vid, I was Conceived in Sin, and brought forth in Iniquity: which Cry is one of the first Soul-Cries of every Child of God. Answ. Let the Reader judge betwixt R. W. and G. F. For G. F. doth not speak of the State of all Mankind, but of John Baptist, and such as the Scripture speaketh of, that were Sanctified from the VVomb, and such Children, as the Scripture speaketh of, that were Clean (as 1 Cor. 7.) that Paul speaketh of: did John and those that were Sanctified and Clean, cry out to God, that they were Conceived in Sin, and brought forth in Iniquity? prove this, or else confess thy unsavoury Spirit and weak deluded Soul. And as for Pope and Arminian Poyson, thou mayst keep that to thy self. And the Estate of Mankind by Nature I have known; yet I must put a Difference, as the Apostles and Holy Men of God have done, and will not say, as thou and thy Messengers of such, as were Sanctified from the VVomb and Clean, That they were brought forth in Sin and Iniquity. And what is all the Work of R. W. (in his 67 and 68 pages), who telleth of the Pelagians, and the For∣ces of the Prince of Orange against them? and David's crying out, that he was Conceived in Sin, and brought forth in Iniquity? this doth not pove, that John was Conceived in Sin, and brought forth in Iniquity, nor prove, that Jeremiah was not Sanctified in the VVomb, (Jer. 1): but here thou hast justified the Perse∣cution and the Force against Pelagians.p. 68. And thou hast rambled over a great deal, and tellest of the Spots of the Leopards, and the Blackness of the Negroes: and Gen. 6, Psal. 51,
and Rom. 5, all this doth not prove, that Jeremiah and John, nor the Children that were Clean, were brought forth in Iniquity. R. W. And thou sayest: These Rotten and Crooked dispositions in every Child bring forth wild Asses-fruit in Youth &c. Answ. Wherein did Jeremiah and John Baptist, or such as were Clean or Sanctified in the VVomb, bring forth such Fruits, as thou speakest of? prove it by the Scripture. For thou say'st, Every Child; here the Child Jesus hath not escaped thy Censure: was not he called a Child? (Luk. 2, 27) who was the Holy One. R. W. And thou say'st; The Experience of all the Saints of God in the Holy Scripture, who maintained a Battle between the Flesh and the Spirit all their days &c. (Gal. 5) like the two Houses of Saul and David, in Abraham and Isaac, Paul and Peter; and Paul crying out, that the Good that he would, that he did not &c. Answ. All these Scriptures do not prove, that Jeremiah and John, that were Sanctified in the Womb, and the Children that Paul speaketh of (Cor. 7, that he said, were Holy) that they were Conceived in Sin, and brought forth in Iniquity, because David said, He was. Neither doth Gal. 5. say, That the Saints have a Battle between Flesh and Spirit within them all their days: neither doth the Scripture say, that there was a Battle between the House of Saul and David all David's days; for David said, All that is within me, praise the Lord: and his Sins were removed as far, as the East is from the West. Neither did Abraham nor Isaac say, that they had a Battle in them all their days, nor Paul, nor Peter; but Paul said, there was No Condemnation to them, that were in Christ Jesus, who walked not after the Flesh▪ but after the Spirit: though he had cryed out, That Good that he would do, he did not; but after he saith, The Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus hath made me free (mark, me Paul free) from the Law of Sin and Death. Nay, did not he say, They were more than Conque∣rours? and doth not he say, That he had fought the good Fight, and kept the Faith? then he was not Fighting, when he had Fought, and was a Conquerour. And Paul saith, I am Crucified with Christ (mark, I AM), and Christ Liveth in me; and the Life that I now live in the Flesh, is by Faith in the Son of God &c. is not the Faith Victory? And thou fallest a railing, and speaking of our Conditions, which thou art ignorant of, and thy own, and hast abused both the Scriptures and Vs.
R. W. And thou bringest John Jackson (G. F. Fol. 217.) saying, [False Prophets and Christs, and Deceivers many should come, if it were possible,p. 69. to deceive the very Elect.] And G. F. Answ. [Yea, Christ said, They should come, to the Apostles; which before their Decease they did come, and went forth from them, which Christ said, should inwardly Ra∣vin, and get the Sheeps-Cloathing: which since the Days of the Apostles all the VVorld went after them, as thou may'st read in the Revelat: And now are People but coming from them to the Rock, and now shall the Everlasting Gospel be Preached to them that dwell upon the Earth, over the Heads of the Beast; and their False Prophet and they shall be taken, and the Lamb, and the Saints shall have the Victory.] R. W. replyeth and saith; That great Fox the Pope of Rome, and his Foxians (the Worshippers of the Beast) maintains, that Anti-Christ is not yet come. [This is nothing to my Answer]. And thou say'st; That G. F. &c. crys out [Anti-Christ, why, he is come and gone long ago], as if False Christs might not be then, and now too. Answ. Let the Reader see, if he hath not wronged G. F's. Words; and see, what Sense thou canst make of R. W's. Words. For G. F. doth not say, Why, he is come and gone long ago (to wit, Anti-Christ) &c. these are thy forged Lies: for we say, Thou and the New-England Priests are in the Spirit of Anti-Christ, as your Fruits have manifested: Act. 20, and Matth. 7, and 2 Pet. 2, and 2 Cor. 11, and Jude have sufficiently discovered you. And thou runnest on in a long Tale of Pope and Protestants-to no pur∣pose; but why doth R. W. and the New-England Priests cry against the Pope, and are found so much in this Spirit? R. W. But thou say'st; What Ignorance doth this little Fox, this great Boaster discover in saying, Now are People come forth from them (to wit,p. 70. Anti-Christ) &c. Answ. Herein thou hast discovered thy own Ignorance of both the Scripture and the Spirit, and Power of God and the Gospel. For we must tell thee and the persecuting Priests, that the Gospel is Preached again freely, as it was in the Apostle's days, and People are coming again to the true Lord Jesus Christ by the Light and Grace of his Everlasting Gospel, from such False Teachers, as thou and the rest of the Persecuting Priests. R. W. And whereas thou tellest of the Jews and Romans mocking and murthering Christ Jesus &c. just as the Pope and the great Fox,
and these little Foxians pretend to be sole Heir unto the Crown of Heaven,p. 71. and all others Reprobates from their Heavenly Majesty. Answ. Let R. W. look at home amongst his New-England Priests and Professors, who have mocked and MVRTHERED the Members of Christ: and dost not thou encourage them to Per∣secute and Punish them? (as in pag. 200) what could your Fa∣ther the Pope do worse, or the Romans, or the Jews? And blessed be the Lord, we are Heirs of the Kingdom of Heaven, and do know the Crown of Life: and we do know, that thou, that dost encourage to Punish us, and the Priests, that Persecuted us, and they that MVRTHERED us, are in a Blind Zeal and Reprobate Spi∣rit, and Rebel against the Commands of Christ, that said, Love one another, and Love Enemies: and Christ said, He came to Save Mens Lives, and not to Destroy them. R. W. And thou say'st; The Protestants maintain, that the Pope is the Anti-Christ, the Man of Sin, (pag. 70). Answ. If R. W. and the Priests and Professors of New-England do bring forth the same Fruits, that the Pope hath done, are not they Anti-Christ? R. W. And thou bringest John Jackson (G. F. Fol. 218) saying, ["I hope, you will not Condemn the Generation of the Righteous, because they are not Perfect.] G. F. Answ. [That which Con∣demneth, is Righteous; it Condemns that which is not Perfect: and that which is Righteous, is Perfect; and the Generation that's Righteous, is not to be Condemned.] R. W. Replyeth and saith, That Our selves being Perfect, are not to be Condemned: the Summe of his Answer is, Himself and the Foxians are Gods, as Pure and as Holy as God is. Answ. Let the Reader see, if there any such Words as these in G. F's. Answer; and Read G. F's. Answer and see, if R. W. hath not forged all these Words; therefore they are Slanders. But doth not the Lord often Command, that his People should be Holy, as he is Holy? I say, let the Reader examin G. F's. An∣swer and see, if he calls Men Gods? Though we cannot deny, but we are the Temples of the Living God, and that he Dwelleth in us by his Spirit, as the Apostle saith, Who is in you all, and o∣ver you all, God blessed for ever, (Eph. 4): again, He that Sancti∣fieth, and they that are Sanctified, are all of One; thus speaketh the Scripture. And R. W. is made to coness, that all that is not Perfect, is not Righteous.
R. W. And after thou hast rambled a great while (but nothing to purpose to G. F's. Answer) thou say'st; In the last place I affirm (and have made it good) that the Generation of the Papists and Quakers are so Pure in their own Eyes,p. 72.73. yet they are not cleansed from their own Filthi∣ness: the Papists are justly charged with Superstition and Idolatry, and Drinking the Blood of Saints; and have not the Generation of the Quakers their Images and Idols also? as I have manifested their Pride, Ignorance and Idleness in not using Means, and their Passionate Railings &c. And if this Spirit had got the Sword, it would drink the Blood of its Enemies, as Hereticks, Idolaters, Re∣probates and Devils. Answ. Roger Williams, thou hast measured the People of God (in scorn called Quakers) with thy own Measure and Rule, which thou hast put with the Priests and Professors of New-England, and Judgest Vs thereby like unto Your selves. Have any of the People cal∣led Quakers, that have had the Magistrates Power in their hands, used any of these Weapons to Dissenters in Rode-Island or else∣where? Nay, have not some suffered in New-England, and Run the Gantlop, because they would not take up the Sword? And as for Drinking of Blood, Railing, Passion &c. let the New-England WHIPS, GALLOWS and Laws, and SPOILING of Goods, and R. W's. own Desire (in his page 200) to Magistrates to Punish us, speak, which is most like, We or They, to the Papists? And why was our BLOOD DRVNK in New-England? was it not, because we could not bow to their Image they set up, like Nebuchadnezar and the Papists? And as for Pride, Ignorance, Passion, Railing, Cursing, let R. W. look at home, and his New-England Brethren, the Priests. And for their Ignorance and Idle∣ness in not using Means, what Means are they, they should use? any that come from this Persecuting Spirit? nay, you may keep it your selves: for we do tell thee and the New-England Priests, There is no other Name given under Heaven for Salvation, than the Name of Jesus. And for Idleness, R. W. may keep that Charge too at home, that lyeth Lazily at home Railing in the Woods; for if he be a Minister of the Gospel, why doth he not go and Preach the Gospel to Pope and Turk, he so much Raileth against behind their Backs? But it's like he will say, He findeth no Call, nor the New-England Priests any further, than they can find a great Benefice: but neither He nor They can say, The People
called Quakers are Idle, that left their own Country and Kindred, to come to New-England to Preach the Gospel freely, whom they WHIPT, IMPRISONED, BANISHED and HANGED. But thou dost affirm, that the Papists and Quakers are not cleansed from their Filthiness. Let the Papists speak for themselves: but as for the People of God called Quakers, thou darest not say, that thou hast an Infallible Spirit to Judge; and therefore thou know'st not our Condition, and affirmest, thou dost not know what. But we must tell thee, that (as John saith) We, who walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, we have Fellowship one with another, and the Blood of Christ Jesus Cleanseth us from all sin. And because thou art not Cleansed, thou measurest us by thy self, who art pure in thy own Eyes, but not in the Eyes of Christ or his People. R. W. Thou bringest the Priest's Words (G. F. Fol. 220.) say∣ing, [Man is not able to Discern the Things of God, till he be Born again]. And G. F. Answ. [The Scripture speaketh of Discerning the Eternal Power and God-head, and that was a Thing of the Spirit of God: and the Apostle saith not, that they were Born again. And yet I say, that None knoweth the Things of God, but by the Spirit of God; and that which may be known of God, is manifest in them, for God hath shewed it to them: for that of God in them was of the Spirit, who is the God of the Spirits of all Flesh, which bringeth them to Discern the Eternal Power and God-head.] R. W. replyes in a Railing Spirit, and saith; With amazement at the dreadful Justice of God, hardening this daring Soul for playing away his own Light, and the Name of God, and the Light, which the Lord hath sent him from so many Excellent Pens, out of which he hath raked nothing but handfuls of Reproaches to fling in the Faces of his best Friends, and turn∣ed Truth into Lies and Poyson to Murther himself and o∣thers. Answ. Now, let the Reader read G. F's Answer, and R. W's. Reply, and see, where G. F. hath cast any Handfuls of Reproaches in the Faces of those he calleth his best Friends, which were our Old Persecutors in Oliver's days. And as for Lies and Poison, and Murthering my self and others, thou mightest have kept that to thy self, which is sufficiently manifested in thy own Book: but I know, the Truth is the Savour of Death unto such as thou art, and therefore it doth Amaze thee. For G. F. hath not played a∣way his own Light, that God hath sent him, nor his Name; these
Words come from thy Frothy, Airy Spirit: but what! doth this prove, that People have not the Spirit of God, nor the Light of Christ nor his Grace, which they hate, and turn into Wan∣tonness? R. W. And thou say'st; The Eternal Power and Godhead can∣not be seen by Mortal Eyes. And again thou say'st; All Man∣kind are bound by the Law of their Nature, to put forth their utmost in searching after God; and we may gain a Great Sight of the God-head &c. [Hast not thou Contradicted thy self?p. 74. for is not Nature Mortal?] And further thou say'st; Yet this Sight of God, which Men and Devils may get of God by their Natural Abilities &c. and yet thou say'st; No Mortal Eye can see the Eternal Power and Godhead: — and again, We may gain a great Sight of the Godhead, and yet not see him, nor glorifie him, that is, Love him, as Paul (1 Cor. 8): Answ. Here in thy own Distinction thou hast Confounded thy self. For first, thou wilt grant, that Paul was a Believer (1 Cor. 8); secondly thou say'st, The Eternal Power and God-head cannot be seen by a Mortal Eye: then this great Sight of the God-head must be seen by a Spiritual Eye, (according to the Apostle's Words and thy Consequence) because that which may be known of God, is manifest in them, for God hath shewed it unto them. And this must be by the Spirit, by which they know the Invisible things of him, even his Eternal Power and Godhead: (Rom. 1) and so it is by the Spirit of God the Things of God are known, (according to 1 Cor. 2) and such as quench the Spirit, and vex and rebel a∣gainst the Spirit of God, and resist the Holy Ghost, and hate the Light of Christ, and turn the Grace of God into Wantonness, are those Born again of God his Power and Spirit, or prate like thee in the Imaginations? for John saith, He that is Born of God, overcometh the VVorld. R. W. And further thou say'st; Now this Woful Cheater find∣ing the word Spirit, confounds (as his course is) all together, and be∣cause God's Spirit Regenerates the Corinthians, and opens to them a Glimpse of the Godhead's Power &c. Answ. As for Cheating and Confounding, thou mayst keep those Words at home; but the Apostle telleth the Corinthians (that were the Believers and Babes in Christ, and Born again) That the Light, which shined in their Hearts, giveth the Light of the Know∣ledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Christ Jesus: and calleth
this the Light of the Glorious Gospel, which is the Image of God. Now, hath R. W. manifested himself to be Born again, who doth not distinguish between them that is Born of the Spirit, and them that Grieve the Spirit? for G. F's. Words were, Such as were not Born of God by the Spirit, yet they had the Spirit, by which they might Know the things of God: for how can they quench the Spi∣rit and err from it, if they have it not? and how will God Judge the World in Righteousness, according to the Gospel? And whether is the Gospel Natural, or all the Judgments of God Natural, or Spiritual? and if Spiritual, whether or no it is not according to the Divine Light and Grace, that enlightneth all Men, and his Spirit that he poureth upon all Flesh? R. W. And thou say'st; I fear that G. F. &c. never Is this Good Sense Roger? Experi∣mened, though they enjoy in Common a Light of Nature, though God hath Endowed him and many of them with Excellent Natural Parts, yea with a Light from the Holy Scripture, yea, a Light of Experience and Common Motions from God's Holy Spirit, and have been lifted up &c. and then thou fearest, most of them will be brought down into Hell, and Cast into great Condemnation. Answ. R. Williams, thou hast shewed thy Ignorance of G. F. and the People, called Quakers, Conditions. What! dost thou call the Divine and Heavenly Light of Christ (which is the Life in the Word) the Light of Nature, which Christ commands to be∣lieve in? this is thy Darkness, which cannot Comprehend the Light. And as for our Experiences and Knowledge of the Holy Scripture, it is by this Divine Light and Spirit of the Lord, which if thou didst Live in, thou wouldst never Rail so much against us. And as for thy foolish Fears, I tell thee, they are Cain's: and as for being lifted up,p. 75. as Capernaum, & being brought down in∣to Hell and Condemnation, this thou wilt know, who hast been pufft up and erred from that Spirit, which formerly hath opened thee; therefore thou railest against them that walk in it. And Roger, thou reprovedst G. F. too soon for False English, and Boys English and Non-sense (as thou callest it); but indeed I must needs tell thee, that here is much False English and Non-sense in thy Book: but whether the Fault be in thee or the Printer, I shall leave it; but how-ever I think, the Printer, that hath printed thy Book, hath grown weary of it, or at least been Careless, for it is paged 74, 74, 76, 77, 77, 78, 80: what, is this right Roger?
R. W. And thou bringest-in the same Author (Fol. 222) say∣ing, [Salvation and Faith are the Gifts of God, distinct from Christ]. To this G. F. Answereth, [They are all of him, and from him, and with him: and how is he the Author of Faith, in whom it endeth, from whence it cometh?] R. W. replyeth; As Potiphar's Wife cries out against Joseph, and pre∣tends Chastity, so doth this subtle Whore-monger, pretending, that all is pure Christ, the Light is Christ, their Hope, Faith, Saints and their own Spirits are Christ, no Distinction between Christ and them, for they are all of Him, from Him and with Him. Answ. Thou Justifiest, what thou Condemnest: thou cryest out against Potiphar's Wife, and thou art guilty Spiritually of the same Evil, that she would Carnally have committed. Fain wouldst thou have enticed J. T. and others to thy Polluted and Defiled Bed; and because they would have nothing to do with thee, nor that Spirit that leadeth thee, but refused Communion with thee, thou wipest thy Mouth, and complainest against Joseph, and wouldst bedirt him, now thou canst not have thy will of him, and that he refuseth thy Harlotty. Well, but I am an Whore-monger, yea a Subtle One: how so Roger? how provest thou this Black Charge? why! because I say, That Salvation and Faith are of Christ, from Christ and with Christ? behold now, ye New-England-People, what Spirit this Man is of! what Language he useth! what Com∣parisons he maketh, and Slanders he casteth upon me! And for what doth he these things? because I own and declare, That Sal∣vation and Faith are of Christ, and from Christ, and with Christ. I hope then, none will say, We, but R. Williams denyeth Christ: for they that deny Christ to be the Author of their Faith and Salvation, deny Christ; but it's plain, that R. W. doth so, for his Salvation and Faith is not of Christ: and what Regard should any have, to what such an Anti-Christ saith? But R. W. saith, that we say, That the Saints are Christ &c. but Roger, these are none of my Words, but thy False Consequences. But why! is not Christ made to the Children of Light in this Day Light, Sal∣vation, Hope, Faith &c. as well as he was made to them Sanctifi∣cation and Redemption in the Days past? where hast thou been? hast thou lost thy Bible as well as thy Religion in the Woods? see, what cometh of thy Vnfaithfulness! thou that werest an Oppo∣ser of the Priests, art turned their Oratour against the People of God.
But what a Forgery 'tis in thee Roger, to say, We make the Saints Christ, and our own Spirit Christ? were those my Words? to God's witness in all Consciences I appeal against thee in this thing, and let my Book be read: True Christians are of Christ, yet not Christ, yet One with Christ; 'twas Christ's Last Prayer, that they should be One in the Father and the Son. And for our own Spirit, it's enlightned by Christ, but it is not that Light, nor Christ the Light; for he is our Lord and King, and we are his Servants, and Subjects, and Friends, and Children: so thy Malice and Ig∣norance will not do, the Day hath discovered thee. Thou goest on to prove, That Christ is not the Saints, nor the Saints are not Christ: And who said, They were? and callest us Vngrateful Monsters, and such Monstrous Names for believing so, that never believed so, nor never writ so; it's a Faith of thy own making. Yet Christ is in the Saints, and the Saints are in Christ: but that the Devil cannot abide, for he would fain get at them, but that he cannot do, while they are in Christ; and this maketh all his Instruments rage, and thee Roger, amongst the rest. And thou takest up much room to prove, The Saints are not Christ (from Col. 1, ver. 11), and who said, they were so? so that falleth in Corse. R. W. Next thou say'st; I know, the Foxians turn Christ, yea his Blood also into a Spirit, a God. Answ. Where and when did they so speak or write? this also is one of thy Calumnies and Lies. Christ's Blood on the Cross for the World we own, and Christ's Blood and Life we own and par∣take of, by which we have Life Eternal; but what hast thou to do with Christ's Blood, that art not washt from thy Lies, nor so much as Repentest of them, that I hear of? R. W. Thou say'st; I have heard also the Foolish Blasphemy of one of my own Neighbours, saying, That the Blood of the Quakers, and by Name of W. B. was Saving and Salvation to the World.p. 76. Answ. This is a General Charge, and therefore no Charge, for it's a Charge against No Body: he nameth not his Neighbour, nor have we any Evidence of it; and if he will both add to, take from and wrest our Words, yea invent Lies against us, as he hath done, we have Cause to suspect, that this is a Slander also. R. W. Again thou say'st; What a Proud Frenzy is it in the Qua∣kers,
to cry out, We are the Conduit it self, we are the Well-head. Fountain and Spring, and (as this Frantick Fox once and a∣gain affirms) no Distinction between God and Christ,p. 77. and his Saints. Answ. O Roger Williams! that ever thou shouldst at this Age, and after so long a Profession of Religion, so Irreligiously abuse my Book and me, and those that read thee! there is nothing I have ever writ to any such purpose, as thou wouldst have; the Lord Rebuke thee! Nay, thou confessest a little further, that I call Christ the Author and Finisher of Faith, yea, that I often acknow∣ledge Christ to be so; how then are we the Well-head, Spring and Fountain, if Christ be so: if he be our Alpha and Omega, our Author and Finisher in Faith and Salvation? Thus thou gropest in the Dark, and ontradicts thy self, as all Babilons-Builders do, which endeth in Confusion and Destruction. R. W. Bringeth the same Author saying, [The Light, which dis∣covers Sin and Iniquity in Man's Heart, is not Christ the Door.] G. F. Answereth, [The First Adam was the Door, where all Sin and Transgression entred; and Christ the Light, the Se∣cond Adam, which doth Enlighten every Man &c. saith, I am the Door, the Way, the Truth and the Life &c. which finisheth Sin and Transgression, and bringeth in Everlasting Righteous∣ness, and the Way of Life out of Death: which Light disco∣vereth Sin.] R. W. Replyeth, and after he hath rambled a while, he saith; What then do these poor deluded Souls tell us of a Light and Christ within every Man in the World, dis∣covering his Pure Estate,p. 78. his Foul Estate, and his Raised Estate? which no Man or Woman in this world, that I ever read or heard of, by Nature had any Spark or Shine of such a Light &c. but they have read or heard of such things from the Ho∣ly Scriptures &c. Then thou Contradicts thy self, and say'st in the same Page; It is granted, that Nature's Light discovers a God, some Sins, a Judgment, as we see in Indians. Answ. — But what Scriptures had Nabuchadnezar and Darius, who spoke of the Kingdom of God and of Christ? and when he had cast the Three Children into the Fiery Furnace, what Scripture had Nebuchadnezar for saying, That he saw Four, and one like the Son of God? — And what must we observe from R. W's. Words? that he can see his Pure Estate, and his Foul Estate, and his Raised Estate without the Light of
Christ within him. And thou may'st say, John was a Deluded Soul, that came for a Witness to bear witness to that Light, that lighteth every Man that cometh into the world, which he calleth the Light in the Word (Joh. 1.). R. W. And thou say'st; Yea, doubtless Nature's Light is able (in Self-Deceitfulness) wonderfully to counterfeit true Heavenly Light, and the Devil seem an Angel or Messenger of Light from Heaven. Answ. Roger, thou might'st very well have applyed this at home; for these are none of my Words: for the Light, which I speak of, that Lighteth every Man, that cometh into world, is Life in the Word, Christ Jesus: and Christ saith, Believe in the Light; and he that believeth in it, shall be saved: therefore it is Saving. And could the Goaler and his Company have seen their Sins, without the Light of Christ to shew them their Sins, with which they might see Christ their Saviour, Physitian and Redeemer, who fed them with his Heavenly Bread, Water, Wine and Oil? but all this is needless and loathsom to thy full, foul Soul and Sto∣mack. And can any see Christ, that pardoneth Sin, but by his Light, by which they see their sins? but thou and all thy Race would see Christ, and not see your sins; but that cannot be, therefore you hate the Light, because YOVR DEEDS ARE EVIL. R. W. Thou say'st; How poor a Plea is this, Adam was a Door to Sin,p. 79. therefore Christ is the Door to the Dis∣covery of Sin? Answ. Have not all dyed in Adam? and doth not Christ enlighten very Man, that cometh into the world, that they might see their Sin and evil Deeds, and him their Saviour, and Door and Way again to God?Here thou wrongest G F's Words; for his Wods are, Christ is the Door, and the Life, which maketh an nd of Sin &c. and G. F's Words are not, That Christ is the Door, that discover∣eth Sin. and with the same Light to see, how their Deeds are wrought in God? and is this Natural? and is it not Christ, that saith, He is the Light of the World, the Promised Seed? And as for A∣dam's mincing and excusing his Sin, R. W. saith, All this is Revealed to us; and not a word yet of Christ the Promised Seed, or a Light Christ, to Convince of Sin (as R▪ W. saith). But by what Means was this Doctrine Revealed to R. W. and the New-England-Professors, to wit, the State of the Fall of Adam &c.
if it was not Revealed by Christ and his Light? R. W. Thou say'st; I know, the Song of this great Deluder is, Turn to the Light, and Hearken to the Light, thou seest, it chideth thee for thy Lying, for thy Stealing &c. is not this the Christ &c. o∣bey him, and he will teach thee and save thee. But the bot∣tom is, he English and Meaning is, to hearken to Satan, the God of this World. Answ. Was it not the Apostle's Doctrine, To turn People from Darkness to Light? and are they not such, as steal and lie, that will not come to the Light, because their Deeds are Evil? such as thou art with thy Bottom and Meaning, to hearken to Satan, the God of this World, to be ruled and guided by him, and not by the Light of Christ▪ nor to walk in it? how canst thou and the New-England-Priests be saved by Christ, and cleansed from all Sin, and not walk in his Light? And is it now become with thee and the New-England-Priests matter of Delusion, to turn People from Darkness to Light, to walk in it and take heed to it? and did the Apostle, that turned People from Darkness to Light, turn People to the God of the World? what Blasphemy is this! R. W. But thou say'st; The Scripture is but a Dead Letter, the true Christ is within thee, he will turn thee from thy Sins, and make thee Perfect as he is: and he is come in us (Ten Thousand of his Saints) &c. Thus thou mockest. Answ. R. W. hath not proved, that the Letter of the Scripture is Living; for Christ saith, Search (or, Ye search) the Scriptures; but ye will not come unto me, that you may have Life; for they are they, that Testifie of me: they Testifie of the Life; but Christ doth not say, They are Life or Living. And doth not Christ shew People their Sin, else how doth he Convince them of their un∣godly Deds? And doth not Christ say to his Apostles, Be ye Perfect, as your Heavenly Father is Perfect? and what dost thou kick against this Doctrine? We do confess, that Christ Liveth in our Hearts; and if he live not in your Hearts, you are Ropro∣bates, the Apostle saith. R. W. And whereas he scoffingly saith; He within thee, is the Word of God, the Christ of God, the Light of God, the Spirit of God, God himself, and He seeks Worshippers in Spirit and Truth. And then thou say'st; What is in all this, but the noise of Fenny Bitter in Hollow Canes &c? what is here but that two Common Businesses may reach to? 1. The Conscience of Good
and Evil, which every Savage Indian in the world hath. 2. The Whisperings, the Blindings and Cheatings of the Devil in Samuel's Mantle. Answ. Here the Reader may see, that R. W's Words are no∣thing in Answer to G. F's. Assertion. But what must we infer from R. W's. Words? but that the Preaching of the Word of God in the Heart, and Christ within People, except they be Repro∣bates; and God Walking and Tabernacling in his Saints; and the Spirit of God to lead his Saints into all Truth, that they may be his Sons; and the Light that shineth in their Hearts, that giveth them the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Christ Je∣sus; and the Worship of God, that is in the Spirit, in which he seeketh People to worship him; These Doctrines (saith R. W. are such a Conscience of Good and Evil, as every Savage Indian in the world hath. And further he saith, These Doctrines are the Whis∣perings, Blindings and Cheatings of the Devil, pretending (saith R. W.) Vowing and Swearing to be the Word of the Lord, to be Jesus Christ, yea, and that to your Feeling &c. This is an Horrid Lie, he knoweth it in his own Conscience: for we neither Vow nor Swear; but Christ Jesus the Word we feel to our Comfort and Salvation: but what Comfort in this Doctrine hath he to poor Sinners? And after this thou Contradictest thy self and say'st, That Christ Jesus is the Door of Hope to poor Sinners: here thou grantest, what G. F. asserts, and what thou hast been Cavilling a∣gainst; and so Contradictest thy self, which is frequent with thee. But Roger, is the Worship of God in Spirit and Truth a Temporal and Visible thing? prove this by Scripture; and prove to us by Scripture, That God, and Christ and his Spirit is called a Consci∣ence of Good and Evil, and whisperings, and blindings, and cheat∣ings in Samuel's Mantle. Also (pag. 74.) he saith to this pur∣pose; Natural Men, until Chang'd and Born again, do but prate, as the Devils do: but in Contradiction to that he saith (pag. 79.) That it is by Outward hearing or reading, and inward Convictions of Natural Conscience, God hath passed Sentence of Eternal Death: R. W. must this then be an Inward or Spiritual Hearing of this Sentence? And when People come to see their Sins by the Light of Christ, then People Cry out to Christ the Saviour, the Gospel, the Good News for Salvation, from him they Receive this Gospel, their Healing, and Setteth them out of Prison, and free from their Sin: and with his Light it is, they see themselves Blind, and with his
Light they see his Spiritual Eye-Salve, and his precious Blood which Cleanseth from all Sin. But these are too good and soft Words for thy foul Spirit and full Stomack, who hast cast out so many Lies against God's People. R. W. And thou bringest-in Ellis Bradshaw (Fol. G. F. 224.) saying, [There is more Words than one.] G. F. Answ. [God is the Word,p. 80. and the Scriptures are the Words, which Christ fulfilleth.] And R. W. replyeth, As the Design of the Bloody Pope and Jesuites are to kindle Wars between the Protestants, that the Protestants may do the Papists work; so deals the Devil, the old Serpent with Christ Jesus and the Holy Scripture, which are but one in a Sense, as the Sun and the Sun-Dial: his end is, to tear down the Sun-Dial &c. under pretence, that the Sun is within them, and they need no Dials or Clocks, no Visible thing, that is Temporal &c. and so to destroy the Person and Commands of Christ as Visible and Fleshly, pretending all to be Light and Spirit. Answ. Reader, what is this to G. F's. Answer? But R. W. have not the New-England Priests and Professors done the BLOODY Pope's work, as thou call'st him? and art not thou a doing it? and would they be so careful of the Scripture, but that they make a Trade of it; and under a pretence of Scripture and Dials with∣out, do the Devil's work to throw at the Spirit and Christ in Peo∣ples Hearts, and tear him out there, if you could? But I must tell thee R. W. that as to Christ himself and his Person, though he was Dead, yet he is Alive, and Dies no more; and he is out of your Reach, and you cannot persecute him any more: though they and thou may persecute him in his Members, that keep the Commands of Jesus. And as to Visible and Fleshly pretending, and the Visible and Temporal things, thy Clocks and Dials, (which are thy Helps to know the Invisible) know this, thou may'st pore on them, till thy Eyes rot in their Holes, and never know the Lord Jesus Christ, but by Revelation. R. W. Thou say'st; The word Dabar in Hebrew, and Logos in Greek signifie the Word &c. and that it is a Metaphor to say, God is the Word; for God is no more a Word, than he is a Man or a Spirit▪ &c. Answ. Dost thou not here gain-say John's Doctrine, who saith, The Word was God? and wilt thou give Christ the Lie, that saith, God is a Spirit? (Joh. 4.) but prove this by Scripture, that
John did say, That it is a Metaphor, to call God the Word. Then dost not thou Contradict thy self and say'st, [The Man Christ Jesus is called the Word] but was not he called the Word, that was called God? and did not this Word take Flesh? did Christ suffer and die, as he was God, or according to the Flesh, since 'tis said, The Word liveth, and abideth, and endureth for ever? Thou say'st, That G. F. confesseth, that the Scriptures are the Words of God: so here thou yieldest to G. F's. Answer; though thou makest a great Smoak with words to no purpose. R. W. Thou say'st; I do affirm, the Sun, and the Moon and the Stars are the Words of God &c. and the Rain and the Hail,p. 81. and the Gras and the Corn, and the Sand &c. Answ. These R. W. calls the Words of God; but where doth R. W. find in the Scriptures, that they are called the Words of God? give us Chap. and Verse. And as for David (Psal. 107.110: and Job. 33. Luk. 1.) what's all this to the purpose? these Words are owned, but not R. W's. Imaginations. R. W. Thou say'st; They rob the Scriptures of their Heavenly Title of the Word of God &c. and also turn this Word of God and Christ into a Spirit without any Body &c. and part him (his God head from his Man-hood) into a Fancy,p. 82. a Dream, a meer Whimsy and Devilish Imagination. Answ. We Rob not the Scriptures of their Title: thou preten∣dest thy self a Scholar, and dost not thou know, that Scriptures signifie Writings, and are called so by Christ and his Apostles? and we charge R. W. to shew, where the Scriptures do give them∣selves the Heavenly Title of the Word of God? And these are Words of thy own Inventing, as to say, Christ is a Spirit without any Body, and our Parting his God head from his Man-hood; this is thy own Fancy or Dream, Whimsy or Devilish Imagination, thou speakest of: as the Reader may see, there is no Ground for R. W's Words in my Answer. And as for thy saying, we would Run the Scriptures out of the world, and by seeming to em∣brace it, destroy and kill it; These are more false words of thy own Inventing: the Lord knoweth, we esteem of the Scriptures more than thou, by the Spirit, that gave them forth. R. W. And thou bringest Tho. Weld (G. F. Fol. 228.) saying,p. 83. [There lies a Mystery of Iniquity, for to say, The World calls them so, by such and such Names, or gives
them their Christian Names.] G. F. Answ. [There are Names given by the Heathen, the Heathen outwardly, by which Men are called; there is a New Name written in the Book of Life, which the World knoweth not: here is the New Man known after God in Righteousness, Created unto true Holiness. Now, who is this New Man and this New Name? the World may call him by the Old. So it is not a Mystery of Iniquity to say, The World calls him so.] R. W. Replyeth; As to Christian Names or things bearing or pretending to bear the Name, Authori∣ty or Vniting of Christ Jesus (as we know, the word Christian sig∣nifieth) &c. and thou say'st; Every Christian Soul should search into the Rise, and Practice and Warrant of them with holy Fear and Trembling in the Presence of God. Answ. What is this to the New Name written in the Book of Life, to tell us what a Christian signifieth? but if thou werest united to Christ, thou wouldst not persecute him in his People. Neither if thou werest in the Practice of that holy Fear and Trem∣bling in the Presence of God, thou wouldst not have uttered forth so many Lies and Scorns against them, that be in his Holy Fear, and Tremble at his Word. R. W. Thou say'st; Is it not a proud Trick of a Pharisee, thus to scorn the poor Heathens and Publicans, as not worthy to know the Quakers high Names, or to take up such Sacred Names and My∣steries upon their Lips? yea, is it not a Ridiculous Fancy thus to prate and (like Pharisees) to scold about washing of Hands, and Pots and Cups, therein placing invented Holiness &c. Who are G. F's. Heathen? &c. Answ. Such as thou, R. W. that knowest not this New Name written in Heaven, who callest it a Ridiculous Fancy, and compa∣rest it to the Pharisees washing of Hands, Pots and Cups, and in∣vented Holiness: and this is an Invented Lie of thy own to say, That we scorn the poor Heathens and Publicans. And R. W. why dost thou so rage against me? because I tell thee, The New Man hath a New Name? And then thou tellest us of the Jew and Gentile, and how that Lea and Rachel did give Names, that were signficant unto the Twelve Patriarch's: and R. W. who knoweth not this, or who opposeth it? what is this to G. F's. Answer? R W. Thou say'st; Doth Christian Regeneration or New Birth destroy Natural Births or Marriages,p. 84. or Names and Educations?
Answ. Where did ever any of the Quakers say, they did? or G. F. in his Answer destroy or slighted any of these things? so, it is a vain Question, — And thou say'st, They quarrel about Straws; when it is thy self, that settest them up and dost it. R. W. And thou say'st; What is this New Creature and New Name they speak of? how shall the World call them by it, if they know it not? Answ. Why is this? because thou and the World hate this Light, by which it is seen and known. R, W. Saith; Such are their Non-sensical Fancies of giving no Re∣pect to any in Word or Gestures, such are their Fantastical Con∣ceited Answers, who being asked, where they dwell? they answer, they dwell in God; and where they live? they answer, they live in God. Answ. And what must we observe from R. W. here? but that he would have his Honour and Respect, Pharisee-like, which Christ forbad, and cryed Wo against: and Christ saith, How can you be∣lieve, that sek Honour one of another, and seek not the Honour, that cometh from God only. And R. W. what! is it a Fantastical An∣swer, to say, That God's People dwelleth in God, and liveth in God? and doth not the Apostle say, In him we Live and move, and have our Being (as the Poet saith) for we are his Off-spring? R. W. Thou say'st; Are not They to the Popes a Kin, because they sling to the World their Old Names. Answ. Nay, we say, That Thou and the New-England-Profes∣sors are a Kin to the Pope both in Nature and Spirit; and your Nature of Dogs and Swine, Wolves and Lyons is not turned into Sheep, and Lambs and Doves. And here thou grantest, that as the Nature is chang'd, the Name is changed: but thy Teth and your Fruits have manifested you to be the Dogs and Wolves. R. W. Saith; That G. F. having attained a great Marriage, and a new Carriage and Civility — and his own former Ri∣gidity —. Answ. R. W. hath manifested his own Ignorance of G. F. and he is busie about that which doth not concern him: for G. F. is of the same Carriage, Civility and Courtesie, as he was at the First. R. W. Thou say'st; I am sure, they will do most them Is this Good Sense ? for worldly Advantages: for as they abuse the Scrip∣ture (Eccles. 11) The World is in their Heart; I may truly use it, and affirm it, the World and the
Pride and the Advantage of it (though they deny it, as the Pope and Cardinals do) is in their Hearts, and is the Body and Soul,p. 85. and Root and Branch of their whole Religion. Answ. Truly R. W. we may use the Proverb and say, Thy Tongue is no Slander; for thou art given up to Lies, and a∣busest us with them. Neither do we abuse the Scriptures, but e∣steem of them: and as for the Pope &c. thou should'st have gone to Rome, and told them these Words. And as for Worldly Ad∣vantages, and Religion rooted upon, It is not our Religion; but hath been the Religion of New-England: as witness, their SPOILING of our Goods, worse than ever did the Papists. R. W. Bringeth (from G. F's. Fol. p. 243) Richard Sherlock's saying, [We must not look for an Immediate, Extra-ordinary, Mi∣raculous Teaching from the Lord.] G. F. Answ. [Yet he saith, All Men are Taught Of God; what Confusion is here? The Grace of God: which bringeth Salvation, hath appeared unto all Men; and this he calleth an Outward Teaching by the Lord Je∣sus Christ: is that which bringeth Salvation, Outward? all in the Truth may judge this, and try thy Spirit. And the Teach∣ings of the Lord are not only Mediate, but Extra-ordinary also above all Yours, which are Men got up since the Days of the Apostles.] R. W. replyeth and saith; Although I have spoken before of their Immediate Inspirations, yet seeing, how greedily and boastingly this Deluded Soul with Scorn and Contempt of all his Op∣posites sucks in the Poyson of Devilish Inspiration instead of the pure Wine and Milk of the Christian Truth, and milks out this Poyson into the Mouths of his Poor bewitched Followers. Answ. Let the Reader observe, what Railing Expressions he giveth in the Front of his Reply! that God's Teaching in his Co∣venant of Grace, and by his Spirit he calleth Bsting, Deluded Souls, Scorn and Contempt, a Sucking-in of Poyson and the Devil's Inspiration, bewitching his poor Bewitched Followers, that follow God's Teaching; as though God's Teachings were not pure Wine and Milk and Christian rths: but God's Immediate Teaching is Poy∣son to R. W. R. W. saith, That G. F. affirmeth, That the Teachings of the Lord are not Mediate, but Immediate and Extraordinary &c. Con∣trary to the whole Stream of the Stes and Experience; Con∣trary to Psal. 9. Contrary to God's Teachings in every Man's Na∣ture — and God's Teaching the Fowls — and Abraham's Teach∣ing
his Children — and the ordinary Teaching and Feeding by Shep-herds, — and Contrary to the Teaching of the Holy Scriptures written by the Immediate Breath of God.p. 86. — This great Wrester of Holy Scriptures saith, They shall be all Taught of God: and Contrary to the Ordinary Teachings of the Priests and Levites &c. Answ. The Teaching of God in his New Covenant is, as the Apostle saith (Heb. 8.) The Lord saith, I will put my Laws into their Minds, and write them in their Hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a People: and they shall not Teach every Man his Neighbour and every Man his Brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me from the Least to the Greatest &c. and Isaiah saith (Ch. 54.) All thy Children shall be Taught of the Lord; and Christ saith (Joh. 6.) All thy Children shall be Taught of God: and this of God's Teaching in the New Cove∣nant is above Nature's Teaching, and Outward, Mediate Teaching, and the Priests and Levites Teaching in the Old Covenant. And this is not Contrary to the Scripture, nor true Experience, but ac∣cording to it; and not Wresting the Scriptures, which saith, They shall be all Taught of God. And as for Abraham's Teaching, and that in Psal. 9. and the Apostle's Teaching, what are your Teach∣ers to them? who are got up since the Apostles. And if the Scriptures were written by the Immediate, Divine Breath of God, and they were made Ministers by Divine Revelation; can any un∣derstand the Scriptures, but by the Divine Spirit? and is that Me∣diate or Immediate? And doth not Moses say, A Prophet will God raise up unto you &c. and him shall ye hear: and he that will not hear this Prophet, shall be cut off. R. W. Saith, What is there in G. F's. wild Notion? [Can that, which bringeth Salvation, be Outward?] &c. Answ. The Grace of God, which hath appeared to all Men (which bringeth Salvation) Teacheth us, that denying Vngodliness and Worldly Lusts, and to live soberly and Godly &c. (Tit. 2.) and this thou callest a Wild Notion: but that is thy own and wilful Ignorance. And is this Grace of God Outward, which bring∣eth Salvation? And as for our Men- and Women-Apostles their Teaching,p. 87. it is in the Power and Spirit of Christ; and they turn People from Darkness to Light, and so to God and Christ's Teaching, and to the New Covenant; and do not keep People always under Teaching, saying like the New-England-Priests.
But thou wouldst see a Sign and a Miracle, like the A∣dulterous Generation, the Priests, Scribes and Pharisees, thy Fore-Fathers. And as Assisted by the Devil's Doctrine, R.W. this suit∣eth thy own Spirit best: and thou hast proved nothing against us, but thy self to be a Liar, and Ignorant of God's Teaching in his New Covenant. R. W. Thou say'st; While they cry out, Light, Light, there is none (as Isaiah speaketh) not a Spark of Light within them. Answ. Here thou wrongest Isaiah's Words, and thou bringest them in Opposition to the New Covenant, and givest the Apostle the Lie, who saith; God, who commanded Light to shine out of Darkness, hath shined in our Hearts, to give us the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jesus Christ: which we and all true Christians have and witness in our Hearts. And what must we Conclude from R. W's. Words? That he and the New-England-Priests have not a Spark of the Light within them, that the Apostle speaketh of: John telleth you, Your Darkness cannot comprehend it. Then thou and you are Pitiful Blind Teachers, Disputers and O∣ratours: and ye are like to be no other, that call Light Darkness, and Darkness Light. R. W. Goeth on to his 43 Instance, where he brings-in Christopher Wade (G. F. Fol. p. 247.) saying, [The written Word is the Sword of the Spirit: and he maketh another Rule beside the Scripture False.] G. F. Answ. [Which (we say) is the Spirit, which gave them forth, whereby Peace is known upon the Israel of God. And the Pharisees had the Scripture, but had not the Sword of the Spirit: the Scriptures testifie of the Sword of the Spirit.] R. W. saith; I reply and affirm, The Spirit of God cannot here be the Sword intendedAnd yet in thy book called Experi∣ments (162) thou callest the Holy Spi∣rit the Two-edged Sword (Epistle De∣dicar. to Lady Vane): see his Contradicti∣on here.. 1. This Spiritual Furniture being a Similitude taken from War-like Furniture, Helmet, Breast-plate, Shield, Shoes &c. and every one applyed to Gifts and Means flowing from God's Spirit, as Faith, Hope, Sin∣cerity &c. it were most improper then, to bring in God or the Spirit to be the Sword or any of the other Pieces. 2. There is no more Reason to make the Spirit of God to be the Sword, than the Shield. 3. It seems too Low to the Holy Spirit and God to be here in this Similitude. Answ. Stay Roger, to the First; If the Written Word be the
Sword of the Spirit, then before the Written Word was, it seem∣eth, the Spirit had never a Sword? which is false: it had as good a Sword before, as since. To the next: It is not a distinct Gift (though a distinct Name) but a distinct Operation: and that thou shalt know. Yet if the Spirit be God (notwithstanding it proceedeth from the Father and Son) and the Spirit of God be God (as thou confessest): so may the Sword of God be God, and the Sword of the Spirit be the Spirit. — To thy Second Particular: Why not a Shield, as well as a Sword? Right; and it is so: This sheweth thy Ignorance of God, his Spirit, Scripture and Ex∣periences of the Holy Men of God of Old. Was not God David's Buckler and Shield? and was not God's Name a Tower of De∣fence? and is that distinct and separate from God? Again, is not God's Word as a Fire? and is not the Holy One of Israel a Flame? yea, Everlasting Burnings, that will consume thy Chaff and Stubble? and therefore is that Word not God? or is that Fire or Flame not the Word? — To thy Third Allegation: That it is below God's Spirit to be so called or resembled; this still sheweth thy Ignorance: Why not to a Sword as well as to a Lyon, a Rock, a Door, a Man of War, a Captain, a Stone &c? and is not a Sword the Emblem of Justice, God's great Attribute? R. W. But thou goest on, saying: (4) This was the Sword, the Only Sword, is called a Sword, with which the Lord Jesus fought and vanquisht the Devil,p. 88. It's Written, it's Written: and we may well say of it, as David of the Sword of Goliah, by which David cut of his Head, There is none to that▪ &c. Answ. O Roger, thy great Stupidity! was the Written Word Christ's Sword, yea, his Only Sword? the Spirit and Power of God is excluded then. And if it be, what had Christ, that the Devil had not? for he us'd the Written Words, and therefore Christ said, It's Written, it's Written; and so said the Devil: because Satan began with him with a Scripture in his Mouth. And so, according to R. W. the Devil had the same Only Sword, that Christ had. But consider what thou say'st, And yet in another Place R. W. saith, The Scripture is of no Value without the Spirit. The Scripture is the Only Sword: Roger, what Scrip∣ture had Christ or his saying, Get thee hence, Satan? Did not he with these Words rebuke the Devil, and by his Power resisted him, and over-came him? because thou say'st, The Scrip∣ture
is the only Sword, with which the Lord Jesus fought, and van∣quished the Devil: shew us that Scripture, from which Christ had that Rebuking, Resisting Sword, when he said, Get thee hence, Satan. But what became of poor Abraham, Enoch, Lot and the Pa∣triachs, if the Written Word be the Only Shield, Sword &c. that had no Written Word? But dost thou not commit Idolatry? con∣sider it well; to say, There is none like to the Written word: What was that Word, when it was never written or spoken, that Burnt as a Fire in the Prophets, that which came to them, before Writ∣ings were, and of which Writings do but declare, that was an Ax, an Hammer, a Sword, a Fire &c? is the Written Word more powerful than that? yea, than the Word in the Heart, the Word of Regeneration and Reconciliation, the Word that was God, that made all things? O Idolatry! O Blasphemy against God, Christ and Holy Spirit! Besides Roger, did Christ the Lord of the New Covenant make the Old-Testament-Writings his Only Sword? for there were no New-Testament-Writings then; if so, then either the New-Testament-Writings are none of the Sword, or the Sword was Imperfect: how say'st thou to that? — But Roger, remember; 'Twas not principally Goliah's Sword, that Kill'd Goliah; but the Stone: so the Stone cut out of the Mountain with∣out Hands, (which the Written Word was not) is that, which smiteth the Image, and bringeth it down; and will bring down thy Images and Imaginations, with which thou puffest up thy self in the Pride of thy Airy and Luciferian Mind against God, his Truth and People. — Again, the Sword, that cut off Goliah's Head, was that which Goliah used, as well as David; but the Stone was that which slew him, that he despised, as thou dost the Light and Spirit of Christ, and which Goliah could never use: which may be called a Figure of Christ, and not of the Scriptures, that wicked Men use as well as good. R. W. But go on; The Holy Spirit, Christ and God are Au∣thors of all those Heavenly Gifts and Graces, the Beginner and Fi∣nisher of Faith, and therefore not Faith nor Hope. Answ. Here thou prevaricatest and abusest me. Did I say, the Spirit was Faith or Hope? or Faith or Hope the Spirit? read my words again, even as thou lay'st them down. But why may not Faith and Hope be called the Spirit, that begetteth them, as well as Christ is called Sanctification and Redemption? but thou art blind.
Again, the Question is about the Spirit's power being its own Sword: the Sword the Spirit, the Spirit the Sword of God, and not Faith or Hope the Spirit. But that the Word of God (Ephes. 6, 17) which the Apostle calleth the Sword of the Spirit, is the Spirit, and not the Letter, is clear from the Greek which is thus; : where the Article  being in the Neuter Gender, is relative to , which is also in the Neuter; whereas  is Foeminine: and therefore the true English Translation of these words is thus: And the Sword of the Spirit which (Spirit) is the Word of God. And so doth Clarius (one of the Criticks) understand them (as may be seen Tom. 7. Crit. p. 3480.) and he doth observe, that the words are an Hebraism; The Sword of the Spirit, that is to say, the Spiritual Sword, or the Sword of the Spirit it self, or the Sword which is the Spirit, and that is the Word of God: for Christ, whose Name is the Word of God, is the Quickning Spirit. Even as when he saith, the Breast-plate of Righteousness, he understandeth the Breast-plate, which is Righteousness: and the Sheild of Faith, that is, the Sheild which is Faith: so, the Sword of the Spirit, that is, the Sword which is the Spirit. Thou talkest of thy Learning and Experience, and ei∣ther can'st not, or else deceitfully wilt not distinguish between Gifts and Operations: Faith and Hope are Gifts to us that believe; but the Sword, Fire, Ax, Hammer, Iron Rod, Honey, Balm, &c. are names for the divers Operations of the same Power. R. W. But thou say'st; Christ and the Sword with Two Edges (which cometh forth of his mouth) are distinct, and cannot be the same. Answ. But where is thy Reason for this? or where is thy boasted Experience? What! is that which goeth out of Christ's mouth, that which is not of him? was not that of Christ, that he breathed upon his disciples, when he said, Receive ye the Holy Ghost? what was that a Figure of, if not of a Participation of his own Breath, Life and Spirit? and if so, it seemeth, this that cometh out of Christ's mouth, must be his breath. By the Brightness of his Coming, and the Breath of his mouth he shall destroy the man of sin (that is, by his Spirit:) what now Roger, is it not Christ's Breath, that goeth out of his Mouth, that destroyeth? and is it not his Breath his Spirit? doth not both the Hebrew and the Greek say so? wherefore the Sword with Two Edges, that cometh out of Christ's mouth, is the Spirit, by which he destroyeth and will destroy the man of sin▪ and all such scornful men as thou art, if you repent not.
R. W. Thee great Interpreters are confounded in themselves: for in Ephes. 4. the Spirit must be the Sword — but in Hebr. 4. Christ must be the Sword with two edges, being the Word of God, and not the Spirit. Answ. Thou writest, as if thou ravest: there is no such pas∣sage in Ephes. 4. Next for Hebr. 4, there is no such thing, as making Christ the Two-edged Sword. For the words are, That the Word of God is sharper, then any Two-edged Sword; but that the Scriptures are not Christ and the Spirit (as thou wouldst have it) neither can they pierce even to the dividing asunder of soul and Spirit, and of the joynts and marrow: nor are they a discerner of the Thoughts and Intents of the Heart; this were to make the Scripture a Spiritual and Invisible Being, yea an Omnipresent one, yea God. For they declare, that he that searcheth the Heart, and trieth the Reins, and telleth unto man his Thoughts, the LORD OF HOSTS is his Name. Thou art like the Apostate Jews, that by thinking to Honour the Scripture, dishonour God, Christ, Spirit and Scripture too. But thou callest us Juglers, for shifting from Christ to Spirit, and Spirit to Christ again; what Vnsavoury Words hast thou? Is not Christ Jesus called the Word of God? and is he not called the Quickning Spirit? and is not the Spirit Christ's Spirit? and can Christ be separated from his own Spirit? but thou art Ignorant of that Vnion, being in the Death and Aliena∣tion from Christ and his Spirit. R. W. But it is Objected by G. F. That the Spirit was before the Scripture, and gave forth the Scripture. I answer, What then? G. F. is before his Book, and gave it forth; is it not therefore G. F's. Word and Writing, but G. F. himself? Or, is not the King's Majesty before his Declaration to the World? is it not therefore the King's Word, or is it the King himself? Answ. What I say, is true, and R. W. shall not be able to de∣ny it, if he own plain Scripture. For before the Scriptures were, the Word was: it was In the Beginning; so were not the Scrip∣tures. The Word was with God, and was God; so were never the Scriptures: All things were made by it, that were made: but nothing was ever Created by the Scriptures: therefore not the Word of God, but Words. Again, the Word of God, that came to the Pro∣phets, was not the Written Word, yet the Word: therefore the Written Word was not that Word; but a Declaration of that Word, and came from the Word: so that which was before the
Scriptures, and from whence they came, is the Word, and not themselves. So, that what thou Alludest to, confoundeth thy self: G. F. is before his Writing; and the Writing is not G. F: the King is bfore his Declaration, and the Declaration is not the King. In like manner, the Word is before the Scripture, and the Scrip∣ture is not the Word, but a Declaration of that Word, and the Words of that great Word. So we are for the Form of Sound Words, that proceed from that Divine Word, that dwelt in Enoch, Abraham and the Patriarchs, before the Scriptures were; and in the Holy Prophets and Apostles, before they gave forth the Old- and New-Testament-Writings: which they directed the Antient Saints to, and desired, that it might dwell richly in them. R. W. Thou say'st: This Immediate Inspiration of the Holy Scripture from the Spirit makes it a Word so powerful — a Stan∣dard, Touch-stone or Weights so perfect for the Tryal of all Spirits, Writings, Doctrines, Religions, Worships, Actions &c. Answ. The Immediate Inspiration of the Holy Scripture is no Scripture-saying, neither can the Scripture Inspire. Thou bringest-in, From the Spirit: if thou meanest, that they are Given forth by Inspiration, we own it: if thou intendest more, 'tis Erroneous: for Inspiration is by the Spirit of God only. Now, the Scripture is a Saled Book to thee and thy Generation, neither knowest thou the Meaning of it; for it is only given to the Spiritual Man to Discern, he that is lead and guided by the Spirit: but thou shuttest the Spirit out; the Scripture is sufficient. Where∣fore thou art ignorant of the Scriptures; for they are not to be learned, but by the Spirit, that gave them forth: they are shut up from all the Wisdom of this World, therefore the Jews under∣stood them not: but persecuted Jesus by them (as they drkly imagin'd) as thou dost us, and thought, in them to find Eternal. Life, and not in Christ, whom they discerned not, as thou dost not the Children of Light. But do the Scriptures try Spirits? they say; the Anointing is to do it: whom shall we believe? But Roger, Tryal of Spirits is more than Tryal of Doctrines, Writings and External Truth. What! if a Man profess all the Doctrines of the Apostles, and were outwardly not to be condemned in his Conversation; yet might have a Deceitful Spirit to gather to himself, and endeavour to supplant the true Servants of God and an all occasions use the Words of the Prophets and Apostles, and say, Thus saith the
Lord, but God never spoke by him; how wouldst thou try this Spirit and this Power? what Chapter or Verse would give thee a Savour and Discerning of the Spirit of this Deceiver, this Wolf in the Sheeps-Cloathing, to try not the Words, but the Nature, Life and Spirit, that useth them? But it hath ever been the De∣vil's Way in his Instruments, since the Scriptures were given forth, to pretend to Stand up for the Scripture; when the Design is, to war against, and undervalue the Power, Spirit and Anointing, en∣deavouring to bring it into Disgrace. But the Lord beholds these things, and he will overtake such Evil Instruments with his Judg∣ments: and his Power, and Spirit, and Seed of Life, and Holy A∣nointing, which the Scriptures of Truth testifie of, shall appear more and more, and go over all. R. W. Thou say'st further; But the Pharisees, saith G. F. had the Scriptures, but they had not the Sword of the Spirit. I answer: The Jews had and have, and so the Turks have had much of it, the Papists and the Quakers, and other Blasphemers, and the De∣vils themselves may have the Scripture, the Word of God in their Hands and Mouths. For may not a true Sword, a choice Sword be in a Mad-Man's Hand, whereby he may mischief, and wound and kill himself and others? hence Men make Merchandize of it, So∣phisticate, and Adulterate, and turn it into a Lie &c. Answ. The Strength of this Argument is; That as a Mad-Man may have a Sure and Choice Sword in his Hand, so may a Bad or Wicked Man have the Sword of God's Spirit in his Hand. O Blind∣ness! O thick Darkness! how art thou be nighted, that thou shouldst thus grosly write! When did the Word of God come to Wicked Men? how often did Wicked Men receive God's Word? for the one is a Fire, the other is Stubble; the one a Sword, or Ax, and the other an Old Rotten Tree. But Roger, is it not a saying of Wonder amongst Mens, What! put a Sword in a Mad-Man's Hand? and doth God put his Sword into Mad or Bad Mens Hands? what dost thou make of the Lord? one like un∣to thy self? tremble at thy Presumption and Wickedness! What! can Wicked, Carnal and Devilish Men handle God's Heavenly, Spi∣ritual and New-Covenant-Weapons? But Roger, can Wicked Men handle the Fire, and wound and kill with this Spiritual Sword? what do they kill? not the Good; for God's Sword will wound and kill nothing, but Wickedness: so this is no Mischief. And when did Wicked Men war against and kill. Wickedness with God's
Sword, whil'st they remained wicked themselves? A Kingdom di∣vided against it self cannot stand. So that, though Mad-Men may do Mischief with a Sword; yet Bad Men cannot with the Word of God: wherefore Bad Men are as good Servants and Souldiers, as Good Men, for they Fight with the same Weapon it seems, a∣gainst the same Wickedness. But Roger, when did the Scriptures kill any Body, or do any Mischief? for so thy Folly has driven thee to say. Again, is God's Sword so common? hath he no more Care of his Weapons, than to arm his Enemies with them? But every Sword must have an Edge; God's hath Two: which be they? And since a Sword can do no Execution without a Hand, the Scripture is unable, unless it hath a Hand to use it: what Hand is this? not the Spirit, R. W. affirms; who then? Wick∣ed Men as well as Good Men. This is the Doctrine of R. W. Dedicated to the King, R. Baxter and J. Owen, as the New-Eng∣land--Priests Oratour against the People of God called Quakers. But what is his Reason for this? bcause (saith he) Men make Merchandize of it, Sophisticate and Adulterate, and turn it into a Lie. Roger, These are the truest Words, thou hast said yet: you New-England-Priests have made Merchandize of the Scrip∣ture, we know very well, you have Sophisticated and Adulterated them with your Inventions, and turned them into a Lie, and made them to speak or mean, what they do not mean; and yet call this the Mind and Sense of Scripture, being dark in your Imaginations, and rebelling against the Light, that should enlighten you. But none can sell the Lord's Sword, nor Sophisticate, nor Adulterate, nor turn a Sword into a Lie. Nor can God's Sword be lost, broken, torn, burnt, drown'd, moulder'd, or any otherwise perish, as the Scriptures have by Carelesness, Age, in Fires, in Ship-wracks, or on purpose by some Wicked Men. And hadst thou known that Word, that is a Fire, an Ax, a Sword &c. thou wouldst not have writ such Blind Stuff, as thou hast done: which shall be thy Burthen one day. Nor is this to slight the Holy Scriptures; but such unholy ones as thou art, that war against God's Spirit, un∣der pretence of standing for the Scripture, that came from it, which thou understandest not; but we dearly own, and love and honour them: and they are good for Instruction, Doctrine and Reproof, that the Man of God may be Perfect through the Faith, that is in Jesus. But do not you New-England-Priests make Merchandize both
of Scripture, that you call the Word, and Christ and his Blood, and Miracles, Death, Resurrection and Ascension, that have so much a Year for telling Stories and your Imaginations of him? did the Apostles so? And R. W. as Nathan said to David, Thou art the Man: as they that read thy Former and Latter Writings, may see; for thou hast Sophisticated, Corrupted and Adulterated the Scriptures of Truth (which thou callst the Word of God) by mix∣ing and adding of thy Imaginations with God's Openings and Dis∣coveries, which thou mightest have formerly had in thy younger Years, when there was some Simplicity in thee, and thou werest under Sufferings for thy Conscience. But now thou say'st, There is neither Motion nor Voice within to hearken to, to turn to, to listen to in Heavenly things, in matter of Super-natural Light. Though again thou say'st (pag. 28.) I find in all Mankind a Con∣viction, that God is — Again I find, there is generally in all Mankind in the World a Conviction of an Invisible, Omnipotent and Eternal Power and God-head. And Roger, is not this in all Mankind to be lissen'd unto? R. W. Thou bringest Henry Hagger (G. F. Fol. 253.) saying,p. 89. [You call all Men Dead and Carnal, in the Ser∣pent's Nature, in what Form soever, if they differ from you.] G. F. Answ. [All that be not in the Light, that en∣lightneth every Man, that cometh into the World, which is the Way to the Father, differ from us; such be Dead, such be Car∣nal, in the Serpent's Nature: for none cometh to the Life, but who cometh to the Light, in what Form soever they be. And such as differ from us, differ from Christ: for none cometh from under the Serpent's Head and Nature, but who cometh to the Light.] R. W. replyeth and saith; The Quakers and Papists are of a Damning and Damned Spirit, as David saith of some, whose Teeth were as Swords; and Solomon saith, There is a Gene∣ration — whose Teeth are as Swords — Answ. And these are R. W.'s. and the New-England-Priests Teeth, as they have sufficiently manifested to the World; for they have out-stript many of the Papists. And as for Damning and Damn'd Spirit, this is thy own Portion R. W. and God's Elect thou canst not charge (whom he justifieth) nor Damn. R. W. And thou say'st. If ever there were a Generation of such in the World, the Papists and We are the Generations intended. Answ. This is thine and your own Condition. For did we ever
desire, that any should be punisht in matter of Conscionce, as thou dost? although formerly thou hast writ largely against Persecution for Conscience-sake. Did we ever WHIP, BANISH or HANG, or SPOIL the Goods of any for Religion, as your New-England-Professors have done, unto which thou hast joined thy self? And thou say'st, It is in vain, to tell us of Christ the Foundation, and of Building Hay, Wood and Stubble: That is thy own Condition, R. W. who hatest the Light, which cometh from Christ, in which the Saints Build upon Christ the Foundation, not Hay, Wood and Stubble. R. W. If you come not roundly to the Pope &c. or to the Light within &c. nothing remaineth but Fire and Brimstone and Dam∣nation, &c. Answ. Dost thou call the Light of Christ within the Pope, or makest as small a matter thereof? And whom have we burnt with Fire and Brimstone? let all the People witness against thy Blasphemous, Lying Spirit. And for thy Comparing us with the Pope, they own the Light within no more than thou and the New-England-Priests. And thou further say'st; Their Idol, called the Light within: here we do Charge thee with Blasphemy, for calling the Light of Christ, which shineth in the Heart to give the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jesus Christ, an Idol. R. W. And thou say'st; The Protestants overcome the Papists not only by Scripture and Argument, but in Charity; for they have hope of many among the Papists, as also among the Quakers. But the Papists and Quakers like Fire-ships burn and blow up all, that bow not down to their Image. Answ. Why how now Roger? What! have you overcome Pa∣pists and Quakers by Scripture, Argument and Charity, and yet the Papists and Quakers blow up all, that will not bow to this I∣mage, the Light of Christ, as thou scornfully callest it, R. W? it's not the New-England-Protestants, that have this Charity. But hath the Light of Christ blown up R. W. and his New-England-Protestants, and scorcht you so, that it maketh thee and you thus rage and blaspheme against the Light of Christ, and call it an I∣dol, beast like? But what Hopes have you of Papists and Quakers, if they burn you, and blow you up, as thou say'st? but thou wrongest the Papists; for they own not the Light of Christ with∣in, as we do: witness, they persecuted us both at Rome and Pa∣ris.
But this know, this Light, thou blasphemously callest an Idol, will be thy Condemnation. R. W. Then thou tellest us, The Quakers Spirit is far from the Spirit of Christ Jesus — and how the Poor Woman de∣sired the Crumbs,p. 90. as a Dog — and how Christ Pro∣claimeth the Kingdom to the Poor in Spirit — and his Blessedness to bleating Lambs and New-born Babes — and how Christ Bore with his Disciples — and their Ignorance of his Death and Resurrection. Answ. What is all this to G. F's. Answer, let the Reader see; alledging Christ's Promise, and his Kingdom proclaimed to the Poor &c. but if they hate the Light of Christ, they neither receive the Kingdom nor Promise. Neither did the Woman, nor Cornelius hate the Light of Christ: for if they had, they would not have received him, nor have had Faith in him. And as for Christ's Disciples, thou art short of them: and the Quakers are not far from the Spirit of Christ, for they have it; or else they would be none of his, like thou. And we have the Mind of Christ, 2 Cor. 2. R. W. Thou bringest John Brown (G. F. Fol. 259.) saying, [And them, that bring People to look at the Light within them, are as Korah, Dathan and Abiram.] G. F. Answ. [All that go from the Light within them, are as Korah, Dathan and Abi∣ram against the Lord's Prophets, Exalting themselves, and Per∣secuting them.] R. W. replyeth, That this Famous History of Korah, Dathan and Abiram's Revolt, may most properly be Ap∣plicable to the pretended Quakers, and saith; I know, G. F. charg∣eth this (to wit, Korah, Dathan and Abiram) upon all, that pre∣tend to Spiritual Ministration, and have not the Immediate Spirit of God, as the Apostles had — The Protestant Religion is a Religion protesting against the Bloody Man of Sin, the Pope. Answ. This is not New-England's Protestant Religion; the Laws, their GALLOWS, their WHIPS, their BANISHING, their SPOILING of Goods declare it to the World. And thou and thy Ministers, that have not the Immediate Spirit of God and Christ as the Apostles had, are in the Revolting Spirit of Korah: which is truly applyed to thee and thy Ministers (in Jude) and not to the Quakers. For you, that have not the same Spirit and Power, as the Apostles had, are to be turned away from; though you may have a Form, but denying the Power.
R. W. And thou say'st; The Quakers are Revolted from the Pro∣testants Doctrine and Worship, and sets up a Flag of De∣fiance against all,p. 91. but pretended Immediately Inspired Per∣sons, Invisible Worship and Ministers, and a Sullen, Proud and Dogged Conversation. Answ. The New-England's Bloody Doctrines, and Religion and Ministers, which are not Inspired by the Spirit of God, and have not the Mind of Christ and his Spirit, the Quakers are turned a∣way from such, who are none of Christ's. And though ye may Protest against the Bloody Whore, yet you wear her BLOODY GARMENTS, and do her Work with your BLOODY HANDS. And as for Dogged, Sullen and Froud Conversation, R. W. and the New-England-Professors might have kept at home: for how often have your Dogs-Teeth been in the Flesh of the People of God called Quakers, with your WHIPS, and HOT-IRON and CVTTING OFF OF EARS? And R. W. now thou dost shew thy Teeth, who desirest the Magistrates to punish us, though it be for Conscience; and thou wouldst not have this called Persecuti∣on: no more would thy Brethren in New-England, when they put God's People to Death. And the Spirit of God, that in∣spired them, and maketh us Ministers of the Spirit, this we do set up, the same Spirit, that the Prophets and Apostles were in. And thou, and the New-England Priests and Professors, that Worship not God in his Invisible Spirit and Truth, but scoff at it, ye are not in the same Spirit and Power, the Apostles were in: and so, have not the Spirit of Christ. So, out of thy own Mouth you are proved to be of Korah, Dathan and Abiram against God's Peo∣ple, that are in the Spirit of Christ the Apostles were in, and Truth, wherein they Worship God. So it's You, that are Revol∣ted from the Spirit of Christ and God's Worship, and Rebel a∣gainst his Light, as Korah did against his Law. And there is no such Word in G. F's▪ Answer, as Invisible Persons, Invisible Mi∣nisters; they are of thy own shameless Forging. R. W. Thou say'st; As to the Pretending Quakers, it is known, they are not Sons of Obscurity, as Reeve and Muggleton: and then thou fallest a railing against the Papists and Mahomeans. Answ. Let R. W. read his Book again and see, if his Brethren be not worse in many things, and as bad as Mahomet and the Papists: and therefore why shouldst thou rail against your own Spirit, who manifest their Fruits. And the People of God called
Quakers are not the Sons of Obscurity, New-England-GOALS, and their Persecution giveth thee the Lie; though Christ said to his Disciples, the World knew them not, as it did not know him: and therefore thy Charge is false against the Quakers, as Korah's was against Moses. R. W. saith, The Quakers do advance their own People. Answ. And what!p. 92. doth this torment R.W. and the New-England-People? must not we Love one another, and Esteem one another? and Love Enemies, and Pray for Persecutors? R. W. would have us to observe the Conspiracy of Korah &c. which was consumed by Earth and Fire. Answ. If R. W. had done this, and the New-England-Priests, he and they had never Conspired against God's People; but let them take heed of the Judgments: and is it not come upon some of them, since R. W. writ this Book? And let the Reader see, if R. W. have touched upon G. F's. Answer, which saith, They that do not bring People to the Light of Christ within, are of Korah and Dathan &c. and the Priest saith; They that bring People to the Light of Christ within, are as Korah, Dathan &c. And now, what must we observe from R. W's. and J. B's. Doctrine? but that They, that turn People from the Light, are not Korah; and they that Observe, Here R. W. &c. maketh the Apo∣stle Korah, who turned People from Darkness to the Light, Act. 26, 18. turn People from the Dark∣ness to the Light, are Korah. So then, the Preachers of Christ the Light within are Korah; and the Rebellers against the Light of Christ within are not Ko∣rah: and they, that will not believe the Doctrine of R. W. and the New-England-Priests, must be Korahs, Dathans &c. by them, and must be Punished, Goods SPOILED, IMPRISONED, BA∣NISHED, WHIPT, BVRNT in the Hand, and EARS CVT OFF &c. And are not ye herein worse than Korah? And a great deal more Railing Language thou hast here, not worth the taking notice of. R. W. Bringeth George Johnson (from G. F's. Fol. 262.) say∣ing; [The Americans were never ordained for Grace and Salvation;p. 93. and the Grace of God never appeared to the Americans] G. F. Answ. [Which is contrary to the Scripture, which saith; The Grace of God, which bringeth Sal∣vation, hath appeared unto ALL MEN &c. and, I will give him for a Light and for a Covenant to the Gentiles, a New Co∣venant
to the House of Israel and Judah; and that he may be my Salvation to the Ends of the Earth. And many in America have received Truth and Salvation.] R. W. replyeth; To the Co∣venant or Bargain of Ged with Man, First and Secondly, I have spoken, [Thou say'st, Thou hast spoken; but thou hast proved no where in the Scripture, where it is called a Bargain] And al∣so thou say'st, Thou hast spoken to the Figurative Calling of Christ to the Jews and Gentiles; and that this blind Soul taking it Li∣terally, he runs upon the Rocks of the Arminian General Redempti∣on, and the Universalists General Salvation, and that with a known Contradiction against their own Foundation of none having any Be∣nefit of Christ, that own not their Light: as also with a known Contradiction to Experience, which saith, The whole World lies in Wickedness. Answ. R. W. saith, G. F. hath contradicted themselves: I say, Nay. For R. W. saith, that G. F. is a blind Soul, and taketh Christ the Covenant literally; for he calleth Christ the Covenant Figurative; but he hath not proved it by Scripture, neither told us, what Christ the Covenant Figureth forth? and then in plain Words contradict∣eth himself (in the same page) saying, Christ is the Light, the Co∣venant &c. as the Sun in the Heavens to all the World. And G. F. doth not say, that any are saved; but who believe in the Light, as Christ commandeth, and so have Faith in him: this is no Contradiction to Christ our Foundation. And God saith, I will give thee for a Co∣venant to the people (Esa. 42.) and what THEE is this, if it be not Christ? And, I will give thee for a Covenant of the people to establish the Earth (Esa. 49.) and thou blasphemously callest this Covenant of Life (which lighteth every man, that cometh into the World) our New black Image of Light within. R. W. why dost thou Blaspheme against Christ and his Light, which shineth in our hearts to give us the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Christ Jesus? where was ever any of the Antichrists and false prophets, thy Fore-fathers so gross, as to call the Light of Christ a black Image? R. W. And thou callest the Light of Christ Jesus within a false Light and Spirit,p. 94. which we would infect the Indians with. Answ. What doth R. W. and the New-England-Priests preach to the Indians, if it be not Christ his Light & Spirit? and doth the Light of Christ Poyson and Bewitch People with Hellish Sorceries? And what must we understand by R. W's. Words, but that he draweth
them from the Light of Christ and his Spirit? but the Apostle was sent to Open the Eyes of the Blind, turning them from the Darkness to the Light. And do not they, that Draw People from the Spirit, bewitch People? read Gal. 3. R. W. saith, What G. F. means by saying, Some in America have received Truth and Salvation, I can but guess at; it is known, that he owns nothing of God in the Indians or English, until they bow down to their Idol. — Answ. Let the Reader see, and consider the Wickedness of this Man against the Light of Christ and the Grace of God, which G. F. saith, hath appeared to all Men, which bringeth Salvation! and are not the Indians Men? And God hath given Christ for a Covenant of Light to be his Salvation to the Ends of the Earth; and this Covenant of Light and Grace he enviously calleth our Idol, and saith, We own nothing of God in Indians or English. So, let the Reader read my Answer to G. J. and judge: but such as hate the Light of Christ, which they should believe in, and turn the Grace of God unto Wantonness, which should teach them, and bring them Salvation, how should they be saved? Now by this the Reader may see, what R. W. and the New-England-Priests have brought the Indians and the People to? seeing, to turn People from Darkness to the Light of Christ, and to Preach the Grace of God, by which the Saints were saved, Poysoneth and Bewitcheth People with Hellish Sorcery: and to bow down to Christ the Light and his Grace, is to bow down to an Idol: as you may see his Blasphemous Doctrine in his Reply to G. F. And many more Malicious Words are here, which are not worth the taking notice of. R. W. Bringeth John Owen (G. F. Fol. 263.) saying, [All Truth concerning God and our selves is to be learned from the Holy Scrip∣ture, the Word of God.] G. F. Answ. [There was Truth learned, before the Scripture was Written; and the Scriptures of Truth are the Words of God, which end in Christ the Word: and there are no Truths learned, but as the Spirit doth lead in∣to all Truth. And many have the Scriptures, but know not Christ and the Truth &c. so he hath thrown out Christ and the Spirit.] R. W. replyeth, and calleth it a Childish Answer, and saith, There was Truth (and Spirit, and Christ and Light) before Scripture. [So here R. W. and J. Owen are in Confusion; they Contradict one another.] And further R. W. saith, That the Scrip∣tures,
nor Preaching, nor Baptism, nor the Supper, nor Afflictions avail, except the Spirit of God set them home upon us: — and many have the Scriptures, and yet know not Christ. — So that this Answer is so Loose and Childish, that none but Fools and Children, and Frantick Persons can find any Savour in it. Answ. The Reader may see, how R. W. Contradicteth himself. He saith, The Scripture doth not avail, except the Spirit of God set it home upon us: and, Many have the Scripture, and yet know not Christ: and yet, The Scripture is the Sword, the Only Sword, and is counted the Sword, with which the Lord Jesus vanquished the De∣vil; and the Touch-stone and Judge, and Tryer of Spirits, and the Ground of Christ's and the Saints Faith, saith R. W. And thou say'st, This Choice Sword may be put in a Mad-Man's Hand, whereby he may mischief, and wound and kill himself and others, (pag. 88, 89:) and (pag. 94.) he saith, The Scriptures do not avail, except the Power of God set them home upon us; and con∣fesseth, Many have the Scriptures, and not Christ. Now R. W. and ye New-England-Priests, how can the Scripture, which will not avail without the Spirit, in the Hand of the Wicked or Mad-Men, Wound, and Kill themselves and others, and be the Only Sword and the Means to resist the Devil, and yet will not avail? which Scriptures they may have, and not know Christ: is this your Great Oratour, that must steer the Church of New-England's Helm? see his Contradictions. And as for Fools, Childishness, Poyson, Frantick∣ness, and no Savour nor Tast in my Answers, this he might have kept at home with his Contradictions, with his False Birth, he hath struggled to bring forth. R. W. For further Answer to this thou bidst, Read Ow∣en's Writings,p. 95. how he proves the Scriptures every Title of them to be the Word of God. Answ. The People of God called Quakers never denyed, the Scripture to be a Declaration of the Will or Mind of God; and so R. W's. and Owen's Work is Childish and Vain, to prove that a∣gainst the Quakers, which they never denyed, but maintain. And Owen and R. W. how cometh it to pass, that you have not writ∣ten against the English School-Master (which doth not tell us, that the Scripture signifieth the Word; but the Scripture signifieth Writing) and put it down, and called it in before now? R. W. Thou bringst Samuel Palmer (from G. F's. Fol. 264.) saying, [The State of the Soul in this Life is threefold; Creation,
Corruption and Regeneration..] G. F. Answ. [In Regenerati∣on the Life is changed from the Life which is in the Fall. So Regeneration and Corruption is not one in the New Life.] R. W. Replyeth and saith, Regenerations and Corruptions are not one in the New Life. Answ. But must they have this New Life, while they be upon the Earth, without Corruptions? if so, then how have the Saints a Battle and a Warfare all their days? (as in thy pag. 68.) is not this a Contradiction? R. W. saith, What a foul Trick is this of a False Man, to impute this to his Opposite, which he abhorreth. I guess, or he means, that in Regeneration there is a Perfection, and no Sin or Corruption left. Answ. Dost thou Abhor (and J. O.) a Sinless Regeneration with∣out Corruption and Sin? what Regeneration is that, that must have Sin, Corruption and Imperfection, and what are People Regenerated from? and are not they Regenerated and Born again, &c. R. W. Thou say'st; Hence the poor Frantick Souls cry out, that the Protestants plead for Sin Term of Life. Answ. Dost not thou make it good, and maintainest a Battle betwixt Flesh and Spirit all the Days? (pag 68.) and how there∣fore canst thou call us Poor Frantick Souls, for declaring that, which thou maintainest? And bringest Paul to prove it; when Paul telleth thee, The Law of the Spirit of Life hath made him free from the Law of Sin and Death (Rom. 8.) and that he had Fought a good Fight, and kept the Faith: then he was not FIGHTING, when he had FOVGHT; nor Crying, nor Com∣plaining, nor Wailing (as thou say'st from Rom. 7.) And callest us Foolish, poor Souls, with Simple Answers; and this thou might'st have kept at home, who dost not understand Paul's Condition: for Paul was not all his Days Complaining, Crying and Bewailing in that Condition; for he Preach'd the Gospel, and bid others to rejoyce, and rejoyced himself. R. W. Thou say'st, The Devil deals with Us, as Pirates do with Ships; he makes no Opposition against such he hath taken, and is pos∣sessed of. Answ. R. W. Thou and the New-England-Priests might have kept those Railing Words at home, who do the Devil's Works, not Christ's nor God's. For thou and they out of the Light of Christ and his Spirit would gather all to your selves; but Christ is Risen,
and is gathering People to God by his Light and Spirit, that maketh thee to rage, whose Ship is split in the Sea. R. W. So that no question, but the Quakers may be freed from ma∣ny Transgressions and Temptations to them, which others are assaulted with. Answ. But R. W. how can the Quakers be freed from many Transgressions and Temptations to them, which others are assaulted with, when the Devil deals with them, as the Pirate with Ships, and he hath taken them, and doth possess them, and is possest of? how can these be freed from Transgressions and Temptations? dost not thou herein Contradict thy self, R. W? R. W. It is a great Mystery, which neither Jews, Turks, Atheists,p. 96. Papists or Quakers know, how the Seed of all Grace may be in the New-Born, and yet the Seed of all Sin. Answ. This is R. W's. Mystery: but he hath not proved it by Scripture, That the Seed of all Sin is in the New-Born, and the Seed of all Grace; we charge R. W. and all the New-England-Priests, to make this good by plain Text of Scripture (as in his 96 Page). And the Apostle saith, If any Man be in Christ, he is a New Creature: Old things are past away; behold, all is become New (2 Cor. 5): and the Apostle saith, Put off the Old Man, which is Corrupt, according to the deceitful Lusts; and put on the New Man, which after God is created in Righteousness and true Holiness (Ephes. 4.): Now, is it not Blasphemy for R. W. to say, The Seeds of all Sin are in the New-Born, and the Seeds of all Grace? so R. W. hath masht all together. For there are Seeds of Sin in the Old Man, which is to be Put off: for John saith, (1 Joh. 3.) Whosoever is Born of God, doth not commit Sin, for his Seed remaineth in him, and he cannot Sin, because he is Born of God. And whosoever is Born of God, overcometh the World: and this is the Victory, that overcometh the World, even our Faith. Whosoever is Born of God, Sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God, keepeth himself, that the Wicked One toucheth him not. So the Seed of Sins are not in the New-Born, but in the Old Born, the First Birth in the Flesh, that persecuteth him, that is Born after the Spirit, like R. W. R. W. Thou say'st; The Quakers Pride; they say: We are come to a more Perfect and Pure Estate, than Paul at First was in, or
John, who saith, If we Confess our Sin: and James, who saith, In many things we offend all. Answ. We do know the Apostles First Conversion, and Paul's Crying out of sin; but that was not the Cry all their life time: If it had, Paul would not have said, he had Victory and was made free, and had fought a good Fight: and John would not have said, He that is born of God, overcometh the World: and such, that had overcome the wicked One, and were strong, and the Word of God abode in them (1 Joh. 2). And it is true, In many things You offend all; and therefore we keep to the One thing, Christ Jesus, in whom there is no sin. And John, who saith; If we confess our Sin, he is Faithful and Just to forgive us all our sins, and cleanseth us from ALL unrighteousness: Mark ALL; but this thou hast left out, for it maketh against thee. And as for Pride, Ambition, Vnbelief, Vn∣thankfulness, Intemperance, Covetousness, full of rash Anger, bitter Railings, dreadful Blasphemies against Heaven, R. W. which thou speakest of, thou might'st have kept it at home, and the Whore wi∣ping her Mouth, for thy bottle is full of it, and the New-England Priests whose fruits do declare it. R. W. He bringeth Richard Mayo (G. F. Fol. 275) the Priest's sayings, that saith [To say, the Gospel is the Power of God, is but a Metaphorical Speech: and that the Gospel is no more the Pow∣er of God, then the Rose-Cake, that lay in his Window. [But these blasphemous Words R. W. taketh no Notice of, nor his New-Eng∣land Priests, of Priest Mayo's Blasphemy.] G. F. Answ: [The A∣postle doth not say so; for the Apostle saith, The Gospel is the Power of God unto Salvation to every one, that believeth, in plain Words (Rom. 1.): but let the Reader read and see in all his Re∣ply, if ever he doth confess and own, that the Gospel is the Po∣wer of God to Salvation to every one that believeth, as Paul doth (Rom. 1). And we do believe, that his dark Spirit will not suf∣fer him; though in Words he doth confess, that the Gospel is Glad Tidings: but goeth about to prove, that to say, The Gos∣pel is the power of God, is a Metaphorical Speech; and maketh a great Rambling about it over and over, but to no pur∣pose. R. W. And he saith; The Gospel is Christ, it is the Spirit, it is the Light and God himself &c. Answ. Let the Reader see, if there be any of those Words in G. F's answer? But did not Christ dye for Sinners, and shed his
blood for them, and is not this Glad Tidings? and was it not to Paul? and is it not so to Sinners now? R. W. And thou tellest, The Devil hates glad News of Christ &c. and tellest of Kings Proclamations of Pardons or Liberty.p. 97. Answ. All this doth not disprove Paul's Words, the Gospel to be the Power of God: and thou, that hatest the light of Christ within, thou hatest-Gospel, as the Devil doth. And we do own, the Gospel is the Glad Tidings preached by the Apostles and Shep∣herds, and by us, God's people now, the same Gospel, as ever it was; though thou and the New-England-priests persecute us for preaching it freely unto you. R. W. And thou say'st (pag. 96) That the Great Fox, the Devil, who thirst after the blood of the Quakers — and (pag. 95.) thou say'st; The Devil deals with the Quakers as Pirates do with Ships; he makes no Opposition against such he hath taken and he possesseth, and is possest of. Answ. R. W. Dost not thou here contradict thy self? how doth he thirst after blood, when he hath possest them? as thou wicked-and lyingly say'st. R. W. And thou sayst, If our Gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost:p. 98. and bring'st 2 Cor. 4. In whom the God of this World hath blinded their minds — and believe not &c. Answ. If the outward Writings be the Gospel, not the Power of God, that Gospel or Bible, which be Writings, are not hid. It is the Power: for Unbelievers have the Scriptures or the Writings and Persecutors, that have the Form, and deny the Power, the Gospel: and a Condemn'd Person may see an outward pardon. And therefore the Gospel, it is the Power of God, which openeth the blind Eyes, which the God of this World hath blinded: and so doth not the Scripture, for that is not hid. And the Light, that shineth in the heart, giveth the knowledge of the Glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus, of his Gospel (2 Cor. 4.) And a many Stories and Ill-fa∣vour'd language thou hast in this Reply, not worthy to be taken notice of; of the Devil and Atheist &c. R. W. thou bring'st Daniel Gawdry (G. F. fol. 282.) saying [The Saints were come to the Spirits of Just Men made perfect, but not on Earth.] G P's Answ. [The Just Mens Spirit, that led them to give forth the Scriptures, was the Spirit of God, and that was
Perfect (which perfected them) and was, while they were upon the Earth, the Saints were come to, (which was Christ, the End of all Words) and so to God, the Judge of all the World.] R. W. replyeth, [but let the Reader see, what a lame and pitiful Reply it is.] He telleth us of the Spirit's being in Prison (1 Pet. 3.) He telleth of Mary's Spirit rejoycing in God her Saviour, Opposite to the Spirits of the Wicked in the Old World (that Peter tells of) now in Prison. Answ. Let the Reader see, if it be G. F's. Answer, that saith, That Mary Magdalen's Spirit, with which she praised God, was the same with them in the Wicked World in the days of Noah? but Peter doth not say, that these Wicked Spirits in the Old World are in prison NOW; he hath added this to Peter's words (as you may see 1 Pet. 3.) R. W. Thou say'st; The Spirit of God (Heb. 12) speaketh not of the Bodies of the Saints neither Con-joyned, nor a Part: nor 2dly, of the Righteous made Perfect; but the Spirits of (First) the Righteous. Therefore it seems to hold forth not a Perfect State of the Saints in this Life consisting of Spirit and Body, which our Proud Boasters say of themselues &c. nor (Secondly) in the E∣state of the Saints in the World to come. Answ. What is this to G. F's. Reply? and why doth not he speak plainly, Whether the Saints are come to Mount Zion, the City of the Living God, the Heavenly Jerusalem, to an Innumerable Company of Angels, unto the Church of the First-Born in Heaven, unto God the Judge of all, and to the Spirits of Just Men made Perfect? And can any come hither without the Spirit of God? see∣ing thou say'st, That the Scripture speaketh of the Spirit of God nothing at all, but of the Spirits of Men? So, the Question lieth here, Whether or no the Saints do come, while they are upon the Earth, to the Just Mens Spirits made Perfect, and to God the Judge of all, and to the Heavenly Jerusalem, the City of the Living God? For the Apostle saith, Ye are come hither, YE ARE COME; and the Apostle and the Saints were alive upon the Earth, when he spoke this. And thou makest a jumble about the Saints Bodies, and say'st, We are proud Boasters: and we never said of ourselves, that we were Perfect of our selves; but perfect by Christ, who doth perfect for ever by one Offering them that are Sanctified (Heb. 10, 14.) mark, them that are Sanctified. And we do own the States of the Saints in this World, and the States in the World to come, Life E∣verlasting:
and so we can truly turn thy lyes back again, seeing they are not ours. —And the Spirit in the Apostles encoura∣geth the Saints to Perfection: and the Apostle saith, he spoke Wis∣dom amongst them that are perfect (1 Cor. 2). And, Be ye Per∣fect, and of good Comfort (2 Cor. 13). Let us, as many as be per∣fect (Phil. 3, 12); and (Col 1) their work was, that they might present every man perfect in Christ Jesus: so the Imperfection was in Old Adam. That ye may stand perfect and compleat (Col. 4): how should they stand perfect and compleat, if they were not in it? That the Man of God may be Perfect (2 Tim. 3): and Christ saith, Be ye Perfect, as your Heavenly Father, which is in Heaven, is Perfect: Christ saith, Every one that is Perfect, shall be as his Ma∣ster (Luk. 6). David saith, Mark the Perfect Man (Psal. 37): and David saith, Many shoot in Secret at them that are Perfect: but if R. W. and the New-England-Priests say, There is none dis∣seit the Grave to be Perfect, then there is none to shoot at, nor to be markt at. And Christ saith, Be ye Perfect, as your Heavenly Father is Perfect (Matth. 5): and Peter saith, After you have suffer'd a while, make you Perfect: Signifying, that it is Attain∣able, or else Peter would not have encouraged to it. And God saith, Job was a Perfect Man, and upright, and one that feared God: and by one Offering hath Perfected for ever them that are Sanctified, (Heb. 10, 14). And the Apostle saith, An Inhe∣ritance amongst them that are Sanctified: mark, that ARE SAN∣CTIFIED; were not these upon the Earth? the Apostle saith, He that Sanctifieth, and they that are Sanctified, are all of One (Heb. 2). And the Apostle saith, I beseech you Brethren, through the Mercies of God, that you present your Bodies a Living Sacri∣fice, Holy, and acceptable to God, which is your Reasonable Service (Rom. 12): Now, must not the Saints (R. W.) present their Bodies thus Holy and a Living Sacrifice to God, while they be up∣on the Earth? and how can they present them to God, if they must not be Perfect, but carry a body of Sin to the Grave? or must they present their Bodies, when they are Dead? and doth not Sin make their Bodies dead, while they be upon the Earth, before they be dead outwardly? Now, if the Spirit of Christ, that raised him from the Dead, dwell in you, he that raised up Christ from the Dead, shall quicken your Mortal Bodies: and this we witness. (Rom. 8.)
R. W. Thou askest, What Truth is in these Words, Christ is the End of all Words?p. 99. and further thou say'st, The truth is, their horrible, unclean and foul Spirit would fain be rid of all Scripture-words and Learning also, that he may bring the more of miserable mankind (under the Cheating sound of Light) into his Eternal Darkness. Answ. R. W. that is thy own Condition, with the Cheating sound of Light, and these reviling Words of thine I abhor. And the Scripture Words we own, and all true Learning of that which is Good, both Natural and Spiritual: but thou wouldst rid the Spirit and Light out of the Peoples Hearts (if thou couldst) who hatest, and grievest and vexest it in thy self; and so railest against them, that walk in it. And I tell thee, Christ is the End of all these Words that are spoken of him, and doth fulfil them: and that is my Meaning, if thou wilt have a Meaning. R. W. bringeth Timothy Travers (G. F. Fol. 325.) saying, [God hath Ordained to Eternal Life all that shall be saved, before they had a Being in the World: but none cometh to Possession of this Salvation, but through the Obedience of the Spirit.] G. F. Answ. [The Ground of Man's Belief and Obedience is Christ, who doth Enlighten him to the Intent, that he might Believe and Obey the Truth. And who knoweth the Seed. knoweth the Election, before the World was made. &c.] R. W. replyeth, and saith, If he meaneth, that Christ is the Ground or Author, the Giver of Repentance and Faith to all the Elect, whom God the Father hath given him, we say so. Answ. You say so in Words, but not in the Faith and in the Re∣pentance; if you did, we should have Unity with you; for, who should be the Author of Faith, and Caller and Giver of Repentance, but Christ Jesus? R. W. Thou say'st; But if he put in their Invented Light in the Room of God's Election and Predestination, as the Effi∣cient and First Cause,p. 100. and of Christ as the Mediatour &c. he speaks Blasphemously of God and of his Son &c. he is now in the Burrough &c. who destroys God's Election, before the World was, and says, That when a Man Believes, he is Elected, when he is Predestinate &c. Contrary to all the Pretious Beds of Flowers in the Garden of the Scriptures, &c. Contrary to the Wit and Skill of Men, who frame a Book, or a House, or a Ship &c.
Answ. Let the Reader see, how R. W. wrongeth G. F's Words, or if there be any such Words in his Answer to T. T. the great Ranter? But what are all R. W's. Words, which he hath framed here, which are not G. F's? Can a Man know Election, Ordina∣tion, Reprobation or Predestination, or Christ the Mediatour and Redeemer and Saviour, without the Light of Christ Jesus? must not he first be turned from Darkness to Light, and from the Power of Satan to Christ and God, in whom the Election is before the World began? [In whom the Election is]. And doth not Christ command to believe in the Light, and the Light giveth him the Knowledge &c is not this Blasphemy in thee R. W. to say, That I Invent the Light of Christ, which lighteth every Man that com∣eth into the World, which is Life in the Word (Joh. 1)? and (Rom. 8. Ephes. 1.) those Scriptures we own, as they speak. And can God's Election be destroyed before the World began? thou say'st, Who destroy God's Election, before the World began; I tell thee, that neither thou, nor the Devil can destroy God's Election, before the World began: 'tis like, Thy Election (which is Reprobation) may be destroyed; but God's Election cannot be destroyed. Is not Christ called the Elect? and are not all his Saints Elect in him, and dies no more? and they cannot pluck them out of his Father's Hand? but thy Knowledge of this is like the Skill of Men fra∣ming of Books, Houses and Ships, which thou callest Vanity. — And as for the Scriptures, the Light of Christ is not Contrary to them, but owneth them, which Light and Spirit we are in (blessed be the Lord for ever!) which leadeth into all Truth of them. R. W. Thou say'st; As to the Seed and Election we know, they make themselves the Seed and Election. 2. They make Christ the Seed, that is, themselves. 3. They make God, and the Spirit of God the Seed, the Seed in every Man, which they Preach to; by them the Imprisoned Seed: and when one turneth Quaker, then God cometh out of Prison &c. They make no Distinction between God, and Christ, and Spirit, and Themselves, as Fox in his Book plain∣ly tells us &c. God himself is hearkened to; then the Soul so Hear∣kening becomes God, Deified with God, and God with God &c. whose Infinite Being and Essence these poor Proud Bruits have not so much Sight of, as the Devil. Answ. These Words are R. William's own Blasphemous Words and Forgeries from his Lying Imaginations: let the Reader see,
if there be any such Words in all G. F's. Book to T. T. the Great Ranter, which R. W. is joyn'd withal against us. But is not Christ called the Seed? and how the Promise was to the Seed? not to the Seeds as many, but one? and to thy Seed, which is Christ? (Gal. 3.) And is not Christ called the Seeds-man, that soweth his Seed upon all Grounds? and are not these Grounds in the Heart of Man? and were not the Apostles Ministers, Sowers to the Spirit? and was not the Spirit in Man, of which they reap Life Eternal? but R. W. and his New-England-Priests, it seemeth, Sow to the Flesh in Man, of which they may Reap a great Crop of Corruptions. And is not this Seed Spiritual, that Christ Soweth? but is not the Seed in the Prison in thee, or under the Clods, which Christ soweth, as scorch't or choak'd, that thou railest so much at it, where it bringeth forth Fruits to God (who is a Spirit) in the Good Ground? And we do not make Our selves the Seeds-Man, God, and Christ and Spirit, as thou belyest us; for we make a Distinction, the Lord knows: the Seed teacheth us to deny our selves, and to fol∣low Christ the Seeds-man. And do not I make a Distinction be∣tween God and Christ, when I say often, that God did not dye, but Christ according to the Flesh? And never did we say, By Hearkening the Soul became God, or God Deifyed, and God with God; for God, who breathed into Man the Breath of Life, and he became a Living Soul, is not that part of his Breath? And when thou hast framed a Meaning of thy own Words, which are not of ours, thou callest it our Ignorance, and say'st, We are fallen, like the fallen Spirits; and we have not so much Sight as the De∣vil: and yet (pag. 74.) thou say'st, That God hath endowed me with Excellent Natural Parts, and many of us, yea with the Light of the Holy Scripture, a Light of Experience and Common Mo∣tions from God's Holy Spirit: so, R. W. see, how thou Confoun∣dest thy self! But blessed be the Lord, we are in Christ Jesus, who bruiseth the Devil, the Serpent's Head, who is the Author of these Lies and Forgeries against us in thee, and they touch us not. And we never said (as thou wickedly say'st), That God was in Prison, or cometh out of Prison; it is He and his Son, that put∣teth us out of Prison. R. W. bringeth Tim. Trav. the Ranter's Words (Fol. G. F. 326.) saying,p. 101. [The Manifestation of the Spirit is given to every Man in the Church to profit withal;
and not to every Every Man in the World.] G. F. Answ. [The Manifestation is given to Every Man to profit withal WITH∣OVT DISTINCTION, the Apostle saith: I will pour out of my Sirit upon ALL FLESH, saith the Lord, and the Spirit of Truth shall lead the Saints into all Truth, and he shall Reprove the World: and that which Reproveth the World, is manifested to the World.] R. W. replyeth, G. F. is like a Cow with a Kettle on her Head, giving every one warning to stand clear; he boldly slanders on, and tumbles Heaven, Earth▪ and Hell toge∣ther. Answ. Let the Reader see, what vain, wild, frothy Words this Old Doting Man uttereth forth scornfully, and see if there be any such Words, as his are▪ in G. F.'s. Answer? And we do charge R. W. and his New-England-Priests to make this good by Scrip∣ture, and let us see, where it is written, that Heaven, Earth, and Hell can be tumbled together, according to R. W.'s Doctrine, that he hath Published to the World in Print. R. W. Thou bringest 1 Cor. 12. and Rom: 12. Ephes. 4. and tell'st, How God bestowed Gifts and Endowments on such, whom he pleaseth, and how he gave his Gifts and Ministrations to his Church &c. and then thou say'st; But this Prophane Mouth has some∣thing to say for it self: and then thou say'st; Was this (as he speaks) without all Distinction done Actually? p. 102. was it Vniversally so with all the Individual Men in the World &c? was not there a wonderful Wall of Separation between Jews and all other Nations? &c. And further thou say'st; Thou observest, how vainly this Deluded Soul cheats himself and others with the Term of All Flesh, Every Man, All the World; and so with the Term Light, Christ, Spirit &c. and thou askest, Whe∣ther all the Believers had these Gifts, to wit, Prophecies and Fiery Tongues? belong they to all the Men and Women in the World, who never saw nor heard of any Glimps of the Sun of Righteous∣ness? &c. Answ. The Scriptures (1 Cor. 12. Rom. 12. Ephes. 4.) we own, and the Order and Practice of the Gifted Men in the Curch of God: but the Apostle he maketh no Distinction; he saith in plain Words, The Manifestation of the Spirit of God is given to Every Mn to profit withal (he doth not say, Only to the Saints:) So he maketh no Distinction; not only the Saints, the Corinthians. And the Separation betwixt Jews and Gentiles Christ hath broken
down, and of Twain maketh One New Man: and doth not Christ Enlighten the Jews with his Divine, Heavenly Light, which is the Life in the Word, as well as the Gentiles, and saith, Believe in the Light? they that Believe in the Light, are One in Christ; and if not, with the Light they are Condemned? And we do not say, that All the Churches had the Fiery Tongues &c. there is no such thing in my Answer to T. T: and so, neither have all the Men and Women in the World these Gifts, belonging to the Church; how should they, if they hate the Light of Christs, and quench ad err from his Spirit, and resist the Holy Ghost? But thou say'st; The Men and Women in the World have never seen or heard of any Glimps of the Sun of Righteousness. What! have they never heard of Christ the Sun of Righteousness? I be∣lieve, there is Millions of Men and Women in the World, that will say, thou art a Lyar. For, were not the Apostles to Preach the Gos∣pel Christ Jesus, the Sun of Righteousness, to all Nations? and doth not the Apostle say, The Gospel was preached to EVERY CREATVRE VNDER HEAVEN, whereof he was made a Mi∣nister? (Col. 1, 23.) and the Apostle saith, Have they not all heard? YES VERILY (Rom. 10): and the Prophane Mouth thou speak∣est with, is thy own. If they hate the Light of Christ and quench his Spirit, that God hath poured upon them, and erred from his Spirit, then they are not like to See him indeed; and will not Hear him in the Spirit, and his Light, they will not See him nor Hear him, like the Pharisees and thou R. W. And why dost thou fret thy self about the Light, and the word ALL and EVERY MAN? but thy Spirit is the Sect-maker, and would not have ALL nor EVERY MAN, who art oppo∣site to the Prophets and Apostles Doctrine. Peter saith, It shall come to pass in the last Days, saith the Lord, I will pour out my Spirit upon ALL FLESH (to wit, Sons, Daughters, Young-Men, Old Men, Servants, Hand-maids) Joel 2. Act. 2: and John saith, This is the true Light, which was Life in the Word, which lighteth EVERY Man, that cometh into the World. And Paul saith to Titus; The Grace of God, which bringeth Salvation, hath appear∣ed unto ALL MEN: and Christ bid his Disciples, To go into All Nations to Preach the Gospel unto Every Creature: and the Apostle saith, That the Gospel was Preach'd unto Every Creature under Heaven. But R. W. saith, Men and Women in the World, who have never seen or heard of any Glimps of the Sun of Righ∣teousness:
and yet thou say'st (pag. 28.) I find in all Mankind a Conviction, that God is IVST and Powerful: and again; I find all Men confess, that the Will, or Word or Mind of God is PVRE: I find, that First, There is Generally in all Mankind in the World a Conviction of an Invisible, Omnipotent and Eternal Power and God∣head; and (pag. 102.) Men and Women in the World have ne∣ver seen or heard any Glimps of the Sun of Righteousness, thou say'st: how now R. W. dost not thou Contradict thy self here? dost thou Divide the Word here, as thou accusest me? is this New-England's Great Oratour? And so, as for Vnclean Beast, and Proud Fancy, and Vainly and Wickedly deluding, and Soul-Cheating thou might'st have kept this in thy own Bottle. R. W. Thou say'st; G. F's 2d. Answer here is, to wit, [The Spirit of God shall lead the Saints into all Truth] and R. W. saith; I observe here, how like a Skittish Jade this Wild Soul runs in and out &c. before he brings in, the Spirit of God poured out upon the Common World; and now he brings in, the Spirit leading the Saints: the next word he concludes, is, Every Man in the World to have the Spirit &c. Answ. Dost not thou confess, that the Holy Spirit testifieth, that he is the Comforter of the Saints, and is he not the Leader also? and dost not thou confess, that the Spirit is the Reprover of the World? (p. 102, 103.) then, hast not thou made thy self the Skittish Jade thou speakest of, and Running in and out? are not these Vnsavoury and Vnseemly Words out of an Old Man's Mouth, that professeth Christianity? And if the Spirit of Truth doth Reprove the World, and God hath poured his Spirit upon All Flesh; then, is not this the Common World? and if it be upon All Flesh, is not Every Man come into the World? else how will God Judge the World in Righteousness according to the Gos∣pel? Thou confessest, [That the Holy Ghost is a Reprover of the World, and that he Reproveth the World in his Threatnings and Judg∣ments;] and doth not he then Reprove the World for its Unrigh∣teousness, Judgment and Unbelief also? and if thou didst not Resist it, it would Reprove thee for thy Vnrighteousness, False Judg∣ment and Vnbelief, as Christ saith. R. W. Dost not thou say, The World mocks at this Ho∣ly Spirit,p. 103. Banisheth, Imprisoneth and Murdereth such, in whom the true Spirit of God appeareth. And further thou say'st; It is Lying Peor tells us, That all the VVorld (with∣out
Distinction) have the Manifestation of the Spirit of God to pro∣fit withal. There have been Persons professing the Order of the Holy Ghost, yet are far from the Savour of the Holy Spirit. Answ. This is thy own Condition R. W. and thy own New-England-Professors, who Resist it (as Stephen saith Act. 7.) and Mock at it, and BANISH, IMPRISON and MVRTHER such, in whom the Spirit of God appeareth: this hath been the Practice of the New-England-Priests and Professors to the Dishonour of Christianity. — And doth not the Apostle say; God will pour out his Spirit upon all Flesh WITHOVT DISTINCTION, as Peter saith? and is not this All the Men and Women of the World? what Flesh dare say, but they have the Reproofs of God's Spirit, when they do Ill? except it be such, as R. W. and R. W's. Pro∣fessors, that quench it, and have erred from it: so, thou may'st take thy Lying Peor to thy self. And so, it is thou, that art resisting and fighting against the holy Spirit of God. And can any profit in the things of God without the Manifestation of the Holy Spi∣rit, that is given to profit withal (and Peter and Paul say) to All flesh, and to Every Man? so it is their Doctrine thou oppossest, not with the Spirit, but with the dark fleshly mind. And thou tellest a story of Babilonish Orders, and of Absolom; which if thou did'st see that, thy own Condition in the Light of Christ thou hatest, it would be better for thee. R. W. Thou say'st; Oh! what Reproofs of God's Spirit hath G. F. and others of their Leaders had in and by so many Excellent Op∣posites and Scriptures and Arguments, which G. F. here trampleth under his Prophane Feet, without any Savour of the Spirit of God. Answ. R. W. thou highly extollest the Ranters here, Tim. Trav. the great Ranter, one of our Opposites: but thou hast manifest thy Spirit, and what thou takest part with-al against the People of God. And we have a Savour of the Holy Spirit of God, and in it can Savour our Opposites or Old Persecutors Spirits not to be of Christ: and it hath been the Evil Spirit, is in thee and them, that hath stroven against us. And we know, you may bring Scripture to a wrong End, as the Devil did to Christ; and the Lord hath given us Power over the Devil's Spirit, blessed be his Name for ever! and he hath blasted it, and brought down, which was up in Oliver's Days, that Persecuting Spirit. And we do own the Scriptures, letit be out of whose Mouths it be: though we can∣not
own their Meanings, nor have Unity with such, as hold up the Truth in Vnrighteousness. And as for Trampling, we trample nothing that is good, under our Feet, that is thy own Condition: but we do own the Appearance of God in all People — But R. W. thou say'st; Without any Savour of the Spirit of God: and yet thou say'st; I find in all Mankind a Conviction, that God is Just and Powerful: and, I find Generally in all Mankind a Con∣viction of an Invisible, Omnipotent and Eternal Power and God∣head; yet thou say'st, Without any Savour of the Spirit of God: read (pag. 28. 102.) thy Contradiction. — And thou say'st; It pleaseth God to strive with Men by Preaching: but not by such, as thou and the New-England-Priests are, that stir up the Punishment, Persecution and HANGING. R. W. Thou askest, Why David complaineth (Psal. 53.) that all the Children of Men, not one excepted, are Unprofita∣ble &c. are Abominable to Spiritual Matters and Hea∣venly Things,p. 104. (and further thou say'st) until the Spirit of God comes, and truly change the Heart and whole Frame of Na∣ture: until then we are as profitable as Hogs and Moles in a Gar∣den &c. and as devouring Foxes amongst the true Lambs and Chick∣kins of Christ Jesus. Answ. R. W. thou hast writ thy Condition and the New-Eng∣land-Priests there, to wit, the Devouring Foxes (and Hogs) of the Lambs of Christ and his Chickkins. For mark the Word, VN∣TIL the Spirit of God change their Hearts &c. and we believe, your Hearts and Natures are not changed, but you are Vnprofi∣table: for how can it be, when thou say'st, There is no Voice nor Motion within in Heavenly things in Matters of Supernatural Light to hearken to, to turn to, to listen to? (p 83.) — And was David's Complaint of the Children of Men Vnprofitable? — And doth not David bid, All that hath Breath, praise the Lord? and how can they Praise the Lord, if there be nothing of the Spi∣rit of God in them? And do not they quench that, which God hath manifested in them, which God hath shewn unto them, and which convinceth them of an Invisible and Omnipotent and Eternal Power and God-head? so, is not this Conviction of the Spirit of God in them? and will not the Lord pour out his Wrath upon all the Heathen, that call not upon his Name? And now, is there not a further Manifestation in these Last Days by Christ, who En∣lightneth every Man, that cometh into the World? and the Grace
of God, which bringeth Salvation, hath appeared to All Men? and God poureth out his Spirit upon All Flesh? but from this Spirit, Grace and Light in all Men thou art erred from, and canst not en∣dure to hear of it. R. W. Bringeth Hugh Archbal (G. F. Fol. 328.) saying, [Christ doth Enlighten none, but those that do receive him.] G. F. Answ. [Contrary to John 3. which speaketh of them, that hate the Light, and are Enlightned, and will not come to it, because the Light will Reprove them: so he, that hateth the Light, is En∣lightned, & will not Receive Christ.] To which R. W. re∣plyeth (and after his wonted manner,p. 105. with foul Expressions) & saith; G. F. abuseth 2 Cor. 4. & saith: Joh. 1. is not En∣lightneth, but Lighted; and the word  may signify both, &c. They which hate the Light, are Enlightned, no question, but with the Ge∣neral Offer of Mercy, as of a Candle or Sun to the Eyes of a Blind Man, which is yet their Condemnation &c. And before thou say'st, There is a Higher Light, which some are affected, tinctur'd and Enlightned with, and yet not the True and Saving Light; that in Heb. 6. where some Persons (as the pretended Quakers &c.) have seen much of the Nature of God, of his Holiness and Justice &c. and had a Tast of the Joys of the Next World. Answ. If ENLIGHTNING and LIGHTED signify both, then do not oppose it. And here thou confessest, They that hate the Light, are Enlightned, as well as the Believers in the Light; it is the same Light: but thou say'st, It is a General Offer, as a Candle or the Sun to the Eyes; That is an Outward Light, and a Blind Man can neither see Candle nor Fire: and so that which he doth not see, is his Condemnation, according to thy Doctrine. But is this according to Christ's Words? (Joh. 3.) are his Words no more, than a General Offer, as a Candle or the Sun to the Eyes of a Blind Man? for Christ saith? One Hateth the Light, and the other Loveth the Light, and bringeth the Deeds to the Light, that they may see, they are wrought in God: so that is not Natu∣ral, which giveth the Knowledge of God, which shineth in his Heart (as in 2 Cor. 4. which I do not abuse; but it is thou, that abusest it). And Christ saith, This is the Condemnation, the Light is come in the World, and Men love Darkness rather than the Light, because their Deeds be evil: here Christ giveth the Reason; for the Light dis∣covereth the Darkness, and their evil Deeds, or else how should they know them. For Every one, that doth evil, hateth the Light
(mark, Every one) neither cometh to the Light, least his deeds should be reproved: and so by the Light he knoweth this Evil Deeds, and knoweth he doth Evil, and knoweth he hateth it: and that is his Condemnation. And this is more, than a Candle or the Sun to the Blind Man's Eyes, that cannot see it: and every one, that doth the Truth, cometh to the Light; so it is the same Light, that he that doth Evil, hateth, and he that doth the Truth, loveth: and this is the Light of Christ. And how darest thou say, the Light was or is not Saving (Hebr. 6)? was not the Holy Ghost Saving? and the Word of God Saving? or, is not the Word of God Suffi∣cient to reconcile to God? and the Holy Ghost Sufficient to lead into all Truth? But thou say'st; In Hebr. 6. the higher Light, which enlightneth; and yet not the True and Saving Light: we charge thee to make this good (& all the New-England priests) by the Scrip∣ture, That the Light (spoken of in Hebr. 6.) is not the True and Sa∣ving Light? it's like, thou never tryed'st it. But thou art such as they, that are fallen away from the good Word of God; and resist the Holy Ghost, and become a Hater of this Light; though thou hast tast∣ed of the Gift: and Crucifiest the Son of God a fresh to thy self, as the New-England-priests, and puttest him to open shame; and then HANG, punish and persecute others, where he is manifest. I tell you, your Earth beareth Thorns and Bryars: and read, what will be your End. (Heb. 6.) R. W. bringeth James Dorram, saying [The Believer is not in Sin,p. 106. as the Vnbeliever is; he sinneth not, as the Vnbeliever doth.] And in another place he saith [That the Law is the same to the Believers, that it is to the Unbelie∣vers.] G. F. answereth (Fol. 330.) [Here any may read thy Con∣fusion: but I say unto thee, He that believeth, doth not commit Sin; but Vnbelief is Sin (Rom. 12, 20). And Christ is the End of the Law to every one that believeth, for Righteousness sake (Rom. 10, 4): and yet thou puttest both Believers and Vnbe∣lievers under the power of the Law.] R. W. replieth and telleth, How the Devil sinneth, and Saul and Judas, and Robbers, and Murtherers; (and saith) It is not so with the Regenerate or New-born. Answ. who saith, it is? But thou say'st, That the Seed of all Sin is in the New-born (Append. pag. 96.) and here thou say'st, They can no more touch Sin, (unless deceived or circumvented) then Fire can delight in Water, or Light in Darkness. How is all their Seeds in
the Newborn then, if it doth not touch them? for mark, thy words are, In the New-born. For the New-born are born of the Spirit, are they not? New-born Babes are born of the Immortal Seed of God: how proveth R. W. (with the New-England-priests) that all the Seeds of Sin are in the New-born, and yet it doth not touch them, no more then Fire can delight in Water? R. W. And further thou say'st, That the Protestants have proved from the Scripture and Experience of all true Saints,p. 107. that Sin and Grace, the Flesh and Spirit, the Law of the Spirit and the Law of Sin may and do continue in the Rege∣nerate or New-born; contrary to that proud Perfection of Pa∣pists and Quakers in this Life, &c. And G. F.'s silly Shift, saying, that Paul was perfect, and thanketh God for Victory, &c. Answ. We never read in the Scripture of such a Doctrine, till R. W. New-England's Oratour, hath publisht it, That Flesh and Spi∣rit and the Law of Sin should be in the New Birth in this Life. This is contrary to the Apostle; for he saith, With his mind he ser∣ved the Law of God, but with the flesh, the Law of sin; so, this was in the Flesh or Old-man Unmortified or put off: so this Law of Sin and Flesh and Spirit was not in the Regenerate part or New-Birth (as Doting R. W. saith) but in the contrary Birth, the Old Man. And Paul did cry out, Wretched man, who shall deliver him: and he saw no Man, but Christ Jesus; and thanketh God through him, who gave him the Victory: and was not Paul Perfect, when he said; As many as are perfect, be thus minded? But why cannot R. W. read as well Rom. 8. as Rom. 7. where the Apostle saith; There is no Condemnation to them, that are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the Flesh, but after the Spirit: and the Law of the Spirit of Life maketh him free from the Law of Sin and Death: so the Apostle saith, he was a free Man from the Law of Sin and Death; but R. W. giveth him the lye, and saith, There is a Combate with the Law of Sin in the New-born in this Life. And, so as for Silliness and Ignorance of the Saints Life R. W. and his New-England professors and priests may keep at home. R. W. And thou say'st: They are to strive after Perfection and Holiness, &c. as a Child going after his Father, the Scholar or Maidens following their Copies and Samplers, though they never come near the full Exactness and Perfection of them. Answ. R. W. doth confound Reason among men, and Short of
the Truth. What! shall the Scholar never learn his Lesson, nor the Maidens learn their Samplars, to be as perfect as their Masters and Teachers? So, the Children shall never come to an Exact Perfect∣ness of Copies and Samplars, nor a Child never to come to go, as his Father doth? nor to be in the Strength and Knowledge of outward things, as his Father? then what do all these learn their Copies and Samplars for, if they never be to come near the full Exact∣ness and Perfection of them? But what shall we understand from R. W.'s Words and Doctrine in this? That they, that learn of Christ, shall not be perfect, as their Heavenly Father is Perfect,Should Christ Command that, which is Impossible to be attained to? as Christ commandeth? and that the Saints shall not be sanctified throughout Body, Soul and Spirit, whil'st they be upon Earth? and, That Christ doth not sanctify his Church without Spot or Wrinkle and Blemish, or any such thing, and present them to God, as on this side the Grave (as Ephes. 5)? But what doth R. W. and the New-England priests say to John (1 Joh. 2); He that abideth in Christ, ought himself even also to walk, as Christ walked? and in another place: So as he is, so are we in this present World? but let the Reader see, what a silly Reply he hath given to G. F. here; he speak∣eth nothing of Rom. 10. and 11. to the contradicting of them, that which G. F. hath asserted. R. W. bringeth in (from G. F.'s fol. 338) John Na∣smith (Priest from Scotland) saying [That the Evil Spi∣rits are both Sinful and Reasonable] G. F. answereth,p. 108. [This is a Lye: for Reasonable is not Sinful; Vnreasonable is Sinful (1 Thess. 3): They have not the Faith. And if the Evil Spi∣rit be Reasonable, and the Good Spirit, they are both One: who then is Vnreasonable, if the Evil Spirit be Reasonable? Thou puttest no Difference betwixt the precious and the vile: thou hast the Mark of a blind Guide, and of a false Prophet in thy Fore-head.] R. W. Replieth and beginneth with Railing, and saith; First, The filthy, rash Fury of his Mind and Pen — and saith, 2dly, This proud Pharisee will appear to be a Sadducee also, and to bold no Angels nor Spirits. It's true, they pretend to own Scripture, Christ and Resurrection, they with the Jesuites-Equivocations name Angels and Spirits; but the bottom (as some of them, and that in Print, discover) is, They hold, there is but one Spirit, which is in all, into which all return; and the Soul of Judas is as Happy, as the Soul of Peter.
Answ. Reader, this is nothing to G. F.'s Answer; neither hath he, nor can he make out any of these False Charges, which he hath forged (which be not our Words) against us: and there∣fore we can say, When he speaketh a Lie, he speaketh of himself, and is the Father of it. For, where did ever any read in any of our Books, or, is there any thing in G. F.'s Answer, that we hold, There is but One Spirit in Man? R. W. and the New-England-Priests, have not we often told you, that you have vex∣ed, and grieved and quenched the Spirit of God? And we never said, That Judas's Soul was as Happy, as Peter's; it was not like: for Peter had fed the Lambs of Christ; and Judas betrayed him to the Chief Priests, as thou art doing now in his Saints, who hast Crucified him to thy self a fresh. And Christ, and Scripture and Resurrection we own according to Scripture Really, without any Pre∣tence or Equivocation; that is thy own Condition. And R. W. thou say'st, They hold neither Angel nor Spirit: then again thou say'st; There is but One Spirit, and that in all: And all in one Sentence confoundest thy self. And so, as for Silly, Rash Fury of Mind and Pen, thou mightst have kept this at home. R. W. Thou say'st; A Man is a Reasonable Creature, as op∣posite to a Woolf and Fox &c. and yet he may be Unreasonable in his Actings, as a Woolf and Fox: who, though Unreasonable in their Natures, are not Sinful, though a Plague to a Man, since his Fall. Answ. Let the Reader see, what a Silly Reply R. W. bringeth here to G. F.'s. Answer to J. N. G. F. doth not speak of Wolves and Foxes Vnreasonableness; but he speaketh of Men, that have not Faith, are Vnreasonable, and that have Faith, are Reasonable: and the Priest J. N. maintaineth, that Evil Spirits are Sinful and Reasonable; which R. W. saith nothing unto, but telleth us of Wolves and Foxes, though Vnreasonable, yet not Sinful, that have been a Plague to Man since the Fall: and falleth a Railing. And who knoweth not, that a Man is a Reasonable Creature, and op∣posite to a Woolf and Fox? and his Actings Vnreasonable, like a Woolf or Fox, out of the Faith of Christ, as thou and the New-England-Priests and Professors have done to the People of God, and Herod, and the Chief-Priests against Christ and his Apo∣stles. R. W.) Oh! Happy were it for G. F. that he had been a Wild Fox in the Woods, and had not been so Sinful, by so horribly abusing so
great a Talent of Wit and Reason, which the Father of Lights hath given him! [and yet Knoweth no more, than a Parret? p. 35.] Answ. And why would R. W. have G. F. to have been a Wild Fox in the Woods? because he would not follow his Imagi∣nations, and such like in others, but followeth Christ Jesus? and he is his Prophet, his Bishop and Shepherd, Counseller and High-Priest. But R. W. thou say'st; G. F. hath so great a Talent of Wit and Reason, which the Father of Lights hath given him: but it's thou, that so Sinfully and Horribly abusest it, not he. And then thou Con∣tradictest thy self, and say'st (pag. 87.) They cry out Light, Light, and there is none (as Isaiah speaketh) not a Spark of Light with∣in them: and here thou abusest Isaiah; for Isaiah doth not speak so (Isa. 8.) as let all read. And thou may'st see in the Margin, There is no Morning in them: and there are many Stars Outward∣ly, before people cometh to the Morning; and is it not so Inwardly, as it is Outwardly? But dost not thou deny the Prophecy of I∣saiah of Christ, who saith, I give him for a Covenant of Light to enlighten the Gentiles? I must tell thee, we Gentiles have re∣ceived this Light according to John's Witness, who Enlightneth every man, that cometh into the World, Christ Jesus. And pag. 100. R. W. saith, These poor proud Bruits have not so much sight of, as the Devil, (to wit, of God): and pag. 108, So great a Talent of Wit and Reason, which the Father of Lights hath given him, &c. so here R. W. New-England's Mouth and Oratour may see, how he contradicteth himself. R. W. saith, We know the Nature of the Devils, Admirable Wit and Reason, as well as the Power of those Vnclean Spirits the Lord Jesus Christ cast out, they did believe and confess the Lord Jesus Christ &c. and, This their Knowledge and Ability is from God; though their Sinful Hardness by God's Just Sentence runs them upon such mad and desperate Courses: as it is with the Sons of Men, when the most holy Judge deliveres them up to the Counsels and Projects of their Proud and Deceitful hearts and Spirits. Answ. R. W. thou hast spoken thy own Belief, and the Be∣lief of New-England's priests and professors; and the Practice of your proud, deceitful hearts and Spirits hath manifested themselves. But R. W. is the Vnclean Spirits, their Wit and Reason so Ad∣mirable with thee? and thou say'st, Their Knowledge and Ability is from God: but where did ever Christ and the Apostle say so? For Christ (wilt thou give him the Lye?) he saith, He was a Murderer from the beginning, and he abode not in the Truth, be∣cause
there is no Truth in him; and when he speaketh a Lye, he speaketh it of his own (mark, not from God) for he is a Lyar, and the Father of it, (Joh. 8, 44.) Now, I query from R. W. and the New-England Priests,Note: Is not this a Ran∣ters Prin∣ciple of R. Ws? What Know∣ledge and Ability hath the Devil from God, and what Admirable Wit and Reason, seeing Christ saith, There is no Truth in him? and what Wit and Reason can a Murderer have, which Christ calleth a Murderer from the Beginning? And he that is called a Murderer from the Be∣ginning, thou allowest Admirable Wit and Reason, and say'st, you know it: and say'st; that their Knowledge and Ability is from God: If from God, it must be Truth; and Christ telleth thee, There is no Truth in him. And it's like, R. W. and the New-England-priests have more Knowledge and Acquaintance with the Devil and Vnclean Spirits, than with God and Christ Jesus, and your Belief and Confession is like theirs. And though the Devil did Confess the Son of God, yet this was not Truth in the Devil; but in the Son of God; for in the Devil is no Truth: & if there be no Truth, there can be no true Reason; and Reason doth not run into mad and desperate Courses, as thou say'st, the Evil Spirits run into. And have the Saints their Knowledge and Abilities from God; and the Devils their Knowledge and Abilities from God too? but is not the Devil's Knowledge and Ability, Wit and Reason, SIN and EVIL, seeing Christ saith, There is no Truth in him? then how is the Truth in his Knowledge and Abilities, Admirable Wit and Reason? seeing, when he speaketh a Lye, he speaketh of his own; for he is a Lyar, and the Father of it: so his Abilities, nor Wit nor Rea∣son is not from God. And he abode not in the Truth, because there is no Truth in him: then what can all his Abilities and Know∣ledge, Admirable Wit and Reason be? And Christ destroyeth the De∣vil and his Works: what! doth Christ destroy Admirable Wit and Reason, and the Knowledge and Ability, that is from God? no surely, that was out of the Truth, in whom there was no Truth, whom Christ the Truth destroyeth, the Lyar, the Murderer, who abode not in the Truth. R. W. Bringeth Henry Foreside, a Scotch Priest (G. F. Fol. 345.) saying, [Concerning those Words of Ezek. 18, 28. If the Righteous Man turn away from his Righteousness,p. 109. his Former Righteousness shall be no more remembred: and he said, The Meaning of that Scripture was, They thought, they
had been Righteous, and were not; but supposed, they had been so.] G. F. Answ. [Here-in thou art a Minister of Vnrighteousness, and thou goest about to make God a Lyar, and the Prophets, and pervertest the Scripture. For, if he forsake his Righteous∣ness, and commit Sin and Iniquity, and trespasse, he shall die, and not live in the Righteousness; but if he forsake his Sins, Trespasses and Transgressions, in the Righteousness, that he hath done and doth, he shall live: (and so God's Ways are Equal, Ezek. 18.) And thou say'st; They thought, they had been Righ∣teous; but it was not so. And the Lord by his Prophets said, It was so, that he should live in the Righteousness; and die, if he departed from it, and transgressed: here thou art a Diminisher from the Prophets and Apostles Words, whose Name is to be diminished out of the Book of Life, Rev. 22, 19.]— R. W. replyeth, and saith; The Question is about Falling away from Saving Grace and Righteousness: wherein it is notorious, that the Quakers &c. And then thou goest on, and tellest of a Story of the Papists, Pope and Arminians, [which thou hadst better kept at home, or gone and told them to their Faces.] And further thou say'st; That the Quakers maintain, that the least, that hearken to the Light, are Born again: they that are Born again, cannot sin; and that they which cannot sin, are Pure, as God is Pure. And therefore they Falling away from them, they must necessarily hold that which is Blasphemous, and that God himself may fall from Grace &c. being kept down, as a Cart laden with Sheaves (per∣verting Scriptures) by Wickedness and wicked Spirits, which are too hard for God, and Christ and Spirit in all the Men and Women in the World, that do not hearken to their Feigned Light. &c. Answ. Here are a many Horrid Lies of R. W.'s that he hath in∣vented and forged: and let the Reader see, if there be any such Words in G. F.'s Answer, or any of their Books; and doth not say, as thou say'st God can fall from Grace (who is the GOD OF ALL GRACE): which is thy own Blasphemy, and Evil Con∣sequence, not ours: but as the Apostle saith, The Grace of God hath appeared unto all Men. And they, that walk despitefully to the Spirit of Grace, and turn it to Wantonness, do not they fall from it? (as in Jude:) and we charge thee, to make it good by Scrip∣ture, for there is no such thing in G. F's. Answer. And we do not pervert the Scriptures: and it is wickedness in thee to say, The wicked Spirits are too hard for Christ, his Spirit and Light in
Men and Women; &c. but, as the Scripture saith, such as thou do quench the Spirit, and vex and grieve it, and may imprison Christ in his members, who Crucify him a fresh to your selves. And as for thy Scoffing Words, Hearkening to their feigned Light, and let loose the imprisoned God and Christ, These are thy own Blasphemous words, not ours: for let the Reader see, is there any such Expression, as a God in Prison, in G. F's words, or the Scripture either? though the Lord by his Prophet speaketh, how he was laden, like a Cart with Sheaves. And dost not thou Scoff and Mock at such, as hearken to the Light of Christ, who is the Light of the World, and enlightneth every one, that cometh into the World? I tell thee, this Light will be thy Condemnation. And the Light, and the Spirit and Holy Ghost, which thou art erred from and resists, the Evil Spirits are not too hard for it; but it will be too hard for thee and them in the End, thou shalt know it, when thou and they are Judg'd and Condemn'd by the Spirit and Light. And dost not thou give the Prophet Ezekiel the Lye? did not they fall from Righteousness (in Ezekiel) that forsook it, and com∣mitted Iniquity? did not they dye, and not live? and dost thou tell God and his Prophet, It is notorious, that they fell from Righteousness? and dost thou tell the Apostle, It was notorious, they fell from Saving Grace, who turned it into wantonness, and walked despitefully against the Spirit of Grace? And doth not Christ say, He that believeth in the Light, becometh a Child of Light? and John saith; He that believeth, is born of God: and whosoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin; for his seed remaineth in him, and he cannot Sin, because he is born of God: in this the Chil∣dren of God are manifest, and the Children of the Devil: Is not this Scripture (1 Joh. 3.)? And, He that is born of God, overcom∣eth the World: so, doth not he overcome the Sin, (1 Joh. 5.)? and he that doth Righteousness, is not he Righteous, as he is Righteous? and he that committeth Sin, is of the Devil: let no man deceive you. (1 Joh. 3, 7.) And doth not Christ say; Be ye perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect? And what! must all these Scriptures be denyed, and say, They are not Attainable in this life? R. W. Thou tell'st of the Imputed Righteousness of God in Christ (Ezek. 18.),p. 110. Of the Sanctifying Righteous∣ness in Christ, and of an Indians Righteousness, and of  Civil Righteousness, and of a Pharisaical Righteousness, &c.
Answ. What is all this to the purpose? for the Righteousness, that Ezekiel spoke of; was the Righteousness of the Law, which they were to do, and live-in in their time: and where doth the New Testament speak of Two Righteousnesses, of Christ and the Foolish Virgins? make this good by Scripture R. W. And Christ's Righ∣teousness doth exceed the Scribes and Pharisees Righteousness, or the Indians either, that may free them from Outward Crimes: and for the Foolish Virgins Righteousness, who make a fair Show of the Building upon the Rock without Light, thou might'st have kept at home. R. W. And thou say'st, Adam shall live, if he keep his Bar∣gain: so shall all his Posterity, if they keep the first Cove∣nant. Answ. Did not God give Adam Power and Dominion over all that he made? and when he bad him to subdue the Earth, did not he give him power to subdue it? and charged him, that he should not Eat of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil? And did not God pour out his Spirit upon the House of Israel, to whom he gave his Statutes, and commandeth and bid them to live in them? and were not God's ways Equal? and when they Erred from the Spirit, and Rebelled against it, did not they cast the Law of God behind their backs, and forsook the Lord? And did not the Apostle say, I through the Law am dead to the Law? and the Righteous∣ness of the Law was fulfilled in him; and he did not make the Law of none Effect? but where doth the Scripture call the Law of God or his Command a Bargain? Now, do not you Christians cast the Law of Life, which is in Christ Jesus, which maketh free from the Law of Sin, behind your backs, saying; None can be made free, while they live upon the Earth? R.W. Thou fall'st a railing, and say'st: Doth this Face of Brass, who hath so horribly slighted the Scriptures, now adore them?p. 111. is he so zealous for them, and against the Viola∣tion of them? &c. Doth he not throughout all his Book, and all of them in Word and Writing deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God? and only that Frantick Light of Christ (ima∣gin'd by them to be in all Mankind) to be the only Word of God? yea, is it of any use or more Value to them, that have the Scriptures in their hearts, as they say, then a Dead Letter, and an Old Almanack? &c. and thou say'st, They undermine the Scrip∣tures.
Answ. As for Face of Brass, R. W. might have kept for him∣self his Face of Brass and Frantick Spirit he speaketh of: we do not in no place in any of our Books or Writings (as the Reader may see) deny, undermine or slight the Scriptures; but do esteem them with the Spirit, that led the Holy Men, that gave them forth, who learned them of God. And they are called the Words of God; and Christ is the Word of God, who lighteth every man, that cometh into the World, with the Light, which is the Life in the Word. And this we must own, if we own God, and Christ and the Scriptures; and are not a shamed of it afore men, to wit, of-Christ the Light, which lighteth every man, that cometh into the World: which thou cal∣lest Blasphemously that Frantick Light or Christ; but Roger, it will be thy Condemnation.—And we never compared the Scriptures with an Old Almanack, or esteemed them so, in that thou belyest us; and we cannot give the Titles to Scriptures, which are belong∣ing to God and Christ: for the Word became Flesh; and so, not the Scriptures. And Christ doth not say, that the Life is in the Letter; but in him: and they testify of him, who is the Life. But R. W. is the Life in the Letter, and is the Letter Living? seeing thou say'st, The Scripture availeth nothing, except the Spirit of God set them home upon us (pag. 94)? and dost thou not say then, The Word is good for nothing (as thou callest the Scripture) without Life? and what sense is this R.W? And can any people know the Scriptures, except by the Spirit of God, which leadeth into all Truth of them? which we say in Truth and Sincerity (as Christ and his Prophets call them) to be the Words of God; and thou that say'st otherwise, dost not thou Add to the Scriptures? and read thy Portion, Revelat. the last. And when thou hast forged many Words of thy own, then thou makest a Re∣ply to them, and fall'st a railing at them, and dost not reply, to G. F's Words: and the Reader may see, there is none of these bad Words in G. F's answer, as thou here falsly assertest. R. W. quoteth a Book from Holland (G. F.'s fol. 356▪) saying,p. 112. That [God hath put out the Remembrance of your sins, and the Corruptions within you, wherein you must fight all your life time.] G. F. Answ. [Whilst the Sins you are fight∣ing with-al, are not blotted out in your own Particulars, this is not the Life of the Saints, that are not fighting all their Life-time, but come to the Kingdom of God, witnessing Sin and Ini∣quity blotted out; and the Everlasting Covenant of Peace and Life with God.] R. W. replyeth, and falleth a railing with many
Vnsavoury Words, and saith: He shews no Knowledge of the He∣brew and Greek, (whence our English Scriptures come from them, as a Daughter from the Mother) and falls short of many English Writers, who scorn to disgrace their Mother English (by so much Ba∣stard and False English) &c. Answ. Here R. W. would seem to be some Body in his Hebrew, Greek and Latin; and let the Reader see, if he hath not Con∣demn'd himself in Judging G. F? though some Words may have been mist in the Printing or in Paging, as many have in his; but he hath not shewn, which is the False English in this Place. R. W. saith further; If ever any poor empty Soul have talked of God without God, and the Holy Spirit within, without them, or any true Savour of them, and of the Holy Writings, &c. without them, or any true Reverence of them, and Love to them; of Light, without any Spark of true Illumination, &c. Answ. How angry and furious is R. W. here! this is thy own Talk, R. W. and not G. F's. And Poor Empty Soul thou mightst have kept at home: for can any Talk of the Holy Spirit within, and have not a Savour or Sense (if it be truly there) within, which we witness? and we do Reverence the Scriptures, and God and Christ with his Holy Ghost, by which the Holy Men of God did speak them forth. But how now R. W.! do I Talk of the Light without any Spark of true Illumination? and yet so great a Talent of Wit and Reason, which the Father of Lights hath given me? what! hast thou forgotten this? (in thy App. p. 108.) R. W. Thou say'st; That no Sin is blotted ou, until there be no more Root or Seed of it in the Soul to Fight against: [and these are thy own Words (of which thou makest a large Reply) and not mine: for my Words are; The Saints are not Fighting all their Life-time.] And thou bringest Paul and the Galatians to Combate with Flesh and Spirit▪ (Gal. 5.) and,p. 113. Paul did not the things, that he would, &c. and Eph. 6, and Luk. 21, and 2 Cor. 7. &c. and Christ speaking to the Churches to Watch, to Overcome, to Repent, &c. Answ. What is all this to the purpose, to prove, That the Saints were Fighting all their Life-time, and had a Combate all their Life-time? all these Scriptures do not prove it, nor Paul's Warfare. For Paul (as I said before to thee) said, He had FOVGHT the good Fight, and he was made free by the Law of the Spirit of
Life in Christ Jesus from the Law of Sin and Death: though the Apostles and the Saints went through many Conditions, before they came to this. And the Prayer of Christ, to Pray against Temptations &c. so, it is not a Sin, to be tempted; but a Sin to Enter into Temptation, is owned. And Christ's Prayer, Forgive us, as we forgive others, &c. if New-England-Priests and Professors had minded the Practice of this Prayer, they had not CVT OFF THE EARS, nor WHIPT or BANISHT, SPOIL'D Goods and HANG'D God's People. And doth not the Lord say, I will blot out your Sins, and your Sins and Iniquities I will remem∣ber no more? and must not the Saints witness this upon the Earth in Growth in Grace, and in the Knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the New-Covenant of Light? R. W. saith; If all, that are in their Fancied Kingdom, are freed from Sin, and come to Peace and Joy, why then do they themselves still confess to be subject to Quaking and Trembling, as if they were at the Foot of Mount Sinai? which indeed they are —. And then thou tellst of a False Peace, Joy, False Repentance, Mortification, Sanctification and Salvation &c. Answ. R. W. that is thy own, and Priests and Professors in New-England Condition, and not ours. And to Mount Sinai, the Receiving of the Law, you never came; though ye may boast of Mount Zion. And G. F's. Words, The Saints are come to the Kingdom of God, and witness Sin and Iniquity blotted out, and Everlasting Covenant and Peace and Life with the God of the Life; and thou Blasphemously callest it our Fancied Kingdom. But R. W. doth any Sin or unclean thing enter the Kingdom of God? and did not Christ and the Apostles Preach the Kingdom of God, and said, No Vnrighteousness should inherit the Kingdom of God? Be not deceived, &c. and (1 Cor. 6, 9.) Envyings, Mur∣ders, Drunkenness, Revilings and such like, they which do such things, shall not inherit the Kingdom of God (Gal. 5): and doth not John say, He was in the Kingdom and Patience of Jesus? (Rev. 1, 9.) And was Paul come no further, then to Mount Si∣nai, when he Trembled among the Corinthians? and R. W. thou art as Ignorant of our Condition, as thou art of his. Is there no Fear and Trembling at the Word of God, but at the Foot of Mount Sinai? and was not this among the Jews, after they came into Canaan? and was Paul at Mount Sinai, when he Came to the Corinthians in much Fear and Trembling? Well! we do hear
him, whose Voice shaketh the Earth; and not the Earth only, but the Heavens also, that that, which can be Shaken, may be Remo∣ved; and that which cannot be Shaken, may Remain: and that is appeared, Glory to God for ever! which this Condition, I see, nei∣ther R. W. neither Priests in New-England have gone through. R. W. Thou bringst Robert Tuchin (from G. F.'s Fol. 365.) his Saying, [The Most-Faithful Messengers of Christ have acknowledged,p. 114. that they came short of their Du∣ty.] G. F.'s Answ. [They that are Faithful Mes∣sengers of Christ, have their Answer; Well done, Good and Faith∣ful Servant. Where did Paul, John and Peter acknowledge, they came Short of their Duty? hast not thou slandered the Servants of the Lord, thinking them to be like your selves? and falsly accusest them, that Ye may seem Justified; who are False Messengers, and come in his Name, when you have no Com∣mission from him: and you come short of every good Work▪ But it is not so with Christ's true Messengers; for they Fulfil his Will, that sent them: it is the Lord, that worketh in them, whose they are, whose Duty they perform by his Spirit.] R. W. replyeth, and beginneth with Railing and saith; The Heavens were not Pure in his Sight (to wit, God) and he laid Folly to the Charge of his Angels, &c. Answ. This Eliphas, the Temanite speak against Job, as R. W. doth against us, (Job 4.) when he Contended against Job, and Re∣proved him; of whom God said, He was a Perfect man: so this is thy Ignorance. As for my Endowments, and our Endowments, they are from the Lord: and I do grant, That Adam and Eve was Perfect, and yet they Fell; and (thou say'st R. W.) We all by them are Fall'n Short of the Glory and Love of God, into the Dung∣hil of Hellish Darkness. THERE YOV ARE, this is true R. W. in that which cannot Comprehend the Light of Christ, which he Enlightneth every Man, that cometh into the World, with∣al; but callest it an Idol: which Shineth in your Darkness, and your Darkness comprehendeth it not. And thou bringst David's Sayings, (Psal. 143: and Psal. 19.) Enter not into Judgment,p. 115. nor reckon with thy Servant, &c. Cleanse me from my Secret Sins, &c. but what is David's Adul∣tery and Murther, that the Most-Faithful Messengers of Christ come short of their Duty? for thou must bring a Text of Scrip∣ture, where they said, They acknowledged, they came short of their
Duty? let us have Chapter and Verse for this, then thou hast said something. And then thou speakest of Abraham and Isaac:— But where is the Charge of Abraham, that he said, he came short of his Duty? or Enoch? or Abel? but as it is said, The Righ∣teous may fall, but rise again; but the Wicked shall fall into Mis∣chief. And doth John cry out (1 Joh. 2.) that he acknowledgeth, that he came short of his Duty? there is no such saying there; and thou wrong'st John: but he writeth to the Young-men, because ye are strong, and the Word of God abideth in you, and ye have OVER∣COME the Wicked One. And John saith, If we confess our Sins, he is Faithful & Just to forgive us our Sins, & to CLEANSE VS FROM ALL VNRIGHTEOVSNESS (1 Joh. 1.): and further saith, If we walk in the Light, as he is in the Light, we have fellowship one with another▪ and the Blood of Christ CLEANSETH VS FROM ALL SIN. R. W. And thou say'st, Paul confest and bewailed his Coming short; The Good, that he would do, he did not; &c. With his Flesh he served the Law of Sin: and though it was not Paul, that sinned, but Sin, that dwelt in him; and thou more then fearest, this Mystery is hidden from the poor Quakers. Answ. But R. W. thou saidst now, It was not Paul, that sinned, but Sin, that dwelt in him: and thou said'st (pag. 96.) of another Great Mystery, How the Seeds of all Sin dwelt in the New-born: and yet, It was not Paul that sinned, thou say'st; for Paul saith, It is not I: but he speaketh of the Two I's, and the Two ME's; which thou say'st the Seeds of all Sin is the [], and in the ME, that serveth the Law of God. But Paul, Peter, and John were not always in that Condition, Peter of denying his Master, and Paul cry¦ing out of Sin, and the Law of Sin, and coming short of their Du∣ty, thou callest: for Peter Exhorted to Perfection; and Paul said, he was made free, with the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus (as I often said before): and he had fought a good Fight, and kept Faith; and there was a Crown laid up for him. And John said; As he is, so are we in this present World: and he was in the Kingdom: and Paul said, The Life that I now live, is by the Faith of the Son of God: and I live, yet not I, but Christ liveth in me, &c. Therefore, how did the Most-faithful Messengers of Christ acknowledge, they came short of their Duty, &c. in the New Covenant to the End? did they fall like Adam and Eve? and we have had full Experience of the Saints Tryals, Sufferings and Temptations both within and without.
And G. F. doth not say, That the Servants of God never fail'd in Word or in Thought: there is no such thing in G. F.'s An∣swer; and therefore thou mightst have spared those Words: but there is no Comparison to be made with the Faithful Messengers of Christ (G. F. saith) and your Pretended Messengers, that never heard his Voice; and so have no Commission from him. And I must tell thee R. W. and you New-England-Priests, that deny Christ the Light, with which he Englightneth every Man, that cometh into the World, which is the Life in the Word, and callest it a Fran∣tick Light and an Idol; thou and they deny Christ that bought you, Worse than Peter, that Deny the Light, which he Commandeth to believe in. And so you are Come Short of every Good Work, but not of the Evil, who would parallel your selves with the Faithful Messengers of Christ, and finding Fault with them, ye do not see your own selves: for the Faithful had Victory. R. W. He bringeth Thomas Hodges (G.F. Fol 372.) saying; [The Scripture speaketh of God after the Manner of Men.] G. F. Ans. [The Scripture speaketh of God after the Manner of the Spirit,p. 116. and to the Spirit, whereby Men may receive him, and know him by the Spirit; which Natural Man cannot.] R. W. replyeth, and beginneth with Railing Language (as he useth to do) and saith; Here he denyeth the Heavenly Mystery of God re∣vealing himself to us after the Manner of Men, having Head, Eyes and Mouth, &c. Answ. His Heavenly Mysteries God Revealeth by his Spirit, doth he not? doth not the Apostle say, The Mysteries and Things of God are Revealed by the Spirit? and R. W. can the Things and Heavenly Mysteries of God be Revealed, but by his Spirit to Men? And if God be likened to a Husband-man, a Shield, a Rock; &c. he is not these Outwardly: for when God Revealed himself to A∣braham, and them he spoke those things to, he Revealed them to them by his Spirit, by which they understood them; and by the same Spirit he Revealeth them now. R. W. Thou tell'st us of a Late Speech of one of the best Philo∣sophers, and of the best Christians, that Old or New-England ever had, (viz.) Then shall we know, (to wit, in the Next Life, in Hea∣ven, in the Heavenly State to come) how to answer that Great Question, What is God? but this Poor Wild-Asses-Colt G. F. he can resolve that Question &c. and so goest on Scoffing. Answ The Apostle saith, He that cometh to God, must believe,
that he is, and that he is a Rewarder of them that diligently seek him (Hebr. 11.): and did not the Saints know, what God is, while they were upon Earth? and must this be laugh'd at by you Philo∣losophers? and is this the best Christian both of Old and New-England, that saith, We must know, what God is, in the heavenly State to come? and what, not in this Life? then how will they know him to be a Rewarder of them, that diligently seek him, if they do not know, what God is, in this Life? how can they know, how to Worship God in Spirit and in Truth, if they do not know him to be the Spirit, in this Life? and what must we Infer from R. W's. Words, his best Philosophers, and best Christians? That we must not know, what God is, in this Life? Then you may know, what the Devil is, and not, what God is, in this Life, and the Great Reason and Abilities he hath, as R. W. saith, And do not the Scriptures say, God will dwell in the Saints, and walk in them? (see Corinth.) and they were to glorify God in their Spirits and in their Bodies, which were God's? And is not he called a God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob? and God said unto him, Walk thou before me, and be thou perfect; for I am God Almighty, and All-sufficient: and did not he know, what God is? and did not all the Saints know, what God is? that gave forth Scripture, while they were upon Earth? And did not John say, We are of God, (1 Joh. 4)? and did not he know him, what he is? and John said, God dwelled in him, and he in God (Joh. 4, 15, 16.) and who∣soever confesseth the Son of God, hath God, and he that dwelleth in Love, dwelleth in God, and God in him, (1 Joh. 4.) And G. F. doth know, That God is, and is the Rewarder of them, that diligently seek him: blessed be his Name for ever! And did not the Apostles and Prophets know this, while they were upon the Earth, before the Next Life and Heavenly State to come? else how could they de∣clare it, if they did not know it, That God is; and is the Rewar∣der of all, that diligently seek him, whil'st they were upon Earth? But R. W. thou art out of this Diligence, and in an Evil Work against God's People, that are diligently seeking him, that know, That God is, &c. R. W. Thou speak'st of the Devil blowing out the Candle, and Torch and Sun of the holy Books and Records, &c. and then thou say'st; Is it not the Devil's Trade, to play the suttle Hunter (as do also his Journey-men,p. 117. who ly in wait to Catch men) and to trim his Pits and Gins, and Snares with
Green Leaves, &c. viz. Fair Pretences of the Spirit, Immediate Spirit, Infallible Spirit, Teachings of the Spirit, the Manner of the Spirit, Speaking to the Spirit, and Christ within you, the Hope of Glory &c. and these are fair Leaves (thou say'st,) and sweet and heavenly green Boughs, on which the Old Serpent twineth, and from whence he uttereth even Scripture it self, and the names of God and Christ, and Spirit in a Frantick Purpose to Stab the holy Scriptures, and God and Christ and Spirit also. Answ. R. W. Thou must apply this at home, and the New-England Priests and Professors. Can the Devil blow out the Torch and Sun of the holy Books and Records? what is this Sun, thou hast not manifest it; if he could, he would have blown it out afore now: but the Sun of Righteousness, or Substance of the Holy Records is too hot for him to blow out; for Christ will destroy and consume him with the breath of his Mouth, and the Brightness of his Coming. And the Devil and Antichrist may get the Form of Godliness, and the Sheeps-cloathing, and so from that to talk of Christ without; but neither the Devil, nor thou, nor Antichrist can endure to hear the Talk of the Spirit within, Christ within, and of his Infallible Spirit, and the Teaching of the Spirit, and the Manner of the Spirit's speaking to the Churches, and Christ in you, the Hope of Glory▪ was not this the Doctrine, the Apostles preached, He that hath an Ear, let him hear, what the Spirit saith to the Churches? and the Apostle was Mi∣nister of the Spirit. And what! dost thou Blasphemously call this Doctrine of the Apostles, a Trimming of the Devil and his Jour∣ney-men, its Gins and Snares? and the Serpent's Twining with these fair Leaves, green Boughs? And so, dost thou call the Apostle's Doctrine a Frentick purpose to stab the holy Scriptures, and God, and Christ and Spirit also? and is not this Blasphemy in thee? can the Devil catch God and Christ, and his Spirit, and stab them? what! is the Devil here greater, then God, Christ and his Spirit? O R. W. the Envy hath blinded thee! I must tell thee, Christ destroyeth the Devil and his Works: the Devil can not stab Christ, nor God, nor his Spirit; but he will cast him alive in the Lake of Fire: and the Lord will judge thee for thy Wicked Words here. And for all thy Wicked Words and Blasphemies we cannot deny, but must own the Apostle's Doctrine of the Spirit's Teaching Really, without any pretence; and so G. F. meaneth, as he speaketh) and how the Ministers of the Spirit sow to the Spirit; and, Know ye not, that Christ is in you, Except ye be Reprobates: and Christ is in the
Saints the Hope of Glory; whom the Apostle preached, that he might rule the peoples hearts by Faith: who doth rule now. And all thy Railing Words are little to us: We know, that the Devil doth rage against Christ dwelling in his Saints, and may per∣secute him in his▪ Members; but he is risen far above the Devil at the Right Hand of God: and so, he is too high for the Devil and his Journey-men to stab him, as thou Wickedly say'st. And we charge R. W. and all his New-England Priests, to shew us, where it is written in Scriptures, that the living God and his Son can be stab'd? and to prove these Horrid Blasphemies, which we deny. R. W. And thou say'st, G. F. knows that we do affirm, that no Reading or Hearing, no Meditation, no Afflictions, &c. can do a Soul any good, until God by the Power or Finger of his own self, or Spirit make the means Powerful and Effectual. Answ. And R. W. dost not thou say (pag. 88.) that the Scrip∣ture was the Sword, and the Only Sword? and what R. W! Rea∣ding, Meditating, Hearing will do the soul No Good, until God by his Power and Finger, and Spirit make the means Powerful and Effectual? and what a Contradiction is this, R. W.? for pag. 88. thou say'st, The Scriptures are the Only Sword, by which Wicked men may kill and do hurt withal: and now here, It is of no Value without the Spirit? and yet, The Scriptures are the Ground and Author of Christ's and the Saints Faith? and now thou hast overthrown thy own Assertions in thy Book withal. Then R. W. thou grantest the Immediate Means of this Power and Spirit of God, which thou hast been Fighting and Opposing all this while against us. R. W. And thou tellest us of a Story or Proverb of a Sow Teaching the Goddess of Wisdom.p. 118. Answ. And this thou applyest to us; but thou must apply it at home, with all thy Mystical Filthiness, thou speakest of: and we can declare the Wisdom, which we have received from Christ and God our Teacher, and tell thee, The Fear of God is the Begin∣ning of it. R. W. And thou runnest over and over about the Immediate Teaching of the Spirit of God within, and art quarreling with the Immediate Spirit of God to G. F.'s Answer to T. H. And thou say'st again R. W. Their Spirit will tell us, That God and Christ &c. New Covenant, and Faith, and Holiness, &c. are all in Prison in eve∣ry Man.
Answ. How often hast thou spoken this over and over in thy Book! which are thy own Forged Lies, aud not my Words: as the Reader may see in my Books, there is no such thing in my Book or Writings; for they are Words I never heard afore. For Christ is ascended far above all the Heavens, and sitteth at the Right Hand of God: you cannot Imprison him, or his Father; though his Light ye may hate, and his Spirit ye may grieve and quench: but as I said before, it will Judge and Condemn you. And we do confess, The Spirit of Truth will lead us into all Truth, and to God and Christ, from which it cometh: though thou Scof∣fingly say'st, Round, in a Conjuring Circle; That Christ brings to Christ, &c. which yet thou confessest To be True: What! hast thou brought thy self into the Conjuring Circle? howbeit the Light, that cometh from Christ, doth give us the Knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Christ Jesus: and this is Scripture, the Apostles Doctrine. R. W. saith; The Lord boasts of his Servant Job to the Devil, to be a Perfect Man (as the Quakers urge, Job 1.) but God School'd him for his Pride and Impatience, &c. by Elihu and his own Voice: and Job Confessed his Pride and Ignorance, and ab∣horred himself, and professed, he would prate no more; and abhor∣red himself as in Dust and Ashes. And G. F. in his Book abhors the Term of Dust and Ashes, &c. with a many more Railing Words. Answ. That is False; for G. F. no where in his Book abhorreth Dust and Ashes, as the Reader may see. And R. W. what an Ill Garb hast thou put God's Words in here? I charge thee and the New-England-Priests. That God and Elihu did School Job, or that God boasted: let us see Scripture for this. Doth Job mention the Word PRATING? thou canst not speak Scripture-Language, who art out of the Fear of God and Reverence of his Words: for if thou did'st, thou wouldst not Add so to them, and speak that, which they do not speak, to corrupt Peoples Minds. For the Lord saith, That there is none like Job in all the Earth; and Vpright and a Perfect Man, one that feareth God, and escheweth E∣vil (Job. 2.): and it is said, In all this Job did not sin with his Lips; in all this Job did not charge God foolishly in his Sufferings, (Job 1, 22.2, 0.) But thou say'st, God and Elihu School'd him for him Pride: but thou hast not shewed us Chapter and Verse for it; so they be thy own Words: Job saith no such thing of
God, That he School'd him for his Pride and Impatience; though Job did Humble himself: and what he said, we own; and God to him. R. W. Thou say'st; If it please God to shew him (to wit, G. F.) and me truly, what Sin is, and what Justice is, and what an Infi∣nite Price must pay for the least Evil Thought, &c. if it please God by any of these Means he useth,p. 119. to imprint these and other such Heavenly Considerations upon our Souls! we shall then for all our Pretences cry out with Peter, De∣part from me, for I am a Sinful Man — and with Job; — in Dust and Ashes. But I fear, G. F. is so taken up with with his Sitting with Christ in Heavenly Places, with Immediate Dictates of his supposed Holy Spirit, that God's Speaking thus to Poor Worms after the way of Men, and by these Outward Means stinks in his Nostrils; which if so, and so Irrecoverably, I desire, and de∣sire all that love God and their own Salvations, to flee from him, as from Korah's Pride and his Plagues: for his Vial is pouring on him in Spiritual Judgments, and shall be pouring out on him in Spiri∣tual and Corporal Torments to all Eternity. Answ. How now R. W! Is R. W. got up in the Seat of God, like Muggleton? turn'd a Reeve and Muggletonian? doth not Christ tell thee, Thou must not Judge, lest thou be Judged? and, Thou must Pluck the Beam out of thy Own Eye, before thou pluck'st it out of thy Brothers? And hast thou forgot thy self, that thou werest Praying to God for G. F. thy self a few Lines afore, for To let thee and him see, what Sin is, and what Justice is, and what Infinite Price must pay for the least Evil Thought? and then pre∣sently after thou say'st, The Vial is pouring out on him in Spiritual Judgments, and shall be on him in Spiritual and Corporal Tor∣ments to all Eternity! How canst thou say, It shall be, and is; and yet art to be shewed to thee, What Sin is? and the Price to pay for the Evil Thought? what Confusion is this? And is not this thy Doting in Darkness with a Reven ful, Malicious Spirit, that can'st pass Sentence upon another, who dost not yet truly know, what Sin is, nor the Price? how shouldst thou, when thou hatest the Light of Christ, who dyed for Sin, and hath bought us with a Price? I know the Price; and am to Glorify God with Soul, Bo∣dy and Spirit, which are his. It seemeth, thou dost not truly know, what Sin is; nor God's Justice, nor Infinite Price paid for Evil Thoughts and Natural Disposition on the Old Score (to wit, of Sins);
and those Gratious Means of Christ Jesus are not yet imprinted in thy Heart by the Light of Christ and his Spirit: and thou hast not cryed out with Peter, for thou hast not that Heavenly Con∣sideration upon thy Soul, as he had, being out of his Light and Spirit. And how shouldst thou? since thou dost not truly see, what Sin is, nor the Price? thou hast not felt the Blood of Christ to Sprinkle the Conscience, as we and the Saints have done; nor the Light of Christ, to shew thee thy Sin, and Christ, from which it cometh, to save thee from thy Sin. Neither hast thou seen Job's Condition, Once have I spoken, yea Twice — and abhorred himself, &c. and if thou hadst, thou wouldst never have uttered so many Lies and Slanders, and False Judgments upon me and God's Peo∣ple; which toucheth us not. And as for thy Spiritual Judgments, Plagues and Vial, and Spiritual and Corporal Torments to all Eter∣nity, it is Absolutely turned UPON THY OWN HEAD. This Sentence thou canst not Cast upon me, for it is from a Presump∣tuous, Envious and Malicious Spirit in thee: for, how should'st thou pass such a Sentence, when thou dost not know truly, what Sin is, nor the Price, &c. on the Old Score, and hast No Voice nor Motion in thy Heart to listen to, of Heavenly Things? And therefore R. W, All will come upon thy self, and what Measure thou measurest to me, or another, it will come to thee again, and will press down and run over; thou wilt have it, Poor Man! and it toucheth not me. And as for Korah's Pride, thou may'st look at home: and if thou had'st minded Job's Words, Once I have spoken, and Speak no more, &c. thou had'st never given forth this Lying, Slanderous Book against me and God's People. And God speaking to Poor Worms after the Way of Men &c. by his Spirit, Men by his Spirit understand, hear and obey him: So, All the Means and Ways of God I do esteem, and they do not Stink in my Nostrils, as thou scornfully and scoffingly speakest; and against the Immediate Dictates of the Spirit, which thou callest, Supposed Holy Spirit, which Word SUPPOSED, we deny: for we own the Holy Ghost Really, and have the Comfort of the Holy Ghost, and Fellowship. And thou Scoffingly say'st; I fear, G. F. is so taken up with his Sitting with Christ in Heavenly Places, with Immediate Dictates of his Supposed Holy Spirit, I fear his Case —. And thou, that Sittest not in the Heavenly Places in Christ Jesus, where dost thou Sit R. W. and ye New-England-Priests and Professors? where do
ye bring People to Sit? in Sin and Death, and Old Adam? The Apostle saith; Even We, when we were Dead in Sins, hath He quickned us together with Christ, (by Grace ye are saved) and hath Raised us up together, and made us Sit together in the Heavenly Places in Christ Jesus: that in the Ages to Come he might shew the Exceeding Riches of his Grace in his Kindness towards us through Jesus Christ (Ephes. 2.) — And now R. W. THESE A∣GES ARE COME; and God hath quickned his People, which was Dead in Sins and Trespasses: and hath Raised us up together, and made us Sit together in Heavenly Places in Christ Jesus. So these Exceeding Riches and Kindness is manifest to us in these A∣ges through Jesus Christ, that was Manifest to the Apostles, GLO∣RY TO GOD FOR EVER! And thou, that Sittest not here in this Heavenly Place in Christ Jesus, art yet Dead in thy Sins, Vn-quickned: and read thy Sitting, thy Life and Conversation, Ephes. 2, 2, 3. And neither R. W. nor ye New-England-Priests can Pluck us out of the Heavenly Places in Christ Jesus, where God hath Raised us up by his Spirit above your Sin and Death; where thou and the New-England-Priests Sit, and Rail, and Scoff and Persecute them, that Sit in the Heavenly Places in Christ Jesus, the AMEN, who is the First and the Last, GLORY TO GOD FOR EVER MORE through Jesus Christ! G. F. I. B. The 5th. Month, 1677.
POST-SCRIPT. ANd R. W. thou and the People know'st, that thou brought'st G. F.'s Fol. 56. at the Dispute at Newport, to prove, That G. F. said, ["The Blood of Christ was Corruptible, and that it was, like the Blood of another Man:] and from thence thou didst endeavour to prove, That our Christ was not the True Christ, and G. F. a Blasphemer. But when the Place was read in G. F.'s Book, it was found to be the Priest's Sayings, and not G. F.'s, to wit, That the Blood of Christ was Corruptible, and so, like the Blood of another Man: (for G. F.'s Answer to the Priest is; That the Blood of Christ, which cleanseth from all Sin, is Incor∣ruptible; as the Reader may read Fol. 56.) And so R. W. see∣ing, it were the Priest's Words, and not G. F.'s, which he brought to Condemn G. F. and us with-al in the Face of the Country, and to prove, That our Christ was not the True Christ; he see∣ing, that it was prov'd to be the Priest's Words, out of G. F.'s Book, and not G. F.'s, he turn'd about to maintain the Priest's Words, to wit, That Christ's Blood was Corruptible, and asserted, as followeth. (Which was taken then in Characters; and we do not question, but that the Sober-minded, Vnprejudiced People then there, may remember the Words) viz. 1. R. W. said; I affirm, That the Blood of Christ, that he Shed, was Material, as another Man's, and was Corruptible. 2. R. W. said; I say, That the Blood From hence he might as well Ar∣gue, That the Flesh of Christ being Ma∣terial, was therefore Corruptible; which is contrary to the A∣postle's Doctrine, (Act. 2, 31.) Nei∣ther did his Flesh see Corruption. of Christ was Corruptible and Corrupted, (with many other Vnsavoury Words.) John Stubs answered: [Take heed Roger, what thou say'st. We do not deny, but Blood came out of his Side; but yet we say, That the Blood of Christ is Incorruptible: and we say, That we were never Able to pay or satisfy God; yet Christ leadeth his People by his Spirit, and reconcileth them to his Father, &c.] — And we dare not for all the World to Assert that, which R. W. hath Affirmed here; to wit, That the Blood of Christ is Corruptible, and did Corrupt: for we know, that we are Redeemed not with Corruptible Things, &c. but with the Pretious
Yet in another place in his Book R. W. doth af∣firm, That he is Redeemed by the Blood of God (which Blood he saith, is Corrup∣tible) Blood of Christ, as of a Lamb without Blemish and Spot (1 Pet. 1, 18, 19.) 3. R. W. affirmed, That Salvation was by a Man, that was Corruptible; I do not say, Cor∣rupted. So far R. W. J. B. Answered and said to this purpose: I desire not to grate upon the Antient Man; but am sorry, that he should so over shoot him∣self, as he hath done, so far to deny Christ, and undervalue his Appearance both Inward and Out∣ward, as to say, That Christ within was but a Fancy, and a false Christ (as he then affirmed) and, That Christ without was Corruptible, (contrary to the Apostle, who said; His Flesh saw no Corruption.) And also of his Appearance without: Who then also said, That his Blood was Corruptible and Corrupted: as I believe, many of the people, that was there, may yet remember. I shewed then, how that he had brought upon himself that Charge, and proved himself Guilty of that, for which he endeavoured to Condemn us. And I spoke at that time of our Owning of the true Lord Jesus Christ in his Appearing in that Body, and of his Suffering and Resurrection, according to the Scriptures: And also of his Spi∣ritual Appearing in his Saints after his Ascension, according to the Promise of Christ and the Testimony of his Apostles: as I then brought many Testimonies out of Scriptures, to maintain and prove the same. And so signified fully to the people of our true Owning of Christ; and there bore Testimony against his dangerous Words, that he had then uttered before them in speaking (contrary to what is written) of Christ's being Corrup∣tible, and his Blood: and was (as I then signified) truly sorry, that he should so sin against God and Christ, and wrong his own Soul. (1.) And now, how could W. E. do any otherwise, but Charge R. W with Blasphemy against Christ, his Body and Blood? For he affirmes, that the Light of Christ is an Idol, a Fancy, a Fran∣tick Light; and Christ within, an Imaginary Christ: as ye may see in many places of his Book. (2) He affirmes, That Salvation was by a Man, that was Cor∣ruptible, and that this Blood was Corruptible and Corrup∣ted. Now we do Charge R. W. and all the New-England Priests,
(together with those Baptists, that took his part against us at Rode-Island and Providence at the Dispute) to make those his As∣sertions good by Scripture, if they can (which we do affirm, are Blasphemies) and show us Chapter and Verse, which he saith, is the Rule and Touchstone; and so, let his Horrible Blasphemies be Touched and Tried with Scripture. For David saith, (Psal. 16.) My Heart is glad, and my Glory rejoiceth; my Flesh also rests in Hope: for thou wilt not leave my Soul in Hell; neither wilt thou suffer thy HOLY ONE to see Corruption. And again the Apostle saith (who spoke of the Resurrection of Christ) That his Soul was not left in Hell; neither [Mark] his FLESH did see Corruption, (Act. 2, 27, 31.) And (Act. 13, 34.) Thou shalt not suffer thy Holy One to see Corruption. David saw Corruption; but he, whom God raised again (to wit, Christ) saw [Mark] NO CORRVPTION. Now, if R. W. and the New-England-Priests be Redeemed by a Corruptible Man, and a Corruptible Blood, that did Corrupt, this is contrary to what the Apostle saith, His Flesh saw no Corruption: and, They were not Redeemed with Corruptible things, but with the Pretious Blood of Christ. So, it is clearly proved, that Christ his Flesh and Blood is not Corruptible, but Incorruptible: And therefore R. W.'s Corruptible Man (and Corruptible Blood, that did Corrupt (by which he pre∣tends, he is Saved) is a false Christ, and not the Christ the A∣postles preached, the true Lord Jesus; whose Flesh and Blood did not Corrupt. And if the Flesh and Blood of Christ as (R. W. affirm∣eth) be Corruptible; then how is he in Heaven with Corruptible Flesh and Blood, when the Apostle saith, Corruption doth not inherit In∣corruption? (1 Cor. 15, 50.) Christ sanctifieth the people with his own Blood, (Heb. 13:) and (1 Pet. 1, 2.) the Saints were sprinkled with the Blood of Jesus: and (1 Joh. 1.) that Blood of Jesus Christ cleanseth from all Sins: and (Revel. 1.) He hath washt us from our Sins: and, Christ hath Redeemed us to God by his Blood (Rev. 5, 9:) and the Saints Gar∣ments were made white in the Blood of the Lamb (Rev. 7:) and the Saints Overcame by the Blood of the Lamb, (Rev. 12, 11:) and Christ saith, Who eateth my Flesh, and drinketh my Blood, &c. and My Blood is Drink indeed. Now, was it Corruptible Blood, o Corruptible Flesh, that the Saints did Eat? and Cor∣ruptible blood, which cleanseth from all Sins, and made the Saints Garments White, by which they Overcame? O Horrid Darkness!
For will not corruptible stain, and not fetch out the Stain? And the Saints were to have Faith in Christ's Blood (Rom. 25:) The Saints are made Nigh to God by the Blood of Christ: the Flock of God, which Christ hath purchased with his own Blood (Act. 20, 28.) NOW, if this be the New-England Priests Principle, Profession and Judgment, that they be Redeemed by a corruptible Man, and the Blood of Christ Jesus was Corruptible and Corrupted; then they, that have tolerated R. W.'s his Blasphemous book to be prin∣ted (that held forth those Abominable things in his Dispute before a great Assembly of people at Newport in Rode-Island) how can we say otherwise, but they are lasphemers, and own not the true Lord Christ Jesus, whose Flesh saw no corruption; neither was his Blood corruptible. And therefore we do Conclude with the Apostle, that R. W. and they that held forth this Doctrine with him, are such, as have Trodden under Foot the Son of God, and counted the Blood of the New Covenant, wherewith they were sanctified, an Unholy Thing: and have done Despite unto the Spirit of Grace; and have Crucified to themselves the Son of God a-fresh, and put him to open Shame. Now see, if this Man R. W. that hath spoken those Blasphe∣mous Words against Christ Jesus, his body, and Blood, and Spirit and Light, is fit to take the Name of Christ in his Mouth? And yet this Man, he brought this Saying of the Priest to be G. F.'s to prove, That our Christ was not the true Christ: Which words proving to be the Priest's, and not G. F's. he (R. W.) stood by them, and maintained them against us. And so by his own Ar∣gument and Judgement by the same Rule and Words, that he would have disproved ours, he hath prov'd His own Christ not to be the True Christ. But should we (the People of God in Scorn called Quakers) have come, and preach'd in New-England and told you, that you were Saved by a Man, that was Cor∣ruptble, and that Christ's Blood was Corruptible and Corrupted, and that you were Washt and Cleansed by such a Blood; then ye might have said, What a Hellish Doctrine is this indeed! Which we abhor, and such Doctries, as R. W. hath preached to us in the Dispute. And our Desires are, that the Lord God of Hea∣ven may deliver all people from such Doctrines! Of all the Do∣ctrines, that ever we read, we never heard the like. And this is New-England's Orator, that so doth Flatter the King: But let the King but read his former Books, and his
Book of the Bloody Tenant (in 1652.) and there he may see, R. W. was in another Mind, when he flattered the Parliament, and justified their High Court of Justice against the Opposers. And yet he pleadeth for Liberty of Conscience, and against Per∣secution: But R. W. is fallen from that Plea, who now desireth the Magistrates to persecute us, and punish us, &c. and it must not be called Persecution neither (as in his pag. 200.) And ma∣ny things we could bring out of his former Books, which would render him very Vncertain; but we shall forbear at present, and leave him to the Lord: for his Books declare themselves, what he said then, and what he saith now. But the Reader may see, how R. W. hath invented and For∣ged many Words against us, the People of God in Scorn called Quakers, which we never spake nor wrote; so that they are none of ours, but his own. And of those his own invented, blasphemous Words he hath made an Image, and set it up; and hath proclaimed an Herault against it and us: but is fallen up∣on him self. And so the Light of Christ he calleth Fancy and a Dunghil, a Feigned, Whimsical Light, a Frantick Light and an I∣dol: and he hath affirmed, that the Man Christ is Corruptible, and his Blood is Corruptible and Corrupted. And this is like the Priest's Saying, (which R. W. hath printed in his Book p. 57.) because we say, Christ is in his People) viz. Can any Man Con∣tain Christ a Man of four Foot long? Might not the Bad and Ignorant people (like him) have said so to Paul, when he told them, Know ye not, that Christ is in you, except ye be Reprobates? So thou art Ignorant of Christ and his Spirit, how he dwelleth in his people; and art far degenerated from the Apostle's Doctrine, else R. W. would never have brought this against us, as to say; We did not own the true Lord Jesus, because that a Man cannot contain a Man of four Foot long in him, therefore Christ doth not dwell in the Hearts of his Saints by Faith. But this is a gross Ignorance and Error from the Apostle's Doctrine: For we never asserted, That a Man should contain a Man of four Foot long; this is the Priest's Doctrine, and not ours, who are the People of God. And have not the New-England-Men, Priests and Professors Burn'd Scriptures (yea, many very good Scriptures) when they Burn'd our Books, which were full of Scriptures? and how could
they Burn them without Burning Scriptures? Yet we cannot but believe, (we have so much Charity) that all the people, nay, all the Professors in New-England, are not of the same wicked Judgment with R. W. and the rest of the New-England-priests and professors, whose Hands have been deep in the BLOOD of our Brethren. So our Design is, all that are Simple and Ten∣der-Hearted, and have a Love to the true Lord Jesus Christ, (whose Flesh saw no Corruption, and doth Redeem with his Pre∣tious Blood, and not with Corruptible things) that they may Re∣pent, and turn to the Lord Jesus Christ, who saith, Learn of me: who is the Way, the Truth and the Life; and No Man cometh to the Father, but by him. And God saith, This is my Well-Be∣loved Son, Hear ye him: And so we say; Hear him by his Light, Grace and Truth, and do not hate his Light, nor turn his Grace into Wantonness, nor quench his Spirit; least the Light be your Condemnation. For we declare unto you; God will pour out his Fury upon all the Families upon Earth, that call not upon his Name. And God saith; In the last Days, (which are the Days of his New Covenant) he will pour out of his Spirit upon all Flesh: That so with his Spirit they may call upon his Name, from whom they have both Help and Strength through Jesus Christ; who is the Beginning and Ending, the First and the Last, who is mani∣fest in his People by his Light, Grace, Power and Spirit, through whom they can Sing HALLELVIAH, and PRAISE THE LORD! And — R. W. saith (Append. p. 76.) I observe, the Instrumental and Purchasing Cause or Price is said to be his Blood, which argues the Infinite Value of his Sufferings; in which Respect only it is called the Blood of God. I know the Light Esteem, that some of these Foxians have of the Blood of the Lord Jesus, saying, That wicked Men, the Soldiers shed it; that it was spilt upon the Ground: and there was no difference between that Blood, and the Blood of another Saint. Answ. R. W. We desire thee to observe (if it be us, whom thou meanest in thy scornful Word Foxians) how thou chargest upon us a Light Esteem of the Blood of the Lord Jesus, in say∣iny, That wicked Men shed it; and that it was spilt upon the Ground:
and that there was no difference between that Blood, and the Blood of another Saint. Which Charge we do believe is false, like the rest of thy Charges; and the Matter we do disown from ever entering into our Thoughts to think, much less to speak of his Pretious Blood (by which we have been Redeemed) That there was no difference between that Blood, and the Blood of ano∣ther Saint: For none are Saints, but such as are Redeemed by it, and have Faith in it, and therefore is above the Blood of all Saints. But Roger, recollect thy Thoughts, and call to mind thy own Sayings at Newport (if thy Memory be so good, as thou in thy Book seemest to hold forth, in writing things from thy Memory; for thou say'st, None writ for thee.) And when thou hast re∣viewed thy lines (in page 76. of the Append.) and called thy Words at Newport into Remembrance; and then see, if this saying be not fulfilled upon thee, The Wise are taken in their own Craft. In thy Book thou say'st, It is called the Blood of God; though at Newport thou said'st, It was Material Blood, as ano∣ther Man's, and was Corruptible and Corrupted: and further said'st, Thou did'st not know, but that the Fowls, or some other Creatures might eat it up. — How now, Roger! Art not thou now fallen into the Pit, thou digged'st for others? As thou did'st at Newport, when thou charged'st the like thing upon G. F. and thought'st thereby to prove our Christ not to be the true Christ; which upon Trial did prove to be the Sayings of the Priest: And when thou found'st it to be his Sayings, and G. F.'s to the Contrary; than that which thou had'st Condemned in G. F. (and for which thou did'st condemn us, and the true Lord Jesus Christ, in whom we be∣lieve) thou Justified'st in him, and then asserted'st further, as is before signified. What Credit is to be given to such an one, that will Condemn a thing, because such a Man or people holds it; and again will Justify the very same thing, because an other in Opposition holds it? Is not this the Case in this very Point, as it is in very ma∣ny things in thy Book? As may be seen by all that read it, how thou Judgest, Condemnest and Opposest the very Doctrine of Christ and his Apostles, because held forth by us; wherein thou shewest rather Malice, than so good as a blind Zeal.
And further we may tell thee, That thy Memory hath either greatly failed thee, or thy Malice hath transported thee far be∣yond the Government of it in thy Narrative, in not Dealing faithfully in thy Relation: For which (with many others of thy false Charges, the Lord will Judge thee! For in this one par∣ticular thou may'st see, how thou hast condemned thy self in the thing thou hast allowed: And so in Judging another Condemnest thy self, being guilty of the same, for which thou hast condemned others, which were Clear Men.

See, what blasphe∣mous Stuff this Person hath brought forth! which he most-unjustly Inves upon the Quakers; when 'tis not at all deducible from any of their Opinions or Principles. We can challenge him here∣in for a forbid, blasphemous Perverter; which would the more easily appear, if he durst shew those Principles of the Quakers, from which he thus Inverts and Inferrs up∣on them those blasphemous Inferences for adhearing to the Apostle's Doctrine, viz: The Saints are the Temple of God; and God dwells in them: and, Christ in them, &c.Devil is ma∣nifest in their Flesh, condemn'd of the Holy Spirit of God, abhorred of the Heavenly Angels—the World shall abhor their Memory; and ex∣cept repentance, they shall descend with all the Enemies of the true Lord Jesus into the Lake, that burns with unquenchable Fire and Brimstone— A Face for the Devil, for Anti-Christ: Hellish bewitching and Impudence, p. 62.

If it please God to shew me and him, what sin is, and the prize to pay for the least evil Thought on the Old Score, R. W.'s Prayer for himself and G. F. &c. and then he saith; For his Vial is pouring on him in Spiritual Iudgments,Muggleton's Curse. and shall be pouring on him in Spiritual and Corporal Torments to all Eternity. AND let the Gentle Reader see, how that above 12 times he mentioned NAKED over & over; & how often over & over he mentioneth SAMVEL'S MANTLE: and above 110. times he scornfully saith FOXIANS, that he might fill up his Book with such scornful Expressions and Vngratious Language. And there are not many pages, where he doth not call us one bad Name or the other; or compareth us with Papists or some o∣thers to make us Ridiculous: Such Vngratious Language and Unwholesom Words we have never met with in any one's Writ∣ings, for a Volumn to be so stuft with such Abundance before, as may be seen, by what is here before written. And pag. 85. and p. 117. of his Book the Reader may Observe, how he judgeth and condemneth us to be as Far from the Ministers of Christ, as Lambs and Doves are from Ravenous, Popish and Devilish Li∣ons ond Eagles: and likewise he judgeth from (as he saith) the Irrationality and Vnruliness of our Spirit, and saith, It is ap∣parent from our bitter and frantick Revilings, &c. and so com∣pareth us to the Devilish Inquisitors, Monks and Friars, &c. Now if these be certainly Fruits of a Wrong Spirit, to wit, Bitter and Frantick Revilings, Vnruliness, Irrationality, Unwhole∣som and Ungratious Words (as they are) and do manifest a Man to be Contrary to Christ's Messengers, as far as Doves and Lambs do differ from Lions and Eagles; Then hath he largely manifested himself not to be one of Christ's Messengers, but the Contrary: as all Sober Readers may see by his Language given in his Book upon us.
[R. W.'s Temporizing Spirit made manifest] AND the Reader may see, how R. W. flattereth the King in his Epistle to him, and saith; Charles the Great was one of the Greatest Princes of that Name in the World, and Charles the Fifth (both Emperours) had his Wonderful Trick at Helm also; but both (and all) turn into the Cabbin of Rotten∣ness: Charles the Fifth in his 58. Year; Charles the Great in his 72. Year. But were every drop of Water between your Old England and New a Million of Years, yet Mors ultima linea (Death the last Line) and it is but Momentum, unde pendet Ae∣ternitas (a Moment, whereon dependeth Eternity,) &c. And R. W. in his Book of Experiments in the Epistle to Lady Vane 1652. saith; How hath he Crowned the Memory of those his Second Zea∣lous Servants in King Henry the Seventh his Days with a most Emi∣nent, Blessed Succession of such Names and Spirits at this Day, Crom∣wel and Lambert, &c. Is not here R. W.'s. Flattery and Temporizing Spirit made manifest, let the Reader judge! And R. W. who hath now so much flattered the King in his Epistle (in his Book 1676) and would have us to be punished; but let R. W. read his Book called The Bloody Tenant, &c. (1652.) and his Epistle to the High-Court of Parliament, what he saith there of the King. R. W.'s words are, as followeth: The late King Charles his Conscience, to oppress the Consciences of others, no small Occasions of the Ruin of him and his. So Roger, read thy words in thy Book (1652.) and those in thy Epistle to the King now (in 1676.) against the Quakers. And in Bloody Tenant (p. 186.) the Reader may see, how R. W. there flattereth the Parliament, who saith as followeth: The Drawing of the Sword of Justice against such Tyrants, I be∣lieve, hath prevailed in Heaven for the Parliament's Succes and Pro∣sperity, &c. and a great deal more to the same Effect in this page. And R. W. in his Letter to Governour Indicot saith: Had it not pleased the God of Heaven, who bound the Insolent Rage of the Furious Ocean, to raise up a Second Cromwel, like a Mighty or Merciful Wall or Bull-wark, to stay the Fury of the Oppressor, whether English, Scottish, Popish, Presbiterian, Independent, &c.
And now here thou flatter'st Cromwel (in thy pag. 305.) and seemest to be against Persecution; yet in this Book (1676.) when thou flatterest the King, thou would'st have us persecuted. And thou say'st in thy Epistle to the High-Court of Par∣liament: The Act of Civil Engagements of great Necessity, &c. SO see Roger, what a FLATTERER thou hast been of the Parliament and Oliver, and now the King: and once wast against Persecution; and now would'st have us punish'd; and yet we must not call it Persecution (as thou may'st see thy Book in 1676. p. 200.) AND so the Reader may see, how R. W. is Changed in his Book of Hireling Ministry none of Christ's, in 1652 (see his pag. 18.) where he saith: The Civil State never made a Good Woork in Spirituals. NOW, what say the Governours of N. England to R. W. in this? hath not he Judg'd you here, who have given so much Money for Printing of his Book? And doth in the 17 page tell you, How you Priests are like the Pharisees in the Vpper-most Rooms in the Synagogues and Feasts, and of their Titles and Salutations? And yet would not he have the People of God called Quakers Persecuted, because not Giving Titles, and is offended, because he hath not their Salutations? As ye may read, what R. W. saith of them, that came to his House (J. Stubs and J. Burnyeat, &c.) and did not give him a Salutation, when they were in Dispute with him. And (pag. 16. of the said Book of Hireling Ministry, &c.) doth not R. W. Cry against the Priests, How they are fitted in the Way of Prentiship, to set up the Trade and Way of Preaching, and calleth them Spiritual Merchants, a Trade of selling God himself, Christ Jesus, the Holy Spirit, Heaven and Hell too, their own Souls and the Souls of Thousands?—HOW now Roger! Wast thou of this Trade? And are the New-England-Priests of this Trade, who served Apprentiship? But if they Sold God himself, and Christ Jesus and his Holy Spirit, and Heaven and Hell, and their own Souls (and the Souls of Thousands more) Then what is left? But R. W. Who hath bought them? The Scripture speaketh of Judas selling his Master. But the N. England Magistrates may see, what the N. England Priests are, and others; and what they have bred them up to do, according to R. W.'s Doctrine (in 1652) whom now ye have given Money to print his Book. And further —
R. W. saith (p. 14. in the Margent) Universities as to the Ministry of Jesus Christ are none of his Institutions: the Title SCHOLAR appropriated to the Ministers, is a Sacrilegious and a Theevish Title robbing all Believers and Saints.— And (pag. 15. in the Margent) he saith, Universities in Order to Christ's Ministry (are) but Refined Monasteries. And, Batchelours of Di∣vinity (or Godliness) and Doctor of Divinity (are) so Clearly and Expresly Opposite to the Command of Christ Jesus, and (in the Mar∣gent) Pharisaical and Popish Titles. NOW, what think ye now, ye Magistrates of N. England and ye Priests, of R. W.'s Doctrine here? Hath not he paid you off? And is not he Changed from what he was? And — R. W. saith (in his 13. page,) We have Indians at home, In∣dians in Wales, Indians in Ireland, and the Body of the Protestant Nations is yet Vnconverted, as to the Point of True Conversion and Regeneration by God's Spirit—And further R. W. saith; Who can deny, but that the Body of this and all Other Protestant Nations (as well as Popish) are Vnconverted? SO here R. W, Judgeth all, but himself: But let him see in his Book against G. F. in 1676. how be Extolleth the N. England Protestants (so called) since they have DRVNK the BLOOD of the Righteous, God's People called Qua∣kers? And— R. W. saith in his Book of Hireling Ministers, &c. (pag. 8.) Jesus Christ never made Bargains with his Messengers or Pastors. And R. W. saith: He that maketh a Trade of Preaching, No longer Pay, No longer Pray; no longer Preach, no longer Fast, &c. [Then ye have PAY.] Further he telleth you, That if ye are brought up to that only Trade, ye must make your Lively-hood of it (p. 9.)—And further thou sayst: The Hireling will not (indeed he cannot, hav∣ing no other way to live) move his Lip or Tongue.—And R. W. further telleth the Protestants of Tithes and Stipends, Wages and Salaries, and of your Removing from Lean into Fatter Benefices: —And hath not here R. W. spoken as much against Bax∣ter, Owen and his N. England-Priests, as he hath done against the Quakers? And ye Magistrates & Priests of N. England, doth not R. W. tell you, (pag. 3. in his Book of Hireling Ministry, 1652.) The Ci∣vil State cannot Restrain nor Constrain into Spirituals?—Then why have ye Magistrates and Priests persecuted, WHIPT, imprison'd and put to DEATH the Lambs of Christ, when R. W. preacheth
this Doctrine to you, That the Civil State cannot Restrain or Con∣strain to Spirituals? And why did not the Magistrates of N. England print this Book of R. W. over again (of 1652. and his other Books that he wrote in 1652) where he flattereth the Parlia∣ment? For did ye not give him Money, to help him print his Book against the people of God called Quakers (in 1676)? But ye may see some of the Heads in R. W.'s Book (in 1652.) as follow∣eth: 1. The National and Parishional Constitution of Churches is found to be the Grand Idol of the Nation. [Then may not this be applied to your Nation of New-England?] 2. The Inforcing of the Nation to such a Constitution is the grea∣test Soul-Oppression in this Nation. 3. The Hireling Ministry attending upon such Assemblies or Others, is none of the Ministry of Christ Jesus, &c. [Which the Reader may read the rest of them, and read his other books, and this Book in 1676. and see now, how he Flattereth Owen and Baxter; and Contradicteth and Confoundeth himself.] And— R. W. saith in his Fifth Head; It is the Absolute Duty of the Civil State, to set free the Souls of all Men from that so long Op∣pressing Yoke of such Ministries and Churches. But instead of this have not ye N. England States set up this Oppressing, Persecuting Mini∣stry and Church? And is not R. W. now joind with you in the Work, let your Practice speak? R. W. further saith (pag. 7.) It is one of the Grand Designs of the Most High, to break down the Hireling Ministry, that Trade, Faculty, Calling, and Living by Preaching; and that if all the Princes, States, Parliaments and Armies in the World should join their Heads, and Hearts, and Arms and Shoulders to support it, yet being a part of Babel and Confusion, it shall sink as a Mil-stone from the Angel's, Hand into the Deeps for ever! — And (page 19.) he saith: It is not the Will of the Father of Spirits, that all the Con∣sciences and Spirits of this Nation should Violently (vi & armis) be forc'd into One Way of Worship, or that any Town or Parish (so called) in England, Scotland or Ireland be disturbed in their Wor∣ship, (what Worship soever it be) by the Civil Sword. — And (page 20.) he saith: Such Priests and Ministers, as can force a Main∣tenance (of Tithes or otherwise) by the Sword, or else Cease Preaching for want of such or such a Maintenance, or can Remove from Bishop∣ricks or Benefices (as Calves and Bulls of Bashan) for fatter and
ranker Pastures; or wanting Spiritual Work and Maintenance, are too fine to Work with their Hands, as the first Patterns, Christ's first Ministers did, how can they say, as Peter to Christ Jesus, LORD, thou Knowest all things, thou knowest, I Love thee? &c. — And in his Epistle Dedicatory he saith: If I give flattering Titles unto Men, my Maker (said Elihu) would quickly take me away. Yet R. W. would have us Persecuted, because we cannot give Flattering Titles (as may be seen in his Book of 1676.) NOW Roger Williams may see, how he now flattereth Baxter and Owen, and the New England-Priests and Professors, and how he Contradicteth himself in his own Testimony in his Book in 1652. as before. TWO LETTERS, one of William Coddington of Rode-Island and the other of Richard Scot of Providence in New-England testifying against R. Williams aforesaid and his Slanderous and Wicked Book. [Part of W. C's Letter Concerning R. W.] HERE is a lying, scandalous Book of Roger Williams of Pro∣vidence, Printed at Cambridge in New-England: John Burnyeat was at the Dispute with W. Edmundson, and John Barker with Roger Williams; however here are yet many Witnesses living, that can Witness with us (even all unbyassed Spirits) that he had made 14. Proposals to be Disputed 7. at Newport on this Isle, and 7. at Providence. His Inveterate Malice was so great against the Truth, that he would have put us in a Lion's Skin, and set Dog's to wor∣ry us; but the Lord Reproved his Madness: That though there were many, that did bear Evil Will to Zion, the City of the Living God, and said in their Hearts, RACE it Race it to the Ground; Yet was there not one found, that would own his Propositions. Bles∣sed be God, we are known in the Nations to be a People of another Spirit: though William Edmundson and the rest did in and by the Pow∣er of the Lord Answer all his 7. Proposals in about two Hours; I Rea∣ding
of them at Newport and John Cranston (that was Deputy Governour then and is so now) was desired to moderate the Assem∣bly, that he might say, what he had to say. He began with a Thun∣der, and had Three Days time to bewilder and befool himself, and so ended in a great Eclips of the Sun (which was taken notice of.) I have known him about 50. Years a meer Weather-Cock, Constant only in Vnconstancy; Poor Man! that doth not know, what should become of his Soul, If this Night it should be taken from him. He was for the Priests, and took up their Principles to fight against the Truth, and to gratify them and ad Magistrates, that licked up his Vomit, and wrote the said Scurrilous Book: and so hath transgres∣sed for a Piece of Bread. And so are all Ioined with the Red Dra∣gon to pour out their Flood against the Man-Child: Into their Secrets let not my Soul come; my Honor, be not thou Vnited! Dear G. F. I may yet more prove, what I have said. One while he is a Separatist at New-Plymouth in New-England, Ioining with them, till they are weary of him (as from Morton's Memorials in Print doth appear:) Another time you may have him a Teacher or Mem∣ber of the Church at Salem in New-England: O! Then a great deal of Devotion is placed in Women wearing of Vails in their Assem∣blies, as if the Power of Godliness was in it; and to have the Cross out of the Colors: and then be against the King's Patent and Au∣thority; and writteth a large Book in Quarto against it. And ano∣ther time he is Hired for Money, and gets a Patent from the Long Parliament; so that it is not long, but he is off and on it again: One time for Mens wearing Caps, and not Hats for Covering their Faces; and again Hats, and no Caps: One time for Water-Bap∣tism, Men and Women must be plunged into the Water; and then throw it all down again: So that Cotton (who in his day did know the Power of God to Salvation) said of him, That he was a Ha∣berdasher of small Questions against the Power. So they ought to have feared God and the King, that is, To punish Evil-doers; and therefore not to meddle to their hurt with him, that is given to Change: In a Letter to Walter Clark he doth bewail and detract, that he hath Cut himself off from us. And for John Leverat Go∣vernour of the Massachusets to say, (as I am Credibly Informed) That he would give 20. Pound, rather than this Mocking, Persecuting Book should not be Printed — and the Governour of the New-Plymouth-Iurisdiction other 5. Pound: and yet to say, I am their Friend, and their Father-friend, and, they will not forsake, that
is; they will not persecute my Friend. But the Governour of Bo∣ston doth persecute, as witness their Whips and Goals. So far W. C. of Rode-Island. (28. day 4 Mon. 77.) Followeth the Letter of R. S. concerning R. W. viz: Friends, COncerning the Conversation and Carriage of this Man Roger Williams, I have been his Neighbour these 38. years: I have only been Absent in the time of the Wars with the Indians, till this present—I walked with him in the Baptists Way about 3 or 4 Months, but in that short time of his Standing I discerned, that he must have the Ordering of all their Affairs, or else there would be no Quiet Agreement amongst them. In which time he brake off from his Society, and declared at large the Ground and Reasons of it: That their Baptism could not be right, because It was not Administred by an Apostle. After that he set upon a Way of Seeking (with two or three of them, that had dissented with him) by way of Preaching and Praying; and there he continued a Year or two, till Two of the Three left him. That which took most with him, and was his Life, was, To get Honor amongst Men, especially amongst the Great Ones. For after his Society and he in a Church-Way were parted, he then went to New-England, and there he got a Charter: and coming from Bo∣ston to Providence, at Sea-conck the Neighbours of Providence met him with fourteen Cannoes, and carryed him to Providence. And the Man being hemmed in in the middle of the Cannoes, was so Elevated and Transported out of himself, that I was condemned in my self, that amongst the Rest I had been an Instrument to set him up in his Pride and Folly, And he that before could reprove my Wife, for asking her Two Sons, Why they did not pull of their Hat's to him? And told her, She might as well bid them pull off their Shoos, as their Hats (Though afterward she took him in the same Act, and turned his Reproof upon his own Head) And he, that could not put off his Cap at Prayer in his Worship, Can now put it off to every Man or Boy, that puls of his Hat to him. Though he professed Liberty of Conscience, and was so zealous for it at the first Coming home of the Charter, that nothing in Government must be Acted, till that was granted; yet he could be the Forwardest
in their Government to prosecute against those, that could not Join with him in it: as witness his Presenting of it to the Court at Newport. And when this would not take Effect, afterwards when the Com∣missioners were Two of them at Providence, being in the House of Thomas Olney, Senior of the same Town; Roger Williams pro∣pounded this Question to them: We have a People here amongst us, which will not Act in our Government with us; What Course shall we take with them? Then George Cartwright, one of the Commissioners asked him, What manner of Persons they were? Do they Live quietly and peaceably a∣mongst you? This they could not deny; Then he made them this An∣swer: If they can Govern themselves, they have no need of your Government. —At which they were silent. This was told again by a Woman of the same House (where the Speech was spoken) to another Woman, whom the Complaint with the rest was made against, who related it to me; but they are both Dead, and cannot bear Witness with me, to what was spoken there. He was too forward in spreading False Reports abroad; as wit∣ness that Letter, that he wrote to one of his Friends at London, (about the year 1660) Scandalizing W. B. with committing Adul∣tery with Horred Garner: Which when W. B.'s wife heard thereof, she wrote to her Husband about it; and he read it in the Meeting at Providence. And as soon as I had heard it read, I desired a Wo∣man Friend to go along with me to his House (who is now out of the Body:) And I asked him, Why he wrote to London, that W. B. had Committed Adultery with Horred Garner? And I told him, I verily believed, that he was as Innocent of any such Act, as a Child of a Year old. To which he Answered, He believed so too; and added this to Confirm his former Speech. That the Man, he believed, was an Honest Man. Then I replied upon him again: If thou believest, that he is an Honest Man, how comes it to pass, that thou hast wrote such a Report of him? To which he Answered: It was so Reported at Rode-Island by others; and he had writ no more, than what others had Repored. [Now let the Sober judge of this Man!]
One particular more I shall mention, which I find written in his Book (pag. 7.) concerning an Answer to John Throckmorton in this manner: To which (saith he) I will not Answer, as George Fox Answered Henry Wright's Paper with a scornful and shame∣ful Silence — I am a Witness for George Fox, that I Received his Answer to it, and delivered it into Yet R. W. has pu∣blish't this Lie.Henry Wright's own hands: So that to his former Lie he hath added another scornful and shameful Lie; And then concludes, That they were his Witnesses, that he had long said with David (and he humbly hoped, he should make it good) that he hates and abhors Lying. Providence in New-England. Richard Scot. SOME TESTIMONIES of Ancient and Mo∣dern Authors concerning the LIGHT, SCRIP∣TURES, RULE and the SOUL of Man. Testimonies concerning the LIGHT within. MVnsterus, Castalio, Vatablus, Drusius, Clarius, Codurus (up∣on Iob 24, 13, and Chap. 25, 3. They re of those, who rebel against the Light; Vpon whom doth not his Light arise?) say; That this Light is of the Divine Wisdom and Fountain of Light: Alluding to the Psalmist, : and Mat. 4, 19. The Peo∣ple that sate in Darkness, saw great Light. Also see Erasmus and Camerar. upon Ioh. 1, 4, 9. Orpheus: His Hand reacheth to the end of the Sea, his right Hand is every where (then within:) Of him alone are all things.Gentiles Testi∣monies. (Clem. Alexandr. Strom lib. 5.) Thales thus: There is but one God, he is Glori∣ous forever; he knows Hearts and tells Thoughts. He maketh the Teller of his Thoughts God (as in Amos 4.13.)
Pythagoras thus: GOD resembleth Light and Truth; he is One: He is not out of the World, he is the Salt of all Ages: ONE HEAVENLY LIGHT and Father of all things; only Wise: In∣visible, yet Intelligible, (Jambl. Iust. Mart.) Heraclitus thus; God is not made with Hands. Pythagoras; What things are agreeable to God, cannot be known, unless a man HEAR GOD himself. Again: Having overcome thy rebellious Appetites, thou shalt know the Cohabitation of the Immortal God and mortal Men; whose work is Immortality, Eternal Life. (Trin. de Animâ Mundi.) Sophocles speaking of the Precepts written in Man's Heart: saith, God is their Father, not Mortal Nature; neither shall they ever be abrogated: for there is in them a great God, that never wax∣eth old. Again (saith he) This is with respect to Man's Conscience a Divine, a Sacred Good: God the Overseer. (Oedip. Tyr. Clem. Alex. Str. l. 5.) Socrates had the Guide of his Life within him, and preached, as he was moved by it, even in the Streets; and died for reproving the Corruptions of the Athenians in Manners and Religion. Plotin taught, That Man had a Divine Principle in him, which maketh a True and Good Man. Hierom called it a Domestick God. The Good (said Socrates) shall be united to God in an In accessible place; the Wicked in convenient places suffer due Puniment. Iustin. Martyr in his Apology saith; God hath built to himself a natural Temple in the Consciences of Men.Testimonies of the Fathers. Clem. Alex. (Admon. ad Gent.) It is the Voice of Truth, that Light will shine out of Darkness: Therefore doth it shine in the Hid∣den Part of Mankind. Strom. (l. 5.) Man cannot be void of Divine Knowledge, who naturally partakes of Divine Inspirations. Lactan. (de Cult. Ver.) The Law of God is made known to us: The Law is pure and unspotted Reason, diffused through all the World. Athanasius (contr. gent.) The way to attain to the knowledge of God is within us; which is proved from Moses, who saith: The Word of God is within thy heart; and from this Saying of Christ, The Faith and Kingdom of God is within you. Minutius Felix saith: God is every where not only very near us,
but infused. As is observed by Grotius, (Crit. Tom. 7. on Acts 17, 27.) Testimonies concerning the SCRIPTURES. LVther taught, That the Spirit is required to the understanding of the whole Scripture, and of every part thereof. Again, The Scriptures are not to be understood, but by that very Spirit, by which they were wrote. (Tom. 3. fol. 169.) Iohn Bradford thus answered the Arch-Bishop of York; We do believe and know the Scriptures, as Christ's Sheep: not because the Church saith, they are the Scriptures; but because they be so, being thereof assured by the same Spirit, that wrote and spake them. (Book of Mart. Vol. 3. p. 298.) W. Tindal, (a faithful Martyr in Hen. 8. his time) writes thus; It is impossible to understand the Scriptures more then a Turk, for him that hath not the Law of God written in his Heart to fulfil it. Again, Without the Spirit it is impossible to understand them. (W. Tindal's Works p. 319 and p. 80.) B. Iewel against the Papists hath this Passage: Flesh and Blood is not able to understand the Holy Will of God with∣out special Revelation: therefore Christ gave Thanks to his Fa∣ther, and likewise opened the Hearts of his Disciples, that they might understand the Scriptures. Without this special Help and Prompting of God's holy Spirit the Scriptures are unto the Reader (be he never so Wise or well-Learned) as the Vision of a Sealed Book. Calvin saith, It is necessary, that the same Spirit, that spake by the Mouth of the Prophets, should pierce into our Hearts, to perswade us of the Truth, of what they delivered. (Instit. lib. 1. cap. 8.) Beza saith, That the understanding of the Scriptures should be fetch'd from the same Spirit, that dictated them. (Beza in Nov. Test. 2 Pet. 1.19.) Peter Martyr taught, That the Spirit is the Arbiter, by whom we must assure our selves for understanding of the Scrip∣tures; that thereby we must discern between Christ's words, and a Stranger's. (Quoting Christ's words, My Sheep know my voice, and follow not a Stranger. And among other Scriptures he quots
these, The Spirit searcheth out the deep things of God—The Com∣forter shall declare all things, that I have said unto you—The spiritual Unction shall shew you all things. (Com. Loc. part. 1. pag. 6.) Again, The Spirit of God reveals the truth in the holy Scrip∣tures. (Com. loc: p. 2. cap. 18.) Again, (in an Oration to the Vniversity of Strasburgh, concerning the Scriptures he expresseth himself thus:) The School of this Philosophy is Heaven. Again, We must remember, that the Teach∣er hereof is the Holy Ghost. Doct. Ames (a Great Father of the Independents) upon 1 Ioh: 2. saith: We require no more; the Anointing of the holy Spirit doth teach the faitful to understand those things, which they received of the Apostles, there from to understand those things, which are necessary to Salvation: for these things those Believers had received of the Apostles. With more to the same purpose in that Chapter (lib. 1. c. 5. Thes. 32. contr. Bellarm.) H. Bullinger asserts (in his 4 Decas, and 8. Serm. dedicated to K. Edw. 6.) That Men fetch'd the understanding of heavenly things and knowledge of the holy Ghost from no where else, then from the same Spirit. Doct. Owen saith, The only publick, Authentick and infallible Interpreter of the Holy Scriptures is he, who is the Author of them; from the breathing of whose Spirit it derives all its Verity Perspicuity and Authority (Exerc. 2.7.9.) T. C. (an Antient and Considerable Baptist) saith: There is the Law and Testimony in the Spirit, as well as in the Letter. The Law of God is in the Heart, there it is written, and there it testi∣fieth the Truth of God: and if any Man speak not according to this Rule, it is, because there is no Light or Morning risen in him: (see his Works pag. 249.) Again, Others know no other Touch-stone nor Trial, no other Light, by which they judge of Truth, then Scripture: thus putting it in the room of the Spirit, which is Light, and the greater Light. For they say, they cannot know Truth, till they bring it to the Letter for Tryal: thus making an Idol of the Letter, setting it up in the oom of God. (Ibid: pag. 248.
Testimonies concerning the RULE. IRenaeus (pag 242, 384, 389): The Writing in the Heart is the Rule. Again, (l. 5. c. 8.) The Word giveth his Spirit to All, to Some according to Condition. And (l. 4. c. 30.) The Fathers being Iustified by the Righteousness of the Law of God in them, there∣fore had no need of Reproving Letters. W. Perkins Works, (Vol. 3. pag. 220) The Light of Nature and Grace teacheth, To do as we would be done to. (Pag. 221.) It is the Fulfilling of the Law, the Rule to Iudge Scripture: That of God made the Rule, something in the Conscience; Happy Times, if Men would follow it. Bishop R. Sanderson, (De Obligat. Conscientiae, p. 127.) saith; A Rule of Discerning without the Scripture, (Regula discernendi extra Scripturam.) T. Collier saith; The Spirit of God, who is God, is the alone Rule of a Christian, (Gen. Epist. to the Saints, Chap. 12.) The Spiritual Man Iudgeth all Things by the Rule of the Spirit, (ibid.) The Law of the New Testament is Written in the Heart, (ibid.) Testimonies concerning the SOUL. TErtullian (De Animâ▪ pag. 297.) Asserts the Immortality and Divinity of the SOUL. D. Fagius (in Gen. 2.7.) Rabbi Nehamanides hath observed; That he, that Breatheth on any, contributes something of his own to it: whence Christ our Saviour, when he would Communicate his Holy Spirit to his Disciples, he did it by Breathing upon them; signifying, that he contributed to them something of his own, that was Divine. The Word  signifies something Divine and Hea∣venly, something  because the Immortal Soul of Man is a certain Divine Thing. Peter Martyr speaks of the Soul thus (in Psalm. 94:) We are Taught not to with-draw from the Divine Nature those Things,
that are Perfect and Absolute in us, (pag. 12.) And pag. (122.) They say (saith he)  (the Soul) doth chiefly signify that which is Divine and Reasonable, which God doth give unto us. H. Bullinger saith; The Soul is a Spiritual Substance, poured of God into Man's Body, (in his 4. Decas. 10. Serm.) Augustine saith; It is felt in the Life, it is Vnutterable; Breathed into Man's Body from the Secret Power of God. [Henry Ainsworth (Annot. in Pentateuch.) brings the Rab∣bines saying; The Form of the Soul (of Man) is not Compounded of the Elements, &c. but is of the Lord from Heaven: There∣fore when the Material Body, which is Compounded of the Ele∣ments, is separated, and the Breath perisheth, (because it is not found but with the Body, and is needful for the Body in all the Actions thereof) this (Essential) Form is not destroyed, &c; but continueth even for ever and ever. This is that, which Solomon by his Wisdom said; And Dust shall Return unto the Earth, as it was, and the Spirit shall Return unto God, who gave it.] Id. (in Gen. 2, 7.) The Lord Animated or Inspired him with a Living and Reasonable Soul or Spirit, which presently appeared by Breath at his Nostrils: For the Soul of Man is not educed, de∣rived or fetched out of any Power in the Matter of the Body, nor made of any Matter at all, as the Body is; but as it is a Spirit, Material and Immortal, so it had its Immediate Original from the Father of Spirits. (Hebr. 12, 9.) Walter Rawleigh's (Hist. of the World, pag. 18.) Man is said to be after the Image of God, in respect of his Immortal Soul on∣ly; because as God is Invisible, so the Soul of Man is Invisible; as God is Immortal and Incorporcal, so is the Soul of Man Immor∣tal and Incorporcal; and as there is but one God, which Governeth the World, so but one Soul, which Governeth the Body of Man: and as God is Wholly in every Part of the World, so is the Soul of Man Wholly in every Part of the Body. Henry More (Philosophical Writings, pag. 37:) The Specifick Nature of the Soul of Man is an Immaterial Substance, endued with those two Eminent Properties of Understanding, and Power of Moving Corporal Matters. Peter Charron's Wisdom (pag. 22): The Immortality of the Soul is a Thing Vniversally received throughout the World (I mean, by an Outward Profession; seriously and Inwardly not so: witness so many Epicures, Libertines and Mockers in the World.)
Iohn Smith's (of Queen's Colledge in Cambridge) Discourses, (pag. 87): The Soul of Man acting upon it self, and drawing forth its own Latent Energy, finds it self able to tame the Out∣ward Man, and bring under those Rebellious Motions, that arise from the meer Animal Powers; and to tame and appease all those Se∣ditions and Mutinies, that it finds there. (Ibid. p. 92.) There is a Naked Intuition of Eternal Truth in the Soul, which is always the same, which never Rises nor Sets; but always Stands still in its Vertical, and fills the Whole Horizon of the Soul with a Mild and Gentle Light: There are such Calm and Serene Ideas of Truth, that shine only in Pacate Souls, and can∣not be discern'd by any Troubled or Fluid Fancy. Plotinus, (En. 4. l. 8. c. 1. pag. 99) The Soul of a Divine and Immortal Being, &c. (Id. Ibid.) When he shall behold his own Soul fixt in an Intel∣ligible and Pure Nature, Contemplating Things Eternal; — look∣ing into the Intellectual World, being it self made all Lucid (to wit, Light) Intellectual and Shining with the Sun-Beams of Eter∣nal Truth borrowed from the First Good, which perpetually Ray∣eth forth his Truth upon all Intellectual Beings. William Robertson, (in his Key to the Hebr. Bible, sub. Lit. Nun:  and  the Soul, a Noun Primitive, from which is de∣rived the Verb in Piel  Nippesh, he Breathed; because the Soul is the Principle of Life and Breath, &c. Henry Moor's Philosophical Writings of the Immortality of the Soul, (libr. 2. cap. 1. pag. 58:) There is such an Immaterial Substance in Man, which from the Power it is conceived to have in actuating and guiding the Body, is usually called the SOUL. (Id. Ibid. Cap. 3. pag. 72) No Essence in it self can vary its Modification.— For there is an Essence in us (what-ever we will call it) which we find endued with this Property, as appears from hence, that it has Variety of Perceptions. (Id. Ibid, Cap. 11. pag. 109:) The Soul is a Substance distinct from the Body, and her very Essence is spread throughout all the Organs thereof. Lactantius; The Soul, whereby we Live, comes as it were from Heaven, from God. G. F. J. B.
