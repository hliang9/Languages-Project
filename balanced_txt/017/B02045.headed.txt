XV. It is also agreed and concluded between His said Majesty of Great Britain, and the said Lords States of the United Ne∣therlands, That the Island of Pularon shall be restored unto His said Majesty, or unto them whom He shall thereunto appoint by a Commission under the great Seal of England; and that so soon as any one provided with such a Commission, shall arrive there and demand the said restitution: Which that it may be effected with the more ease and certainty, Commissions necessary for that end shall be delivered unto Him from the States General and the Netherlands East India Company, immediatly after the Ratification of this Treaty. And that by the restitution of the said Island of Pularon, all actions and pretensions wherein the Subjects of either Party think they have right for losses, injuries and offences committed upon each other in India, and taken no∣tice
of in England before the 10th,/20. of January, 1658/9. (with this exception, That they who say that they have suffered loss in two Ships, to wit, the Bonaventure and Bona Esperanza, may prosecute the Suit already begun) shall cease, be extinguished and annulled in the maner following: That all offences, injuries and losses (except before excepted) which one part hath suffered, or can any way pretend to have suffered from the other in the East Indies, whereof any notice hath been given to the English at London, or to the Netherlan∣ders at the Hague, before the twentieth day of January, 1659. new Stile, or the tenth of January, 1658. old Stile; but in other parts of the world on this side the Cape, of any actions or things whatsoever, that hapned before the publication and notice of the Peace concluded between both Nations the 4/14. day of March, 1653/4. shall remain utterly cancelled and extinguished, so as neither Party shall trouble the other for any such damage, offence, injury or de∣triment (except before excepted) but there shall be and remain a perfect abolition of all and every one of them, and all Suits and Actions upon such account shall be void and null: But other da∣mages, offences, injuries and detriments, which the English Nation either upon publick or private account, can affirm to have fallen or been brought upon them by the Government of the United Netherlands, or by the Companies or private persons subject to that Government; as on the other side what the United Ne∣therlanders can, upon publick or private account, pretend to have fallen or been brought upon them by the Government of the English, or by the Companies or private persons subject there∣unto, in the East Indies, before the 10th./20, day of January, 1658/9. or at least whereof there was no notice at London or the Hague, before that day; and in other parts of the world after the pub∣lication and notice of the aforesaid Peace in the year, 1653/4, with∣out any further distinction or exception of persons, place or time, shall be submitted, as by this Treaty they are submitted, unto the examination, arbitration and decision of Commissioners or Arbitrators, after the maner and under the conditions following. That Commissioners be appointed only for maters past, but not at all for matters to come, which may happen after the day where∣upon this Treaty is concluded.
That their Commission directed unto past things only, as hath been already said, is not to contain any general Clause, but to be expressely confined and limited to a special Catalogue, which shall be annexed unto the Commission, so as they may by no means take cognisance of any other thing besides the Actions set down in that Catalogue. But that they may mutually agree thereupon, a Catalogue shall be made by both Parties, and interchangably delivered, that it may be punctually and duly examined by either side: And if there be found in either of the Catalogues, any thing whatso∣ever relating to the East Indies, which were known in London before the 10th./20. of January, 1658/9 as to actions of the English, or at the same time at the Hague, as to the actions of the United Provinces, or which hapned in other parts of the world before the publication and notice of the foresaid Peace; in the year, 1653/4 or other actions of such a nature as may not be thought fit to be referred unto such Arbitration, they shall be rejected and ex∣punged out of the Catalogues. Wherefore, after each side is agreed upon these Catalogues, a whole year shall be appointed, wherein all businesses contained in in those Catalogues may be accommodated and composed by friendly conferences between His Majesties Minister and the Commissioners of the States General at the Hague; and the Pretenders or their Deputies thereunto appointed by special Letters of Atturney, shall be bound to make their appearance at the Hague, before the end of the sixth moneth in the foresaid year: But that year being expired, all those actions about which the Pretenders or their Deputies were at the Hague with an aim or purpose to have them brought unto a friendly issue (which they shall be bound to prove by a lawfull testimony of the King of Great Britain's Envoy, and the Commissioners of the States General, or of either of them) and which nevertheless have not been by that time brought to such an issue, shall be referred to the said Commissioners, that they may be at last composed or decided by them; which Commissioners, after the said year is expired, if there remain any Actions uncomposed in such friendly maner at that time, shall to that purpose meet at London, and they shall be four on either side, instructed and provided with Autho∣rity;
and thenceforward this submission and progress in and through all things, shall be carried on in the same manner as it was in the year 1654. But so as the Arbitration upon these mat∣ters be not referred to the Protestant Cantons of Swisserland. XVI. That the Subjects of the said King of Great Britain, and those which are under His Jurisdiction, may freely and se∣curely travel in all the Provinces of the Low-Countries, and all their Dominions in Europe, and through them by Sea or Land pass to other places there or beyond them, and through all Quar∣ters of the United Provinces, Cities, Forts, or Garisons what∣soever, which are in any parts of the United Provinces, or else∣where in their Dominions in Europe, as well they themselves exercising Trade in all those places, as their Agents, Factors and Servants, may go armed or unarmed (but if armed, not above Forty in a Company) as well without their Goods and Merchandises as with them, wheresoever they please. The People also and Inhabitants of the United Provinces shall enjoy the same liberty and Freedom in all the Dominions of the said King in Europe; Provided that they and every of them do in their Trade and Merchandising yield obedience to the Laws and Statutes of either Nation respectively. XVII. That in case the Merchant-Ships of the Subjects of ei∣their Nation shall by Storm, Pirates, or any other necessity what∣soever, be driven into any Haven of either Dominion, they may depart securely and at their pleasure, with their Ships and Goods, without paying any Customs or other Duties; provid∣ed they break no Bulk, nor sell any thing; nor shall they be sub∣ject to any Molestation or Search, provided they do not receive on board any Persons or Goods, nor do any thing else contrary to the Laws, Ordinances or Customs of the places where they (as aforesaid) shall happen to arrive. XVIII. That the Merchants, Masters and Seamen of either Party, their Ships, Goods, Wares, or Merchandises shall not be Arrested or Seised in the Lands, Havens, Roads or Rivers of the other, to serve at War, or any other use, by vertue of any general or special Command, unless upon an extraordinary ne∣cessity, and that just satisfaction be given for the same; but so as the same shall not derogate from the Seisures and Arrests
duely made in the ordinary Courts of Justice of either Na∣tion. XIX. That the Merchants on both sides, their Factors and Servants, and also the Masters and other Seamen, as well going as returning by Sea and other Waters, as also in the Havens of either Party, or going on Shore, may carry and use for the de∣fence of themselves and Goods, all forts of Weapons, as well Offensive as Defensive; but being come into their Lodgings or Inns, they shall there lay by and leave their Arms, until they be going on board again. XX. That the Men of War, or Convoys of either Nation, meeting or overtaking at Sea any Merchants Ship or Ships belong∣ing to the Subjects or Inhabitants of the other, holding the same Course, or going the same Way, shall be bound, as long as they keep one Course together, to protect and defend them against all and every one who would set upon them. XXI. That if any Ship or Ships of the Subjects or Inhabitants of either Nation, or of a Neuter, be taken by a third Party in the Harbours of either, not being of the Subjects or Inhabitants of either Nation, they, in or out of whose Haven or Jurisdiction the said Ships shall be taken, shall be bound to endeavour with the other Party, that the said Ship or Ships be pursued, brought back, and restored to the Owners; but all this shall be done at the charges of the Owners, or whom it concerns. XXII. That Searchers and other like Officers on both sides, shall regulate themselves according to the Laws of either Nation, and shall not impose or demand more then they are allowed by their Commissions and Instructions. XXIII. That if any injury be done or practised by either Nati∣on, or the Subjects or Inhabitants of the same, against the Sub∣jects or Inhabitants of the other, or against any of the Articles of this present, Treaty, or against common right; yet neverthe∣less no Letters of Reprisal, Mark or Countermark shall be grant∣ed by either side, till Justice hath been first demanded according to the ordinary course of Law; but in case Justice be there de∣nied or delayed, then that the said King of Great Britain and the said States General, or Commissioners of that Nation whose Subjects and Inhabitants have suffered the wrong, shall publick∣ly
require Justice from that other Party, where (as above-said) it was denied or delayed, or from that Power appointed to heat and decide such differences, that there may be a friendly com∣posure, or due process of Law. But if still there happen more delays, and neither Justice be administred, nor satisfaction given within three moneths after such demand, that then Letters of Re∣prisal, Mark, or Countermark may be granted. XXIV. That they who have obtained private Commissions from either Party, before they receive such Commissions, shall give good and sufficient caution before the Judge of the Court where they receive such Commissions, by responsible men, who have no part or share in such Ships, that they shall do no damage or injury to the Subjects or Inhabitants of either side. XXV. It is also agreed and concluded, That the Subjects and Inhabitants of either Party shall alwayes have free access to each others Sea-ports, there to remain and from thence to depart with the same freedom; and not only with their Merchant-ships and Loading, but also with their Men of War, whether they be∣long to the said King or States General, or unto such as have ob∣tained private Commissions, whether they arrive through vio∣lence of tempest or other casualty of the Seas, or to mend their Ships, or to buy Provision, so they exceed not the number of eight Men of War when they come there voluntarily, nor shall remain or abide longer in the Havens or Places adjacent, then they shall have a just cause to repair their said Ships, or to buy Victuals or other necessaries. And if a greater number of Men of War should upon occasion desire to come unto such Ports, they shall in no case enter thereinto, untill they have first obtained leave from those to whom the said Havens do appertain, unless they be for∣ced so to do by storm, or some force or necessity, whereby they may avoid the danger of the Sea: In which case also they shall presently make known the cause of their coming unto the Go∣vernour or chief Magistrate of the place, and shall stay no longer then the said Governour or chief Magistrate shall permit them, and shall not do any acts of Hostility or other prejudice in the aforesaid Havens during their abode there. XXVI. Furthermore it is agreed and concluded, That both Parties shall truly and firmly observe and execute this present
Treaty, and all and every the maters contained therein, and ef∣fectually cause the same to be observed and performed by the Subjects and Inhabitants of either Nation. XXVII. Also for further caution and assurance that this Treaty and Confederacy shall be duly and bonâ fide observed on the part of the said States General of the United Provinces and their People, it is concluded and agreed, as also the said States General by these presents do agree, and firmly oblige and bind themselves, That all and every one whom they or the States of the Provinces shall at any time choose, appoint, or make Captain General, Governour or chief President, or State-holder, General of Armies or Military Forces by Land, or Admiral or General of the Fleets, Ships or Forces at Sea, shall be bound and obliged by Oath to confirm this Treaty and all the Articles thereof, and promise sacredly upon Oath, that they shall, as far as it is possible, religiously observe and execute the same, and as much as concerns them, cause the same be observed and executed by others. XXVIII. And it is further agreed and concluded, That this present Treaty, and all and every thing therein contained and concluded, shall be confirmed and ratified by the said King of Great Britain, and the said States General of the United Pro∣vinces, by Letters Patents on both sides, sealed with the great Seal, in due and authentick form, within three moneths next en∣suing, (or sooner if it can be done) and that within the said time the Ratifications on both sides shall be exchanged; and that pre∣sently after the delivery and exchange, this Treaty and Alliance shall be published in such places and maner as is usual.
