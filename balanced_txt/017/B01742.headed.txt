TOBIAS Observation; A Youngman came unto a fair, by chance he met his true Love there Said he, sweetheart thou art welcome here, invited her to drink some Beer, But in the end prov'd ne'r the near, as in this Song it will appear. Tune of, The Country Farmer. By Tobias Bowne. This may be Printed, R. P. THere was a Youngman who lately exprest his love to a Damsel that liv'd in the West; And thus he began his mind to declare said he, thou art welcome unto this Fair I have a great mind with thee to talk, come pray let us to the Tavern walk Ile do thee no harm thou needst not fear, for Fairing i'le give thee one flaggon of Beer. Pray how doth your Father and Mother at home, they were well this morning then answered Joan Said he if you please to walk with me we will be as merry as merry may be: To tell thee the truth I do love the dear, yet I am so doubtful my mind to declare For fear what I ask you should me deny and then for your Love I shall surely die I hope you will not offended be though I make so bold to speak unto thee, For night nor day I can take no rest, for Love that lies harbour'd within my Breast And thou art she that canst ease my pain, then grant me love for love again: Give me some kind answer my heart to ease, and let me not languish in Loves disease. The Maids Answer. Good Sir, I do fancy you jeer at me, your Riches and mine will never agree, For I am a poor Mans daughter its known I work for my Living abroad & at home Sometimes I'me at whom to spinning of Yarn and sometimes abroad to reaping of Corn Sometimes in the Feild to milk the Cow I get what I have by the sweat of my brow. I live as well contented as any Maid can, what need I intangle my self with a Man, I walk where I please at my own command I need not say shall I, pray shall I husband, Now I have my self to guide and to rule, in marrying some people have plaid the Fool: Methinks it is troublesome to be a Nurse, when children are froward & husbands are worse Yet for your Love I have no cause to deny sure you deserve one that is better then I For you have a good estate of your own And I am a poor Mans Daughter it's known, Yet I am content, with what little I have, Perhaps if I marry I may be a Slave, Therefore I'le beware how I marry in hast, for fear I have cause to repent at the last. The Mans Answer. O prithee my dearest take pitty on me, no one in the World, I fancy but thee, And do not abuse me for loving thee dear, I'le willingly tarry for thee one whole year Nothing shall be wanting thy mind to fulfil so thou wilt but grant me thy Love & good Wil But if thou deny me and Love thou hast none, then surely thy Heart is as hard as a Stone. Sweetheart prethee tell me, I know you well can whether you do fancy another youngman Pray pardon my boldness in asking so far, or to any other ingaged you are, My dearest resolve me if you'l be so be kind, that will be great ease to my troubled mind, But if from all other Men thou art free, I shall live in hopes that my Bride thou wilt be. The Maids Answer. Good sir, you pretend a great deal of good will yet I am not ready your mind to fulfil, For I have no fancy to be made a Wife nor ne'r was concern'd with no man in my Life And for to live single it is my delight and so honest youngman I wish you good night, Pray by your leave let me pass by you youngman for now it is high time for me to be gone. The Mans Answer. And must thou begone and no longer wilt stay then I wish I had not a seen thee this day, For now I am troubled with doubt and with fear because I am slighted for loving so dear Young-men I advise you where ever you be If Cupid do hit you, then think upon me, Although you Love dearly yet never declare, unto any Damsel the Love that you bare. And so having ended I wish you all well each youngman & maid to the place where you dwell But yet I would have you one penny bestow amp; that is the price of this Ballad you know You know it is good to learn Children to Read, it's fit for a Youngman to sing to a Maid It is good for pastime on each holy day, and here be the Ballads come buy them away. Printed for P. Brooksby at the Golden Ball in Pye-corner.
