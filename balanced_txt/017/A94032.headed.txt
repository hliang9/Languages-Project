The wonder of the World, Or the Great GYANT DESCRIBED. THE strange Report of this Monsterous Huge Gyant hath filled all Ears with Wonder and Amazement; that such Men have been in former times, is undeni∣able; but that such should be in these last Times of the World, might seem not on∣ly very inrredible, but also Wonderfull to the hearers or beholders of all such Monsters, as this is Reported to be; But before I come to describe him, let me a little reflect upon former times, and of the Men of those dayes, that the present relation we have in hand may gain the more likelyhood of truth. That learned Author Varro, writeth of one Tritamio, a Fencer at Rome, of such exceeding strength, that being bound hand and foot with massie Chains, he would wrestle with the strongest men that could be found, pushing their bodyes from one side to another, he giving such a deadly
blow, that if he but touched one of them, they were in great danger of their Lives; his Son was no whit inferior, for being a Souldier under Pompey, fought alwayes naked, armed with nothing but what Nature had furnished him withall, namely his Fiests and Nayles, and if he touched but any one with his little finger, he made him yeeld, and brought him Prisoner to the Campe; the Sinews of these two, were not onely at length like other men, but onely athwart, and crosse-wise over all their whole Body, from whence (as the Sages observe) proceeded this their so mi∣raculous strength. Elan writeth of a Gyant named Tritormo, of such mighty Puissance and strength, that Milo (another Gyant) thinking his great Fame would be ecclipsed by the Report of the others strength, and unconquered Valour; that Milo made no more adoe, but sent him a Challenge, which was gladly accepted by Tritormo, and the Day appointed to Fight, the Combitants being no sooner entred into Fight, But Tritormo catching up a mighty cleft of a huge Rock, which was impossible for any Humane force to move, casting it from him three or four times, with such exceeding force, and then lifting it up upon his Soulder, carried it so farre, that Milo trembling and amazed at the strangnesse thereof, cryed out; Oh JƲPITER! Is it possible that thou hast brought another Hercules into the World? And so declining the Ingagement, without more adoe, yeilded unto him; thinking it honor enough for him to wait upon him, and become his servant till his Death; these had both the Pipes of their Armes and Leggs doubled, their bones being whole, firm and sound, either without hollownesse or Marrow, which caused them to be of greater force and strength; and which is most Remarkable, They never suffere Thirst, nor at any time was it ever observed that they sweat. Solinus writeth, that Hercules himself was but Seven Foot high, and all the rest of his Body proportionable.
He mentioneth also two Gyants that lived in the time of Augustus Caesar, the one named Puston, the other Secundila, who were Ten foot high apiece; their bones are now to be seen in the Ossary of the Salustians: Another Gyant was a∣bout this time in Arabia, called Gauara, who was Nine foot and 9 Inches long, the rest of his body proportionable. The Bones of Orestes found at Tegoea, which being measured, were found 7 Cubits long, which is more then four yeards. In the time that Sartorius remained Captain General over the Romane Army at Athens, he caused the Sepulchre of a Gy∣ant to be opened, and his bones to be measured, the length of his Carcasse was found to be 70 Cubits, which was seen to the great admiration of all the Romane Hoste. Bergamo writeth of a Sepulchre, wherein was found a Body of admirable greatness, outreaching as it were in length the high Walls or Buildings, he seemed as if he lay sleeping, having wounds upon him Four Foot wide; at his Bolster stood a Lampe burning, which would not go out till a hole was made in the Bottome thereof, which being done, it suddenly extinguished; and the Body, so soon as touched turned into Powder and Ashes, about this Tombe was written in Greek Letters, Pallas, Son of Evander, slaine by Tur∣nus. John Bocacius writeth, That in the City of Trapana, cer∣tain Labourers digging of Chalke at the foot of a Hill, dis∣covered a Cave of wonderous widenesse, in which was a Light burning, in the midst whereof sate a man of Monster∣ous bigness, holding a Saffe as big as the greatest Mast of a ship; they being much affrighted with the fight, runne to the next Town amazed, and raised all the People, who arming themselves, came with Light Torches to the Cave, where finding he did not stir, they laid hands on him, who so soon as touch'd fell into Ashes, the bones also remain∣ing, which being measured, his Carcasse was found to be 140 Cubits long, his skull holding two heaped Bushells of Wheate. But these were all but Dwarfs to ou Gyant; the truest Description of him, take from that sage Philosopher Democritus, who limmeth him forth thus.
This Monsterous Gyant was taken by an English Merchant in a certain Iland in America called Nera, as two ships were taking in fresh-water, they seeing this Monsterous Gyant make towards them, with a great Oake in his hand, fled all to their shallop or long-Boat, and so made away to their Ship, much amazed at the sight of so monsterous a Man; He standing some little time on the shoar looking after them, and so returned some distance up again into the I∣land; Whereupon the Captain comanded 3 Butts of Sacke, and a Rundlet of Strong-Waters, to be placed on the shoare, and set an end, and the heads of them to be knock'd out, and so to return a Ship-board againe, which done, the next Morning they perceived the Gyant come stalking down to the shoare, and smelling the Sack, he took up a Butt as easi∣ly as one would take up a Cup from the Table, and at one draught drunk it all off, and so went to the next, and did the like, but at the third Butt he made two draughts, and so falling down, set the Strong-waters to his mouth, turning it up as easily as one would do a Gill, which Strong-wa∣ter so intoxicated his head, That he fell into a dead sleep; whereupon the Captain sent out a Shallop, with 30 of the lustiest Marriners, with Chains to binde him, and so with Cranes and Pullyes to get him into the Shallop, which with difficulty they effected, yet not without great dan∣ger of sinking their shallop with his extraordinary weight, having him at the Ship-side, opened the Decks, halled him up by Ropes and Pullyes, and so loared him down into the Hole, where he slept sweetly among the Sand 24 houres after, during which time, they had taken off his chains, and bound him hand and foot with new Ropes and Cables, and so making fast the Ballast-room left him lying along (as in a Coffin) all the length of the Ship; and so, having a fair wind, sailed about a hundred Leagues from the Iland be∣fore he awaked, who perceiving himself intangled, stretch∣ing out his Limbs; cracked assunder the Ropes, as easily as one of us would doe a twine-thread, yet could not by reason of his length rise up; they feeding him through a
hole, by degrees have in some sort civiliz'd and tamed him; he is 19 foot and a half high, 9 foot broad in the Shoul∣ders, his head is four yeards and a quartern about, his neck 2 yeards, and the Calves of his leggs as bigg; his Nose is 13 inches long London measure, it being about a yeard between each Eye, the hollow of his nostrills being just the com∣passe of the Muzzle of a Drake, and his Eyes as bigg as rea∣sonable Sawcers; he will easily put a shoulder of Mutton in his mouth at a bitt; his Keeper, since he came to Portsmouth putting in a 24 pound piece of raw Beef through the hole to him, the Gyant being hungry, and snapping eagerly at it, bit off his Keepers hand, just by the elbow, making no bones of it, which makes them ever since more wary of him; he is suddenly expected at the Mouth at Aldergate, which Place (being large) is now taking up for him; Three sales-men on Snow hill have hired 30 Tailors to make him a pair of Breeches and Doublet, the Cloath whereof, being 38 yeards of Broad-Cloath, at 11. s. the yeard; and a Felt∣maker in Greens Rents hath bought an old Copper of the Brasier at Holburn-Conduit, to boyle his Felt in, the crown of which Hat will hold 3 bushells of Wheate, there being in the Brims and all, about a Todd and a half of Wooll; the Kings Shoe-maker in St. Martins, having bought the last Monday in Leaden-hall 7 Dicker of Leather to make him a pair of Boots and a pair of Shooes, there being a large back in one sowle, and 2 hides in an upper Leather, Squire Bugge is to take measure of his foot, and to cut them out, and liquor them; twenty Ells of Lockrum will but make him one shirt, his Stockings being full as bigg, but longer then a Quarter-Sack, and his Garters 12 yeards long, comming but twice about his legge, all the Fees at the Slaughter-house on Tower Hill are bespoak to feed him; and 3 Carpenters hired by the Merchants that own him, to goe and cut down the Great Elme at Hamsted to make him a Pick-tooth; Some re∣port, that a certain rich Jew hath bought Powls to keep him in, where he intends to show him to the People, because the Mouth Inn at Alders-gate is measured, and found too lit∣tle
to hold him; the great Oliphant in Holland is sent for over, to bring him thorow the City, as he passes thorow Cheap-side, Two men are to be placed on the top of Bow-Steeple, with two great Ladles fastned upon Poles, to reach him Sack to drink, and two more with great Shovells to fling Sugar-plumns into his mouth; 24 men have underta∣ken to feed him on the side Galleries on top of Pauls, one standing with a Scoop to fling in salt after every mouthfull of meat he takes, 40 Fat Oxen being roasted for his Dinner, and 100 sheep for his Supper, two Tun of Wine, and Three Hoggs-heads of Beer to a meal, and this is to welcome him into the City; thus he is to be feasted for 6 Dayes, and the Seventh, four Presbyterian Priests are to say Grace, and af∣terwards to use all the possible means they can to Convert him from Paganisme, and so he is to goe to Broken-wharf, where the Priests are to stand by the Windmill on the top of the Water-House, and to sprinkle him with Holy-water drawn up by Horses for that purpose, and afterwards he is to pull off his stockings, and to wade up the Thames to Westminster-Hall and back again, that all the Citizens may behold him, as he goes and comes back, all the Chambers are to be dis∣charged at the Bank-end and upon Tower-Hill; Some affirm, that the Hgogs-fac'd Gentle-woman is sent for out of Holland to be his god-mother; and litte Jeffry the Great Turk from Constantinople to be his godfather; but this is only report; when he is christned, and all this performed you shall hear more, untill which time, I shall forbear any further Infor∣mation or Discription of this Monsterous Gyant; In the mean time, take this for the most truest Relation. FINIS.
