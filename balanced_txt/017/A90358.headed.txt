ANGLORUM SINGULTUS: OR, THE SOBBS OF ENGLAND, Poured out. To be presented to His Excellency GENERALL GEORGE MONKE. London, Printed for D. L. 1660.
Anglorum Singultus: OR, The Sobs of England poured out: To be presen∣ted to his Excellency, General George Monke. THe hopes which was generally raised in the spirits of all men, who have any true sence of the blee∣ding and gasping condition of the three once famous and flourishing Nations, of England, Scotland, and Ireland, have received some Check, by what is published, of the minde and intentions of your Excellency, in relation to the publique af∣fairs; yet can we not conceive them utterly blasted, whilst we remember, you are a Christian, an English-man, and a Gentle∣man, and one whose Prudence and Pollicy in the conduct of Affairs both Civil and Military, hath appeared signal and emi∣nent amidst the many stormy violences, which, of late years, have so much, and so often threatned our utter ruine and de∣struction, both in Church, State, and Common-wealth: Oh let not the Syrens of blood and mischief further charm your ears, and delude your apprehension, by many specious pretences, and beguiling suggestions, come they cloathed in what shape or co∣lour soever: But keep those Scintillas divinae facis, those divine faculties of your soul, your Understanding, Reason, and Will, free and untainted from all the inchanting allurements of pri∣vate interest and Faction; and with the generous soul of a free-born Native of this Land, look about you, and with true Chri∣stian compassion behold the new Chains and Fetters, which the black Operators of mischief are now afresh hammering, upon your Anvil, and with your Tools. It is now compleat eleven years, since that fatal and horrid act, that Crimen fulmine dig∣num, executed by the wicked Instruments of him, from whose dark conclave of Fiends it had its product? You that hitherto have stood free from the gnawing guilt of so direfull, grand, and piacular a crime, have so much pity upon your own soul and
honour, as not to sully either, with so much contamination, as to enter Councels, much lesse Interests, with that bloody crew, of the most diabolical humanities, which cloathed with flesh and blood, ever entred the stage hf this world in any age or place whatsoever, since Adam digg'd for his first transgression in Para∣dise. To say nothing of what preceded, but to take a short view and glance towards the dismal wasting, and destructive contin∣gencies, which in those sad eleven years have befaln us, viz. since Decemb. 5. 1648. from which time the first grand Contri∣vers of all our deplorable miseries, began with bare face, to shew their horrid shape; what have we had since that time, but a continued concatination of successive mischiefs, one rushing up∣on the neck of another, and all under the guilded shew of a free Commonwealth; when, of all the true real and essential parts thereof, we have enjoyed not so much as the least glimpse or iota? Was there ever upon earth any state and society of men, who in so few years have endured such, and so many bitter pangs and throws of vicissitudinous thraldom, as we since that tiem have done? What heaving and shooving have we often tremblingly beheld for the Empire and Dominion over us, and in whose hand that iron Rod should be that we poor Vassals were (however) to be scourged with? and when ambition had climbed and even reached the very pinacle of its aspirings, what sudden and stu∣pendious revolutions have afresh assaulted and amazed us? What a deluge of innocent bloud (now crying under the Altar) hath been waded through, to grasp, and assert the grandeur for some persons; and what millions of treasures (all robbed and extorted from us) have been squandred by every uppermost Power to support its own usurpation and greatnesse? and we poor hackney'd, spurr'd and galled people, held under a severe and imperious charge and command to believe, that all this while, we were a free Common-wealth, and had gained that liberty which we were seduced so long, and vigorously to con∣tend for; although the chains of this our cruel bondage lay so hard and heavy upon us, as that they even fretted and eat into our very bowels and vitals: Are we not from hence become the scorn of our neighbour Nations, and without Gods infinite mercy very likely to become some of their prey? Was ever poor Church, State, and Commonwealth (twenty years since the wonder and envy of the whole Christian world) reduced by a
few of its own members, most of them of meanest birth, and al∣most all of inconsiderable quality, to such a condition as we are? even the basest, and most vile of all slavery and servitude, that ever was known or heard of among the sons of Christian men? And any thing which but looks like freedom, so utterly banish∣ed from us, that it is almost become treason, to name or men∣tion the word (FREE;) no, not in relation to that authority which cals it self supream; we must not dare speak, much lesse declare our desires to have a Free Parliament; if so, whips of Steel are providing for us, to tear off that little flesh which yet remains upon our so much bloodied and bruised bones: What the interest and aims of private and particular Factions and per∣sons are, it is, by many sad experiences, become most appa∣rently evident, and no longer to be obscured, under any spe∣cious and glossy terms whatsoever, invented only to dazle and amuse the vulgar and common notions, which have been so of∣ten cheated and deluded by them. The true proper and gene∣ral interest of the People and Nation undoubtedly is, The set∣ling and securing of the ancient and known fundamental Laws of the Land, upon which depends the property and true liberty of every individual member, the reviving and restoring of our languishing and dead Trade, both at home and abroad, which together with our traffique manufactures is by our ruinous dis∣orders frighted from us to our neighbour Nations: To settle and establish Religion, that great and sure bond which fastens our securities all other wayes: The procuring (after such fatal storms of feud and animosity amongst us, and something else of a higher nature) a sure, firm and generall indempnity for all past actions whatsoever: To have the Government in such hands as may securely settle our forreign allyances, whose particular interest is involved in the publique, and buton'd by a Title and just possession, which needs not a consuming exorbitant, and all terrifying force, and power to defend and support it. These at present are the chiefe points of the Nations true interest: And where can these things be treated, debated, and concluded of, with any good fruit or effect, or the least hope thereof, bu in a full and free Parliament, and the whole Nations convention? What is it, that makes this word (Free) so terrible, and de∣testable to some persons? is force so pleasing and delightsome to them: why then did they so lately and loudly call and cry out
for help and assistance against it? And yet no sooner by the Na∣tions joynt concurrence delivered from it, but immediatly they fall to put the same in practice upon such their deliverers, and continue it upon them with far more dread and terror than it was in any sort ever exercised upon themselves, in their utmost extremity. Must a small cantel of the substitutes only enjoy freedom, and the residue substituted, being almost ten times their number, together with the whole body of the Nation sub∣stituring, be kept under a force? Is freedom only the portion of some few the meanest of the people, and force to be entailed upon all the rest, to all eternity: Or be we in a dream all this while, or so stupidly ignorant, as not to understand, what is force, or what is freedom? Or doth the season or circumstance of time, alter the nature of one and the self same act in omni modo? Is that force in 1653. and the same thing not force in 1648. and 1649? Do those men who thus, as it were sport them∣selves with our misery, and their own usurped Empire, think that the eyes of God, Angels and men, are all shut, and that none beholds this their grand tyrannical and deluding im∣posture? There hath been, and may be so much truly said, in this and many other particulars, that it seems no lesse than a kind of wonder, that there should be such a sort of Natives of this Land, endued with reason, and such refined reason, as pretends to the steerage and government of three ancient, potent and flou∣rishing Monarchies, and yet should openly dare to breath the comon air thereof, whilst with severest rigor, they impose such the most indign of all prevarications upon it, and seem to have such confidence in their acts of tyranny and force, that although (if they go on thus) their infamous ruine is so apparent to all sober by-standers, and cannot surely be otherwise to themselves likewise in their own secret thoughts; yet are they so hurried on by that Monster Ambition (Herostratus-like) to put all into a flame rather than suffer their hot and high aspirings in the least to chil or take cold, till themselves and their designes drop into ashes and rubbish. It is you (Great Sir) who have been long lookt upon as the Grand Moderator between these few unparalleld men, and this whole Nation, with all its Dominions, all the Nobility, Body of the Gentry, and Commons of the same; every County, City
and Burrough, and indeed every degree and society of men throughout the same; such especially as have at any time been engaged in the late war upon the Parliament account (and not now in arms) hereby joyntly as one man Addressing themselves to you, as the onely Esculapius to apply a seasonable remedy to this malady of Force, which is the epedemical and contagious disease, that hath so long, and now more then ever corrodes and plagues us, and so much distorts our ease, settlement and quiet: You have brought with you store of medicaments of all sorts, potent Antidotes against the malignity of forcible power, and subtle imposture, nor want you skill and courage seasonably to apply them; we regard not the lying Trump of Fame, which publishes various stories of your being already en∣gaged against us, and come rather to shackle us faster, then loose us from our long endured chains, to pull off our very skins which are already so close clipt by our shearers, rather then to afford us any ease or reluxation from our long endured misery. Much less do we credit that vain and empty whisper of your pretence of title to the Crown, as of the blood of a Plantagi∣net. These we look upon as inventions, raised by such as to re∣tain us still in slavery, would have us think, that the scorching oyle in the frying pan, is more tollerable than the glowing heat of the fire; we are very well acquainted with subtleties of this kind, and are most confidently perswaded, that your prudence and experience is such, that (would Religion and conscience permit in you such an attempt yet) the late ruinous downfal and exposition to general contempt, infamy and scorn of the Person and Family, and almost whole Allyance of such a da∣ring Usurper, is so fresh in memory, and so visibly and appa∣rently acted by Divine Providence in the very summity and height of their glory; that the very thought of such an as∣piring, will be most execrable and abhorrent to you: The Go∣vernment of this Nation and its Dominions, having in that par∣ticular much resemblance to the Arke of God, which till it came again into its right appointed place, was but a burden and plague almost to the utter destruction of whosoever durst set upon the retaining of it; witness our many late revolutions, and in them the downfal and suddain precipice of almost all that have in any sort taken upon them its steerage and manage∣ment: To say nothing of the signal judgements, which have
not been infrequently visible amongst us, upon such as have been eminently active in its first unhinging. There are many particulars more to be hinted, much too long for this Paper, yet very necessary for your advertisement; so that if freedome of argument in writing, or otherwise, were by your favour and indulgence to be used, without the danger u∣sually in these times attending it: That which is said to be your Letter into the West, would soon cleerly appear to you, to be ve∣ry Paradoxal, and as Hetrogenean to true policy, as detestable to all piety. All new by-paths, though somewhat trodden before experi∣ence shews us, will certainly lead to no other place but preci∣pice and ruine; for whatsoever is contrariant to the ancient setled foundation, upon which (if duely and without prejudice considered) we are so evenly and so excellently bottomed, though to such as look with false and bribed spectacles; the same may seem plausible, plain and easie of digestion; yet it is almost impossible, but that there must needs be thence a pro∣duction of the same evils, which have been acted amongst us un∣der several shapes and forms, ever since the year, 1648. And which will as certainly and undoubtedly return and rush in again upon us, and that the same causes cannot in nature but produce the same effects, and this without any difficulty is cleerly and infallibly to be demonstrated to each rational and capable ap∣prehension; if pens were permitted that freedome to unde∣ceive, as they are countenanced, nay hyred to becloud, corrupt, and insnare men, that so their chains and bonds of slavery and servitude may appear somewhat necessarily to be continued up∣on them; and whatsoever tyranny and vassaledge they under∣go and feel, they must yet believe (because they are so com∣manded) that it is liberty and freedome which they enjoy, and that they are Members of a Free-State and Common-wealth. The way you are desired to walk in, is not at all obscure; but as it is plain and easie; so is it most open, cleer and mani∣fest to all prudent and unbyassed men, free from self interest and partiality; such as we doubt not but to find your Excel∣lency; especially (dum res sit integra, with you, and before you drink deeper of the cup of inchantment prepared for you) if you will please but seriouslly to cast your thoughts upon, believe truths, and duely consider the preparations and resolu∣tions
abroad: And with the tender bowels of a true English Gentleman to ponder the most earnest and intense desires (al∣most to rude clamors) at home, of all sorts from the highest to the lowest, and in all parts and places of the Nation; and pre∣serve your self fortified against the allurements, and not be taken with the seeming bounties, but really empty husks, of those who (though at present you are the darling of their courtship) yet you may be sure, intend no further to honour you, then as it is useful for themselves, nor make use of you longer, than (after their own turn is served) they have an op∣portunity and power to crush and destroy you; which as is cre∣dibly reported, an eminent one amongst them, not long since affirmed in effect to his Friend. Providence hath brought it so to pass, that you have now the scale of your future fortunes in your own hands; be wary how you poize them, and look circumspectly to the weight in each scale; and take heed you make not the dross weigh down the gold. It is now undoubtedly in your power to settle firmly and lastingly the peace and quiet of this so long miserably torn and wasted Nation, and that in all probability, without the least drop of blood: A piece of Honour and Christianity, which hitherto hath not been vouchsafed so cleerly to any person or power whatsoever, since our fatal and unhappy struglings: Loose not this your happy and glorious opportunity, (as divers others have done theirs, and perished) least any glimpse thereof never dawn more to you: The cure is so easie (done with a word or two, A Free Parliament) and so natural for the malady and distemper; that surely it would be the greatest of all ty∣rannical cruelties, to suffer a longer perseverance in denying so certain a remedy for such a sore and desperate evil; you have potent Arguments Sir, and such only they are, which the grand Opposers and our tormentors have used themselves to be con∣vinced by: Oh look upon, and more than seriously consider the rufull and deplorable condition which your poor Mother Nation, without this your intercession, will most unavoidably and desperately be involved in. Think upon her, and her Chur∣ches former and ineffable sufferings; and let her not be denied this one boon so necessary to preserve her from final and utter destruction; she (as it were upon her bare and bended knees) begs this from you, her own Son; and that it may be speedy and
effectual, not hampred and shackled with (we know not what) absurd and empty previous Votes, made by a handfull of incon∣siderate and corrupt interessed men, to the infamy, stain, and dishonour of those grave, high and honorable Assemblies, but free and absolute, without any dread, force, restriction, or aw upon it, which really and indeed destroyes its very essence, and renders it a meer slavish, captived Conventicle, and no true En∣glish Parliament: By which, and no other way or remedy under Heaven, she can hope to obtain any effectual and successful cure; agd which by your means procured for her, shall immortalize your fame and renown, not only through these Nations, but through the whole Christian world, and merit Trophees of ho∣nour to be erected to you; and your Name and Posterity by all sorts and degrees of men, be justly magnified and exalted, so that no length of time shall defeat its just merit, but the same remain upon record to all succeeding generations. But yet after all these hopes, and expectations of your gene∣rous integrity, if you shall, by what allurements whatsoever, be warped and wrested from this undoubted true interest of your own and your Mother Countrey, and shall comply with that rotten Rump, and Bob-tail of a Parliament, the most base and unworthy for all sinister and corrupt interest and faction that ever entred the wals of any of our English high Assemblies; in so much that never any crew of men, since this Island was first peopled, how vile and bad soever, incurred more than they, such odium, scorn and contempt from all sorts and degrees of per∣sons, from the highest to the lowest, throughout the whole Na∣tion, which may be easily heard and seen, not only in the open streets chanted out in Rithmes and Sonnets, but upon the wals of almost every Ale-house and Tipling-hutch; yet if such be the power of their Rhetorique to perswade, and your faculty to be∣lieve and comply, then look to your station, and the Reed you choose to lean on, for you will assuredly finde your ground very slippery; and your seeming support, though weak in it self, yet piercing your hands; and although perhaps you may seem to flourish a while, and swallow down great hopes, yet be assured they will never come to good digestion, but must up again: The incensed Nation, though dejected for a time, will again rouze themselves, and never forget the delusion, cheat, and indeed no other than an absolute Tre-pan put upon them, by which so
many of them have incurred some hazard and danger, and all from the good hopes they had of your prndence and integrity, and your loyalty and good intentions to the true National inte∣rest, which you seemed so much to professe, and plainly asser∣ted the same in your Answer to the City of London's Letter, tel∣ling them, that you concurred with them in their Declaration, which in expresse words was for the obtaining of a Free Parlia∣ment; nor can your Mermidons help you at the long run nei∣ther; but you and your posterity will finde your name and me∣mory noysomly stink in the nostrils of all good and sober men; and your Exit (at least of honour) in all probability become more speedy than tis possible you now deny or imagine, and that in the most abject and contemptible kinde of all others your fellow-destroyers and Ruiners of three famous and potent Kingdoms; nor will that be the worst neither. There is an ac∣count likewise to be given (a very deadful one) at that impartial bar of the great and general Tribunal, where no martial force, pomp or pollicy, will at all be prevalent; and where perhaps this very paper, (if slighted by you) may add something to your astonishment and confusion. But we yet hope better things from your Excellency, and such as shall be worthy your self, as you are a Christian, a Gen∣tleman, and an Englishman, and one so eminent, whose lot it is, to be furnished with that power in such a conjuncture of time as this, that if you please but to pronounce the desired word only, all our miseries end, and our chains immediately fall off, which otherwise may be somewhat lasting, upon us; yet such is our hope and confidence in the great Disposer of all things, that we dare in faith and sincerity use the words of Mordecai con∣cerning Gods people, recorded by the Holy Ghost, Esther 4.14. Deliverance shall arise from another place, and thou and thy Fathers House shall be destroyed, and who knows whether thou art come to this honour for such a time as this? &c. But we retire, stand still, and expect, &c. FINIS.
