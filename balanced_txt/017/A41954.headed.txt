Great YORK and Albany: OR THE Loyal Welcom to His ROYAL HIGHNESS on His Return from SCOTLAND. To the Tune of, Hey Boys up go We. Now now the Zealots all must droop, the Synagogues shall down, and Truth and Loyalty get up, The Pillars of the Throne, The Whigs, (who Loyalty forsook,) shall with one Voice agree, To welcome home the Mighty Duke of YORK and ALBANY. [2] Behold with what a Glorious Train Of Noble Lords and Peers, Great York is Guarded o're the Main, In spight of all our Fears; Our Groundless Doubts, and Jealousies Of Popish Slavery. For who can keep the Crowd in Peace, But York and Albany? [3] The wandring Dove that was sent forth To find some Landing near, When Englands Ark was tost on Floods Of Jealousie and Fear; Returns with Olive-branch of Joy, To set the Nation free From Whiggish Rage, that wou'd destroy Great York and Albany. [4] And now He is return'd in Peace, With all His Pompous Train, Whom Heav'n protected o'r the Seas, 'To Bless this Land again; Let Us with Thankful Hearts comply, And Joyful Harmony; For Scotlands Hope, and Englands Joy, Is York and Albany. [5] Let Bumpers flow, and Bonfires blaze, And every Steeple Ring, To set forth Royal Jemmy's Praise, The Brother of our King, Let Trumpets found, and Canons roar, All with one voice agree, Since Heav'n again has brought ashoar Great York and Albany. [6] These solemn Rights they freely gave To ev'ry Factiuns Brother; Who thought the Nation to Enslave, And Ruine one another: To M and each Factious Lord; To O and S But thought it Treason to afford To York and Albany. [7] Now be confounded, all you Tribe Of Ignoramus sway; Who by Malicious Plots contriv'd To drive her Heir away, (As you did once before to France) An Exile o'r the Sea; Who to your grief did home advance Great York and Alban. [8] And may he, with the Joys He wed, Together flourish still; And live to crush the Serpents Head, Whose Sting did pierce his Heel; Till Rebels tremble at his Name, And all the Land agree, The Just Succession to Proclaim Of York and Albany.
