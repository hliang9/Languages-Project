¶A comparyson bytwene .iiij. byrdes / the Larke / the Nyghtyngale / ye Thrusshe & the Cucko / for theyr syngynge who shuld be chauntoure of the quere.
¶How a sorowful mā went to the wood and there toke comforte by ye melody & comparyson of thes byrdes. FAmētyng my sorowes wt syghes depe How lowryng fortune me had scorned Pensyue in my harte dreryly dyd wepe Whos scoffe perfyt anone I lerned Rare is the welth yt hath not morned Iocunde / plesaunt and of corage O sorowful howre in his outrage As whyle markyng in cyrcle rotyng Famous men callyng to my remembrance That rued pytyful in to dotyng To meane men also showyng his varyaunce Lyke the ayre than founde I hym of constance Now smylyth fayre and sodenly doth rage Mam rockyng in the flode of sharpe passage This dyd I secretly with me reason Of hym anon hauyng aduertysment To clyme not to hye for fere of euersyon Aboue my state to make no interment Of comparyson ospryngyth torment Which of me patiently pondered In me the matter lay / that he scorned O low byrth / why woldyst thou auaunce Whan in thy purse lay al thy corage In proudly port to make repastaunce My welth vanyshed in redy passage Thus turned my state in to dotage
Fortune than why shuld I now accuse Seyng he ragyth of my mys vse Proude nor portly be thou neuer Comparyng / bosting nor of wylfulnese To gyue reuerence the endeuer Recounter thy blode to be of mekenese Of thy homage reason no secretnese For whan lowe blode clymith ouer hye He tumblyth oft hedlyng in vylonye Let the cartar than handel his plough The smyth his hammar dylygent entrete Thy mynd insatyat content with ynoug Peres lyke of blod together wel met Of nature prudently pondar thy fet Seldom buddyte from the cartars grosse brest Polycy / cheualry and maners honest This repetyng / in my mynd oft reuolued Of presumptyon I dyd me repent And that comparyson me not behoued To late bewaylyng tyme mysspent Sorowe to doble a folyshe entent Therfore purposyng for my comfort To a place of plesure me to resort I drewe to the wood freysh enpareled With flowrs smylyng plesauntly With bewtyful colours enpurpuled With swete odor ryght sauory A medycen apt for syke memory
And ny to a baythorne I approched Entendyng to take rest there me choched A busshe of plesure perlese in the wood Fragraunt / vernaunt / bewtyful in coloure The blossoms iucunde / in vertu lyke good Facyng the Lyly in whytly candoure Al swete flowrs dysclosyd theyr odor The goddes there to solace than I iugged Such comly flowrs on euery boufe budded A fayre founten was there at hande A freyshe spring / clere as any Crystal That sofely tryllyd on the sande The which moysted the flowrs vernaunt all The Lybanot and Lyly of conwall With a pure sauoure that there remayned As Pallas / or Uenus there had bathed The ayre murmured of theyr presence As after assemble remaynith monument Of great powrs in fet of magnyfycence Which reuyued my mynde wt sorowe ny spent Reioysed streight / vnburdened of torment And as fre myndes pursuyth oft slepe So soft and gentyl on me dyd it crepe But not long after as I ny slombered Of tewnable cordes I harde melody Oft recountering that my rest combered A noyse far passyng in armony
In cordes and raches of consony Thet none I iuge but wold it desyre Except the ayshe vnapt to the lyre O my spyryttes so it refreyshed My body trymbelyd in reioysyng That ny my sorowe away it wayshed And fully awake from my slombering To it gaue than dyligent heryng My eye rollyd swyft here and there To be fed as wel as was the ere Than gentyl touches I recorded In welth whyle fortune dyd fauor But to farmownt I remembered A fayned melody lost in labor Proue who lyst nothyng lyke sauor For there is lernyng of reuenyence But I lerned here the notes of prudence Mannys state was there descrybed Among the fowles of the ayre Man promptly there myght haue lerned Elegaunt to garnyshe nature fayre My sorowe where at dyd appayre For comparysons I dyd combynde Mekly assuagyng in theyr kynde Of foules there certayne dyd assymble To proue theyr voyces in counteryng Arrogaunt began / but endyd humble To syng most plesaunt was theyr stryuing In swete armony and also reasonyng
Betwyx the nyghtyngale and the thrusshe The larke and the cocko in that busshe Among them began a natural stryfe Of melody who coude best endyte Theyr tewnes ware redy and outraunce ryfe To tedyous ware it to resyte Comparysons made in theyr delyte With reasons strong there lackyd none That they renderyd one after one ¶The descryptyō of ye nyghtyngale. The nyghtyngale made heuynly noyse Redobelyng her tewnes melodyously Man beryed in sorowe it wold reioyse Swete / plesaunt in consent / in corde redy The ere fedyth no sownde more freyshly That yf al melody ware truly loste To be found in her / perelese she myght boste Ful meryly in tyme it recorded Swete / swete / iug / iug ryght meruelus And in another key streyght reported In manyfold notes lyke wonderus To be taught in Paradyse / I iuged thus Or had some lectorne of Melpomene Which of armony hath the dygnyte But of the ere thus fed not suffysed My eye I cast on that mery orgon Of whos syght anon was amased So lytel a byrde to muse that lesson
So audyble / so tewnable in good facyon From the lytel body than I remembred That famous vertu oft hath burgened Hystoryes calling to my rembraunce In the lytel body that vertu hydyth The grosse body a yocke to be of combraunce Of educatyon / such robustnesse rysith Demynishmēt of stature in vertu smilyth Pregnaunt in wyt / lusty in corage In goodnese prompt / in counsel ryght sage The sume of vertu there enharboryng To al thynges apte that be of fame The greattest conquest left in wrytting To a lytel body that honor came Before Alexandar who berith the name Cesar in stature properd / fete and small Whos polycy tryumph had ouer all Which Corylane morned in lost of victory The grosse body turning in occasyon Also Sertorius hym saued by polycy The tayle of the horse lesyng by reason Sonar than strenght by good conclusyon The batel of wyt this prouyd spetyal Where strenght & lymmes seruyd not natural Moch feble deceyt raignyth in strenghth Hartes popyd in corage without aduysement For lake of wysdome fowndering at lenght And so most comyn we haue it in experyment In a lytel body lernyng hath enclosement
Freshe subtyl and redy of outteraunce Facunde / elegaunt and of remembraunce The seneuey sede who lystyth to beholde In vertu all other that doth excell Exhausten of nature gyftes manyfolde Powned the fragraunter I you tell Busshyth in veruaunce thoughe not mychel So thys lytel byrde her notes endyted Of no great fowle so wel there recorded Of the Larkys melody But not far of the Larke dyd appere Composyng her pennes arrogauntly Which to that busshe approched sone nere Fayre penned redy proferyng to fly Which as in worthy cheke for cheualry Ny to that busshe streyght toke her flyght Mowntyng meruelus agaynst the lyght And euer as she dyd than assende Lyke knyght in campe for vyctory Her notes she swetely dyd amende Exaltynge her voyce merely The trebyl tewne song than freshly The Nyghtyngale no bettar in report Such swete armony she made of comfort I behelde that byrde of strange nature The clowdes welny her inclosed
In the element redounded her voyce pure The heuyn to penetrat I supposed The heuynly melody she dysclosed At heuyn gates I iuge she dyd get The reches at plesure that she dyd fet Of orbes rotyng she lerned armony Enforsed by powre of the fyrst mouyng Enstructed of nature lawde god almyghty The Egle thowghe strangly be in mowntyng yet of it sure hath not lyke outteryng Recordyng at plesure / deuydyng wonderus Nothyng so swete Syrene the dangerus Anone after she dyd descende By lytel and lytel lyke a byrde of pryce With note that euer dyd amende Redy in wynges swyft / mowntyng at a tryce Of the vernaunt lawre worthy in my aduyce Which in the grotton anone lyghted Faryng as she there wold haue rested But quykly lyke a byrde of bewte To the fayre haythorne toke her flyght As after worthynesse showed of dewte Wolde make clame there to some dewe ryght And among the blossomes dyd lyght Lyke an heyre to take possessyon Clamyd of ryght for her swet lesson Of the thrusshe
Which the thrusshe dylygent marked That her ere fast layd to that melody Lyke a byrde greuyd anone carped Expressyng sone her fast memory As nothyng had scaped of that armony She whysteled and also chypped And from bowghe to bowghe there trypped Sone after that byrde so semble and fayre Her chere changyd of greuyd cowntenaunce To the hyest branche leppyng of the bryar And her gyft of nature prowdly dyd avaunce Showyng of muses her redy owtterance Nothyng was truly to her than strange In cordes at plesure she dyd range The nyghtyngale she dyd cownterfet Lyke abyrde that wolde the hole reply For no dysdayne she dyd than let Ful of corage syngyng ryght freshly The larkys note she dyd descry The starle / the keyt she pertly dyd mocke Robynredbrest the wren and the Pecocke Such borowed descaunt she song freshly And of her owne she spared no bost Now swete / now sharpe and scornfully Avaunsyng as the other had lost Or none such to be in that same cost And so on the bryar syttyng a hy Proyned her fayre fethers by and by
¶The melody of the Cocko. Which father cocko sone espyed Ful sagely restyng not far off That to confownde hym self emplyed He noddyd with the hed as a man wold coff Apperyng lyke one hauyng no vse therof And at the last it out dyd brast A sad song and a formal blast Great grauyte therin pretendyng Tewnes syngyng of solempnyte Playne was it witout ruffelyng Crachettis nor quauerettis cured she That esyly iuged it myght be By some subtyl reason wold make clame And not by note to encrese her name Lyke as we rede vertu hath oft spyred From body not elegaunt of composyng In membres deforme or in tonge lypped Esope was not al venust in shapyng Demosthenes of nature was suttyng yet reason pregnaunt in the one rayngned Dylygence in thother eloquence procured So plesaūt cowntenaunce oft hath be occasyō In vyce or troble that some ware trapped Moch bewty shone in the face of Absolon His bewtyful heere in vyce hym lapped Putyfers spouse fayre Ioseph clapped
In pryson for his fayre cowntenaunce Because with her he made not dalyaunce So rudy chekes haue often dysseued Crokyd lymmes be of louely mekenese Esyly gotten oft tymes hath greued Elabored thyng is of more suernese That lake bewty be of prompt redynese To garnyshe nature with pregnaunt reson In the cowcko prouyd by conclusyon So from the cothows oft hath floryshed Prynces redoubded of valeaunt pusaunce By vertu and vyctory that it purchased Actes declaryng of worthy remembraunce Gydyng theyr people by noble gouernaunce Which conquered to landes great royalte Where vyce spoyled them of auctoryte So from the thorne buddyth the rose In bowghe and branch not lyke apperyng ye in sauour his nature doth lose Rubycunde fayre of plesaunt smylyng Whyte / sprynkeled of semble colouryng Lyke in the blake botel lyquor hydyth Swete / freysh / fragraunt that mā confortyth So thys sory byrde in notes ryght playne Not in pennes arrogaunt composed Of the lawre made profer to be fayne But that she note no bettar expressed To reason she wold styke I than iuged
In an oke not far of restyng As wold fle with her hed noddyng Streyght from her perch she toke her flyght Entendyng there to make comparyson And in that bussh boldly dyd lyght Where they chypped and chaunted a ceson But not long after they began to reason The chantors offyce who shuld haue So they compared them selfe to saue ¶The reason of the nyghtyngale. The nyghtyngale sayd she was worthy In whom the key of musyke dyd rest All hole her self fayned melody Nothyng delyueryng from her brest But descaunt it was of the purest Another bost than made of comparement A swete qualite to her only lent Whan Lucyfers bemes be beryed bryght Than at rest syt you all lurkyng Many sad hartes than make I lyght The corde of trewe musyke reportyng So Pheba I please with my chantyng And yet on the day I seldom delay Utteryng my notes with sport and play The kocke refreysheth many a man In the nyght from dull and duskyd slōberyng Prowdly crowyng now and than But that ne pausyng suckeryth lamentyng
Of more lawde is worthy after reasonyng Wherfore most apte am I for this offyce A byrde perelese of pryke and pryce The subtyl set of good inuentyng In cordes and tewnes that plesaunt be With coraged brest of clene delyueryng Seyng the grounde with reportes of bewte Bettar than his boke is of auctoryte Such cordes be in me / such tewne is kepte As the lady of musyke in me had slepte Another argument of ryght tytell Most men of me take theyr repast To fede theyr ere delectable well Wherby to me such loue haue cast Sayeng my tewnes that all haue past What nedyth me than to make reclame Of that in possessyon that is my name ¶The larkys reason Me semyth (quod the larke) ye do dote Imprudently your self to avaunce That wyll compare must haue no blotte I fynde in you a thyng of combraunce That sone assuage shall your dalyaunce Lyke as the Pecoke in penues dysdaynyth But fowle legges his corage assuagyth So doth many one promote his parson With crafty colours of aduauncement All that furtheryng is good reason The bowe indyfferent is not bent
To touch the but lokyng for punyshment Of whom the prouerbe shal not dye A man fawtlese / but / but doth denye Many commodytes ye do propone Of notes / dytes and armony By your selfe as ye ware perles alone But to me it semyth a pange sory That lokyth on vertu and not foly Them in a bundel wysdom doth combynde Which sone assuagyth the arrogaunt mynde your notes I besech where do become Whan Baron Ianus bloyth his blast you lurke in a corner than very dome your voyce slomberyth / your pennes do wast That after your syght than no man hath hast Is not thys a byrde lyke to make comparysō? In a pange of fortune whystelyng his lesson? yet nere by nature may I approche Thys offyce vpon me to take No sharpe / hore frost makyth me to choch Nor fethers for it do asslake But in the grotton myrth do make And somtyme for my plesure merely My armony sone wyl exalte an hye With an other gyfte that surmowntyth all Not erth only in me doth delyt But also the aungels ethere al
Where I lerne so puerly to endyte And ful wel do I theyr grace requyte In theyr swete dewe there bath I oft With plesaunt armony mowntyng a loft I rendar kyndly that they me lent Benefyttes geuyn in me do not spyl My nowne person doth it present With prompt seruys and voyce subtyl Which is famous after my skyl In an other freysh to behold playne That with study dyscussyd his brayne This leftyd swetly in the ayre Of armony only here not the lesson But I contemplat the woddes fayre The flowrs / the odors haue assentyon Wherof I haue great delectatyon I behold wel the place of amenyte Paradyse in erth / most worthy of dygnyte ¶The reason of the thrushe. Whom the thrush coude no lengar forbere Supposyng to speke al to late As no laude had be lefte for here there And for the offyce began to chat Euyn in the bussh there as she sat With formal reason of eloquence As of Pallas had some influence

Cesar is landed for fast memory Of no man resyted / that euer red swyftar Pennyng his mynde in quycknes as redy Of foure quaterns he was compylar Of epystels at ons no man bettar Pycus de Myrandula not longe agon Thrughe fast memory felowe had non Now marke ye dylygent my entent The flowre of study of me expressyd To dylygent pregnaunce comyn is lent yf in no trechery the mynde be duskyd In slewth and dyscord be not there luskyd Apt to honor is that elegaunt parson Which as in me lyke / in none hath perfectyon This auaunsyd she in that natural hous Coyshe with her cowntenaunce vnderpopyng Fayre mayled and a properd smale dows With scornful syght rollyng on them lokyng That bone ī theyr throte thought to be chokīg But sone after bespake her make Her arrogaunt bost to aslake ¶The cocko. Soth sayth the cocko it is that ye say Sen in many but expert in very fewe your brest vtteryth sport and play With Meduseus as ye dyd renewe Or in the font of the hors lappyd the dwe
Moch your comparyson greater your bostyng As all the muses had in you reclosyng To the hole perlese ye make reclame A hole sume with a grosse gappe A false tytel and forged fame A vayne bost that the wynde doth flappe A fayre byldyng wyl stand parhappe Insculped / enbosted and paynted venustly For lake of fundatyon fallyth quycly So your reasons apperyng strong Lykely / but false I can proue What is descaunt with out playnsong With reportes of plesure as ye loue In the meane or swetely to syng aboue yf the playnsong swarue from the boke A none your descaunt wyl stande a croke To me it longyth to syng the plansong And you on me to syng descaunt I wys Now on mynom tyme and now two long Together shal we syng swetely this Most fyt for me than this offyce is And seldome ye se it in experyence But the quere rulyth the basys dylyence After the which prudent and formal reason To the cocko dyd they al assent Geuyng hym that offyce of promotyon And ech with other ware wel content Kyt in trewe loue sone after ware bent
To repete theyr notes of melody A swete song to make of armony The cocko began than redely to syng A fayre key takyng of meane tyme The dyapason now and than touchyng The larke in her voyce anon dyd clyme The nyghtyngale reportyd hym A standyng tenor song the thrussh Ioyned in felysshyp in that bussh Theyr voyces in the wood dyd redownde All instrumentes in plesure excellyng Far bettar theyr eccho was in sownde A fayrar lectorn they rede of syngyng Than dyd the hamors of Tubals techyng Or Pyctagoras that was so tedyus Knyt in a sume myght se it compendyus It was not frompelyd nor yet iombelyd Nor fayned voyces but of nature pure Not hob for gyb out rayshly tumbelyd Lyke blynd bayar that nothyng doth cure Lytel in the grounde / in the boke assure Which not syngyth but scuyth al raysh That with his fryse from the cord doth laysh Than perseuyd I good apperyng symple Of many coniectured folyshnese In the wooddes to lyue forsoke the cyte Renownsyng al pompe of wantonnese Dwellyd in the cothowse of wyldernese
