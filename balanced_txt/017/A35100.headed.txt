PAX QVAERITVR BELLO VS DEI GRA ◆ REIPVB ◆ ANGLIAE ◆ SCOTIAE ◆ ET HIBERNIAE, &c PR seal of the Commonwealth OLIVER Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and the Dominions and Territories thereto belonging, To all Parsons, Ministers, Lecturers, Vicars, and Curates; and also to all our Justices of the Peace, Majors, Sheriffs, Bailiffs, Constables, Church-wardens, Collectors for the Poor, and Head-boroughs; and to all other Officers, Ministers, and People whatsoever, as well within Liberties as without, to whom these presents shall come, Greeting. WHereas the Minister and Inhabitants of the Parish of South-Okenden in our County of Essex, have made their humble Peti∣tion to us, setting forth, That by a sudden and fearful Fire occasioned by Lightning on the One and twentieth day of June, in the year of our Lord One thousand six hundred fifty and two, the Spire of the Steeple of the Parish Church of South-Okenden aforesaid was fired, the Bells and Leads thereof totally melted, and the Church consumed to Ashes, the Chancel thereof onely excepted, which is thereby also much defaced, and that the repairs of the premisses will amount to Two thousand and two hundred pounds at the least: All which was made to appear to our Justices of the Peace for the said County, at our General Sessions of the Peace for the said County, held the Fourteenth day of July last by sufficient Testi∣mony, as by a Certificate thereof from our said Justices of the Peace, unto the said Petition annexed, doth fully appear. Which said sum is so vaste and great, as that the said Inhabitants of the said Parish are no way able to expend and discharge without the Aid, Assistance, and Charity of well-disposed persons, as by the said Certificate of our said Justices we are informed and assured. And forasmuch as the said Parishioners ever since the consuming of the said Church have been destitute of a fit and con∣venient place to meet in by way of a Publick Assembly, for the Worship and Service of God, and for the good of their Souls, in their attendance on Gods holy Ordinances, and in sanctifying of the Lords days: For which Heavenly purposes that the Publick Meetings of the said Parishioners may no longer be obstructed, but be effectually revived, promoted, and furthered, because our gracious God hath in his holy Word declared, That his love is in a more especial manner towards the Publick Assemblies of his People, then to their private Devotions: For therein it is recorded, That the Lord loveth the Gates of Sion more then all the dwellings of Jacob. We seriously considering the premisses, have there∣fore willingly condiscended unto the humble request of the said Minister and Parishioners by them made unto us, That we would be graciously pleased to grant unto them our Letters Patents, whereby they may be enabled to collect the Charities and Benevolence of well-disposed people; we being likewise well assured, That all good people will be zealously affected towards the advancing of this so pious a work, and readily extend their helping hands thereunto by their liberal contributions in that behalf. Know ye therefore, That we of our Christian zeal and compassion have given and granted, and by these our Letters Patents under our great Seal of Eng∣land, we do give and grant unto the said Minister and Inhabitants of the said Parish of South-Okenden aforesaid, and to their Deputy and Deputies, the Bearer or Bearers hereof, full Power, Licence, and Authority, to ask, gather, receive, and take the Alms and Charitable Benevolence of all good and well-disposed people inhabiting within our several Cities of London and Westminster, and within our Counties of Middlesex, Essex, and Suffolk, and in all Corporate Towns, Villages, and other places within our said Counties, and not elswhere, for and towards the rebuilding of the said Church. Wherefore we will and command you and every of you, That at such time and times as the said Minister and Inhabitants before mentioned, their Deputy or Deputies, the Bearer or Bearers hereof, shall come and repair to any of your Churches, Chappels, or other places, to ask and receive the Gratuities and Charitable Benevolence of good and Charitable Christians, quietly to permit and suffer them so to do, without any manner of your lets or contradictions. And you the said Parsons, Ministers, Lecturers, Vicars, and Curates, for the better stirring up of Charitable Devotions, deliberately to publish and declare the Tenor of these our Letters Patents, or the true Copy or Brief hereof unto the People upon the Lords day next, after the same shall be tendred unto you; Exhorting, perswading, and stirring them up to extend their liberal Contributions towards the said pious work. And you the Church-wardens of every Parish and Collectors for the Poor, where such Collection is to be made as aforesaid, together with two other honest active men there (nominated by the Minister and your selves) are hereby willed and required to collect and gather the Alms and Charitable Benevolence of the said Charitable and well-disposed People, not onely Housholders, but also Strangers, Servants, and others. And if you finde it more expedient for an effectual advancement of this pious work, you are hereby required to go from house to house in your respective Parishes upon the Week days to gather the Alms of the said good people: And what shall be by you so gathered in the said Parishes or places, the same is to be by the Minister and your selves endorsed on the backside of these our Letters Patents, or the true Copy or Brief hereof in words at length: Which Endorsement is to be subscribed with the hands of you the said Ministers, Church-wardens, and such in each Parish and place as have assisted you in such Collection, and also to be Registred in the Books of your respective Parishes: And the sum and sums of money so gathered and endorsed to deliver to the Bearer or Bearers of these our Letters Patents, warranted and allowed to receive the same, and to no other person or persons, when as thereunto you shall be by them required; whose receiving thereof with their Acquittance or Acquittances shall be your sufficient discharge. And lastly, For the more assurance of faithful and equal dealing, in the Receipt, Account, and Distribution of the Moneys hereby to be collected, our will and pleasure is, That no man shall be employed to collect any of the Moneys by vertue of these our Letters Patents, but such as shall be appointed there∣unto by deputation under the Hands and Seals of the said Minister, and of the Church-wardens of the said Parish of South-Okenden aforesaid, for the time being. And that the Moneys collected and raised by virtue hereof, shall be by them or by their appointment disposed to the use intended, for the rebuilding of the said Church: And they in like manner to appoint in whose hands the Moneys so collected, shall be kept until the same shall be distributed for the said work according to the true intent and meaning of our Christian will and pleasure herein declared, Any Statute, Law, Ordinance, or Provision heretofore made to the contrary in any wise notwithstanding. In witness whereof we have caused these our Letters to be made Patents to continue for the space of one whole year next after the date hereof to endure
