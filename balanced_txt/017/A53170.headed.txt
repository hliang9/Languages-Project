Observations on the Proposals of the CITY, to Insure Houses in case of FIRE. WHEN Right is Invaded, all manner of Defence is lawful; Therefore, since the City of LONDON endeavour to Set Up the Insuring of Houses from Fire, by the Invention of Other Persons, it is reasonable to expect, that they who were Authors of the Designe, and are thereby Injured, will not forbear, to Publish those Truths which may Lessen their Adversary, and be useful to Preserve their Right, though by so doing, they should seem to Re∣flect on the Justice, Wisdom, or Credit of the City of LONDON. For, that the Gentlemen of the Insurance Office on the Backside of the Royal Exchange, were the First Inventors of this Designe, must be Granted by All; because, the City would have otherwise Accepted that fair Proposal that was at first made to the Right Honourable the LORD MAYOR, &c. viz. To Refer it to Council, to determine this Original Right: And if it did appear [by any of the City-Journals] that they had formerly resolved the same war of Effecting this Design, or could adde any New Thoughts that improved it, other than Lessening the , or Prolonging the Terms of Insurance, which are no Essential differences, nor may perhaps be a  vantage to the Insured; The Gentlemen of the Insurance Office did Promise, to desist from Insuring  City and Liberties. And though it may be true, that about the Year, 1670. Proposals were made to the City about Insuring Houses from Fire, upon which a Committee was Chosen to Examine them; yet they were extreamly different from this Design, and so Impracticable in themselves, that they were forced to lay them Aside: And it is more than probable, that the City could never have Settled this Affair, had they not taken the Pattern from the Insurance Office, since Ten Years have been spent without making the least Progress in it. Now, since the Undertaking of the City to Insure Houses, is but a Copy of Anothers Inven∣tion, the best way to Discredit it, and shew its Imperfections, will be to Compare it with the Original. The Method that was at first used to Settle the Insurance Office on the Backside of the Royal-Exchange, was thus, viz. Propositions for Insuring Houses were Published; wherein were set forth, the Premium, or Rates of Insurance; the several Terms of Years; the Security of Ground-Rents, and manner of Settle∣ment on Trus. And that General Satisfaction might be given, several dayes, upon Publick No∣tice, were Apointed for those that had Thoughts of Insuring, to Meet at the Office, to Object and Debate hat might be Advantagious or Disadvantagious to the Design; and according to the Result of ose Debates, this Affair was Setled by Counsel chosen by those that Subscribed to Insure. This xample the City would seem to Follow: Some things they have Imitated not now Ney, others Necessary they have Omitted: Some things they have Altered, which has much priced their Designe. All which may be observed from these Four Particulars in their Printed Paper, viz. I. Taking Subscriptions. II. The Rates of Insurance. III. The Terms of Years. IV. Their going at last to Council, to know whether they can Settle. AS to the First, [Their taking Subscriptions] There can be no occasion now; unless not under∣standing the Reasons of the Design, they are careful to make a True Copy: For though the First Inventors did take Subscriptions, because the Design being altogether New, they could no other∣ways discover, whether their Propositions were Approved of, but by the Readiness of several Gentle∣men to Subscribe. Yet since this Affair is Setled, and gives General Satisfaction, there is no occa∣sion of Subscriptions: For if the City can in all respects follow This Pattern, they have reason to expect the Same Success. But it not, Why should men Subscribe to their Disadvantage? Espe∣cially when their Houses are not Insured by Subscribing; and it may probably be so Long, if ever, before the CITY Settle their Fund, that their Houses may be Burnt before they are Insured. Moreover, they may Insure at the Office already Settled, and be Released, when they find the CITY have made Better Provision for them. Therefore, there can be no Occasion of Subscripti∣ons, unless those Gentlemen of the Committee, that drive this Designe, believe they may easier engage men to Subscribe, than to Pay their Money; and by perswading the Court of Alder men, the Common-Council, the Officers, and other Persons who have their Dependency on the City to Subscribe; may, by their Number and Quality of Subscribers, gain a Reputation to their Designe, which may serve as an Encouragement to many not thinking persons, and supply the
Defects of their Settlement; and may seem a more effectual way than any Answer that can be riven to the Paper Entituled, An Enquiry, whether it is the Interest of the CITY to Insure Houses rom Fire? Though this way will be a kind of force, and therefore not lasting. THe Second Observation Is, on the Rates or Premium of Insurance, which is Fourty Eight Shillings per Cent. for Thirty One Years for Brick-Houses, and double the Price for Timber; and so in pro∣ortion for Longer and Shorter Termes. This Rate, is Two Shillings in Fifty Cheaper than that of the nsurance Office, which was probably Valued as a great Contrivance to draw Customers: The ffects of such Practices hath been already Observed in the Paper of Enquiry; which is, That it ust bring Loss to the Undertakers, and at last Ruine the Desgne. So that the Managers of this ffair, seem not so much to regard the Future Consequence, as the most probable means to bring resent Money to the Chamber, and Places to Themselves. But since the Gentlemen of the Insu∣nce Office are under this Force, they are Resolved, rather to Run the Hazard of Losing, than hat the City should make Advantage by their Invention. Therefore, that the Easiness of the Terms may be no Encouragement to Insure with the CITY, hey do Resolve for the Future, to Set their Rates at Fourty Five Shillings and Ten Pence per ent. for Brick Houses for Thirty One Years; which is Five Pence per Pound Rent, for Brick-Houses for a Year, and Double the Rates for Timber; and to Discount by way of Purchase, viz. ive Years paid down for Eight Years Insurance; Seven, for Twelve; Nine and a Half, for wenty-One; And Eleven, for Thirty-One Years. These Rates are Lower than the Cities, and ore agreeable to Practice, than their Table, which is after the Rate of Thirteen Years Purchase for ne and Thirty Years, and near Sixteen Years Purchase for Fifty-One Years: Prices never heard of mong Purchasers. And do Further Declare, That they will Alwayes set their Price Vnder the City, though they do not intend to Alter any more, till they are Certain that the CITY can proceed, and have Settled their Fund. This they think, they can Better Justifie the doing, than the CITY; because their Security is o proportioned to a Number of Houses, that whether the Premium make a Greater or Lesser Sum, t doth not Alter the Security to the Insured: And if they Lose by the Undertaking, it is their Own, and no Injury to Any. But those Citizens that Manage the Revenue of the City, are but Stewards for the rest; and  they (through Rashness and want of Knowledge) Venture the Publick Revenue of the City, on a roject that brings Loss, they prejudice the Whole Body of the Citizens: For if the Revenue of e City be Wasted, then the Charge of the Government must be Supported by Taxes. And it is very probable, that there is no great Over-plus of Revenue belonging to the City, ore than is Necessary to Defray the Charge of the Government, the Trust of the Orphants, nd the Repairs of the publick Places: For if there were, Why is Money borrowed at Interest, hen no visible Improvement is made by it? Or, why were the Fifteens so lately Raised, to Re∣air the publick Works of the City, which ought to be done out of the publick Revenue?  specially since the Citizens in many Years before, had not been so Taxed? THe Third Observation is, on the Terms and Length of Insurance; The Office on the Back∣side the Royal-Exchange, Insures no Longer than for Thirty-One Years; the City Propose to nsure for what Term Desired, and for Ever. This perhaps was thought of as another Strata¦gem to bring in Customers; as if it might Ingage all those that had the Inheritance of Houses and long Terms; and besides, might Raise the Value of the Premiums, and bring a greater Su o the Chamber. They never Considered, That those that First Formed the Design, had probably thought  his; and had it been Convenient and Advantagious, might Practice the same: And therefore nce they have taken this Design on the second Hand, and upon Trust, were very Adventurou  much to Alter from their Pattern, unless they were provided to give Better Reasons for thei  doing, than are to be Expected from them. For, to Insure for Ever, is to Spoil the whole Design; because no Security can be good where all the Profit is at first Received, and the Loss is Uncertain, and Continues for ever; fo he Loss being uncertain, the Security cannot be Proportioned: And where all the Profit is a first Received, there is no Interest obliged to take Care of the Design, so as to Pay a Loss, and Pre∣serve the Fund. So that, when ever the Loss happens greater than the Annual Rent of the Secu∣ity, the Land must be Divided and Torn in Pieces, to Satisfy the Loss: Whereas, when Hou∣ses are Insured for no longer then Thirty-One Years (which is Sufficient to Comply with all Men Occasions) these Terms will Exspire; and the Premium that will Arise from the Reversion, wil gae the Interest of those concerned in the Office, to Raise Moncy to Pay the Losses, and Pre∣rve the Fund intire; tho the Losses were greater than Ten Years Rent of the Fund. And is was one of the great Arguments that was Used at the Setling this Affair, to shew the Ce∣ of the Security, which no otherwise could have given Satisfaction
Therefore, should Men be so Imprudent to Insure their Houses for Ever, this Corporation would have greater occasion for an Act of Restraint, than the Spiritual Corporations heretofore have had for, though the Church and Colledges, by Granting long Leases, prejudiced their Successors they left them the Old Rent: But these Gentlemen of the Committee, will not be so kind t their Successors; for they would not only leave them without Reversions, but Entail a perpetual Charge and Loss upon the Corporation. THe Last Observation is, that They are Resolved, to Settle Lands and Ground-Rents of the Cities. to the Value of One Hundred Thousand Pounds on Trustees, so as to be Easily Recovered, (and yet have not Discovered to the World where they lye) and to attend Counsel, to Know whether they an Settle them. This ought to have been the first Step, to have published a Particular of these states, with the Opinion of Councel; that they are not already Appropriated and Charged sor other Uses: For the Lands of Corporations are generally charged both for Publick and Spe¦cial Uses; such as Repairing of Bridges, Maintaining of Aquaeducts, and Supporting other Pub∣lick Works. Had they followed their Pattern in this Particular, they had prevented several Enquiries. First, How the Lands of the Corporation can be Settled for the Benefit of private Persons, and to pay their Losses, but that they must be still liable to the first Trust? So that whilst the De∣sign brings Profit, the Settlement may seem Good; but when Losses happens, the first Settlement may take Place, to the Defeating of the Latter. Secondly, How can these Lands be Settled upon Trustees, so, as when a Dispute Ariseth, the City must Not be made a Party, since they are more Entrusted for the City, than for any particular Person that shall Sue? It being not usual for the Court of Chancery to bind any person by Decree without being Heard, especially the principal party to the Suite? If so, their Settlement of Ground-Rents, is not so Good as their Seal: For this Settlement, is liable to the same difficulty of Reco∣very, if there be a Dispute, and is not so large a Security: For the Seal might be made to Affect all the Lands of the Corporation, were it not for the Difficulty of Suing  but the Settlement, will be Limited to a Part. Now if the City must be made a Party upon all Suites, they must be Summoned; if they  fuse to Appear; they Forfeit, or lose Issue; which the Party hath no reedy to Recover: And the Party cannot proceed in his Suite, Because the City will not App. So that those Gentle∣men of the Committee were extreamly Led out of the Way, in following the Pattern of a Settle∣ment, thinking to Gain a Reputation by Offering an Hundred Thousand Pounds Security; Where∣as the Revenue of the City, must be Supposed to be Worth more, and the Seal Affects it all▪ For the Objection was not against the Ability of the City, but how to make them Willing or Force them to Pay. This Difficulty in Suing the City, is Real; for if it were not, Those many Persons (whereo some of them have not Bread for their Families) would not have been so long without their Monyes, which they Lent to the Chamber upon Interest, and have Bond under the City Seal for their Payment: And yet some of these Bonds are of so Little Value, as to be Sold for Twelve-Pence in the Pound. Therefore it were more Honourable and Just, for the City to Sell such Lands as they can Dispose of, to Pay those Debts, than to Imploy them to Injure other Men: For til then, How can it be Expected, That the Insured shall have Better Justice, when a great oss happens, than those Persons have had? For, Why may not the City hereafter give out, That this Project was Driven by a Particular Party, then Powerful, that Ingaged these Lands in a Design to their Prejudice, And therefore they have no Reason to pay the Loss? As hath been formerly said to he Creditors that Lent their Money, that a particular Faction of Men (though then the Majority) ent the Money to the Parliament; and therefore they have no Reason to Pay it? Thirdly, Suppose the City can Settle those Lands, so, as to make them Easie to be Recovered, ow can they be Freed from the Incumbrances of these Debts? And bring Easie to Recover, ow shall the Insured be Secure, that Those Creditors will not Seize Them? For some of hem being put in Mind, by the Cities Proposals, that the Lands shall be Settled to Recover Without Trouble, are Resolved to try what they can do to Get their Money: And therefore ve been Advised by Counsel to Sue; If the City refuse to Appear, the Issues must be levyed n the Land; which may be a dispute in Chancery, whether it is not an Incumbrance from notice  in the case of Lands setled for payment of Debts, a Creditor shall charge them, by Filing a Bill it. Chancery; for Lands of Corporation are in the nature of Lands in Trust? If to avoid this Diffi∣lty, the City shall Appear, then why should they not obtain Judgment, and so Seize the Lands? nd as far as they will go, take them to satisfie their Debts? Lastly, What will become of their Settlement, if the City Forfeit their Charter? Whether the ands of the Corporation do not Devolve on the Crown? Who then shall satisfie Losses, and Exti∣h the Fires? By these Observations it may Appear, That the Gentlemen of the Committee did not well Un∣derstand
the Design they were about; for which they are not to be Blamed: For it is not Reasonable to expect, that they should so well (on a suddain) understand a Design, as the In∣ventor of it, who had spent much Time and Study in the Contrivance; no more than they may be supposed to understand Law and Physick, as well as those that have Studied those Sciences. And it is as Reasonable, that the City should have the sole Practice of Law and Physick, with∣in the City and Liberties, because it would be Profitable, as that they should Insure the Hou∣ses within those Limits; and something more Reasonable, because the Profit from Law and Phy∣sick would be more Certain. But however, those Gentlemen that intend to Insure their Houses, may perhaps consider, That by Insuring with the City, they Support the Contest; which though it bring Down the Prices of the Insurance, yet in the End, must Ruine the Designe, and so will Lose that Advantage (which by Encouraging the First Inventors) they might probably expect from it: And that by Insuring, they are not Serviceable to the City; for this Design (as the Committee have Contrived it) may produce some certain Places to themselves, but Uncertain Profit, if not Loss to the City: And be∣sides, by Insuring with the City, they are Instrumental to take away the Right of the First In∣ventors; and as it were Club, to do that which every person (were it his private Concern) would Scorn to do. These are to give Notice, to those Gentlemen that have Insured their Houses, at the Office on the back-side the Royal-Exchange, If they will come to the Office, they shall be Repaid the Over-plus of their Premi∣um, above the Rate of Forty-Five Shillings Ten Pence per Cent. for Brick, and Four Pound Ele∣ven Shillings Eight pence for Timber, for Thirty-One Years. And so in proportion for Lesser Terms, according to the Printed Table; Or, be made Allowance by addition of Term. And if they shall have further Occasion to Alter their Rates, they will make all that have, or shall hereafter Insure, equal Abatement. And they do further give Notice, That they intend to Settle the Ground-Rents of Devonshire Buildings the next Term; And then to make provision for Insuring Chambers in the Inns of Court and Chan∣cery: And have also provided another Parcel of Ground-Rents of Fifteen Hundred Pounds per An∣num at Westminster; which will make the Security to the Value of near Fourscore Thousand Pounds. These they intend to Settle before the Number of Houses (upon this Security) is Compleat; And to give publick Notice somtime before, with the Names of Council that are to settle the Conveyances, that all Persons desirous of Satisfaction in the Title, may resort to them without Fees. The Premium, or Rate of Insurance for Brick-Houses (the same to be reckoned Double for Timber) from One Pound per Annum Rent to an Hundred, for the Term of Thirty-One Years, or Under, which is Five Pence in the Pound-Rent for one Year, and to Discount by way of Purchase; that is, Five Years Paid down for Eight Years Insurance; Seven, for Twelve; Nine and a Half, for Twenty-One; Eleven, for Thirty-One. For every Pound-Rent Insured, Ten Pounds in Money is to be paid as often as the House is Burnt down within the Term Insured. This is Forty-Five Shillings Ten Pence for One Hundred Pounds for Thirty-One Years, which is Under the Cities Proposal, Two Shillings Two Pence per Cent. Pound Rent Insured for 8. Years. Insured for 12. Years. Insured for 21. Years. Insured for 31. Years. Houses Burnt, Money Paid.
