A Letter to the King. LET thy mind Oh King, attend on Reading, Hearing, and Instruction and reject not the Counsel of the Lord spoken to thee by his Servants and Hand-maids, but mind it till thou art truly reformed into the way of Truth and Life of him that brings Salvati∣on near, thorow the Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ; which Gospel is to be Preach∣ed to all Nations before the end come, though it be Foolishness to that Wisdom that stands not in the Power and Demonstration of the Spirit that gives Life and Liberty to the Just; for the world by wisdom knew not God, and it pleased him by his infinite Wisdom thorow the Foolish∣ness of Preaching to save them that Believe; and this is the infinite Wisdom of the invisible wise God, who is incomprehensible and full of Glory; Oh this infinite wise God, that founded all things in Wisdom, and man by his Earthly Knowledge cannot find it out; this is he that hath given unto us a Saviour, him that is the Light to lighten the Gentiles, and to be his Salvation to the ends of the Earth; and all must come to the measure of him in themselves, to the manifesta∣tion of his pure Spirit, which is Truth and Life, that comes to know the depth of the Wisdom of God; the Mystery of this Kingdom stands not in words, but in power, and demonstration of the pure Spirit of Life, which Spirit breaths thorow and helps the infirmity of all that trust to it, and believes in it; and blessed are all they that are joyned to it, for it ever lives to make interces∣sion with sighs and groans that cannot be uttered. So dear Friend, if thou wilt be endowed with pure Wisdom from above, wait in love and so∣berness of mind, to receive the Spirit of Life from God, and that is more than all the World, and will be more comfort to thy soul, than all the Dominions that the Earth can afford; for the first man is but of the Earth Earthly, but the second is the Lord from Heaven, the quickning Spirit, which Spirit if it be received, is it that works the Reformation, for it is grieved with Evil where ever it meets with it, at home or abroad; & so long as Iniquity bears Rule, it suffers, & it interceeds unto God from whence it came: Oh dear Friend, that this were descended into thy lowermost part, that thou mightst feel him rise, and Eternally know the power of his Resurrection, then as∣suredly thou wouldst suffer no Evil to be done in thy Name, nor in thy Nation, and then the fruit of thy Goodness would spring forth, and thy Glory and Renown spread unto the Nations round about thee, and this wholsome Wisdom would be a Crown of Glory to thee, and as a Royal Diamond in the hand of the Lord thou wouldst be found, and thy Name would be had in Ever∣lasting remembrance, with succeeding Generations; which if thou dost not mind the Glory of the Lord, and be tender of the birth Immortal, and relieve the Oppressed; then thy Name will ot, as others that is gone before thee. Oh therefore seek the Glory of God, and the good of his People, that thy Soul may live and be refreshed with his vertue; so with diligence and suffering, wait to know the coming of the just One in thy own particular, the manifestations of his Eternal Spirit, that thou mayst answer his Love, which must be with his own, if ever thou please him, who thou seest rents the King∣dom from men, and overturns, and will overturn till he come to Reign whose Right it is, even them that will fear him, that they may give Glory to his Name. So dear Heart, as the Lords Love hath been large unto you, mind the Wisdom that will an∣swer his dear Goodness unto you; for it was his Love indeed unto you, and great cause you have to remember it, and not to let his Benefits slip out of your mind, lest you forget his Goodness which hath been great unto you; for this I can say, who am the least of many thousands, as in the Mystery and Life of Truth, which reveals the secrets of the Lord, that I saw and felt in the Spirit that reacheth over Sea and Land, your Coming before you came, and my spirit breathed to the Lord for you; and I felt three, and one was a Woman, and that I spoke of then, that my spirit reached forth unto three; and they said you were three Brethren, but I said that one of the three that I felt was a Woman, and still that did abide with me; and now that you are come, my spirit breaths to the Lord, desiring him to subdue that in you, that will not glorifie him, that the Kingdoms may not be rent from you; So mind the fear, and remember how he rent the Kingdoms from Saul because of his Disobedience, and he is the same still, holy and pure, and though he wait to be gracious, yet he will not alwayes strive with man, but he will take to him his great Power, and rend the Kingdom from man, and will overturn, overturn, till he come to Reign whose Right it is, the SON of Equity the KING of Justice; So in Love nd Fear Rule the Nations, that thou mayst be found in the Land of the Living. From a Lover of thy Soul, ANNE CLAYTON.
