❧ By the King. WHereas the Kings Maiestie, for the better reliefe and sustentation of the poorer sort of people within this his Kingdome, in this time of scarcitie and dearth of Corne and Graine, did out of his Princely and gracious disposition, lately cause certaine Orders to bee generally published and sent into all the Counties, Cities, and principall plates of this Realme for the seruing of the Markets from time to time with conuenient quantities of Corne and Graine, whereby the poore might be chiefly prouided for with so much thereof, as should be necessary for them at reasonable rates: And whereas it hath pleased God to giue this yeere greater increase of Barley then of other Graines, which of it selfe, or being mingled with Wheat or Rye, will make good Bread, especially for the poorer sort of people: His Maiestie is giuen to vnder∣stand, that of this great quantitie of Barley (whereof the greatest part ought and might be made into Bread as aforesaid) much is by the infinite multitude of Maultsters, like to bee turned into Mault as hitherto it hath bene, and then againe by common Bruers brued into strong Beere and Ale, which consumes double the Mault that is needfull, and serues not for vse, but for drunkennesse and excesse; Although both by the Lawes now in force, and by the said Orders lately published, there is prouision against these abuses. His Maiestie therefore continuing his Princely care for the preseruation and reliefe of his poore Subiects, And to the ende that the great waste and con∣sumption of Barley in making of Mault may be preuented, and that the poore may haue sufficient store of Barley to make Bread for their sustenance at reasonable prices, in this time of scarcity of Wheat and Rye, Hath therefore thought good, and by this his Proclamation doth straitly charge and command all Justices of Peace, Maiors, Constables, Headboroughes, and other his Officers to whom it apperteineth, That they foorthwith after the publishing of this his Proclamation, doe carefully and diligently cause the Lawes and Statutes of this his Realme, concerning Mault and Maultsters, and concerning the Assize and price of Beere, to bee put in due execution, And by all meanes to diminish the number of Maultsters, and to establish good Orders to such as they shall allow still to Mault for the sparing of Barley, as much as may be, As also to see that com∣mon Bruers, Alehouse keepers, and all others that sell Ale or Beere, make their Beere and Ale not too strong, but of such rate and price, as may occasion least expence of Mault, and whereby they may vtter their Beere at low and reasonable prices, that the poorer sort may haue the greater proportion for their money. And his Maiestie doth likewise straitly charge and command all Maultsters, common Bruers, Alehouse keepers, and such as sell Beere or Ale, to obserue and keepe aswell the Lawes and Sta∣tutes of this Realme in that behalfe made, as his Maiesties said Orders lately published, and all other Orders and directions of the said Iustices of Peace, Maiors, Bayliffes and other Officers hereafter to bee made, according to his Maiesties gratious commandement in this Proclamation conteined. Giuen vnder our hand at Thetford the xij. day of December, in the sixt yeereof our Reigne of great Britaine, France and Ireland. God saue the King. ❧ Imprinted at London by the Deputies of Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Maiestie. Anno 1608.
