I'll make thee be fain to follow me. A NEVV SONG. To its own proper Tune. OF late a Dispute did happen to pass, 'Twixt a lusty Soger and a young Lass, My Honey and Life I Love thee (quoth he) I'll make thee be fain to follow me. 2. To follow thee that's a Soger Dad, All Persons that know me wou'd think me mad; No Battel I ever did covet to see, So cannot be fain to follow thee. 3. My dear never fear the hazard of war, I of my Dear Jewel will take special care And from all dangers will set thee free, If thou wilt consent to follow me. 4. I cannot endure your pitiful Pay We'll never live well on Sixpence a Day; By Nature we're taught to shun Povertie, I'll never be fain to follow thee. 5. What if I'm prefer'd by an Officer's fall. O then you're call'd Madam by great and small; Such things has happened oft-times we do see. I'll make thee be fain to follow me. 6. I fear then you'l lead a prodigal Life, Not value you're weded, and slight your poor Wife, And probably Love some other than me, I'll never be fain to follow thee. 7. No, no, my Dear I'll ever prove true, My Love I will keep entirely for you, A kind loving Husband I vow I will be: Now therefore consent to follow me. 8. Since this you do swear I'll deny you no more. Your Faith and your Honour lies on this score; Upon these Conditions thy Wife I will be: And now I am bound to follow thee.
FINIS.
