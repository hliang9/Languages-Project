The Sheriffs have about 1000 l. per Annum likewise, and about one Fifth in the Share of the Sale of these Offices. And tho' some of these Places have of late been sold for above 2500 l. yet in the Memory of many Citizens now living, no Place or Of∣fice in the City was worth above 100 l. The Sellers of these Places, by conniving at the Buy∣ers Exactions, have found their Account in the next Sale of the Office; so that the Purchase of these Offices are, many of them, above 20 times more than formerly. So that here is a Possibility that a Lord-Mayor may get 20 or 30 Thousand Pounds in the Year of his Mayoralty.
