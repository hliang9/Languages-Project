Isa. 3. 24. GOD, who from the be∣ginning Gen. 6. 7. 19.of the world Syrach. 16. 40.hath punished the un∣godly courses of the children of men, and Isa. 40. 41. 55. 56.destroyed or rooted 1 Malach. .them out from before his face; He is in being still, and will forgive nothing now 2 Tim. 3.to the Devill in his Members, nor yield Rom. 1. 2. 9.ought to the unbelieving and godlesse scoffers and scorners in their presumptu∣ous and unconscionable actions; who Epist. Jud. 2 Pet. 2. 3.shal do pennance in hell, for the destru∣ction Malac. 3.they have practised hitherto in the Psal. 2. 89. 119.world. For God will have a Man yet according to his everlasting Righteous∣nesse, Jer. 9. 23. 30.Act. 17.for the severing of the bad from the Matt. 3. 13.good, him that serveth God, and him
that serveth him not, by whom he hath connived long already to the world, and the children of wickednesse in it, with a Psal. 31. 6. 102, 109, 140, 143.great deal of patience, suffering him∣self to be mocked, scoffed at, buffeted, or Isa. 50. 52. 59. Mich. 3. 4. 7.beaten upon the cheeks for his Names and the truth of his Words sake, yea to be 2 Tim. 4.reviled, slandred, and persecuted. Mat. 5. 7 Those under the second or New-Testament, are not at all allowed accor∣ding Luke. 6.to the Doctrine of Christ, his Di∣sciples and Apostles, to Judge, or a∣venge Matt. 24.themselves upon their enemies, 1 Cor. 4.for the maintenance of their old waies, Mark. 8. 13.Rom. 1.upon the prevailing unrighteousnesse; being, they ought not to love, but to Rom. 12.hate, deny and die unto themselves ac∣cording e Joh. 12.to the sinfull generation, Rom. 6. Dan. 2. 7.8. 1 Cor. 15. 2 Cor. 5. 6. 1 Pet. 2. or to be mortified Col. 3. and to recommend all Luk. 17. 18, 21.Revenge to God, that judgeth righte∣ously. Luk. 9. 12. 14. But how the People of this present and last World, have observed or consi∣dered the Kingdome and Judgement of
Rom. 8. God, in regard of the fundamentall De∣liverance Heb. 3. 10. 12. Isa. 45.of his Elect, or the universall Isa. 9. 7.everlasting Redemption of Israel ac∣cording Isa. 65. 66.to Regeneration, through Hope and Faith in God the living Well, Ierem. 2. 17. 30. That same many shall find and feel in hell, with everlasting shame and sa. 5. 29. 33.  49▪confusion, Daniel 12. According to which it shall be made known and ma∣nifest, how it came that Satan was let Rev. 20.Psal. 9. 19. 52, 68, 94.loose thus far, by the mightie ones; the Murtherers, Ierem. 7. 19▪ and Tyrants, who do hinder the deliverance of Zion, and would have it made altogether Heb. 0.void and of none effect, by their Cain-like, 1 John. 3.fierce, envious, Iam. 3. 4. and impla∣cable 4 Esdr. 15, 16.practice, Mich. 3. For the abun∣dant Isa. 1. 26. 59.nnocent bloud, Ierem. 2. 7 of the Revel. 16. 18.slain, poor and guiltlesse souls, that hath been shed for such a time hitherto, yea, from the beginning, in this bloud-drunken Babel, or murthering City of Ezek. 22. 24.this false Ierusalem, and the destruction Psal. 12. 79.2 Tim. 3.of the poor that were destroyed by the Hos. 4. 10.Heathen or false Christians, for the
maintenance of the hypocrisie and lies, of the disunited, distracted, 1 Tim. 1. 6. and divided Sectarian, 2 Pet. 2. contentious Rom. 16.courses, 2 Tim. 2. of those bold and un∣profitable Tit. 1.Bablers the false Prophets; Matt. 24.That same speaketh yet, although the Heb. 10. 11.men be dead, and shall be judged Mark 13.Jerem. 7. 8. 14▪both here in time, and hereafter in eter∣nitie, upon every one, according as he 1 Thess. 5.doth share in the guilt and cause thereof; Rev. 6. 21. 22For which cause there is no peace at hand for this Cain, in his generation, 1 Joh. 3.who never desired to spare the very Jam. 5.righteous, no nor God himself, in the poor and afflicted hitherto, Psal. 10. 94. 119. Mich. 3. 7. WHere the serious Exhortati∣ons, Warnings, and Threat∣nings Heb. 4. 10.of the Power and Truth of the living Word of God, will Amos 9.not avail nor help at all, there the Sword Isa. 9. 27, 63. 65. 66.of Gods Vengeance, Hezek. 21. 33. His furious wrath, Isa. 13. 30, 31. Death and Ierem. 30. Revel. 6. 19, 20, 22.everlasting hellish Condemnation, must and shall help. Iam. 2.
2 Cor 5. THE Righteous lives not to him∣self, Rom. 14. but of (or by) his Rom. 1. 9. 11.Faith, Habak. 2. Galat. 3. Heb. 10. But the Heathen or false Christians, 1 John 5.Matt. 24. Mark 13. which through vain courses, are so drowned in evill, and so Ephes. 4. 5.blinded in it by the Devill, 2 Cor. 4. that Matt. 10. 11. 12. 18. 24,for matter of Light, in behalf, or consi∣deration of the so long before our eies, continuing things, works or practises, touching the great Distresse and Tribu∣lation, Jsa 9, 27. 44, 50, 56. 59, Hezek▪ 16.Luk 10. 11. 12. 17▪ 21. They have not any thoughts more of Faith or Consci∣ence, no not of humane Reason at all; And are become like Sodom and Gomor∣ra, Luk. 18.Rom. 9. Insomuch, that they had ne∣ver Dan. 2. 7. 12.any desire yet, but once to consider, (or take notice of) the Kingdome and Psal. 14.Judgment of God, about the fundamen∣tall Deliverance of his Elect, according to the Law and Testimony, neither care∣ing Gal. 5. Jerem. 7.for God in Heaven any more, nor re∣garding their Neighbour in the world Jam. 3. 4, 5.here, according to the same; yea, through their Murtherous and envious
Practises, not sparing the very Righteous Mal. 3. 4.2 Pet. 2. 3.among themselves, Psal. 10. 94. These, Luk. 10.I say, shall farr surpasse the unbelievers Isa. 65. 66.and wicked of old, in condemnation on that day. Psal. 7. 58, 59, 63, 69, 82. And forasmuch as such men have no place more with God neither in Mich. 7.Heaven, nor here upon His Earth; Let them by no meanes imagin, as if the Revel. 20.World did appertain unto the Devill, Isa. 40.who hitherto hath continued loose through them, as his Members; For the eternall God, which hath drown∣ed Gen. 6. 7. 19.the like Scoffers and Mockers with the Flood, and consumed others with fire and brimstone from Heaven: Epist. Jud.He is in Beeing still, and hath connived Matt. 13.long already to the Devillish waies Jam. 5.and practises, in the Children of ma∣lice, that never desired to spare the Righteous.
Joh. 12. HE that despiseth me, and doth not Jerem. 23. 30.receive my Words, hath one already Heb. 4. Revel. 19.to judge him: The Word that I have spoken, that shall judge him, which is living, powerfull, and sharper then any two-handed sword. FINIS.
