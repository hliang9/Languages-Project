TO YOU THAT ARE CALLED ANABAPTISTS IN THE NATION OF IRELAND Teachers and People, who profess your selves to be the Church of Christ; This is the word of the Lord God unto You. YOu are gathered and not in the Spirit of Jesus, nor in the Light of Christ, nor in the power of God; you are sepa∣rated but not in the truth, nor in the ground, for the defi∣led and uncircumcised nature of the world stands alive in you, & you are in the uncrucified estate, in the dominion of death, & under the power of sin: pride, covetousness, hypocrisie, vainglory, and the workes of the flesh abound among you; to the Light in you which Christ hath lightned you with all, I doe speake, which shall beare witness for me herein; and against you in the day of the Lord which suddenly comes upon you and all the world, who are not in the Light and power of God: you are bowing down to the Jmage in the fained hippocrisie, of what the Saints Injoyed and witnessed in the life & power of God: you never came truly through the mi∣nistration of Moses which reveales wrath upon the uncircumci∣sed, nor you never came to the ministration of Iohn, who is a burn∣ing Light and brings down the mountaines, and prepares the way of the Lord before his face, but you are in your taken out observan∣ces from the Letter, as the Jews were, but gainsayes and opposes the life of God as they did, and in that nature you stand which put Christ to death, who doth not own the Light whereby he light∣eth
every man that comes into the world, though him & his words and Ordinances you profess, and performes your own Immitations, in your fleshly wills, and not the worship of God in the Spirit, and in the truth, for the truth you are strangers too: which the di∣vell nor the wicked abides not in, and are alienated in your mindes from the way and councell of the living God, and hath but the name that you live; and are dead in trespasses & in sins, and the Jmage of God doth not live in you, and you have but the forme of godliness in your sensuall understandings, in that wisdome which is divelish; & your dead mindes are exercised in the forme without the power, in vaine shewes in set dayes and in set observances, glorying in the flesh, seeking and receiving praise of men, and is but as the Jew, outward whose house of worship and sacrifice is left desolate and you know not the pure moveings and leadings of the pure spirit of the Lord God to rule you, and to teach you in the way of peace, be∣cause you doe not beleeve in the Light which Christ Jesus hath lightned you and every man in the world withall, but doth gainsay it, and strive against it, in your high thoughts, and Imagina∣tions to your own condemnation in the sight of God: who are wise in your own conceits, and Righteous in your own Eye, and mea∣sures your selves and not with the rule of Judgement. But this is the condemnation of you, & al the world that light is come & hath shined in your darke hearts, but darknes and the workes thereof is loved rather then the light, you say you are not of the world; but what doe you differ from it, in Doctrine, or in Worship, or in Conversation: doth not pride and vanity, and selfe seeking, rule in many of you? yea, to your shame might I mention the abominati∣ons which I have seen among you; who often beheld your devoti∣ons, to the unknown God, and was an Eye witness of your Idoli∣tries, and even while you profest to be gathered out of the world, you are wallowing in its filthiness, and drinking deeply of its po∣lutions, in envie, in wrath, and in bitterness, and in all eivill, not like members of the body of Christ; but may justly be Judged many of you to be the Sinagogues of Satan; who say you are members of Christ and are not, for you are tried and are found
wanting before the Lord, and your Pastors & Teachers, they goe before you and are examples in Iniquity, unto you, and are guilty of your transgression, and you of theirs, for you hold them up, and loves to have these things so; and they through lies, and lightness causes you to erre. And so the blinde leads the blinde till you both fall into the ditch of perdition: and they may be ashamed, of you who are in igno∣rance, and blindness of heart, wo have not learned the way of truth and righteousness, nor come to the knowledge of God; nor denied your selves and sins, and you may be ashamed of them, who are as they that feed themselves with the fat, and not the flocke, & that through Covetousness by fained words, makes marchandise of Soules: and goes for gifts, and rewards, as Balaam, and while they Condemne others for hirelings, are manyfold guilty themselves therein, & to be Condemned & Judged, with the Light of Christ Jesus; witness some of your chiefest Pastors and Teachers, at Dublin, at Limbricke, and at Corke, and at many places else where in Ireland; some having a hundred pounds a yeare, & others more or less, to their shame let this be told, and to their Condemnation in the Light of God, & all that know him who are hippocritticall in crieing against others for that whereof themselves are guilty, and are an ill savor and a reproach to some of their own Brethren; and a shame to Religion and to all that profess faith in the Gospell of Christ; and are out of the example, of all the Appostles and Mi∣nisters of Christ: who freely recived and freely gave, and did not seeke and receive maintenance from the powers of the Earth, but Preached the Gospell, and lived of the Gospell, & eate of the fruit of the vinyard which they had planted. But your Pastors are in the ex∣ample of the false Brethren, who taught for filthy Lucar and with faigned words beguiled the simple, and while you have been zea∣lous to pull drown the Episcopall Priests; you have exalted your selues in their Seates, some of you in the same Temples; with Large aditions (by oppressions) to their maintenances, and hath the wages of unrighteousness as Balaam, and goes for gifts & rewards; and is not this a shame to you to be laid to your charge,
appearing more vile in deepe hippocrisie then your predecessors, in publique prophaness; to the Light in your Consciences I speake, which shall witness this to be true in the presence of God, who Condemns al your workes and worships in that nature acted: who worships in your Carnall mindes, in the Idols temples, some of you as the Priests of the world doe, upholding the worship of the beast, under another name, & you are as bitter and envious, in blind zeale as the prophane world: against any that differs from you in Iudge∣ment, or that comes among you to declare the word of the Lord; witness at Dublin, Kilkenny, Corke, and else where, where the Servants of the Lord were halled out of your Assemblies and evill entreated, with mockings and cruell words, to your shame for ever may this be rehersed: who while you profess a separation from the world, are one with it in wickedness, as in lieing, slander∣ing, false accusing, reproaching and promise breaking, witness at Waterford and else where; whose lies and eivill speeches, might e∣vidently be declared, to your shame, and of those with many other of your Abominations, which I have seen in you, I am a witness a∣gainst, and your Iniquities are not found upon secret search only: but openly in all those things, & hereby in the presents of the live¦ing God I doe warne you, of the righteous Judgements of the Just God, who hath seen and taken notice of your hippocrisie & naugh∣tyness, and desemulation with God and Men, and that uprightness which once was in you, have you betrayed for selfe ends and earth∣ly intrests, & have set up your selves in places of honor, and are not in the light nor life of God, but enemies to the light of Iesus Christ; where with he lighteth every man that comes into the world; & you are out of Church order, in the confusion of your own hearts, in divers oppinions, and not of one heart and minde, but stumbles at the light; and rejects the foundation, and hath hearts and cannot understand: your understandings being shut up from the knowledge of the truth, gainsaying the Councell of the Lord in your sensuall wisdome, and opposing the way of truth to your own confounding, witness at Waterford, Corke, and other places, where some of you were taken in your own craftiness, to your shame, when you set
your selves against the Lord, and Ioyned your selves with the wick∣ed, & be came one with the Priests, in opposing the life and power of truth, as Herod and Pilot, became friends in the persecuting of Jesus; where you uttered forth much blindness, and parverted the Scriptures to your own Confoundings, as many can witness, now these things I write, not altogether to shame you, but rather to re∣prove them in you; that you may reade and Consider, and repent and may turne from your dead Idoll worship, and hippocritticall Teachers and false wayes, to serve and worship the Living God in the newness of the spirit, and in the power of truth in it selfe, and noe more may seeke the Kingdome of God in observances, for it comes not with outward observances saith Christ: but the Kingdom of Heaven is within you, to be revealed in the light and truth in all that beleeve in the light of the world. Therefore be cause you are gathered to gether, and not by the spi∣rit of the Lord, nor in the Light, you shall be broken and your Al∣ters of Immittations, and vaine Traditions, shall be thrown downe and you into Confusion shall be turned, for you have the Saints words, and practises, but the life you are without; and the spirit that gave forth the Scriptures you have not received, with which the Scripture is only understood: but you take on things in your own wills, and performes a sacrifice which is not regarded of the Lord. How proud are some of you, and how vaine glorious, and how covetous and selfe seeking, of the glory of this world, giving and seeking honor of men, not like members of Christs body, but of an harlot; not like them that take up the dayly Cross of Christ, or that deny the world: but as them that seeke after it; and layes up Trea∣sure in it, who seekes the praises of men, as much as the praise of God; And gives and receives honor one of another; as the Gentiles, and seekes not the honor that comes from God only; and so are out of the Covenant of Life, and out of the bond of Peace, in strife & contention, and false oppinions, and Judgements, and out of the power of God in the Forme and Likeness of things without Life, professing the Scriptures in the spirit of Error, and your Ministry be gets into the forme and not into the power of Righteousness, and
differs not from the ministry of the world in the ground, but is death and reapes not the Life, to bring any unto God. Woe unto you hippocrits, the mighty day of the Lord, is com∣ing upon you, and your desolation comes as an armed man, the witness of God in your Consciences is mine, and to it I speake, it beares my voyce and shall answer for me, and against you, in the day of recompence, therefore to the light of Christ Jesus, which he hath given you, turne in your mindes, your workes of darkness it will reprove and make manifest, and be not stout hearted neither count your selves unworthy of eternall life: come downe and sit in the dust, and cease from your Idols, and from your imitations, and lay down your Crownes at the feet of Jesus; who is the Light of the world, and lighteth every man that comes into the World; if you love it▪ you will bring your deeds to it; it will let you see your owne Conditions, into which you are fallen from the Life of God, through disobedience and are in the transgression and not reconciled to God; for that enmity stands in you against him, above the seed of God, & the dayly Cross you doe despise, and are in your plasures and va∣nities, and knowes not the Covenant of peace and rest, where the Saints dwell; wherefore bow down your uncircumsised eare, to the Light▪ and let the Lord God search your hearts with his Light, and it will discover to you the way in which you ought to walke; and that which you ought to denie: And this Light is your way to Christ and to the Baptisme of Christ, where the cleane water is received, which washeth a way Sin, and the bread of Life is receiv∣ed which nurisheth up unto God, and unto eternall Life; & in the Light you will receive the true satisfaction to your Soules, and of the Lord you will receive teaching, in the spirit from him; who is that Minister of the Covenant of Life, and here is your way out of the world; and into the pure separation from its wayes, and workes, and nature, into the fellowship of Christ Jesus: and one with ano∣ther which is in the Light, and in the truth, which noe un∣cleane thing hath any part in; But the Liars, and the Proude, and the Covetous, and the vaine glorious, shall have their portion in the Lake, that burnes in the Indignation of God▪
Wherefore, awake awake, ye that sleep in the darke night of Ig∣norance; Heare ye deafe, and Looke ye blinde, the day of the Lord cometh upon you, and the Pretious from the Vile will he se∣parate; by his everlasting word of Judgement, and in Love to all your Soules; This is a warning from the Lord and is the word of the Lord God unto you, whether you will heare or forebeare, and with the Light in all your Consciences, this shall be witnessed when your Judgement is read, and remember you are warned in your life time. By a friend and Lover of all your Soules, but a wit∣ness against all your deceits. E: BVRROVGH.
