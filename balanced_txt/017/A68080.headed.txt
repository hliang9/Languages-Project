The interpreta¦cyon / and syg∣nyfycacyon of the Masse. ¶ Here begynneth a good deuoute Boke to the honoure of god / of our lady his mother / & of all sayntes / and ryght profytable to all good Catholyke per¦sones / to knowe howe they shall de∣uoutly here Masse.

¶ Here begyn∣neth the fyrste boke, conteynynge very profytable Doctrynes, ser∣uynge to the Masse deuyded in .xxxiii. Chapytres. ¶ The fyrste Chapytre: wherfore the Masse in all languages is called Missa / and none otherwyse. IN all languages (as La∣ten / Hebreu / Greke / in Englysshe / Frenche / and in all other lāguages) the blyssed Sacryfyce of the Masse: is named and cal∣led a Masse. And that is as the Doctours do wytnesse for thre causes. ¶ Fyrst Missus in laten doth sygnyfie and is as moche to saye as sent / for the Catholy¦ke people do sende to the father of heuen by the handes of a Preest / whiche is a medyta¦toure betwene the father of heuen and the synner: a sacryfyce and oblacyon prayenge to obtayne by the same grace in the soule / & pardone of all synnes.
¶ Secondaryly Missio is to saye: an offe∣rynge sent vnto vs from heuen / from the father almyghty / by the wordes of the con∣secracyon of the preest: in the whiche conse∣cracyon the sone of god descendeth in body / vnyed with the dyuynyte / the whiche the preest receyueth to the helth of all catholyke people / as well lyuynge as deed: beynge in the state of grace. ¶ Thyrdly Missio is also as moche to saye as sent without / For at the begynnynge of the holy churche / all those whiche were not baptysed in contynent after that the gospell was songe of the deacon: they were sent out of the churche / the whiche be named Cate cumini / that is to saye: people blys∣sed of the preest / but not yet bap¦tysed / wherfore they were not worthy to beholde the holy sacrament in the Masse. ¶ The seconde Chapytre / wherfore cō∣monly the catholyke churches be sy¦tuate / or sette in the Eest and west partes and the masse is sayde in the Eest parte.
ALl good and Catholyke people shall make theyr prayers to almighty god beynge with theyr vysa¦ges towardes the Eest parte / where the Sonne doth ryse / rather than towardes the West / Northe / or Southe / for after the ordynaun¦ce of the holy churche: the masse is rather said in the Eest parte than in the West / Northe / or Southe / and that is for foure reasons. ¶ Fyrste to the intent that we do not resem¦ble and be lyke to the Iewes / Sarazyns / or Turkes / or other Infydelles / for the Ie¦wes do praye / with theyr faces towardes the West / the Sarazyns in praynge do tour netheyr faces towardes the Southe / And the Turkes and other Infydelles do make theyr prayers towardes the Northe. And therfore we do rede contrary to them in the Northe parte (from whens all euyll dothe come and shall come vnto vs) the holy gos¦pell of the Masse. ¶ Secondaryly / we praye towardes the Eest parte / for there is Paradyse terrestre sytuate / where by ryght our dwellynge pla¦ce is / and from whens we be chased & put out for oure mysdedes and synnes. And to
the intent that we maye retourne agayne in to our countree / out of this valee of myse∣ry and sorowe / where we be but as banys∣shed / whiche can not enioye our propre lan∣de and countree. Therfore we do tourne vs towardes the same / prayenge and desyryn∣ge to come there agayne. ¶ Thyrdly / for our Lorde the sone of god / hath honge vpon the crosse / with his face and vysage towardes the west parte / and his backe towardes the Eest parte. Wherfo¦re whan we praye in the Eest parte / we be sytuate with our vysages afore the crosse / beholdynge in the face of oure lorde Ihesu chryste / to the intent that by his bytter and sharpe passyon we maye be saued / we tour¦ne vs towardes his face / as desyrynge the same / otherwyse we shulde be tourned to∣wardes hym with our backe and to the con¦trarye. ¶ Fourthly / for whan our lorde dyd ascen∣de in to heuen / he was sytuate in the Eest parte / where his apostelles dyd worshyppe hym / and where he shal be constytute at the daye of iugement. And this doth sygnyfye vnto vs that after we be deed / we be bury¦ed with the hed towardes the west parte / & the fete in the Eest parte / for at the daye of
iugement whā we shal be resuscytate from deth / we shall ryse as we do lye / & shall go streyght forth without retournynge / to the iugement of god syttyng in the Eest parte. ¶ The thyrde Chapytre / who dyd saye the fyrste Masse vpon the erth / and who hath so ordeyned and com¦posed it sens that tyme. AS the holy scrypture doth te¦che vs / oure lorde the sone of god in his last supper that he made with his apostelles in his lyfe / dyd instytute the ho¦ly sacrament: & he onely dyd speke the wor∣des of the consecracyon as a very preest / af¦ter the ordre of Melchysedech: In the which supper our lorde as a soueraygne bysshop / dyd ordeyne all his apostelles preestes / cō∣maundynge them and also all other preest{is} that shall come after them / so to do in his re¦membraunce and cōmemoracyon. ¶ After this the apostelles sayd the Masse: spekyng the same word{is} yt our lorde dyd in blyssynge the breade / with a Pater noster: and so the masse was sayde and accomplys¦shed. And in this maner saynt Peter dyde
the fyrste masse / by the space of foure yeres in the Eest parte / where he was bysshop / & after was constytute bysshop in Antyoche And there he sayde after the Pater noster / thre oraysons. ¶ Saynt Iames the lesse sayde the fyrste masse at Ierusalem afore that he was bys∣shop. Saynt Marce the euangelyste sayde the fyrste masse in Alexandrye / and so all the other apostels in al quarters of the worl¦de. After them / the holy catholyke churche hath ordeyned and instytute / to saye the epy¦stell and the holy gospell. And fynally dy∣uerse holy popes and bysshopes / by inspyra¦cyon of the holy ghost / as saynt Gregorye / saynt Basilius / saynt Celestyn: saynt Am¦brose / and saynt Austyn / haue ordeyned & instytute it as it is nowe and euer shall be. ¶ The fourth Chapytre / yf the fyrst masse of a newe preest be better than the secon¦de or the thyrde of another preest. THe holy sacrament consecrate of the preest / is in all masses & of all preestes of lyke power and myght / as touchynge the holy sacrament. Yet notwith∣stādynge the fyrste masse is cōmonly more
profytable and merytoryous: than the secon¦de or the thyrde: and yt is for foure reasons. ¶ The fyrst cause is / for in the fyrst masse there be many reuerences and solempnytes done / whiche be not done in other tymes / as to com to offre: to hange the churche with Tapysserye / to cast & sprede herbes in euery place & other ceremonyes / the which be done by deuocyon: & to moue the hertes of catholy¦ke people to feruent prayers and oraysons. ¶ The seconde cause is / for ī the fyrst masse the synnes be more habundaūtly pardoned for certayne pardons and indulgences gy∣uen them / whiche do here the fyrste masse. ¶ The thyrde cause is: for in the fyrst masse the preest{is} be wont to prepare them self mo¦re deuoutly: than at another tyme. And ther¦fore theyr prayers be than more acceptable / deuoute / & feruent to praye for them that do here theyr fyrst masses for to obtayne grace. ¶ The fourth cause is: for in the fyrst masse certayne soules be delyuered from purgato¦rye / the whiche god hath ordeyned to be de∣lyuered at that tyme / and not in none other masses: as it is red of saynt Gregorye / that in his fyrste masse / he delyueryd as many soules as there was folk{is} heryng his masse and of suche examples there be many.
¶ The fyfth Chapytre / yf it be more for the soule helthe / to here masse of a deuoute and vertuous preest / than of an euyll preest. VPon this deuoute doctours do saye / that we maye speke of the masse in thre maners. ¶ Fyrst touchyng the holy sa¦crament of the blyssed body of oure lorde Ihesu chryste / the whiche is the most pryncypall in the masse. The masse is as good of an euyll preest as of a good / for the holy sacrament is not worse nor the ver¦tue therof dymynysshed by the euyll preest / nor better and of greatter vertue by reason of the good preest. Yet neuertheles the euyll preest beynge in synne doth receyue it to his dampnacyon. ¶ Secondaryly / a man may consydre / by what persone the masse is done and sayd / for yf it be sayd by the person / or vycare / or chaplayne of the churche / for other persones and not for hym selfe / than the masse is as good of an euyll preest / as of a good and a vertuous preest. ¶ Thyrdly a man maye speke of the masse touchynge the prayers and oraysons / the
whiche the preest sayth in the masse tyme / And than the masse sayd of a good and de∣uout preest is more better / than of a synner and an euyll preest. ¶ The syxte chapytre / Yf all the masses be lyke good: as masse of Requiem / of our Lady / of the holy Sacra∣ment. &c. and whiche is best. OF the offyce or seruyce of the masse we maye speke in two maners / as the Canon lawe dothe shewe vs. ¶ Fyrste there be certayne fe∣stes / whiche hath theyr propre offyce and ser¦uyce / as Ester / Pentecoste / the Ascencyon / the Dedycacyon: All the festes of our lady: and cōmonly the Sondayes / and dyuerse other dayes. In these hyghe and great feest{is} it is not cōuenyent (but of necessyte) that a man shall saye any other masse / and leue the masse of the great feest. Therfore we shall not cause to saye any other masse / but the same of the daye and feest. ¶ Secondaryly / there be certayne dayes in the weke / which hath no propre offyce: and than it is best to saye the masse / wherin the
preest or the man hath the greatest deuocyon as of Requiem / or of the Vysytacyon / An∣nuncyacyon: Assumpcyon. &c. And so there be certayne masses ordeyned by certayne de¦uoute persones / or by apparycyon / the whi∣che be very good and profytable to be sayd as well for these that be lyuynge / as those that be deed. As the pope Boniface hath or¦deyned fyue masses / in the honoure of the fyue woundes of our lorde / the whiche be very deuoute and profytable. And also the¦re is founde in wrytynge for a trueth / that there be .vii. masses called the goldē masses the whiche sayd of a deuout preest the space of .vii. dayes / euery daye in remembraunce as hereafter is wryten / be very profytable / for to delyuer shortly the poore soules out of purgatorye / the whiche acordynge to the iu∣styce of god / oughte to be a longe season in the paynes of purgatorye / for it is red of a deuoute preest / whiche in one masse delyue¦red a hondreth soules / whiche were seen of another deuoute man / flyeng out of purga¦torye as thycke as sparkes of fyre. ¶ The .vii. Chapytre / howe a man shall saye the seuen masses.
FYrste: the fyrste masse shal be sayd on the Mondaye in the honoure and graty¦tude / that our lorde Ihe∣su chryste was taken in the gardayne / prayenge that he wyll delyuer the poore and mysera∣ble soules out of the pryson of purgatorye. ¶ Secondaryly / the Tuesdaye the masse shall be sayd in the honoure / that our lorde pyteously and cruelly was bounde to the pyller / prayenge hym that he wyll vnbyn∣de the soules out of the bandes of dette and paynes. ¶ Thyrdly / the wednesdaye masse shal be sayd in the honoure of the iniuste iugement and sentence that Pylate gaue of our lorde the innocent lambe / prayenge that he wyll delyuer the soule from the iust sentence that shall be gyuen vpon the soules. ¶ Fourthly / the Thursday in the honoure of the incōparable paynes that god suffred hangyng on the crosse & nayled with great nayles of yron / prayenge that he wyll dely¦uer the soule lyenge bounde in purgatorye. ¶ Fyftly / the Frydaye the masse shall be sayd in the honoure of al the woundes that our lorde had in his blyssed body / whiche
were .v.M.iiii.C.lxv. prayenge our lorde that he wyl delyuer the soule from the woū¦des of conscyence / wherwith it is maculate and spotted. ¶ Syxtly / the Saterdaye in the honoure that our lorde was taken downe from the crosse & buryed: which neuertheles was kyn¦ge of heuen / prayenge that he wyll delyuer the soule out of the sepulchre of purgatorye. ¶ Seuenthly / the .vii. masse shall be sayd in the honoure that god dyd ryse gloryously from deth the .iii. daye / prayeng hertely that by the same resurreccyon / he wyll graunt the soule to ryse from the payne of purgato¦rye / so that it maye raygne with hym / and to fyue euerlastyngly. ¶ The .viii. Chapytre: Yf euery catho∣lyke persone be bounde to here masse the Sondaye. EVery good catholyke {per}son whiche is come to lawfull age / is boūde & cōmaūded by the lawe / to here a hole masse on the Sondaye / & that he do not departe out of the churche / vnto the laste benedyccyon be gyuen of the preest / excepte that he haue
so great and lawfull necessyte / that he can not here masse. The necessyties be declared by deuoute doctours in dyuerse maners. ¶ Fyrste syckenes of the body / so that with out peryll he can not go out of his house. ¶ Secondaryly / those whiche haue many yonge or sycke chyldren / the whiche in the meane tyme: they can not leue alone nor wt none other person / nor they can not brynge them with them: for fere that they do not co∣me in to a worse case therby. ¶ Thyrdly / in suche wyse that in some coū¦tree is the custome whan the next frendes is deed / they abyde a certayne tyme in the hou¦se without cōmynge forth. Yet alwayes by lycence they maye haue masse sayd in theyr house. And so it is to vnderstāde that may dens that marye / where it is so acustomed. ¶ Fourthly / when a towne or a castell is beseyged and in peryll and daunger of ene∣myes. And yf certayne persons be not there {pre}sent / the sayd towne or castell shuld be in daunger to be taken / or myghte haue some other euyll chaunce. ¶ Fyftly / all that which acordyng to good conscyence / is a iuste and a lawfull cause / dothe excuse man afore god and holy chur∣che / of not herynge masse / yet neuerthelesse
suche a persone shall do some other good de∣de that daye or some other daye for it / wher∣fore whan the man can not go to the chur∣che / he shall rede in this lytell boke. ¶ The .ix. Chapytre: yf it be cōmaun¦ded to here Masse: as well of all other feestes and holydayes / as of the Sondayes. WE haue it wryten in the law Canon / that where there is lyke and egall reason / there is also lyke and egall lawe. The reason wherfore it is cōmaunded to here masse the Sondayes: is bycause the man than shulde occupye hym selfe with god / whiche thynge can not be better done than by herynge of masse / and shulde not occupye hym selfe with other bo¦dely worke / the which also for the same rea¦son is defended & forbyde in other feestes & holy dayes. Yet neuertheles as the doctours do wytnesse & wryte: there be some lytel fee¦stes ordeyned by the bysshop / wherin (after the masse is herde) a mā may worke a lytel for another / but not for hym selfe. And this he may do by foure maners without synne.
¶ Fyrste / whan it is a lytell worke so that by the same he dothe not ouercome his herte with laboure / and be not euyll dysposed in his body therby. ¶ Secondaryly / whan it is great necessyte & that the busynes can not be dyfferred to a¦nother day / for the peryl & daūger that may come therof: As whan the corne is in the fel¦des: & that it is lyke to be great rayn & other tempestes / or for fere of enemyes ī the tyme of warre. Than a man maye gather togy∣ther his corne and brynge it in to the barne without synne. Also bochers / bakers and other vytellers maye sell theyr vytaylles / without the which the people can not passe or abyde vnto the next daye folowynge. ¶ Thyrdely / whan it is for the cōmon pro∣fyte of any towne or vyllage / as to make cōmon wayes / brygges / or churches / or su∣che other. ¶ Fourthly / whan suche a worke is done for the loue of god / as for poore folkes / whi¦che can not helpe them selfe / that is to saye to serue them / to laboure for them / to cary wode or any other maner of thynge for the loue of god / this maye a man do withoute synne: yet neuerthelesse he muste alwayes here masse.
¶ The .x. Chapytre / Yf a man maye go on pylgrymage the Sondayes and other feestes. And yf ser∣uauntes be bounde to here masse the Sondayes. SAynt Hierome saythe / that that thynge which man doth is not acceptable to god whā he leueth that thyng vndon whiche he is bounde to do: to go in pylgrymage the Sondaye / excepte that it be great nede / and cheyfly afore that a man here masse / can not be done without synne. Thā moche more do they synne whi¦che do go for theyr marchaūdyse on the son∣daye without herynge masse / and without necessyte. Yf the mayster cōmaunde his ser∣uaunt to ryde or go / or to worke on the son∣daye / and yf necessyte requyre it / than the mayster nor the seruaunte do not offende / but yf it were not for necessyte: thā the may¦ster doth offende. Yf the seruaunt do it with out cōmaundement and that he myght here masse yf he wolde in rysynge a lytell erlyer in the mornynge / than the mayster is excu∣sed / and the seruaunt onely shall make acō¦pte therof afore god.
¶ The .xi. Chapytre: Yf it be suffycyēt that a man here one masse the Sondaye / in leuynge the sermon and euenson¦ge the same daye. AFter the cōmaundement of god: man is bounde to kepe & sanctyfye the holy daye by good work{is}: not onely by one good wor∣ke as to here masse / but rather by many good workes / for as Doc∣tours do saye / that man whiche wyll accō∣plysshe the thyrde cōmaūdement of god / as to sanctyfye the sondaye: he shall do that sa¦me daye after his power / syxe thynges. ¶ Fyrste he shal here masse as is aforesayd. ¶ Secōdaryly: he shal also here the sermon yf it be possyble / for yf the man dyde leue or lease it by contempte or custome / he shulde syn̄e greatly. And yf he can not here the ser∣mon / he shall rede in the stede of the sermon some other good thynge. ¶ Thyrdly / the man also shal gyue that sa¦me daye an almous for the loue of god / yf he be of power. And in case that he be not of substaunce to gyue almous it is suffycy¦ent / yf he haue a good wyll so to do.
¶ Fourthly / the man shall praye that same daye for his greatest helth. ¶ Fyfthly / he shall remembre that daye the goodnesse and benefytes that he hath recey¦ued of god / princypally that god hath creat hym of nothynge / and hath called hym vn¦to the holy catholyke fayth: And delyuered hym by his precyous blode / and this doyng the man shall loue god with all his herte. ¶ Syxtly / the man is also bounde the sa∣me daye / to make a generall confessyon of all his mortall synnes / the whiche he hathe done sens his last confessyon / and therof to haue contrycion and repentaunce bytwene god and his conscyence. For this cōmaunde¦ment of god / to sanctyfye the Sondaye / no man maye accomplysshe beynge in the sta∣te of deedly synne. Yet neuertheles the man is not bounde to confesse hym but at the ty∣me ordeyned and instytute by the churche but in certayne causes hereafter in the fyfth Chapytre of this boke wry∣ten. Yet he is bounde that same daye to make a generall con∣fessyon and to haue contry¦cyon / and to purpose ne¦uer after to synne.
¶ The .xii. Chapytre / howe the man shall behaue hym selfe in the masse tyme / after the ordynaunce of the holy churche and the lawe Canon. WE fynde wrytten in Canon lawe in dyuerse places / that oure mother the holy churche hath ordeyned nyne ordinaū¦ces or maners of the masse / the which all chrysten people ought to kepe. ¶ Fyrste / the man albeit that he haue herde one masse / yet he shall here the hygh masse / yf it be not that he be lawfully excused for certayne necessyties / as is aforesayde. ¶ Secōdaryly / the mā shal also here masse in his parysshe churche / and he shall not go by contempte to any other. ¶ Thyrdly / those that wyll deuoutly here masse / they shall leue theyr hawkes & theyr dogges at the churche dore / or elles at home in theyr howses. ¶ Fourthly / the laye people shall not sytte or stande by the hyghe aulter / pryncypally whyles that the masse is sayd. And aboue all the women shall absent them from the aulter. ¶ Fyfthly / the man shal kepe scylence / and
shall make no trouble nor noyse ī the masse tyme / but shall praye with a feruent herte. ¶ Syxtly / euery man whan he heryth the gospell red: shal stande vpryght redy with his body to defēde the holy catholyke fayth / whiche god hath spoken in the holy gospell. ¶ Seuenthly / euery person herynge the na¦me of Ihesus: shall knele or bowe with his knees / or he shall inclyne with his heed in sygne and token of reuerence / for so ofte as the person doth it / he doth meryte threscore dayes of pardon / gyuen by two popes. ¶ Eyghtly / all good catholyke people shal knele downe of both theyr knees: whan the preest doth lyft our lord Ihesu in the masse and shal worshyp the holy sacrament with great reuerence. ¶ The .ix. euery good chrysten mā and wo¦man shall offre some thynge at the masse / for god spekyng in the olde testament sayth Ye shall not come in my presence voyde or Idle / that is to saye / that at the leste ye shal offre vnto god a feruent prayer and oray∣son. And there where it is the custome / the man shall gyue ī the masse tyme temporall goodes and offrynges. But to this no man is bounde except in great & hygh feestes: af∣ter the custome of the countre or place.
¶ The .xiii. Chapytre / Yf the man be bounde to here masse of his Cura¦te / and in his owne parysshe. IT is wryten ī the Canon lawe / that he whiche con∣tempneth his owne curate & churche / and goth to here masse ī another place: shal be chased out of that chur∣che where he goth vnto. This cōmaunde∣ment hath our mother holy churche gyuen / for to cōstrayne them that do rebell agaynst theyr curates / in contempnynge them and also theyr mother the holy churche / and to brynge them to subieccyon and humylytye. Yet neuerthelesse yf any man do go to here dyuyne seruyce in any other churche / with∣out any contempte / but rather that he hath greater deuocyon there or better place / or yt he doth here the sermon there and other seruy¦ces / whiche he can not here in his parysshe churche or for any other iuste cause / he dothe not offende / in case that his bysshop or cu∣rate haue not forbyd hym the same. ¶ The .xiiii. Chapytre / Yf masse maye be sayde in places not halowed / as within the howse.
WE haue it wryten ī the Ca¦non lawe / that in as mo∣che as is possyble / a man shall not say masse with∣oute places dedycate and halowed / and pryncypal¦ly in the shyppes beynge vpon the see / for the daūger that maye come therof. It is bet¦ter to be sayd in the feldes vpon a stone ha¦lowed or dedycate & sette in a case of wood with two fayre to welles spred vpon the same / or one to well doubled. &c. There can no masse be sayde in a howse or a chambre / without lycēce of the bysshop: but the freers whiche be called freers prechers / & myneurs haue pryuylege and lycence to say masse in the howse / in tyme of necessytye / howe be it they maye not mynyste the sacrament to no person vn∣der the payne of excomyny∣cacyon / withoute lycence of the Curate. ¶ The .xv. Chapytre / yf a man the sondaye in the masse tyme may saye that thynge / whiche is cō∣maunde hym in penaunce.
SOme doctours do saye / that the sōdayes whā a mā hereth but one masse that he ought not to say or rede any thynge ioy∣ned to hym in penaunce The reason is / for with one peny a man can not paye two credy∣tours or dettours / & so also a man can not at one tyme accomplysshe two cōmaunde∣mentes / for ye be bounde to here masse and to saye your iniūccyon. Agaynst this there be certayne other doctours whiche do saye / that there is none apparēce nor reason ther∣in / for man maye obserue and kepe all the cōmaūdementes of god at one tyme / wher∣fore a man maye at one tyme here masse & also say his iniūccyon: for otherwyse amon¦ges an hondreth persones / there shulde not one here masse well / nor shuld not also say well his iniūccyon / whiche be so symple yt they knowe none otherwyse to do. Wherfo∣re he that knoweth howe to do / he shall say his iniūccyon eyther afore or after the masse for the suretie therof. And that sayd he shal cōmende it vnto god / in remembrynge in the masse tyme the passyon of our lorde / as hereafter is wryten.
¶ The .xvi. Chapytre / Yf the man whiche cōmeth after that the masse is begon / be yet bounde on the sondayes / to here another masse. BYcause that al the workes of god be parfyte / So he wyll also that ours in ly∣kewyse be parfyte & not dyuyded nor broken / for an hondreth peaces do not make one hole peace. It is cōmaunded in the spyrytuall lawe / that euery man shall here one hole masse to the ende on the son∣dayes and holydayes. He that heryth than but a peace of the masse doth not accomplys¦she the cōmaundement of the holy churche. But he that cōmeth a lytell to late / after cō¦fiteor / or kyryeleyson / or there aboutes and no further / he is not bounde to here another masse. For a lytell is in maner as nothyng pryncypally whan it is not done by cōtem∣pte / yf he com after that the halfe or the thyr¦de parte of the masse be done / than he is boū¦de to here another hole masse. Those that do helpe and serue at the masse / whiche ofte tymes be letted in the masse tyme / rēnynge for insence / wyne / or any other thynge tou∣chynge
the masse / be excused / & they be not bounde to here another hole masse. ¶ The .xvii. Chapytre / yf it be requysy∣te that the man here and vnderstan¦de the wordes of the masse. AFter Canon lawe / it is cō¦maunded to all chrysten peo¦ple to here masse / howe be it the preest doth somtyme rede so lowe: that those whiche be but a lytell from hym can not here nor vn∣derstande the wordes of the masse. Wherfo∣re the doctours do saye / that it is suffycyent yf the man be present at the masse whyther he here and vnderstande the wordes or no. And whyther he be farre of or nere / so that he be present: and it is suffycyent yf he do se the preest. But yf there be any that vnder∣stande Latyn / he maye go nere to the aulter whan the preest dothe rede the holy gospell to here it. Therfore many symple folkes do euyll / whiche do make noyse and rumoure in rennynge here and there whan the preest doth lyft our lorde / and do trouble both the preest and other persones of theyr deuocyon. He that can not se our lorde without rēnyn¦ge
here and there and troublynge other fol∣kes / he shall tourne his face to the preest / in castynge his iyes deuoutely towardes the grounde thynkynge with the Publycane / whiche beynge farre of in the temple / dyde esteme hym selfe that he was not worthy / to lyft vp his iyes in to heuen: but knockyn¦ge on his brest sayd. O good lorde haue mer¦cy of me poore synner / for the synner shall oft tymes cast his iyes towardes the groun¦de by humylyte / whan the preest doth lyft our lorde in the masse / estemynge hym selfe not to be worthy to beholde the holy & blys∣sed sacrament with his iyes. ¶ The .xviii. Chapytre / what profyte cōmeth by the masse / and what per∣sones maye haue and vse it. OF the masse do come honour: glory / and helth: Honoure to god / glory to the aungelles / and sayntes / And helthe to the men and women. ¶ Fyrste of the masse / the holy & blyssed try¦nyte receyueth glory / honour / & prayse / ī the honour & glory wherof the masse is sayd & done and the holy trynyte is there present.
¶ Secondaryly / the aungelles and all the sayntes in heuen do reioyse of the masse / for they be glad of all thyng that is done in the erthe to the honoure and laude of god / and pryncypally whan god is honoured by thē and in them. ¶ Thyrdly / of the masse doth come profyte and conforte to the soules lyenge in purga∣torye. For there is no vertue nor prayer so profytable vnto them: as the masse done or sayd for them / for by the same / theyr deedly synnes be forgyuen & also venyall synnes. And that is by the holy sacrament / whiche the preest doth offre in remembraunce of the passyon of our lorde Ihesu chryste. ¶ Fourthly / the masse also gyueth conforte and socoure to the lyuynge persones / for by the same the man is oft tymes delyuered frō many perylles of the body: as is declared in the .xxiii. Chapytre in the last condycyon or degre: & in the .xxiiii. Chapytre folowynge. ¶ Fyfthly / the man also ī his lyfe doth get and obtayne pardon of many venyall syn¦nes whiche he doth cōmyt dayly / wherof he is contryte and sory. ¶ And this is in the masse tyme in seuen maners.
¶ Fyrste all those that do saye Confiteor with the preest. ¶ Secondaryly / he that doth inclyne in bo¦wynge his knees / & doynge reuerence whā he hereth the swete name of Ihesus. ¶ Thyrdly / he that kneleth downe to the grounde / whan the preest dothe rede in the Credo. Et homo factus est. ¶ Fourthly / he that with great deuocyon / beholdeth the holy sacramēt whan the prest doth lyfte it. ¶ Fyfthly / he that with contrycyon and re¦pentaūce of his synnes / doth knocke vpon his brest whan the preest sayth in the Pater noster / Et dimitte nobis debita nostra / or the man maye saye the Pater noster with the preest / And whan he shall saye / Et de∣mitte nobis debita nostra / he maye knocke on his brest. ¶ Syxtly / he that doth with humylyte re∣ceyue the benedyccyon of the preest / at the ende of the masse. ¶ Seuenthly / he that after the masse dothe receyue of the preest or by hym selfe / the ho∣ly water with repentaunce of his venyall synnes. And accordynge to the quantyte or greatnes of the deuocyon: the venyal syn̄es be pardoned and forgyuen to the man.
¶ The .xix. Chapytre / yf a man maye without synne saye or cause a masse to be sayde for moneye. WE haue it wryten in the ho∣ly scrypture / that it is Sy∣monye to sell that thynge / whiche is sanctyfyed and de¦dycate vnto god. And that he which doth sell it / hath receyued it of god for no thynge: And so both he that doth sell it & that dothe bye it do cōmyt deedly synne. For it is agaynst al lawes / as agaynst the lawe of god / the lawe of man / & the lawe of nature. Wherfore whan the intent of the preest is pryncypally vpō money / and ma¦keth marchaundyse of the masse: And that those whiche cause the masse to be sayde / do take it that they do bye it for so moche mo∣ney / they do both cōmytte Symonye and is deedly syn̄e. Therfore whan a man wyl haue a masse sayd for hym or for his frēdes / he shall say to the preest. Syr we maye not make marchaundyse of the masse / but I praye you say so many masses for me or for my frendes / and I wyll prouyde for you and recompence your payne. And than ye shall prouyde hym of an honest lyuynge ac¦cordynge
to his estate and degre. For as the apostell saynt Paule sayth / he that serueth at the aultre / he must lyue by the aultre / for the preest hath none other occupacyon. ¶ The .xx. Chapytre / In what thynge & wherby a man may consydre the great¦nesse and dygnyte of the masse. THe dygnyte & holynes of the blyssed masse maye be consy∣dered by fyue reasons. ¶ Fyrste: for in the masse is  the same blyssed flesshe / that Mary the mother of god dyd conceyue and the precyous blode shed vpō the crosse on good frydaye. And therfore sayth Cryso¦stome / that touchynge the holy sacrament of the aulter: the masse is not of lesse dygny¦te and value / than the deth of our lord god vpon the crosse for the helth of the man. For as the deth of our lorde hath delyuered man from euerlastynge deth / so is euerlastynge lyfe gyuen to them / whiche be delyuered by the masse. ¶ Secondaryly / a man maye consydre the dygnyte of the masse / for there is alwayes present all the holy cōpany of heuen. That
is to say / the holy trynyte / Mary the mother of god / with all the holy aūgelles & saynt{is}: beholdynge and worshyppynge the holy & blyssed sacrament. For as saynt Gregorye sayth / who is he that wolde doubte yt whā heuen doth open / at the tyme that the preest doth consecrate the sacrament / and that the sone of god as the kynge of glory / doth de∣scende vpon the aulter / that there doth not come a great multytude & company of holy aungelles with hym. For a myghty kynge or prynce whan he wyl showe his mageste he doth take with hym / his nobles / his kny∣ghtes and other his seruauntes. Shuld thā the kynge of glory descende hym self alone and without company / I do not byleue it. ¶ Thyrdly / ye shall consydre that without lyght the preest maye not say masse / whan there shulde be bothe Sonne / Moone / and sterres shynyng vpon the aulter. And that doth sygnyfye / that there shall be in vs a hote and feruent loue of god / and a ferme & stedfast fayth & byleue. Also the ornamēt{is} of the masse ought to be dedycate and halo∣wed. And also the chalyce / the corporas / the aulter clothes and towelles / and other pre∣parementes / ought also to be halowed / or elles a man maye not saye masse. Also he
that shall say the masse / ought to be a preest consecrate: and otherwyse he maye not / we¦re he as holy as our lady the mother of god. For all the sayntes and aūgelles in heuen can not saye nor do one masse. ¶ Fourthly / ye shall consydre that all that is done and sayd in the masse: hath a syngu¦ler mystery and deuocyon in it / so that the preest doth not say one worde / nor doth not moue ones his hande ī the masse: but it doth sygnyfye some thynge of the lyfe of our lor¦de. For as Aureolus sayth in Cōpēdio theo¦logie / in the syxt boke in the .xviii. Chapy∣tre / that the masse (in a maner of spekynge) is as full of dyuyne mysteryes / as the see of droppes of water / & the sonne full of lyght & the skye full of sterres. And also all chry∣sten people beynge here in erthe and in pur∣gatorye / and all the sayntes in heuen / haue a synguler ioye and gladnesse of the masse. And some doctours do saye / that there is ne¦uer a masse sayd here ī erth / but there is one soule delyuered out of purgatorye / or a syn¦ner conuerted / or a good and iuste man pre∣serued and kept from fallynge in to temp∣tacyon. ¶ Fyfthly / ye maye also consydre the hygh dygnyte of the masse / for it is aorned with
many dyuerse languages & prayses. Fyrste Hebreu / as Amen / alleluya / sabaoth / osan¦na: also Greke / as kyry eleyson / chryste eley¦son / also Laten / as dominus vobiscū / pax tecum. Also ye here the voyce of oure lorde in the gospell: the whiche euery person ought to here with great deuocyon / not syttynge nor knelynge / but standynge vpryght / re∣dy to fyght vnto deth for to defende it and the holy fayth. And as ye do here god speke in the gospell / so ye here also the voyce of aungelles / as in Gloria in excelsis deo. Al¦so the voyce of the apostelles / as in the epy∣stelles. Also the voyce of the synner / in the Cōfiteor. Also ye here the voyce of the iuste man / as in the graduall or grayle / alleluya offetorye & cōmunyon or cōmon. And ther∣fore euery good chrysten person shall dyspo¦se hym selfe deuoutly to here masse / with a feruent herte and with great reuerence / as yf he were vpon the mount of Caluerye / & there dyd se our lorde god hangynge vpon the crosse. O with what and howe great deuocyon shulde we be at the masse / and shuld remembre the blyssed passyon of our lorde god: the whiche is represented & showed in the masse.
¶ The .xxi. Chapytre / what the persone shall rede in the mornynge whan he doth ryse from bedde. O Lorde god Ihesu chryste / I thanke the most humbly yt thou haste preserued & kepte me this nyght from sodeyn deth / and also from euerla∣stynge dāpnacyon / by the whiche neuerthe∣les moche people must be seperate from the: the whiche haue not done so many greuous offenc{is} & synnes as I haue done. But thou hast preserued me to the entent that I may amende myne euyll lyuynge. Wherfore I praye the good lorde / by thy incomparable mercy / and by the merytes of thy most blys∣sed mother & of all sayntes / that thou wylt kepe and preserue me this daye from all ma¦ner of deedly synne and euyll thoughtes & wordes / and from all vnlawfull workes to the entent that I maye so with a pure cō¦scyence / entre in to thy temple / and there to fynde thy great mercy / wherby I shall be worthy to be the temple and habytacyon of the holy ghost / where thou desyrest to dwell And that I maye come to the soueraygne temple of Ierusalem / there to gyue the lau¦des
and prayses euerlastyngly with all the sayntes. Amen. ¶ The .xxii. Chapytre / what the man shal saye for all chrysten soules / whan he doth passe by the churcheyarde. HElth and conforte be to you all christen soules: whose bo¦dyes do rest here and in eue∣ry place. Ihesu chryste whi∣che hathe boughte you with his precyous blode / delyuer you from the innumerable paynes of pur∣gatorye / and brynge you amonges the blys¦sed company of heuen. And there do ye re∣membre vs / in prayenge humbly that we maye be in your company / and crowned in heuen with you euerlastyngly. Amen. ¶ Pater noster. Aue maria. ¶ The .xxiii. Chapytre / howe the mā shall dyspose hym selfe to here masse. HE that wyll deuoutly and me¦rytoryously here masse in the temple of god / he shall mount or ascēde .vi. steppes or degrees that is to say: that he shall haue in hym selfe
syxe vertues / the whiche be fygured vnto vs in the temple of Salomon / whiche had syxe degrees or steppes goynge vpwarde. ¶ The fyrste degre or condycyon is / to desy¦re to be incontynent and without any tary¦enge at the seruyce of god / That is to saye / that as soone as ye here that they rynge the fyrste pele to masse / ye shall cast downe all maner of thynges out of your handes / and shall go to the seruyce of god / takyng exam¦ple at the thre kynges / whiche dyde leue all maner of thynge / and came from the Eest parte serchyng the lytell chylde ī Bethleem at the fyrste token & warnynge of the sterre. Wherfore all busynes that come and chaun¦ce to man goynge towardes the churche / & that he maye well let it passe / he shall let it be vndone vnto another tyme. And yf he can not let it passe without shame / he shall answere quyckely / as Dauid the prophete sayd. Good lorde thou haste made my fete lyke to the fete of a harte. Vpon this saynt Gregorye saythe / that whan a harte dothe renne vpon a hygh mountayne / he doth le∣pe ouer all that he dothe mete / and so shall we do in lykewyse. For the enemye of god and man whiche is the deuyll of hell / doth serche somtymes many wayes for to drawe
man from the seruyce of god / as from the masse / sermon / euen songe / and other dyuy∣ne seruyce. Or elles yf he can not lette hym from the hole / yet he wyll let hym from as moche as he maye: so that many folkes do tary in the waye talkynge or chydynge / or otherwyse occupyed tyll that the seruyce of god is halfe done. Therfore our lorde god dyd forbyd his dyscyples / to talke or reason with any person in the hygh waye. Wherfo¦re it is good that the man erely in the mor∣nynge do go to masse afore that any person maye let hym. For as Iob sayth / he that ere¦ly in the mornynge dothe serche for god / he shall fynde hym: for than man hath greater deuocyon / thā at any other tyme of the daye whan the wyttes be occupyed. ¶ The seconde degre or condycion is humy¦lyte: so that the {per}son ought not to entre in to the churche or temple of god / by great pom∣pe and pryde as the Pharazen dyd. For ma¦ny folkes (which god amēde) go to the chur¦che more to be seen or to se other / than for de¦uocyon or the helth of theyr soules / the whi∣che be afore god: as the proude Lucyfer was in heuen and Adam in paradyse. Therfore man shall come to the churche with humy∣lyte / as dyd the Publycane knockynge on
his brest sayenge. O good lorde haue mercy of me poore synner. And than god shall he∣re & exalte his prayer. For saynt Bernarde speketh a notable worde / sayeng that man that doth humylyate & meke hym selfe here in erth as lowe as he can / god wyll exalte hym as hygh as he can in heuen. And he yt doth exalt hym selfe here in erth as hygh as he can / god shall humylyate and caste hym as depe in hell as he can. O mercyfull god / howe depe shall some folkes descende in to hell / which be ashamed through theyr great pryde to humylyate them self afore the. So that ī heryng masse / some persones do wal¦ke vp and downe in the churche: other some do sytte at theyr most case / and other some do knele but of one kne / theyr bonettes fast nayled to theyr heddes / & so dyd the Iewes knele of one kne / whan they mocked oure lorde and dyd spytte in his face. O what ly¦tell knowlege / loue and fere haue suche fol¦kes of god: for the holy aūgelles be standyn¦ge vpryght with great reuerence and fere / afore the face of god. And the proude & styn¦kynge creature of god the man / doth swell with pryde and without any fere or drede. Ye do se that whan a man shall be hedded / that he doth knele on bothe his knees / with
his handes ioyned togyther afore hym that shall do the execucyon: and the poore & wret¦ched synner / is ashamed to humylyate hym selfe afore god. Here what our lorde Ihesu doth speke of the man / he that is ashamed to serue me afore the worlde / I wyll be a∣shamed of hym afore my father celestyall. Wherfore the man as soone as he is entred in to the churche: shal knele on both his knees with great humylyte and mekenes of herte in showynge to god his synnes / sayenge. O good lorde haue mercy of me poore syn∣ner / or other lyke wordes as ye shall fynde hereafter wryten / in the .xxx. Chapytre: for suche prayer god doth exalte / and doth ascē¦de in to heuen afore the face of god / & dothe not departe from thens / vnto it hath obtey¦ned all thynge that it doth demaūde for the helth of the soule. ¶ The thyrde degre or condycyon / to here masse deuoutly / is contrycyon or repentaū∣ce of al the deedly synnes that the man hath done. And whan the man shall thus haue mekened & humylyate hym selfe afore god / he shal haue made his peace with god: afore that he wyl praye for any thynge / For god doth hate the syn̄ers / & cannot se them whi¦che do not repent them of theyr syn̄es with
all theyr hertes. Therfore our lorde speketh by the prophete Esaye and sayth. Whan ye entre in to the churche and do lyft your han¦des on hyghe to me / I wyll tourne myne iyes from you: and whan ye crye to me / I wyll not here you / for your handes be full of blode: that is to say full of syn̄e. Of this ye maye haue example / yf ye wyll desyre & obteyne any thyng of a prynce or of a great lorde / the whiche is angry with you & doth hate you: so that he can not abyde the syght of you / ye muste fyrste fynde the meanes to content and pacyfye hym. And that done / desyre what ye wyll reasonably & ye shall obteyne. For otherwyse as saynt Gregory sayth / ye shulde prouoke hym to be more an¦gry and dyspleased with you. Therfore as Iohan Gerson chaunceller of Parys doth wryte / euery man oughte one tyme of the daye saye this orayson & prayer folowynge with all deuoute premedytacyon. For yf it do chaunce that the man dye sodaynly that same daye or nyght: he shal not be dampned nor pryuate of the syght of the gloryous fa∣ce of god / in case that he do saye this prayer with all his herte / and with cōtrycyon and repentaunce of his synnes.
¶ The prayer. O Most benygne and mercyful god / I knowlege & confesse that I haue greuously syn∣ned agaynst thy wyl and cō¦maūdement / aboue the nom¦bre of sterres. Wherof I am very sory and contryte ī my herte / and am sory that I can not repent me a hondreth tymes more than I do. Wherfore good lorde / I vndertake from hensforth / that yf I do lyue a hōdreth yeres more / I wyll kepe me (with thy gra∣ce) from all deedly synne. And also I haue a good and a ferme wyll to confesse all my synnes at the tyme ordeyned by the churche / & wyll also do penaunce for all my synnes after the counceyll of my confessoure. ¶ The fourth degre or condycyon is / to con¦sydre that the man beynge ī the churche shal cast all temporall & worldly busynes from his herte / in as moche as he can possyble / & onely shal occupye hym selfe with god and that thynge that he doth rede or saye / to the entent that he maye saye with Dauyd. O good lorde I haue cryed vnto the with all my herte. And that is yt thynge / to the whi¦che the preest dothe monysshe & exhorte vs in the masse sayenge / Sursum corda / that
is to saye / lyft vp your hertes to almyghty god. And than the clerke doth answere in the name of all them that do here the masse / Habemus ad dominum / whiche is to saye / we haue our hert{is} towardes god. O wold to god that it myghte be alwayes so: for yf we dyd praye as we ought to do / we shuld obteyne all thynge that we wolde desyre. And therfore god doth not regarde the wor¦des that we do speke in prayenge / but he de¦syre the herte of the mā. Wherfore Isodorus sayth: that a prayer made and sayd onely of the mouthe withoute any premedytacyon / doth as moche preuayle as the kackelynge of a henne. Wherfore whā ye wyll rede any thynge in prayenge to god for grace ye shal say thus. O good lord gyue me thy dyuyne grace to rede & saye my prayer deuoutly / to the entēt that it may be exalted of the. And yf any other thynge come in my mynde / I do reuoke now as for thā: this prayer sayd. God (as saynt Thomas doth wryte) shall receyue it all for the beste. And therfore the man shall not coueyte to rede moche / as so∣me do whiche haue sackes full of bokes / & great longe bedes / as they wolde tarye all the daye in the churche. Yet neuertheles they wyll rede all in one masse tyme / not regar∣dynge
what they do rede. But the mā must praye with a very pure herte / for the prayer ought to be feruēt deuout / & shorte of word{is} as our lorde doth showe vs in the gospell. Therfore saynt Ierome saith: yt one Pater nr̄ / sayd with deuocion / is better & more pro¦fytable thā an hondreth without deuocion. ¶ The fyfth degre or condycyon is scylence so yt the man ought to kepe hym from moch talkynge in the churche / as many folkes do not / as well men as women / yonge & olde great and small / but there do talke and ian¦gle as they were ī the hygh strete. And other some do walke vp and downe in the chur∣che showyng them selfe as they were in the market / wherby they do let & trouble other of theyr deuocyon / the whiche they haue not in them selfe. And other some there be / whi∣che do speke vnhonest & vycyous wordes / no more regardyng the temple of god than a tauerne / wherof the deuyll doth reioyse & is glad. Nowe is accōplysshed that Dauid doth speke of the Infydels and Sarazyns sayenge. Deus venetūt gentes / hoc est gen¦tiliter viuentes. &c. that is to saye: the Sara¦zyns and Infydels / that is to saye / the cry∣sten people lyuynge lyke vnto Infydels / become in to your herytage: that is io saye /
in the catholyke fayth / and haue maculate the holy temple. And without doubte / the Iewes haue greater reuerence in theyr syna¦goge / than many chrysten people haue ī the tēple of god: where god is alwayes {pre}sent in the holy sacrament of the aulter / cōsyderyn∣ge / seynge / and herynge all your wordes & thoughtes. Wherfore whan ye do entre in to the churche which is the temple of god / tour¦ne your iyes from the people and remembre your synnes / and the passyon of our lorde / and rede some good thynge. ¶ The syxte degre or condycyon that man shall haue to here masse deuoutly / is perse∣ueraūce / so that ye shall here the hole masse from the begynnynge to the endynge / and shall not out of the churche vnto it be fynys¦shed / and that the preest haue gyuen the blys¦synge / excepte great necessyte requyre it / & specyally on sondayes and other holy dayes for it is so cōmaūded by the lawe. Agaynst this some do offende which do walke in the churcheyarde there talkynge and iangelyn¦ge / and whan the preest doth lyft oure lorde in the blyssed sacrament / they do renne and entre in to the churche / as the dogge in to the kechynge / and incontynent they do go out agayne. All those that so do by custome &
doth not regarde the cōmaundement of the holy churche / they do cōmyt a deedly synne at euery tyme. O good lorde what small de¦uocyon / loue / & fere haue the people of god: they be lothe to bestowe one houre to here masse / serue god / and norysshe the soule: but they be not lothe to myspende thre or foure houres at the table in eatynge and drynkyn¦ge / for to norysshe the body the whiche shall rote and be eten with wormes. O man re∣membre of what vertue the blyssynge whi¦che the preest dothe gyue after the masse is / for his hādes haue mynystred at the aulter: the blyssed body of our lorde Ihesu chryste. So god in the olde Testament dyde blysse the chyldren / whiche were blyssed of theyr fathers / as Abrahā blyssed his sone Isaac: Isaac blyssed his sone Iacob / and Iacob all his chyldren of the .xii. generacyons of Israell / by the whiche blyssynge god oft ty¦mes dyd saue and delyuer them from many perylles and euylles. Moche more god wyl be mercyful vnto vs and kepe vs from so dayne deth: yf we do receyue with all humy¦lyte the blyssynge of the preest / at the ende of his masse / for his handes be moche more holy / thā were the hādes of the olde fathers. And by the blyssynge of the preest / we be
made worthy of the blyssynge of our lorde god in heuen. Therfore whan the preest gy¦ueth the blyssynge after masse / ye shall kne¦le downe vpon your knees: with your heed bare and inclyned towardes the grounde / in receyuynge the same. Wherof we haue many fayre examples / the whiche shuld be to prolyxe and longe to descrybe. Yet neuer theles ye shall haue twayne in shorte wor¦des here declared. ¶ Example. WE rede that there was a coue¦reur of howses: whiche beyn¦ge vpon the toppe or hyghte of a howse there workynge / sodaynly fell downe to the grounde / without hurtyng hym selfe or ha∣uynge any maner of harme. The people se∣ynge this dyd renne vnto hym / thynkynge that he was dede / and they dyd fynde hym hole & sounde: and they dyd say vnto hym. Thou haste ben well blyssed this daye / He answered and sayd it is true: for I had this daye the blyssynge / whiche the preest gaue after the masse / whose handes had touched the body of our lord Ihesu chryste. And my fayth & byleue was / that after the blyssyn∣ge which I receyued hūbly after the masse
I shulde not dye sodaynly without confes∣syon / as nowe ye maye se. ¶ Example. WE rede moreouer of two men whiche were cōpaygnons & felowes in mar¦chaundyse / of the whiche the one receyued alwayes the blyssynge of the preest / and the other neuer dyd regarde nor care for it. And one day as they were goynge in theyr iourney / there came a great tempest of thon¦dre and lyghtnynge / of the whiche tempest he that was neuer wont to receyue the blys¦synge of the preest nor to regarde it / was stryken to deth / and the other whiche was alwayes wonte to receyue the blyssynge / was saued and not hurte. ¶ The .xxiiii. Chapytre / what thynge a man shall rede whan he cōmeth fyr∣ste before the holy sacrament. ¶ Orayson. O Blissed and mercyfull lord Ihesu chryste / I cōmende this daye in the presence of thy holy body and at all ty∣mes: my soule and my body by the vertue of thy holy natyuyte: thy blys¦sed crosse / and sharpe and bytter passyon / &
thy gloryous resurreccyon. O father euerla¦stynge god almyghty / thou arte the begyn∣nynge and the ende of all creatures / thou art the waye and the trueth and the helth of al men. O father euerlastynge / I crye and call pryncypally vnto the for my helpe & ayde / by the vertue of the holy sacrament / to the entent that thou wylt defende me frō all thynge that may be hurtfull to the helth of my soule. Albeit that I am a poore syn∣ner / Yet neuerthelesse I am thy vnwor∣thy creature / redemed and delyuered by the precyous blode of thy sone. And I byle∣ue stedfastly in the: wherfore good lorde de∣fende me alwayes from all perylles and daūgers of myne enemyes vysyble and in∣uysyble / and from all venom and poyson in metes and drynkes / from shame and so∣dayne deth / by the vertue of the holy sacra∣ment / in the whiche I put all my hope and byleue. O holy and most worthy sacramēt in the which be vnyed ī godhed / the father / the sone / and the holy ghost / thou dost exalt all that do crye and call vnto the and that do byleue in the. Therfore exalte me nowe specyally in all that is necessary & helthful for my soule / & that from hensforth I maye accomplysshe and fulfyll thy wyll.
¶ The .xxv. Chapytre / what thynge the man shall rede / whan he cō∣meth before the holy crosse of our lorde Ihesu chryste. O Lorde Ihesu chryste / I pray the by the vertue of the same orayson & prayer / that thou dyddest make in great an∣guysshe and payne of herte / vnder the mount of Olyuete: where for fe¦re & drede of deth / thou dyddest swete drop∣pes of blode rennynge downe to the groun¦de. Offre and show that same blode to thy father celestyall / agaynst the multytude of my synnes / and delyuer me at the houre of deth / from all fere and drede whiche I ha∣ue deserued for my synnes. ¶ Pater noster. Aue maria. O Lorde Ihesu chryste whiche hath dy¦ed vpon the crosse for me poore syn∣ner / I pray the yt thou wylt showe & offre to thy father celestyall / all the payne and bytternes of thy passyon / and specyal∣ly whan thy blyssed soule departed out of thy blyssed body / agaynst the multytude of my synnes. And delyuer me at the houre of deth from all payne / whiche I haue deser∣ued
for the multytude of my syn̄es. Amen. ¶ Pater noster. Aue maria. O Lorde Ihesu chryste / I praye the by the inestymable loue: that caused the to descende from heuen vnto erthe / there to suffre deth vpon the crosse most cru¦elly for me poore syn̄er / to showe and offre the same vnto thy father celestyal: agaynst the multytude of my synnes. And after this lyfe to open me the gate of heuen. Amen. ¶ Pater noster. Aue maria. ¶ The .xxvi. Chapytre / what thynge the man shall rede / whan he doth come before the Image of our Lady. O Moste benygne Mary dou∣ghter of the father of heuen mother of the sone of god / espouse of the holy ghost: I praye the that as the father celestyall of his great myght & power hath exalted the in the hyghest trone of heuen / so I pray the most benygne vyrgyne and mo¦ther mary / to socoure and helpe me and all my frendes. And to defende vs from the tē¦ptacyons of our enemye. Amen. ¶ Aue maria.
O Most humble mother of Ihesu chry∣ste Mary: thou art a paradyse of ioye & the hyd treasor of the secrete of god: I pray the yt as the son of god of the myght & power of his incōprehensyble wysdome hath aorned the / that ouer and aboue al the saynt{is} thou shulde vse & haue the fruycyon most perfytly / of the face & presēce of the ho¦ly trynyte: so I pray the most pure virgyn mary / that thou stande by me & assyste me and all my frendes at the houre of deth / in remplysshynge and in puttynge in our sou¦les / the lyght of the holy catholyke fayth / to the entent that oure fayth / be not occupyed with erroure. ¶ Aue maria. O Most swete mary / beaute of the aun¦gelles / flower of the patryark{is} / may¦stres of the apostelles / courage of the martyres / swete foūtayne of the cōfessours honoure and ioye of vyrgynes / consolacy∣on & solace of all synners / I praye the that as the holy ghoost hathe remplysshed and fylled the of his swetnes and dyuyne grace to the entent that thou be the most benygne and mercyfull next after god / so I beseche the most holy & imaculate vyrgyne mary / that thou wylt be present by me and all my
frendes after the tyme of our lyfe: in shedyn¦ge and puttynge in to our soules the swete¦nes of the dyuyne dyseccyon & loue / so that we maye ioye with the and with all saynt{is} euerlastyngly. Amen. ¶ The xxvii. Chapytre / how he that doth helpe the masse ought to behaue hym. FYrste he that dothe serue & helpe the preest at masse / he muste beware that he do not beholde the preest / in the face. ¶ Secōdaryly / that whi¦che he doth gyue to the preest / he shall gyue it with both his handes. ¶ Thyrdly / he shall be dylygent to proue and knowe the water from the wyne. ¶ Fourthly / he shall absteyne in as moche as he maye / from to moche spyttynge and kowghynge or makynge any noyse / specy¦ally whan the preest is in his Memento. ¶ Fyfthly / he shall not greatly gyue his mynde to rede any prayers in the masse ty∣me: but rather shal take hede dylygētly that there do lacke nothynge / and shall kepe dog¦ges from the aulter.
¶ Syxtly / he shall not knele betwene the courteyne & the aulter / in beholdynge what the preest doth vpon the aulter. Also he shal not knele behynde the curteynes: but shal be of the one syde of the preest / partely behyn∣de hym. ¶ Seuenthly / he shall take hede that he do answere the preest perfytely: and that he do lyghte the candell of waxe in tyme / and to put it out whan the preest after the masse hath gyuen the blyssynge. And whan the preest hath fynysshed his fyrste Memento / he shall prepare hym selfe to lyght the torche or candell in tyme / and to rynge the lytell bell to the eleuacyon. ¶ Eyghtly / he shall take hede that he be pu∣re and clene in his conscyence / that is to say that he haue contrycyon of all his synnes / & also that he be clene without ī his body and in his handes: so that he do not fyle the boke towelles / aulter clothes / or other aornemē∣tes. He shall take hede also / that he do not touche the chalyce / patyne / or corporas / for yf he do he doth offende. ¶ Nynthly / he shall folde the vestementes & the aornementes honestly after the masse: and shal laye them in theyr place. And this done he maye deserue and meryte moche.
¶ The .xxviii. Chapytre / howe euery man shall gladly helpe and serue at the masse / for syxe reasons. THe fyrste reason is / for the seruy¦ce that we do to the preest in the masse tyme / god wyll rewarde vs for it as we had done it vn¦to hym selfe: for the preest is not there before the aulter as syr Iohn̄: but he is there as the sone of god hathe hanged vpon the crosse ¶ The seconde reason is / that to serue god the man of hym is made. And therfore there is no man so myghty of power nor so no∣ble / that ought to be ashamed to serue god. For oure lorde Ihesu chryste sayth / he that is ashamed to serue me: I wyl also be asha¦med of hym afore my father celestyall. O with what loue and dylygence shulde we serue hym / whiche hath gyuen syght vnto vs beynge blynde / the whiche (we beynge pryuate of our handes & fete) hathe restored them agayne vnto vs: and we beyng deed he hathe resuscytate vs to lyfe / and moche more hath god done for vs. ¶ The thyrde reason is / for to the entent yt we serue our lorde god / he hath cōmaunded his aūgelles to serue vs and to kepe vs / to
the entent that we may come to heuen / whe¦re the sone of god hym selfe shall serue vs. ¶ The fourth reason is / for to the entent yt we shulde be more bounde to serue hym / he hath made hym selfe man mortall / & hathe serued vs in his owne persone / by the space of .xxxiii. yeres in great pouertie and myse∣rye / wherfore by all ryght we be bounde to serue hym. And yet moche more hath he don for vs / he hathe shed his blode for vs / and suffred dethe for vs / to the entent that we maye reygne with hym in his glorye. ¶ The fyfth reason is / for god hath made all thynges to serue vs / as in heuen the aū∣gelles / the sonne / the moone / and the fyrma¦mēt / in the ayre the byrdes / in erth the beest{is} and other creatures: in the water the fysshes to the entent that by them we shulde be mo¦nysshed to serue hym. ¶ The syxte reason is / for god shall gyue hym that gladly doth helpe and serue at the masse / a synguler rewarde in heuen / more than to other herynge the masse onely / as it is wryten. ¶ The .xxix. Chapytre / what fruytes he receyueth of god / that serueth gladly and deuoutly at the masse.
THe fyrste vertue is / that god doth neuer suffre suche a per∣sone to fall so farre in synne / but that he shall ryse sooner out of the same by true penaū¦ce / than another that doth not helpe ne ser∣ue at the masse. ¶ The seconde vertue or fruyte is / that su∣che a persone is not onely preserued & kepte as another man of his propre aungell / but also there be many other aungelles nyghe vnto hym: and alwayes redy to helpe hym and prayenge for hym. ¶ The thyrde vertue is / that the good wor¦kes whiche he doth / be more acceptable vn∣to god and more profytable to men / as wel lyuynge as beynge deed / than of other whi¦che do not helpe and serue at the masse. ¶ The fourth vertue is: that he which doth helpe and serue at the masse / shall be in all his busynes and causes more dyscryte and wyse than other men. ¶ The fyfth vertue is / that the mercye of god shall neuer forsake that man ī his great necessyte / but shall alwayes be redy at his most nede. ¶ The syxte vertue is / that god shall gy∣ue hym / whiche deuoutly and dylygently
helpeth and serueth at the masse: a synguler grace here in erthe / and a great rewarde in heuen / as he sayth ī the gospell / he that doth serue and mynystre vnto me in the erth / he shall be honoured of my father ī heuen. For to helpe and serue at the masse / is a seruyce appertaynynge vnto aungelles. Yet neuer∣thelesse god wyll be serued of man in erth. Therfore euery man ought gladly helpe & serue at the masse / for it is no shame / but great honoure to serue god. The fathers ou¦ghte to cause theyr chyldren to lerne to helpe masse / for that person shall not serue god in heuen: whiche hath not serued hym in erth. ¶ The .xxx. Chapytre / yf women maye helpe and serue at the masse. YT is prohybyte & forbyd in the Canon lawe / for women to preche openly / or to gyue insence vpon the aulter / or to touche the chalyce / the patyne / or cor¦poras. And therfore the women shall not wasshe the lynnen clothes of the same afore that the preest hath wasshed them. But that women maye not helpe the masse / we haue
not so great cōmaūdement in the lawe / for the holy churche doth admyt the spyrytuall persones: and maydens maye helpe and ser¦ue at the masse ī necessyte / whiche they shal not do yf there be any man present that can do it. wherfore the maydens whā they shal helpe the masse in necessytye / they shall al∣wayes loke deuoutly afore them / and shall not beholde the preest in the face / But they shal knele down honestly behynde the prest and shall not come to nere the aulter for the dygnyte of the holy sacrament. ¶ The .xxxi. Chapytre / yf the mynyster maye helpe and serue and here the ho∣ly masse all togyther. And also yf a man maye here many masses togyther & at one tyme with as great meryte / as yf he herde euery masse by it selfe. AS the doctours do wryte: the lyfe of all good and iuste ca∣tholyke people is as a cōpa∣ny of marchaūtes in the whi¦che that yt the one doth wyn the other doth lease. So it is with all them
that be in the loue and grace of god and of holy churche / so that they be not onely parte takers of the masse at the which they be pre¦sent with theyr iyes / but also so longe as they be in the state of grace and ī the loue of god / they be parte takers of all the good de∣des that be done in the holy churche through out all this worlde / of all good and iust ca∣tholyke people. And the cōtrarye is of them whiche be in deedly synne / which do not me¦ryte for them selfe any rewarde ī heuen / for they be deed afore god and also theyr good workes. O yf the syn̄er dyd remembre this in takynge it to the herte / what goodnesse shulde come vnto hym. ¶ The .xxxii. Chapytre / what the aornementes of the preest / dothe sygnyfye. FYrste the aulter where the preest sayth the masse / doth sygnyfye the crosse of oure lorde god. ¶ Item the preest at the aulter / doth sygnyfye our lorde vpon the crosse. ¶ Item the chalyce afore the preest / doth sy∣gnyfye the sepulchre of our lorde. ¶ Item the corporas sygnyfyeth the lynnē
cloth / in the which our lorde was wrapped in the sepulchre. ¶ Item the lynnen cloth of the chalyce / sy∣gnyfyeth the lytell cloth put vpon the face of oure lorde in the sepulchre / for to wype the swete. ¶ Item the patyne of the chalyce sygnyfy∣eth the stone that dyd couer the sepulchre. ¶ Item the amys which the preest doth put on his heed / sygnyfyeth the cloth whiche the Iewes dyd bynde afore the iyes of our lord whan they dyd mocke hym. ¶ Item the albe whiche is whyte and lon∣ge / sygnyfyeth the whyte and longe robe / wherwith Herode dyde cloth oure lorde in derysyon. ¶ Item the longe stoyle that the preest hath aboute his necke / sygnyfyeth the corde the whiche the Iewes dyd cast about the necke of our lorde / and afterwarde about his bo∣dy whan they dyd take hym in the garthen. ¶ Item the short stoyle or maniple the whi¦che the preest hath on his left arme sygnyfy¦eth the corde with the whiche the handes of our lorde were bounde / for whan they dyde vnbynde hym they left the corde hangynge at the left hande. ¶ Item the corde / wherwith the preest is
gyrde / sygnyfyeth the corde wherwith oure lorde Ihesus was bounde to the pyller. ¶ Item the chesuble whiche is the vpper vestement of the preest / closed behynde and before and withoute fasshon open of bothe sydes / sygnyfyeth the robe of purple / wher¦with Pylate dyde cloth our lorde whan he dyd mocke hym. ¶ Item the crosse vpon the chesuble vpon the sholdres of the preest & goth to the groū∣de behynde / sygnyfyeth the heuye crosse of our lorde of .xv. fote of length / the whiche he bare vpon his sholdres vpon the mount of Caluarye. ¶ Item the crowne of the heed of the preest doth sygnyfye the crowne of thornes / whi∣che our lorde ware vpon his heed. ¶ Item the lytell peac{is} vpon the albe vpō the handes of the preest / and also hangyng behynde and before at the fete of the preest / do sygnyfye the great nayles / whiche were stryken through the handes and fete of our lorde vpon the crosse. ¶ Item the breade whiche is consecrate / is verely the blyssed body of oure lorde / And the wyne after the consecracyon / is the pre∣cyous blode of our lorde habundaūtly shed vpō the crosse. This may a symple person
whiche can not rede thus thynke and remē∣bre in the masse tyme / and to occupye hym selfe with the passyon of our lorde. ¶ The .xxxiii. Chapytre / what vertue or fruyte doth consyst and lye in de∣uoutly herynge masse: the whiche vertues be in .xii. maners. THe fyrste vertue or fruyte is / as some doctours do wryte / that the man doth meryte mo¦re whyles that he dothe here masse deuoutely / than yf he shulde gyue for godes sake / as moche groū¦de & lande as he could passe and go ouer in the space of the same masse. O what maye he than deserue whiche doth here euery daye thre or foure masses. And what doth he lea∣se / & what compte shall he make afore god at the daye of iugement / whiche hath not so great busynesse / but that he maye here one masse at the left euery daye. O what it shal greue you that ye haue lost so moche. This ye shall vnderstande accordynge to the dy∣gnyte and excellentnes of the masse. ¶ The seconde vertue is / that the holy aū∣gelles be glad to be nyghe vnto that person
in kepynge hym whan he hath herde masse. As Dauid sayth / god dyde cōmaunde his aungelles to kepe and preserue you / in all your wayes and busynes. ¶ The thyrde vertue is: that the man behol¦dynge with deuocyon and reuerence the ho∣ly sacrament in the masse / as saynt Austyn sayth / god doth gyue hym that same daye al thyng{is} necessary for his body. Item vayne wordes and vnaduysed othes be forgyuen and pardoned / and he is preserued from so∣dayn deth. A man doth lease no tyme why¦les that he doth here masse. All the steppes in cōmynge and in goynge / be compted of the holy aungell. And yf the man dyed the same daye that he hath herde masse without receyuynge the sacramēt / god shall compte it as spyrytually receyued. ¶ The fourth vertue is / that the person be¦ynge in synne ofte tymes in the masse tyme by the presence of the holy sacrament / doth receyue a good īspyracion: so that from thēs¦forth he doth conuerte hym from his synnes As the good thefe vpon the crosse / Mary Magdaleyne afore the fete of our lorde. Yf they had not ben present with our lorde / per¦auenture they shulde not haue had pardon of theyr synnes.
¶ The fyfth vertue or fruyte is: yt the man herynge masse deuoutly / receyueth spūally the holy sacramēt so that he desyre it deuout¦ly. And so it maye chaunce that the man he¦rynge masse deuoutly / shall obteyne more grace than the preest whiche doth it / for the preest is not alwayes egally well disposed And so maye the man euery daye / receyue the holy sacrament spyrytually. ¶ The syxte vertue is / that the man heryn¦ge masse and beynge in the state of grace / is parte taker of all the masses done through∣out all the worlde / and that is more or lesse after as the man is in the loue and fauoure of god. For it is one of the artycles of the ho¦ly catholyke fayth / as in the cōmunyon of the holy churche. ¶ The seuenth vertue is / that the prayer of them whiche do here the masse / is sooner her¦de and exalted of god in the masse tyme / than at any other tyme / for than the preest & the holy aūgelles which be about the aulter do helpe you to praye. ¶ The eyght vertue is / that the soules be∣ynge in purgatorye / whyles that the man doth here the masse and doth praye for them haue a synguler absolucyon durynge the sa¦me masse / for there is nothynge that dothe
brynge them so shortly out of the paynes of purgatorye / as to cause to saye or to here de∣uoutly masse for them. ¶ The nynth vertue is / that it is better to here one masse in our lyfe tyme: than to cau¦se an hondreth to be sayd or herde for vs af¦ter our dethe. And also that it is better that the man cause a masse to be sayd for hym in his lyfe: thā an hondreth after his deth. The reason is / for the man maye nowe deserue & meryte moche with a masse / but not after his deth: but onely that he dothe fynde that thynge / whiche he hath deserued in his lyfe. An hondreth thousāde masses nowe done can not augment one moment of glory & ioye after this tyme: but by a masse whiche I do here / I maye obteyne that I shall not come in purgatorye / but after our deth / the masse delyuereth onely from purgatorye. Is it not better than not to come in to pur∣gatorye / than whan a man is there to tary and loke for ayde & helpe to be delyuered. ¶ The tenth vertue is / that a woman he∣ryng masse deuoutly / yf it chaunce that she do labour of chylde that same daye / she shal be delyuered (without faulte) the more ease∣ly & with lesse payne / for the holy aūgelles be veray busye and dylygent aboute her.
Therfore all women beynge with chylde / yf it be possyble shall here masse euery daye for by the vertue of the same / the fruyte or chylde is preserued. And thā shall put theyr trust in the holy sacrament & in our blyssed Lady the mother of god / and in none other thynge. ¶ The eleuenth vertue is / that all thynge that man doth enterpryse after that he hath herde masse / doth prospere and com to good ende. And that whiche the man doth eate & drynke after he hath herde masse / dothe pro∣fyte more to the necessyte of nature. ¶ The twelfth vertue is / that yf the man dye the same daye that he hathe herde masse / god shall gyue hym a synguler grace which otherwyse he shulde not haue had. That is say to that god hym self or his aungelles at the laste houre of his deth: shall helpe & con∣forte hym as the man hath serued god at the masse. For it is wryten in the holy gospell / with the same measure that ye haue measured / with the same also I wyll measure you euerlastyngly. Amen. ¶ Thus endeth the fyrst boke of the masse. And here foloweth the seconde.
¶ Prologue. HEre begynneth the secon¦de boke of the masse whi¦che is dyuyded in thre: as the lyfe of our lorde is dy¦uyded in thre dyuerse ty∣mes / & these thre tymes be cōprehende in .xxxiii. yeres. Also the masse is dyuyded in thre par¦tyes / & the thre partyes in .xxxiii. artycles. ¶ The fyrste tyme is / from his humanyte vnto his passyon / and that doth sygnyfye the begynnynge of the masse: vnto the Ca∣non or Sanctus. ¶ The seconde tyme / from his passyon vn¦to his resurreccyon / and that doth sygnyfye from Sanctus vnto that the preest haue re¦ceyued the sacrament. ¶ The thyrde tyme / from that vnto the fy¦nysshynge of the masse / & that doth sygny∣fye after his resurreccyon / vnto that tyme that our lorde dyd ascende ī to heuen. Vpon euery tyme is a prayer / by the which a man maye deserue veray pardon. As of our La∣dy .xi.M. yeres / in the honoure of his huma∣nyte: of saynt Gregorye .xlvi.M. yeres / & in the honour of his passyon and resurreccy¦on .lxxx.M. yeres. Som̄e. C.xxxvii.M.
yeres: & at euery artycle is a deuoute prayer as to pray to almyghty god to obteyn some vertue or to eschewe synne. ¶ The holy father pope Syxtus the .iiii. of that name / hath gyuen .xi.M. yeres of par∣don so ofte as in the state of grace / with de∣uocyon a mā doth say this prayer folowyn¦ge afore the Image of our Lady: in the whi¦che prayer a man may clerely vnderstande and perceyue / that Mary the holy mother of our lorde Ihesu chryste / is a pure and a cle∣ne vyrgyne / and was conceyued without any spotte of orygynall synne / the whiche is clerely declared in this prayer / where it is sayde / thou arte conceyued without synne. And of this indulgēce or pardon / is a fayre Bull in the cytie of Coleyne. BLyssed be thou Mary holy mother of god / quene of heuen / gate of parady∣se / lady of the worlde / thou arte a syn¦guler pure vyrgyne cōceyued without syn̄e Thou haste borne and ben delyuered of the creatoure / redemoure / and sauyoure of this worlde / wherin I do not doubte but sted∣fastly do byleue. Praye for my synnes & de∣lyuer and kepe me from all euyll. Amen.

HOwe the preest doth ma∣ke hym redy in the vestry to saye masse / and the dea¦con and subdeacon do hel¦pe hym / but the preest alo∣ne doth take & caste vpon hym the chesuble: which doth sygnyfie how chryste hath taken vpon hym the nature of man / and was cōceyued in the vestry of the blyssed body of our lady / wherin the father and the holy ghost haue gyuen ayde & helpe The mynystrer or he that doth helpe to ser∣ue at the masse / doth sygnyfye the aungell Gabryell. ¶ Orayson. Pater nr̄. Aue maria. O Blyssed lorde Ihesu chryste / I do thanke the that by the wyl of thy fa¦ther celestyall / thou hast ben concey∣ued by the operacyon of the holy ghoost / in the blyssed body of the vyrgyne mary in al clennes and without any spotte of synne / I beseche the good lord by the meryte of thy dere mother / that I whiche haue ben concey¦ued in malyce and synne / may be puryfyed of all my synnes. Amen.

Amen. ¶ The thyrde artycle of the masse. HOwe the preest beynge betwene thē sayth with great deuocyon Confite¦or / and doth confesse hym selfe as a

Pater nr̄. Aue maria.

Amen. ¶ The fourth artycle of the masse. HOwe the preest after Cōfiteor gothe to the aulter with great reuerence / & lowly inclynyng hym selfe doth worshyppe god almyghty / whiche doth sygny¦fye vnto vs / howe the thre Kynges with

Amen. ¶ The fyfth artycle of the masse.

O Blyssed lorde Ihesu chryste / I than¦ke the that thou hast suffred deuout∣ly and obedyently thy selfe to be pre∣sented ī the temple by the soueraygne preest to the entent that we maye be present in he∣uen with the father celestyall. Wherfore fa∣ther celestyall / I do offre accordynge as I am worthy this daye in the masse / Ihesu chryste thy onely sone for all my syn̄es: and praye the that this oblacyon be not loste in me. Amen. ¶ The .vi. Artycle of the masse. HOwe the preest / the deacon and sub¦deacon do go from the aulter / & the preest and the deacon do sytte them downe / and the subdeacon doth synge the epystell. This doth sygnyfie vnto vs how Ihesus Mary and Ioseph fled out of theyr countre from the face of Herode where they dyd dwell in to Egypte / where Ioseph la∣boured for them. ¶ Orayson. Pater nr̄.

Amen. ¶ The .vii. Artycle of the masse. HOwe the preest dothe come agayne to the aulter / where dylygently he doth rede the gospell. This sygnyfy¦eth howe Ihesus Mary and Ioseph / haue retourned from Egypte in to theyr countre from whens they fled / by the cōmaūdemēt of the holy aungell. ¶ Orayson. Pater nr̄. Aue maria.

Amen. HEre endeth the seconde boke of the masse / trea∣tynge of the lyfe / passy∣on / and resurreccyon of our lord Ihesu chryste / in the which euery good catholyke person maye be in his deuocyon occupyed / and specyally in the masse tyme. For as doctours do wry∣te there be .xii. vertues in remembrynge the
lyfe and passyon of our lorde. ¶ The fyrste vertue is / that the synner ofte tymes is conuerted therby / from his euyll & peruerse lyuynge to good and holy lyuyng so that god graunt hym repentaunce of his synnes / true confessyon and penaunce afo∣re his deth. ¶ The seconde vertue is / that the remem∣braunce of the passyon of our lorde is a me∣dycyne agaynst the tēptacyon of the deuyll. For howe great soeuer the temptacyon be / yf the man remembre cordyally the passyon of oure lorde / tournynge his iyes deuoutly vpon the crosse of god / he shal be delyuered from the temptacyon. ¶ The thyrde vertue is / that our lord wyl make a sure and a stedfaste peace betwene the synner and his father celestyall. ¶ The fourth vertue is / that all trybulacy¦ons: aduersytes / syckenes / dyseases / displea¦sures / and temptacyons / shall be easye and lyght for that man to bere / whiche doth re∣membre the passyon of our lorde. For saynt Gregorye sayth / there is no grefe / dysease / nor displeasure / but we may lyghtly vayn¦quysshe it / yf we do remembre deuoutly the passyon of our lorde. ¶ The fyfthe vertue is / that suche a person
hath more knowlege of god what his wyll is to be done or not to be done / thā the other. ¶ The syxte vertue is / that oure lorde gy∣ueth deuocyon to suche men and doth exalt theyr prayer. And therfore whan the man is drye of deuocyon / he shall tourne hym sel¦fe to the passyon of our lorde where he shall fynde swetnes and abundaunt deuocyon / And also whā any man wyll praye to our lorde for any thynge / be it for hym selfe or for any other quycke or deed / he shall occu∣pye hym selfe fyrste in one of the artycles of the passyon of our lorde: wherin he hath the most deuocyon: and in suche medytacyon he shall praye / and without doubte yf the thyn¦ge that he dothe desyre be to the helth of his soule / he shall obteyne it or elles a better. ¶ The seuenth vertue is / as saynt Bernar¦de sayth / that god is present & nere to hym that doth remembre his passyon / and so oft as the man doth drawe his breth and dothe take it of the ayre / so ofte dothe he receyue a specyall grace in his soule. ¶ The eyght vertue / is that the man in re∣membrynge hertely the passyon of our lor∣de / maye obteyne more grace than yf all the holy churches / or all the men in the worlde shulde praye for hym.
¶ The nynth vertue is / that the remem∣braunce & medytacyon of oure lorde Ihesu chryste / doth passe and surmount all other corporall operacyōs / and is acceptable vn∣to god aboue all thynges / after that man hath done true penaunce for his syn̄es. For as Albertus magnus doth wryte / it is bet∣ter for man to remembre one poynte of the passyon of our lord / than to fast an hole ye∣re breade and water: or to scourge hym selfe tyll he make the blode renne out / or to saye the hole psalter. ¶ The tenth vertue is / that the hertye and feruent medytacyon of the passyon of oure lord is more profytable to man / than yf our lady and all the sayntes in heuen dyd pray for hym: that is to vnderstande accordynge and after the dygnyte of the passyon of god For in the prayer of sayntes dothe not con∣syste our helth: as in the passyon of our lor∣de Ihesu chryste. ¶ The eleuenth vertue is / yt the man whi¦che hath lost & myspent his yonge age / may recouer that whiche he hath lost and consu∣med / yf deuoutly and hertely he occupy and exercyse hym selfe with the passyon of god: So that in shorte space he may obteyne as great rewarde of god / as another in longe
tyme whiche doth not occupye hym selfe in the passyon of god. ¶ The twelfth vertue is / that god shall ayde and conforte suche a man in the houre of deth / & shall not departe from hym vnto he come to a good ende / & sauely be brought to euerlastynge lyfe. To the whiche the fa∣ther / the sone / and the holy ghost brynge vs all. Amen. ¶ Here begynneth the thyrde boke / contey∣nynge & showynge howe a man shall confesse hym and prepare hym selfe to receyue the holy and blyssed Sacrament / and what he shall rede than. ¶ The prologue. EGo sū panis viuus qi de celo descēdit: si qis mādu cauerit ex hoc pane / vi∣uet īeternū. Iohīs sexto In the whiche wordes our lorde doth resē∣ble hym selfe to breade sayenge. I am the ly¦uynge breade / he that doth eate of this brea∣de shall lyue euerlastyngly / not that this breade after the consecracyon doth lyue / but
this breade is conuerted in to lyuely flesshe and blode / albeit that it doth resemble and appere lyke breade / And that for foure rea∣sons. ¶ Fyrste / for the breade noryssheth the man more than any other meate / so also the holy Sacrament doth norysshe the soule of man aboue all thynge / for a thynge is full whā there can no more enter therin. The soule of man is of so great importaūce: that no crea¦ture in heuen nor in erth can or maye fyll it / but god onely whiche hath made and four∣med it. This ye maye consydre / for albeit yt man shuld haue al the ioye & all the goodes of the worlde / yet wolde he more haue and desyre / as those that haue a thousande poū∣des / wolde yet haue .x. thousande / and tho∣se that haue .x. thousande / wolde haue .xx. thousande. And therfore the herte of man is neuer content / haue he neuer so moche: ex¦cepte that he haue god in his soule / for he is so great that he onely can fyll satysfye and content it. And therfore they do erre whiche do saye / yf I had suche a thynge I shuld be content. O man / yf thou haddest all the worlde as kynge Alexandre had / yf thou haue not our lord Ihesu chryste in thy herte yet shall thou not be content. For as saynt
Austyn sayth. O good lorde thou hast ma∣de vs after thy dyuyne Image & lykenes. And therfore our herte is not content tyll it come vnto the / my herte maye be occupyed with & in all thynges / but thou onely good lorde maye remplysshe and fyll it. ¶ Secondaryly / oure lorde dothe resemble hym selfe to breade / for naturally a mā can not lyue without breade / and breade dothe fortyfye the herte and gyueth lyfe to man / So spyrytually the man can not lyue in the soule / without vsynge and receyuynge re∣uerently the holy sacrament / For by recey∣uynge reuerently the holy sacrament / a mā doth not onely lyue but also he is preserued here in erth / in vertue / ī prosperyte / in grace and also hereafter in heuen in ioye / whiche god hym selfe hath promysed vs sayenge / He that dothe eate of this breade shall lyue euerlastyngly. ¶ Thyrdly: albeit that the breade is necessa¦ry for man as concernynge the body / yet ne¦uertheles it is very euyl & daūgerous eaten in foure maners. So is it also of the holy sa¦crament whiche is the breade of the soule. ¶ Fyrste / the breade eaten in angre & with impacyence / bryngeth & causeth great dysea¦se and syckenes to the man: for the naturall
hete of the man whiche dothe consume and dysgest the meate / doth apply & gyue it selfe to the angre and impacyentnes / and not to the meate. So is it also with them that re∣ceyue the holy sacrament beynge in malyce & enuye: for theyr synnes wherof they be cō∣fessed / be not pardoned and forgyuen them And as saynt Ambrose wryteth / the man receyueth of god suche pardon of his syn̄es / as he gyueth and pardoneth his neyghbour and euen chrysten / for suche persones do set theyr myndes more to dystroye theyr ene∣myes / than to serue god. ¶ Secōdaryly / he that doth eate the breade or meate whiche is not well hādled / dressed or apoynted / shall fynde it very vnholso∣me. So is it also with them that do receyue the holy sacrament / without a feruent pre∣paracyon of deuocyon / as of contrycyon & confessyon which be necessary for the man. For as saynt Paule saythe / the man shall proue hym selfe fyrste / that is to saye howe he is dysposed in his conscyence / afore that he receyue the holy sacrament / and than he shall go there. ¶ Thyrdly / it is very vnholsome to take and eate to moche of brede or of mete: for all fyllynge and excesse & specyally of breade
is euyll as the Phesycyens do saye. So is it also of the holy sacrament / that is to saye / whan the man wyll enquyre further and knowe more thā it doth belonge vnto hym where it is cōmaūded vnto hym to knowe or to byleue / he doth fall in a great dysease and syckenes in his soule as the Herytykes whiche byleue not in the holy sacrament: by¦cause that it is aboue theyr vnderstandyn∣ge / the whiche (as Salomon sayth) be spoy¦led of grace and of glory hereafter in heuen. For as saynt Bonauenture sayth / there be .xxiii. mysteryes hyd and closed in the sacra¦ment which do surmount and passe all our vnderstandynge. ¶ Fourthly / the breade or meate is not hol∣some yf that the man do slepe incontynent after that he haue taken it / for therby do pro¦cede and come feuers and other dyseases as Auycene sayth. So is it also of the holy sa∣crament / that is to saye / whan the man af∣ter that he hath receyued the holy sacrament dothe fall incontynent agayne in to deedly synne / so that he doth not kepe the grace of the holy sacrament / he doth lease all his ver¦tues by hym done / and his soule is deed afo¦re god. And so longe as he is yet in synne / so longe he is in dampnacyon of his soule.
Therfore saynt Iohan Euangelyste sayth be well ware that thou do not lease that / yt thou hast done / to the ende that thou maye receyue a great rewarde in heuen. ¶ Fourthly / wherfore our lorde doth resem¦ble hym selfe to breade is / that in all maner that the naturall breade is apoynted and la¦boured for the profyte of the body / so is also the lyuynge breade spyrytually apoynted / in the holy sacrament. ¶ Fyrste / for to sawe the corne fructefully a man muste take the tyme conuenyent for the same / as the last parte of the yere. This doth sygnyfie howe our lord had made hym selfe man / in the laste age of this worlde / whan it had dured .v.M.C.xcix. yeres. ¶ Secondaryly / by the sede caste in to the erth / we vnderstande the humanyte of our lorde buryed and couerte in erth. ¶ Thyrdly / by the erth in the whiche the se¦de was caste / we vnderstande the blyssed body of oure lady / in the whiche oure lorde hath rested. ¶ Fourthly / the erth ought to be donged yt it may be fertyll / and yet alwayes it is este¦med as nothynge worth. We vnderstande by this the parfounde humylyte of the blys∣sed vyrgyne mary / the which dyd not repu¦te
and esteme her selfe to be the worthy ser∣uaunt of our lorde god. ¶ Fyfthly / the erth muste be laboured and tourned. This doth sygnyfye howe mary was tourned by consent to receyue the sone of god in her vyrgynall wombe. ¶ Syxtly / there is a seruaunt that doth le∣de and guyde the horses tournynge the erth. This doth sygnyfie the aungell Gabryell berynge the message / and dysyrynge her consent. ¶ Seuenthly / the erth oughte to be moyste with the rayne celestyall / for otherwyse the corne wolde not sprynge and come forth of the grounde / whiche doth sygnyfye the holy ghost descended from heuen / makynge the blyssed vyrgyne mary apte and mete to be the mother of the sone of god / and she to be styll a vyrgyne. ¶ Eyghtly / the corne is couered vnder the erth that a man can not se it. This doth sy∣gnyfye the meruaylous concepcyon of oure lord / by the which the humanyte was vny¦ed with the deyte / the whiche thynge howe it was done / it doth passe the vnderstādyn¦ge of all creatures. ¶ Nynthly / after that the corne hath ben a longe space in the erth / and that it is rype /
it is cut & layed on the grounde. This doth sygnyfye how after that our lord had rested nyne monethes in the wombe of our lady / he was borne lyenge vpon the colde erth. ¶ Tenthly / whan the corne hathe rested a lytell vpon the grounde / it is taken vp & bounde togyther. This doth sygnyfye how our lady dyd take vp her dere sone from the grounde / byndynge his membres in poore lynnen clothes. ¶ Eleuenthly / after that the corne is so boū¦de / it is layde in the grange or barne. This doth sygnyfye howe our lady dyd laye her chylde in the crybbe of an Oxe stall: betwe¦ne an Oxe and an Asse. ¶ Twelfthly / whan the corne hath ben a certayne space in the grange or barne / and that the man wyl vse it to his profyte / it is taken & caste downe from the mowe to be thrasshed. This doth sygnyfye howe after that oure lorde had rested .xxxiii. yeres / he was taken from the company of his dyscy∣ples by the Iewes / who caste hym downe to the erth. ¶ The .xiii. the corne is thrasshed and all to bette on euery syde hygh & lowe. This doth sygnyfye howe the Iewes dyde caste hym downe moste cruelly before them / betynge
and scourgynge hym / hygh and lowe: afore and behynde and on euery syde / those that were the seruaūtes of Pylate & the Iewes. ¶ The .xiiii. a man doth clense it and caste it in the fan from one syde to another. This sygnyfyeth howe swete Ihesus was sent and ledde from Annas to Cayphas / from Cayphas to Pylate / from Pylate to Hero¦de / and agayne from Herode to Pylate / as from one Iuge to another. ¶ The .xv. the corne is gronne and broken so yt there is no parte therof left hole. This doth sygnyfye howe our lorde beynge boū∣de to a pyller / was so sore bette / scourged & wounded / that from the toppe of his heed vnto the solles of his fete was not one pla¦ce lefte hole. The two heuye stones of the myll / were the Iewes and Romaynes / as the seruauntes and sergeauntes of Pylate. ¶ The .xvi. the corne thus broken is cyfted & caused to passe through the cyue / whiche is full of lytell holes. This doth sygnyfye howe Ihesus after that he was scourged was crowned with a crown of thorne / the whiche dyd make many holles in his blys∣sed heed wherof dyd tenne downe his blys∣sed blode abundauntly. ¶ The .xvii. the swete flowre or mele / is
mynged or myxte / with daughe or sowre paste. This dothe sygnyfye howe Pylate hath gyuen and myxte the bytter sentence of deth / with the humanyte of oure lorde Ihesu chryste. ¶ The .xviii. the breade thus myxte & ma∣de / it is couered with a cloth. This doth sy∣gnyfye howe after the sentence gyuen by Pylate / the Iewes dyd cloth our lorde a∣gayne with his owne clothes. ¶ The .xix. the breade begynneth to ascen∣de & ryse. This doth sygnyfye howe swete Ihesus charged with the heuye crosse / dyd ascende vp to the mount of Caluerye. ¶ The .xx. the ouen is prepared for to bake the breade. This doth sygnyfye that the Ie¦wes dyd prepare the crosse / for to crucyfye our lorde vpon the same. ¶ The .xxi. the fyre is put in to the ouen / wherwith it is made hotte. This dothe sy∣gnyfye the brennynge & feruent loue / wher¦with the herte of our lorde was kyndled & set on fyre for to saue mankynde. ¶ The .xxii. the cooles & asshes be drawen out of the ouen & the ouen made clene. This doth sygnyfye howe our lorde ones agayne was spoyled of his robes by the Iewes / & was lefte all naked.
¶ The .xxiii. the breade is put in to the ouen to be baked. This doth sygnyfie that the Ie¦wes dyd cast our lorde vpon the crosse and there dyd fasten and nayle hym with great nayles. ¶ The .xxiiii. than the ouen is iust stopped that there go none ayre forthe of it. This dothe sygnyfye that the sonne was darke & stopped from his lyghte at the deth of oure lorde Ihesu chryste. ¶ Fynally whan the breade is well baked it is drawen out of the ouen. This doth sy∣gnyfye howe after that our lorde was wel dryed and baked with the hete of the sonne / he was taken downe from the crosse. And as a man doth shytte & locke vp the breades so was the body of our lorde buryed / shytte fast and kepte / and the thyrde daye dyd ryse from deth. All this done / the breade is perfy¦te / wherof our lorde Ihesu chryste doth spe∣ke sayenge. I am the lyuynge breade descen¦ded from heuen: all those that do eate of this breade shall lyue euerlastyngly. O what it is swete to here in the eres of synners. Our lorde doth moue & exorte vs poore synners spoyled and voyde of all vertues / to recey¦ue his blyssed body for the meate and resec∣cyon of our soule. But O good lorde man
maye say / what am I that wolde presume to receyue the: for neyther heuen nor erth can not cōprehende the / and shall I receyue the. O good lorde / howe shall I be so bolde as to receyue the / whiche hath done no maner of good afore thy face / but ofte tymes haue greued and offended thy dyuynyte. The ho¦ly aungelles tremble for fere in thy presence and the iust men fere and doubt thy power: and yet exhorteth and moueth me to recey∣ue the. O most benygne lord Ihesu yf thou haddest not spoken this / who wold byleue it. Yf thou haddest not cōmaūded this / who wolde haue ben so bolde as to do it. Noe the iust and good man was an hondreth yeres in preparynge a shyppe to saue eyght perso¦nes. And howe myght I prepare my selfe in so lytell space to receyue the / whiche hast made heuen / erth and all creatures. Moyses thy faythfull seruaunt and frende / made a tabernacle of precyous wode couered with golde / for to put in the tables of thy .x. cō∣maundemētes / and Ian vnclene creature shuld I presume to receyue the: whiche hath made all lawes & all creatures. Salomon the prudent kynge was .vii. yeres ī makyn¦ge a precyous temple for to honoure & wor∣shyp the there / & there dyd offre thousandes
of offrynges / and I a poore synner howe shall I be so bolde as to receyue the in my soule / whiche hath not occupyed my selfe de¦uoutly one houre of this daye. O good lord what great dylygence haue they gyuen in the olde testament for to please the / & howe lytell haue I trauayled and busyed me to receyue the worthely. There is great dyfferē¦ce betwene the tabernacle of Moyses with the relyques / and thy blyssed body. Yf they haue showed suche deuocyon afore the arche or tabernacle of the testament / moche more shulde I prepare my selfe to receyue the blys¦sed body of our lorde Ihesu chryste in the ho¦ly sacrament. O father of heuen albeit that I shulde be a thousande yeres in preparyn∣ge my selfe / and that I shuld haue the holy¦nes of all saynt{is}: the charyte of all aūgelles and archaūgelles / the desyre of all iust per∣nes / yet neuertheles I knowlege my selfe vnworthy to receyue thy onely sone Ihesu chryste in the holy sacrament. O man this thou shall vnderstāde after the dygnyte of the holy sacrament / for there is no person ne creature in heuen so holy / nor in erth so iust that myght worthely receyue it. But thou shall vnderstāde and knowe for to cōforte the / that whan the man dothe prepare hym
selfe to it by true cōtrycyon and confessyon that god doth not regarde what he is or hath ben / but onely doth se & regarde yf he wold be better thā he is / for god doth than forget all his synnes / and doth molyfye hym selfe by the holy sacrament. And therfore the mā shall proue and serche his cōscyence in these thre poyntes. ¶ Fyrste / yf his conscyence doth moue and prycke hym in any of the deedly synnes. ¶ Secondaryly / yf his wyl be vnyed and ioyned to the wyll of god / so that all thyn∣ge do please hym whiche doth please god / & that all thynge do dysplease hym / whiche doth dysplease god. ¶ Thyrdly / yf the man do fynde in hym sel¦fe that charyte & the loue of god is augmen¦ted by the holy sacrament / and that the fere of god is not dymynysshed. In these poyn∣tes the man shall examyne hym selfe. And yf he fynde that by oft tymes goynge to the holy sacrament / the loue of god is not fer∣uent and quycke in hym: and the fere of god is dymynysshed / than by humylyte he shall refrayne and shall not go so ofte. For the ly¦fe of one man is the deth of another / but yf he fynde that the loue of god is more feruēt and quycke in hym by reason of the same /
and that the fere of god doth encrease rather than dymynysshe / he shall ofte tymes go to the holy sacrament after the counceyll of a good cōfessoure and ghostly father. For the desyre of god is / that he maye dwell in the herte of man: and by the same habytacyon or presence of the holy sacrament / the man doth drawe hym selfe from transytory thyn¦ges / & doth delyte in heuenly thynges. Also by his holy body / ours is renewed / & with it is vnyed and ioyned: so that all thynge is oure whiche belongeth vnto hym / so that his herte and ours is all one: our body is his our wyttes be his / our power / and all our membres be vnyed with god by the holy sa¦crament. Wherfore he doth speke by the pro∣phete Dauid. I haue spoken: O men ye be godes and all togyther chyldren of heuen / For the soule of man is so vnyed with god by the holy sacrament: that all the aūgelles Cherubyns ne Seraphyns can not fynde any dyfference betwene thē two: for where they do moue the soule / thyther also they do moue god. There was neuer thyng so vny¦ed as god is with the soule of man / for he is nerer and more vnyed / than the soule and the body / whiche do man a man. This we may consydre by many sayntes and perfyte
men whiche haue suffred great paynes / pu∣nysshementes / and tourmētes of tyrauntes vnto deth / that theyr bodyes dyde departe from theyr soules. Yet these tyrauntes could neuer separate god from theyr soules with all theyr tourmēt{is}. This vnyon is greater than yf a droppe of water were put in to a great tonne full of wyne / the which droppe of water shall be incontynent conuerted in to wyne. And therfore man yf thou wylte procede from vertue to vertue / from grace to grace / from charyte to charyte / from desy¦re in to desyre / from the lyght of grace to the lyght of glory / and to come to the perfeccy∣on of good workes / exercyse thy selfe in the passyon of our lorde / and go oft tymes true tenly and worthely to the holy sacrament. For there is nothyng that doth quycken the wyttes so moche / nor that doth illumynate the herte with deuocyon / nor that doth lyfte vp the man so moche to hygh contemplacy¦on / as to receyue the body of our lorde / and remēbre his passyon. O man yf thou wylt also be perfytly pourged from synne / enry∣ched in vertues / hyghly illumynate in the holy scrypture / boldly vaynquysshe thyne enemyes / be cōforted in all paynes and try∣bulacyons / lyue deuoutly in erth / feruently
be enbrased in thy herte / to wepe swetely in thy prayers / oft tymes to be illumynate / in thy desyres to be ferme and stedfast / to con∣tynewe in good operacyons / to be remplys¦shed and fulfylled with spyrytuall ioyes / to be drawen to heuenly thynges / to know that thynge that god hath hydde and kepte darke / to dye wysely / & to lyue euerlastyng¦ly with god / exercyse thy selfe here in erth with god in the holy sacrament and his byt¦ter passyon. For the man myght with suche and so great medytacyon / desyre / and with suche loue and deuocyon receyue the holy sa¦crament that from the lowest trone of aun¦gelles he shulde be set ī the hyghest. For god doth not promyse nor also rewarde the man in heuen / after the multytude of his good workes / but also after the greatnes of his desyre & loue. Therfore many do erre which do withdrawe them selfe from the holy sa∣crament sayenge. I worde very oft tymes go to receyue the holy sacramēt / but I haue no spyrytuall rychesse in me / that is to saye vertues wherwith honestly and competēt∣ly I maye aorne my soule for to receyue the great kynge beynge present in the sacramēt The other do say / I haue not in me the wa¦ter of teares for to clense and wasshe my cō¦scyence
from all fylth and synne. Other do say / I haue no feruent deuocyon ī my pray¦ers / but I am colde / feble / and slouthfull towardes god. And so they wyll tary vn∣to they be ryche in vertues: and that they ha¦ue abundaunce of teares and feruent deuo∣cyon: as they were assured therby to receyue god worthely ī the holy sacramēt. O poore man: there be many Turkes / Sarazyns / & Infydelles / whiche haue done many ver∣tuous dedes & haue great deuocyon in theyr sacryfyce / yet neuertheles they do consyste & be in dampnacyon of theyr soules. It is not that that god doth serche. Our lorde Ihesu chryste doth desyre and demaūde of vs: that we after our poore power prepare our selfe by trewe confessyon / repentaunce / and con¦trycyon and ferme purpose neuer to retour∣ne more to syn̄e. In this we do prepare our selfe. And yf our lord god gyue vs this gra¦ce / than we shall tourne vs to deuocyon & to the teares of our iyes. And yf we can not do it / we shal cōmyt it to god: and shall not therfore leue and refrayne to go to the holy sacrament / specyally yf thy herte greatly de¦syre it. That suche people do erre / I wyll showe you by thre reasons. ¶ Fyrste / it shulde be great foly & madnes
for a poore man beynge clothed in ryche and precyous apparell / to demaūde and begge of a ryche kynge / but it shulde be better that he shuld come lyke a poore man showynge his pouertie and so demaundynge rychesse. So do the poore people that do sytte at the churche dores / showynge to the ryche men theyr nakednes and pouertie: and therby the ryche people be moued with pytie. So also shall we do: showyng our nakednes of ver¦tues / howe feble so euer we be / howe colde and flowe in deuocyon / howe indyscryte in wordes inclyned to all syn̄e. These faul¦tes & other lyke showynge to god the ryche kynge of Ierusalem / he wyll ayde and hel¦pe vs in our pouertie with the treasoure of his dyuyne grace / and shall haue mercy of vs in lykewyse as he dyd to the woman of Canane / the whiche humbly dyd demaun∣de and desyre to eate with the fytell dogges the crommes & lytell peaces of breade / that dyd fall from the table. And bycause that she dyd not repute her selfe worthy to recey∣ue a great grace / god dyd graunt her that / that she dyd demaunde / ye and yf she had desyred a greater thynge. And this is that / wherof he doth speke by the prophet Dauid The poore shall eate & shall be fylled / and
those that do serche god shall prayse & laude hym / & theyr herte shall lyue with god euer∣lastyngly. In this ye maye consydre two thynges. ¶ Fyrste / god is the meate of the poore / in the soule. ¶ Secondaryly / that they shall eate vnto they be full. And bycause that that is impos¦syble so longe as we be here in erth / vnto yt we come to heuen where we shall be fylled Therfore all deuoute persones shall dyspo¦se themselfe for to go ofte tymes to the holy sacrament. For as saynt Gregorye faythe / there is great dyfferēce betwene spyrytuall meate & carnall meate. For the man maye take so moche of carnall meate or ioye / that he shall be wery therwith. But of spyrytu∣all meate or ioye / the man can not take so moche that he wyll be wery therwith / for the more that he dothe take therof / the more he doth demaunde and desyre. And of this it is spoken in Ecclesiastico: sayeng. Those that do eate me shall haue hungre. Wherfore he that wyll go to receyue the Sacrament worthely / he shall do that is in hym / & than he shall cōmyt hym selfe to god / which wyl fulfyll that that doth lacke in the mā. The other do cōplayne and saye / that they haue
not the water of teares for to wasshe theyr cōscyēce / for the which thyng they do refray¦ne to go to the holy sacrament / in depreuyn¦ge theyr soule from moche fruyte. These per¦sones do lyke foles / whiche wyll not go to the fountayne for to haue water / but with theyr pottes full. And shulde it not be more profytable to go to the fountayne with em¦ptye vesselles / and to take of the water so moche as shall suffyse them. This fountay¦ne is our lorde Ihesu chryste hyd in the holy sacrament / & redy with his dyuyne grace / to gyue abundauntly to all persones / as he dyd speke to the woman standynge at the well. He that doth drynke of that water yt I wyll gyue hym he shall neuer haue thir¦ste / but in hym shall spryng and come forth a lyuynge fountayne in the euerlastynge ly¦fe. And therfore he that hath no thynge nor no thynge can get of the water of teares in his vessell / he shall go surely without dou∣bte or fere with a ferme fayth and byleue / to the abundaūtly lyuyngly well the whi∣che is open to all persones / that is to saye / the holy sacrament. And therof thou shall drawe and take abundauntly / so moche as thou shall nede / and shall suffyse the / for yf the fountayne be to depe / bynde thy vessell
to the woode of the crosse remembryng his bytter passyon / & thou shall fyll thy vessell abūdauntly with the water of teares. And therfore it is yt our lorde Ihesu chryste hath gyuen hym selfe in the holy sacrament / by∣cause that he knoweth wel that mā is faul¦tye and inclyned to all feblenes. Yf we shul¦de haue ben as perfyte as the aungelles in heuen / it shulde not haue ben nedefull that our lorde god shulde haue gyuen hym selfe in the holy sacrament for our syckenes & fe∣blenes. Therfore man shall do that that is in hym & shall recōmende hym to the mercy of god / For so haue all the holy men done / whiche be saued by the same. ¶ There be other that do complayne sayen¦ge that they be not feruent nor hote in the lo¦ue of god / and that theyr hertes be not infla¦med in the charyte or loue of god / but they be colde. And therfore they wyll not go to the table of god to receyue the holy sacramēt These persones do lyke foles / as those that be very colde and wyll not go to the fyre to warme them. It were better for them to go to the fyre / than to tarye longe from it / and to suffre ī the meane tyme great colde. This fyre is Ihesu chryste hydde in the holy sacra¦ment / as the Prophete sayth / Our god is
fyre whiche deuoureth / the whiche fyre is god come and descended in erth / for to illu∣mynate our hertes by all the benefytes that he hath done vnto vs. Deuocyon doth not consyste in moche fastynge / prayenge / and oft tymes confessynge / but it doth consyste in that that the man be humble of herte / fer¦uent / tourned towardes god / illumynate with dyuyne charyte / mercyfull towardes his neyghbour & euen chrysten hauyng god alwayes afore his iyes. For it is more acce¦ptable vnto god / that the man after that he hath synned / tourne hym selfe humbly to∣wardes god / than yf he had neuer synned & shulde not be humble. Therfore all those yt be colde and feble in the loue and charyte of god / shall somtymes prepare themselfe for to go worthely to the holy sacrament / for to be so and in suche maner hooly illumynate with the loue of god / without the which al our good workes (as saynt Paule sayth) be no thynge acceptable of god. I do not saye that I wyll counceyll al persones to go oft tymes to the holy sacrament / But I say as saynt Austyne sayth / I do not laude and prayse for to go euerydaye to the holy sacra¦ment / nor also do not dysprayse it / but I gyue counceyll to receyue it euery sondaye.
This dothe saynt Austyne speke of those / whose cōscyence is not knowen / wherupō the glose doth saye / that yf the good men go ofte tymes to the holy sacrament it is to be praysed whan they be in good lyfe / flyenge synne and the occasyon therof / takynge al∣so good hede to them selfe and alwayes oc∣cupyenge them selfe in the passyon of our lorde. These folkes thus lyuynge and not after the sensualyte of the flesshe: be greatly to be praysed / that they go so ofte tymes to the holy sacrament. And bycause that the conscyence of man is hyd and not knowen whether it be worthy to receyue god or no / therfore the holy doctours do counceyll that euery man do after his byleue & fayth / that is to saye after his conscyence / and the loue that he hath towardes the holy sacrament. For after the loue that the man hath towar¦des the holy sacramēt / he doth perceyue and fele deuocyon and swetnes in his soule / & the man doth more honour to god in deuout¦ly goynge to the holy sacrament / than yf he shulde refrayne by and through humylyte. For the man goynge deuoutly to the sacra∣ment / he doth conuerte and tourne hym self to the dyuyne loue & charyte / and in refray∣nyng he doth tourne hym to humylyte: and
bycause that charyte and loue do passe all other vertues / so it is better to go with loue to the holy sacrament / than to refrayne by humylyte. For he that is not letted by synne and myght well prepare hym selfe to the sa¦me and dothe it not / he dothe depryue (in as moche as in hym is) the holy trynyte from his honoure / the aūgelles from theyr glory / the holy churche from his treasoure / the iust men from many graces / the synners from pytie and mercy / and the soules in purgato¦rye from delyueraunce of the payne. Yet not withstādynge it is good that the man som∣tymes withdrawe hym selfe through humy¦lyte from the holy sacrament / in not goyng to the table of our lorde. For it was as ac∣ceptable to god / that Centurio that noble knyght dyd knowlege hym selfe by humy∣lyte to be vnworthy to receyue hym in his howse / as Zacheus that ryche man whiche worthely dyd receyue hym. This neuethe∣les shall not be oft tymes to be done / specy∣ally whan the man dothe fynde hym selfe īmaculate and without synne. For the holy sacramēt is a medicyne of the soule agaynst syx dyseases wherwith the soule is charged. ¶ Fyrste / the man is feble and hath small courage in vertue / and is not so vertuous
ne doth not so many vertuous dedes / as he is bounde to do. Wherfore god hathe made hym selfe lytell and small in the holy sacra¦ment / to the entent that no man be afrayed of his myght & power / the whiche we maye consydre in two maners and sortes. ¶ Fyrste / it semeth that god is lesser than the man / for he doth applye & gyue his wyll to the wyll of the man: so that he doth descē¦de from heuen to the erth vpon the aulter / whan it pleaseth the man / that is to say the preest. And doth suffre hym selfe to be vsed as well of his enemyes as of his frendes / & doth showe no maner of euyll nor aduersy∣tye. And so it semeth outwardely that the man is greater than god / for god is obedy∣ent to the man. ¶ Secōdaryly / we may consydre the smal∣nes or lytelnes of god in the holy sacrament For he dothe gyue hym selfe so frely to the man / that he maye do with hym what he wyll. He doth suffre the man to vse and re∣ceyue hym as he wyll / to the entent that eue¦ry man whiche is lytell & poore of vertues: shulde receyue great rychesse in his soule. ¶ The seconde reason: the man is feble and redy to synne. Therfore oure lorde Ihesu chryste hath gyuen hym self in the sacramēt
to the entēt that the man therby shuld vayn¦quysshe all tēptacyons and inclynacyons to synne / For the multytude of our synnes towardes the power of the holy sacrament is not / but as a droppe of water towardes the hole see. So we may alwayes by the ho¦ly sacrament / make satysfaccyon for oure synnes. Therfore saynt Ambrose sayth / so ofte as the man receyueth the holy sacramēt so oft receyueth he remyssyon of his synnes. And for so moche as man is alwayes redy to synne / therfore he shall haue alwayes with hym the medycyne of his soule / for the man can not better reconcyle hym selfe to god / than by the holy sacrament. Therfore those that do not go to the holy sacrament / do showe yt they do not desyre grace ne mer¦cy of god: thynkynge to come to heuen with out god. Notwithstandyng the nerest way to come to heuen / is by the holy sacrament. Therfore the prophete Dauid sayth: assaye and proue howe swete our lorde god is. ¶ Thyrdly / the man is enuyroned & amon¦ges his enemyes / as the deuyll / the flesshe / and the worlde. Wherfore the man lyueth alwayes with fere and drede / and is neuer in suretie. And to the entent that the man do not fere beynge in this great myserie and
peryll / and that his enemyes do not vayn∣quysshe hym nor wounde hym to deth / ther¦fore god hath gyuen hym selfe in the holy sa¦cramēt as a faythfull felowe & cōpaygnon whiche styfly wyll tary with hym and not departe / vnto he haue vaynquysshed all his enemyes / the which thynge god dyd pro¦myse to his dyscyples in the last supper: and to all men that do receyue hym sayenge / I wyll be with you / vnto the ende and con∣summacyon of the worlde. This good com¦paygnon defendeth / techeth / and doth soly∣cyts the man in all thyng that he hath to do and that is necessary for hym / and doth ke∣pe and take hede of the man / in all payne / tēptacyon / trybulacyon / in pouertie of spy∣ryte / and in all busynes that maye chaunce vnto hym. Therfore the man shall call & demaunde the cōmynge of this cōpaygnon / for he doth make the slouthfull person quyc¦ke / and that thyng that is heuy lyght / eygre and bytter swete. And he doth make ryche those that be poore: and those that be desola∣te and in heuynes / he doth reioyse and con∣forte them. For saynt Paule sayth / I may in hym whiche dothe coroborate me / do all thynge / that is to saye in the holy sacramēt the mā may fynde in cōpanye many swete
ioyes / ye yf the man wolde serche he shulde fynde all that he wolde / as vyctorye in tē∣ptacyon / ioye in trybulacyon / in syckenes pacyence / in persecucyon pleasure. Therfo∣re Dauid sayth / I wyll not fere what so∣euer man shall do to me for god is with me. ¶ Fourthly / a good man fereth god for his tyme loste / the whiche he hath consumed in syn̄e without doynge any vertuous dedes fewe or none. In this may be cōsydered the great displeasure of the mā: which is moche to be complayned / & that for two reasons. ¶ The fyrste / that so longe as the man is in deedly synne / so longe is he in the male∣dyccyon of god / and is eueryday more than a hondreth tymes cursed of the good perso∣nes sayenge theyr houres / by the prophete Dauid in the psalter / where it is wryten. O good lorde cursed be those whiche do not obserue and kepe thy cōmaundementes. ¶ Secondaryly / so longe as the man is in deedly synne / he doth lease all his good wor¦kes that he doth & hath done: And yf he dye in any deedly synne / all is lost. O good lor¦de / howe fewe people do remembre that. O man remēbre that yf temporall goodes and rychesse be lost / there is no thynge lost / but yf the soule be lost / all is lost: yf honour
be lost / moche is lost: but yf the soule be lost all is lost. And to the entent that the man do not contynewe in this myserye and that he do not fall in dyspayre: the most benygne Ihesus hath gyuen hym selfe in the sacra∣ment / to the entent that all those whiche a∣fore were cursed / by hym agayne maye be blyssed / and whose workes were deed / by hym shulde reuyue. That is to say the good workes whiche ones were in lyfe / whiche nowe reuyue. And so the man doth repare and recouer by the holy sacrament / all his tyme loste. And in receyuynge the holy sa∣cramēt the man doth a great worke / so that he can do no thynge better / in case that he re¦ceyue it as it aperteyneth after the ordynaū¦ce of the holy churche / for therby the myserye of the man is amended. ¶ Fyfthly / the man is very poore of ver∣tues / so yt he can do no good thynge of hym selfe. Therfore god hath gyuen hym selfe in the sacrament for consolacyon and cōforte / as a marchaunt with all the treasoure and rychesse of his grace and mercy / so that the man maye surely of hym demaunde & aske what soeuer he wyll / and god wyll gyue it hym by and in the holy sacrament / to the entent that the man may so satysfye his po∣uertie.
Wherof Salomon speketh sayenge / He is come as a shyppe of a marchaunt / the which brought his breade frō a farre coūtre. This marchaunt is the dyuynyte: the shyp is the humanyte / the whiche hath brought the dyuynyte from a farre countre / as from heuen in to the see of this worlde. The brea¦de whiche he hath brought in this shyppe: is the holy sacrament / as he sayth of hym self. I am the lyuynge breade descended & come from heuen. This breade is so abundaunt and so fertyll in it selfe / that it is suffycyēt for all those that demaundeth it and loueth it. Therfore god sayth in the gospell: all my goodes be the goodes of the mā / for all that I haue apperteyneth to the man. O good lorde what thou art lyberall / large & mercy¦full / that all thy goodes whiche so rychely thou onely doest possede: wyll spende with the man sayenge / all my good & rychesse of grace & glory / apperteyneth to the. O good lorde what small gyft thou receyuest of me for that that thou gyuest me in the holy sa∣crament: god maker of all creatures for one creature / a man īnocent for a man beynge a synner / a noble holy soule for a peruerse & vnnoble. Wherfore I speke with the pro∣phete Dauid. O good lorde what shall I
gyue and render to the for that thou hast gy¦uen me. I wyll take the chalyce of helth / & I wyll inuoke and call the name of our lor¦de. All those that be poore of vertues in the soule / they shall go surely without any fere to the holy sacramēt as to a ryche marchaūt whiche shall fulfyll all thy demaūdes and desyres of his lyberalyte: without gyuynge golde or syluer. ¶ Syxtly / the man is to farre from his en∣de of perpetuall helth / to the which he was made and fourmed in this worlde / so that of hym selfe he can not come therto. Neuer∣theles to the entent that the man do not dy∣spayre for to come thyther / god hath gyuen hym selfe in a spyrytuall meate / in and by the whiche the man is saued and vnyed: as he doth speke hym selfe in the gospell / He yt doth eate my flesshe and drynketh my blode he abydeth in me and I in hym. And yf it be not that thou eate the flesshe of the sone of the man and drynke his blode / thou shal neuer haue lyfe in the / that is to saye in thy soule here in erth & hereafter in heuen. Ther¦fore speketh saynt Austyne in the person of god sayenge. Whan thou doest eate me / I shall not be cōuerted in the / but thou in me. For this vnyon the sone of god dyd pray to
his father sayenge. O father saue in thy na∣me al those that thou hast gyuen me: so that they maye be one with vs as we togyther be one / I in the and thou in me. O most be∣nygne Ihesu thou hast showed in this thy infynyte mercy / for by this meate we do ioy¦ne and make vs one in the / to the and with the. But many doth receyue the holy sacra∣ment with lytell desyre & in great feblenes. It is greatly to be complayned / that so ma¦ny folk{is} haue so lytell deuocyon towardes the holy sacrament / so that for a lyght occa¦syon they do not go therto: to the which they shulde well and dylygently alwayes pre∣pare them. But bycause that they be loth to confesse them / and that it greueth them to fast / they do let it passe / the whiche is a to∣ken of lytell loue that they haue towardes god. For as saynt Gregorye sayth / the dy∣leccyon and loue of god is neuer Idle and voyde in the man / For where it is there it worketh great thynges / and where it is not there the man is Idle. O yf there were but one man in the worlde worthy to receyue the holy sacrament / howe wolde all the o∣ther rēne to se hym and to speke with hym. Nowe our lorde Ihesu chryste gyueth and maketh hym selfe cōmon egally to all per∣sones
/ wherfore many there be that do not regarde hym. And therfore whan they dye / they fynde them selfe naked of vertues in the soule / and chased from euerlastynge ly∣fe / the whiche all those onely that do eate of this breade shall vse and haue / for they shal lyue euerlastyngly. Amen. ¶ The fyrste Chapytre / what thynge is necessary for the man that wyll recey¦ue worthely the holy sacrament. AS the doctours do wry∣te / thre thyng{is} be necessa¦ry to euery good {per}son yt fructefully wyll recey∣ue the blyssed sacrament of our lord Ihesu chryst. ¶ The fyrste that is necessary for the man / is purenes and clennes in the conseyence / so that he be without deedly synne / in true re∣pentaunce / confessyon / and stedfast purpo∣se neuer to synne more / and to fulfyll the cōmaūdemētes of god and those of the holy churche. For the holy churche doth prohybyte and forbyd / that all those that be in deedly synne / that they shall not receyue the holy sacrament / yf they be not fyrste and afore
confessed and assoyled. For otherwyse in goynge to the sacrament they synne deedly: in case that they maye haue or fynde a con∣fessoure. Therfore the mā shal prepare hym therunto: as yf incontynent after his confes¦syon he shulde dye / and that is suffycyent afore Ihesu chryste. ¶ The seconde is / that the man shall haue feruent deuocyon / so that he shall appoynte and prepare hym self as deuoutly as he can possyble / tournynge hym selfe hooly from that thynge whiche for that tyme and houre myght drawe hym from god and from his deuocyon. Therfore the man shall haue af∣ter his confessyon afore that he go to the sa∣crament / a generall repentaūce and contry¦cyon of all his venyall synnes / specyally of those wherin he knoweth hym selfe day∣ly to fall / be it in vayne spekynge / in eatyn¦ge and drynkyng more than nede requyreth or in not hauynge pacyence in trybulacyon or any other lyke / for they do let the persone in his deuocyon. A man may get deuocyon in two maners / that is to saye by the fere of god / as in remembrynge the greatnes and multytude of his synnes / and the iustyce of god. Secondaryly / by the dyleccyon & loue of god in remembryng his passyon and the
benefytes that he hath showed vs. ¶ The thyrde thynge that is necessary for man for to receyue the holy sacrament wor¦thely / is clennes of the body outwardly / so that he be not poluted and maculate in the body with synne by the defaulte of nature / the whiche maye be done in deedly synne / That is to saye whan it cōmeth of carnall thoughtes / or whan it cōmeth of glotonye and excesse of meates & drynkes. And than it is good for hym to refrayne for the dygny¦te of the sacrament. It maye be done also without synne / as by feblenes or debylyte of nature / by coldnes of the body / by tēpta¦cyon of the deuyll or otherwyse. But he that shall fynde hym selfe greued herein: shall ta¦ke the counceyll of his confessoure. ¶ The seconde Chapytre / howe the man goth in thre maners of wayes to the holy sacrament in deedly synne. THe man may be in deedly syn̄e and yet receyue the holy sacra∣ment in thre maners. ¶ Fyrste / he maye be in deedly synne and knowe it not / or he doth truste in god that it is forgyuen hym /
for he doth not remembre it. To this the do∣ctours answere sayenge / yf it be so that the man afore his confessyon haue examyned his conscyence after his power / and accor∣dynge to the prolyxyte of the tyme that he was last confessed. And than he doth serche for a good confessoure / that can helpe & ex∣amyne hym in that wherin he is ygnoraūt. Who that so goth to the holy sacramēt with repentaunce and contrycyon of his synnes: receyueth in the holy sacrament remyssyon of all his synnes / confessed and forgoten. But yf he do renne neclygently to confesse hym / as the dogge to the potage / without remembrynge his euyll lyfe / it shall not hel¦pe nor profyte hym afore god / that he hath forgoten his synnes. For it semeth that he careth not for it / and that he doth dyspyse it. ¶ Secondaryly / the man maye doubte in deedly synne for the erraunt and varyable conscyēce / so that he maketh cōscyence whe∣re it nedeth not / wherof cōmeth ofte tymes great peryll. For the varyable conscyence byndeth the man to electe a good sage and wyse confessoure / whiche hath knowlege and vnderstādynge therof / and so he shall take awaye from hym the varyable cōscy∣ence or the erroure of the same. And than he
shall go to the holy sacrament: but so longe as that erroure of conscyence dureth or the most parte / he shall not go to the sacramēt. But yf the man doubte yf it be deedly syn̄e or no / he shall confesse hym afore that he go to the holy sacrament / or els he shall cōmyt a deedly synne / in puttyng hym ī the peryll of deedly synne. ¶ Thyrdly / the man maye yet be in deedly synne / and that he knoweth well that he hath not confessed hym therof. And neuer∣theles he shulde haue confessed hym therof / where he cōmytteth a deedly synne bycause he doth not knowe it / for he is boūde to knowe it. And in so goynge to the holy sacramēt it is deedly synne and the ygnoraūce doth not excuse afore god / for he myght go / whe∣re he myght be instructed. ¶ The thyrde Chapytre / yf the man maye go vnworthely to the holy sacrament / or be dampned for certayne deedly synnes whiche he hath forgoten: and that he knoweth not.
VPon this answereth / saynt Bonauenture that ī case that the man haue fyue poyntes in hym / god shall not compt his synnes forgoten / albeit that there were many. ¶ Fyrste / he shall aduyse hym selfe well a∣fore that he go to his confessoure / in examy¦nyng his conscyence in the .x. cōmaūdemen¦tes / and in the .vii. deedly synnes / and after¦warde in his state / offyce or crafte. ¶ Secondaryly / he shall praye to god dyly¦gently that he maye haue knowlege of his synnes forgoten / of the whiche he is redy to confesse hym and to do penaunce for the sa∣me after the counceyll of his confessoure. ¶ Thyrdly / he shall gladly go to the Ser∣mons for to here and lerne / what thynge is deedly synne and what is not. ¶ Fourthly / he shall take counceyll with his confessoure / and shall demaunde that wherin he doubteth / whether it be deedly synne or venyall. For many folkes do ma∣ke no synne of that that is synne / thynkyn∣ge so to begyle theyr confessours / the which neuerthelesse shall be reputed great synne afore god. ¶ Fyfthly / the man shall kepe hym in as
moche as he can and may from deedly syn̄e for those that synne an hondreth tymes and esteme it no more thā yf they dyd it not but .x. or .xx. tymes / it is no meruayle yf they do forget moche / the which our lorde god wyll iuge at the daye of iugement. ¶ The fourth Chapytre / wherby the man maye truste that he receyueth the ho∣ly sacrament worthely / & who is in the state of grace. SAynt Thomas saythe / that no man so longe as he lyueth here ī erth may knowe certaynly yf he be in the state of grace / & yf he receyue worthely the holy sacramēt or no / excepte that god do manyfest and showe it vnto hym. For saint Paule speketh of hym selfe / I do not knowlege me to be culpable in any deedly synne / yet notwithstandyng I am not iustyfyed afore our lord god: whi¦che knoweth all the hertes. Neuertheles af∣ter that the man hath confessed hym selfe a∣fore his confessoure / and hath dylygently declared all his synnes. There be yet foure
tokens / by the whiche he maye surely truste and also haue knowlege / that he is well cō¦fessed and that he is in the state of grace / & so goth worthely to the holy sacrament. ¶ The fyrste / yf the man after his confessy¦on / gladly doth here the worde of god and to speke of god. For our lorde sayth / he that is of god / gladly doth here to speke of god. ¶ The seconde is / so longe as the man fe∣leth hym selfe redy to dwell & to serue god / it is a token that he is in the loue of god: for where the charyte and loue of god is / there it doth worke some good / and yf it can not do it by workes / it doth it by desyre. And as saynt Gregorye sayth / the token of loue is the showynge of the workes. ¶ The thyrde is / that the man ought to ha∣ue a stedfast purpose / from hensforth neuer to synne more. For so longe as the man is in the mynde and wyll to synne / so longe is he in the state of dampnacyon. ¶ The fourth is / that the man ought to ha∣ue great repentaūce and contrycyon of his synnes passed. Therfore the man shall not reioyse nor vaunte hym selfe / nor also shall not reherse his synnes: for by hauynge pleasure and delyte in any deedly synne / a man maye cōmyt another deedly synne of
newe / and is great peryll and daunger to the soule. In these foure poyntes (as saynt Gregorye sayth) doth consyste true and per¦fyte penaunce. ¶ The fyfth Chapytre / yf the man be boū¦de in and for any cause / to confesse hym more than ones in the yere. YT is cōmaūded in the Ca¦non lawe / that all good & catholyke persones which be come to theyr aege (cer∣tayne great necessyties ex¦cepte) at the leste / ones in the yere do confesse them and do receyue the holy sacrament / or elles he that doth it not / he shall be excōmunycate in his lyfe / and after his deth he shal be buryed in the feldes lyke a beest. Yet notwithstādynge doctours do saye / that the man is bounde vnder the payne of a deedly synne / to confesse hym in contynent and not to tarye to Easter / and that for foure reasons and causes. ¶ Fyrste / so ofte as the man is in peryll of his lyfe: as women afore that they begynne to trauayle and laboure of theyr chylde / or those that wyl interpryse any great iourney
or to go ouer the see: or those that do go to the warre for to fyght / or those that do vnder∣take any thynge / wherof many do dye / or those that be in peryll to dye / as in the tyme of pestylence. ¶ Secondaryly / those that haue cōmyt su∣che synnes that cōmon confessours can not assoyle them / or he that maye assoyle them / doth come thyther where they be: or they may lyghtly go vnto hym where he is: as to par¦dons and suche other / that they be bounde to confesse them. ¶ Thyrdly / whan the conscyence is very vnquyet and doth moue a man feruently to confesse incōtynently his synnes / for the conscyence bereth wytnes howe the man is dysposed within. ¶ Fourthly / whan the man wyll receyue the holy sacrament or any of the .vii. sacra∣ment{is}. In these foure causes is the mā boū∣de more than ones in the yere to confesse his synnes. Yet all this notwithstandynge eue¦ry good catholyke person shal confesse hym selfe at the leste foure tymes in the yere: albe¦it that he be not redy to go to the holy sacra∣ment so oft. For a vessell that is vsed and occupyed euery day and not made clene but ones in the yere / it wyll be so foule and fyl¦thy
at the last that he can not be made clene so it is also of the conscyence of man. ¶ The .vi. Chapytre / howe and in what the man shall serche and examyne hym selfe / that worthely wyll go to the holy sacrament. A Man that worthely wyll go to the holy sacrament he shal examyne dylygently his cō∣scyēce / in lyke case as he wol decyue and make a compte to a great lorde of many dettes. And to the entent that euery man whiche can not well confesse hym selfe maye knowe the maner howe to confesse hym / I wyll wryte a cō∣mon and a shorte maner / wherin al cōmon synnes be inclosed / in leuynge that whiche apperteyneth not to be wryten / to the entēt that some do not lerne that which they kno¦we not. And by this the man may lerne to cōfesse hym / in addynge & takynge awaye as his state and occupacyon doth requyre / or also after as his conscyence doth testyfye and moue hym: for it shulde not profyte nor be possyble to wryte all maner of synnes. Therfore the man shall prouyde hym of a
good confessoure in cōtynuynge with hym without rennynge from one to another / the whiche shall knowe his state and lyfe / to the entent that he may the better helpe hym in that that he shall haue forgoten and be ygnoraunt. And thou shall come in tyme to confessyon / so that thou be not last / and that thou maye haue space ynough to con∣fesse the / And whan thou doest confesse the a daye before / and thou doest remembre in the meane tyme any venyall syn̄es / it shal not nede to go agayne to confessyon / but to knocke vpon thy brest with cōtrycyon say∣enge. O good lorde haue mercy of me poore synner. And kepe the in as moche as thou can from vayne wordes / and carnall thoughtes and frequētacyons / and from brekyng thy pacyence one day after thou hast receyued the sacrament / and one daye before / for the dygnyte of the same. ¶ The .vii. Chapytre / howe the man shall confesse hym selfe / fyrste of the .xii. Artycles of the holy catholyke fayth.
WHan thou shall come to thy confessyon / knele downe of both thy knees afore thy con∣fessoure / makynge a crosse a¦fore the and saye / In the na∣me of the father / of the sone / and of the holy ghost. Amen. or In nomine patris. &c. And than saye Confiteor yf thou can saye it vn¦to Ideo precor. And yf thou can not say it / saye Benedicite: and than saye / Syr I con¦fesse me afore god and you of all my syn̄es that I haue done / syth the fyrste tyme that I could synne vnto this houre. Fyrste that I haue synned agaynst the .xii. artycles of the holy fayth: that I haue not so stedfastly byleued in herte / mouthe / and workes as I am boūde. I haue somtymes also doubted in the holy sacrament or otherwyse as thou shall knowe thy selfe gyltye. Yf thou haste kepte companye with Iewes / Sarazyns / Heretykes / or yf thou know any other thyn¦ge / thou shall tell it. ¶ The .viii. Chapytre / of the .xii. ver¦tues of the holy ghoste / wherof thou shall confesse the / as here foloweth.
I Confesse & accuse me / that I haue ben neclygent and haue transgressed ī the .xii. vertues of the holy ghost / I haue not had ioye / glad∣nes / and loue in the seruyce of god / nor peace with my chrysten brother: nor pacyence in aduersyte / nor longanymy¦te or contynuaūce in the seruyce of god / nor holynes in my lyfe / nor pytie in beynge cō∣uersaunt with other folkes / nor also mea∣sure and sobrenes in my maners / myne ap∣parell / and in my workes / nor mekenes & Ientylnes with them that I haue haūted and dayly kepte companye / nor humylyte in my thoughtes and dedes / nor trueth in my wordes: nor purenes in my desyres and concupyscence. ¶ The .ix. Chapytre of the .xi. capytall syn¦nes / whiche be called crymynall. I Do confesse and accuse me: that I ha¦ue synned in many of the crymynall or capytall synnes. Yf thou fynde thy selfe culpable any wyse in any of the same thou maye tell it. ¶ As to syn agaynst the fayth of the trinite
¶ To synne agaynst nature. ¶ To synne in manslaughter. ¶ To synne agaynst the equyte and iusty∣ce of the mageste of any prynce or prelate. ¶ To synne ī robbynge the church{is} by force ¶ To synne in carnall medlyng with any of his lynage. ¶ To synne in adultery in the state of ma∣ryage. ¶ To synne in conspyracye or in makynge tumoure by force amonges the cōmonaltie. ¶ To synne in berynge false wytnes and that he doth knowe it false. ¶ To synne in Symonye. ¶ To synne by hauntynge vserye. ¶ The .x. Chapytre / of the .x. cōmaun∣dementes / the whiche euery per∣sone is bounde to knowe. YEt I confesse and accuse me of the .x. cōmaūdementes of our lorde Ihesu chryste. ¶ Of the fyrste cōmaunde∣mēt: yt I haue not loued our lord god with al my herte aboue all thyng{is} I haue not also worshypped hym as I ou∣ghte to do / nor I haue not had so stedfaste
fayth in hym as I am boūde / but sōtymes I haue byleued those which haue vsed Ny¦gromancye / or wytche crafte / or Herytykes which haue spokē agaynst the holy churche. ¶ Of the seconde cōmaundement / that I haue taken the name of god in vayne with out any necessytie / for I haue sworne ofte tymes for a lytell cause / which I haue kno¦wen to be contrary / wherwith I haue ofte tymes deceyued myne euen chrysten. I ha also caused other to swere and curse / bycau¦se that I wolde not byleue them of theyr worde. I haue also sworn not onely by god and hy his blyssed membres and passyon / but also by his sayntes / as by the mother of god / by saynt Iohan / & in other maners. ¶ Of the thyrde cōmaūdement / that I ha∣ue not sanctyfyed the sondaye & holy daye / by true contrycyon of my deedly synnes / by my prayers / by herynge masse and the ser∣mon / and by gyuynge almous / but I haue in this tyme serched my profyte in demaun∣dynge money of my dettours / byenge and sellynge that that was not greatly necessa¦ry. I haue suffred my seruaūtes to laboure without necessytie / so that they coulde not here masse. I haue occupyed my selfe that same daye more than in other dayes / with
wordly pleasure: as in eatynge / drynkynge and in carnall frequentacyon. ¶ Of the fourth cōmaūdement / that I ha∣ue not honoured my father and mother: nor haue not obeyed them / nor helped them in theyr necessytie / but I haue vexed and dys¦pleased them: and haue wysshed them deed in my herte. I haue not also after theyr deth faythfully prayed / nor caused to praye for theyr soules. I haue not also ben obedyent to my spyrytuall prelates and auncyent fa¦thers and to them / and to the holy churche I haue not borne honour and showed reue¦rence as I am bounde. I haue not parfyte∣ly payed my offrynges and dewtyes of the holy churche. I haue spoken and kepte com¦pany with those that were excomunycate / with vsurers / herytykes & other Infydels. ¶ Of the fyfth cōmaundement / that I ha¦ue slayne and kylled my chrysten brother or neyghboure by wyll and desyre / albeit that in dede I haue not fulfylled it / And that vniustly and agaynst reason I haue cau∣sed them to be imprysoned / or I haue done them hurt and dōmage in theyr bodyes and goodes. I haue hurte / wounded / or bette so¦me / I haue not kepte well my chyldren / so that they be departed out of this worlde / ba¦ptysed
or not baptysed. ¶ Of the syxt cōmaundement / that I ha∣ue done vnclene and vnlawfull workes with vnlawfull persones not maryed / or in adultery with persones maryed / or with vyrgynes and maydens whom I haue de¦floured and vyolate / or with my kynsfol∣kes / or gossep / or agaynst nature / or with thy selfe / or yf thou haue gyue thy fayth se∣cretly to any persone without any wytnes or without the cōmaūdementes of the chur∣che / and so hath carnally medled afore that thou was maryed. ¶ Of the seuenth cōmaundement / that I haue take and also by force without ryght or reason the goodes of other men out of ho∣ly places or not holy. And that I haue soly¦cyte to haue some offyces or benefyc{is} / wher¦by I haue oppressed the poore people / and haue taken more than of ryght I ought to do. I haue cōmyt vsurye secretly or openly I haue solde my goodes or marchaundyse derer by credence than for redy money. I ha¦ue receyued the goodes of spyrytuall perso∣nes / or of theyr seruauntes / or of chyldren / and those whiche can not gyue any thynge without lycence. I haue not ben faythfull in my laboure and worke. I haue praysed
often tymes my goodes and marchaundyse moch aboue the pryce that they were worth: in puttyng the best aboue in syght. And the worste beneth. I haue also deceyued folkes with euyll money. I haue not restored the goodes which I haue wrongfully come to or that thynge that I haue founde. I haue euyll and vnprofytably spent the goodes of the churche / or myne owne goodes. And I haue not fulfylled the testament or laste wylle of my frendes / so as I oughte to do / or so soone as I myght. ¶ Of the .viii. cōmaundemet / that I haue gyuen by malyce agaynst my neyghboure false wytnes secretly or openly.

I haue also presumed and bosted my self of my no¦blenes and fayrenes / by reason wherof I haue dyspraysed & dyspysed the other which had it not. I haue not regarded the ordinaū¦ces of the holy churche / but reputed them as no thynge / in kepynge companye with tho¦se that were excōmunycate. I haue dyspy∣sed bothe those persones / that were not so hygh indygnyte as I / and also those that were hygher and better than I: and I haue hayted those that were lyke & as good as I.

And by enuye I haue

Also for enuye I haue be ryght sory of his good fortune / prosperyte / & auaunce∣ment / and haue ben very glad of his mys∣fortune / trybulacyon / and aduersytie / trou∣blynge and oppressynge hym to my power where soeuer I coulde. I haue also dyffa∣med hym behynde his backe: and haue glad¦ly herkened and herde other which haue spo¦ken euyll of hym. And I haue also made dyscēcyon where there was peace & cōcorde. ¶ Fyfthly / I haue synned in glotonye / for I haue not fasted and kepte abstynence on fastynge dayes / vygyles / & other cōmaun∣ded by the holy churche. I haue also eaten afore the tyme and houre of the repase / and somtyme without appetyte / more for car∣nall voluptuousnes than for the necessytie and mayntenaunce of nature. I haue also taken meate and drynke so abundauntly & excessyuely / that I haue ben sycke & euyll dysposed therby / hauynge loste reason / me∣morye / and vnderstādynge. I haue caused ouer delycate and precyous meates to be or∣deyned for me / wherin I haue had great pleasure. I haue also eaten meat{is} not law∣full to be eaten on suche a daye / after the cō∣maundementes of the holy churche.
¶ Syxtly I haue synned in yre and wrath for I haue ben ofte tymes vexed & angry with my husbande / or my wyfe / with my chyldren or my menye & seruaūtes. I haue wylled through wrath to be venged / and haue desyred vengeaunce. And I haue bor¦ne in my herte the iniurye and wronge whi¦che hath ben done vnto me / and for yre and wrath / I haue not ben wyllynge to forgy∣ue hym that dyd it / nor to speke vnto hym / but rather I haue eschewed his companye.

¶ Fyfthly / I haue not ben wyllyng to for¦gyue thē / which haue troubled & vexed me. ¶ Syxtly / I haue not pacyētly borne nor suffred iniuryes / wronges / dyspysynges / tēptacyons / syckenes / oppressyons or other aduersyties. ¶ Seuenthly / I haue not hertely / affectu∣ously / and faythfull prayed for my frendes and for myne enemyes / and for them that I am bounde to praye. ¶ The .xviii. Chapytre / howe the man maye confesse hym of the syx synnes whiche be agaynst the holy ghost. I Confesse me yf I haue a¦ny maner or wyse synned in the syxe syn̄es agaynst the holy ghost. ¶ Fyrste in dyspayre / yt I haue not byleued throu¦ghe dyspayre that god is mercyfull / & wyll pardon and forgyue all synnes: after repen¦taunce / contrycyon / and confessyon. ¶ Secondaryly / that I haue wyllyngly spoken agaynst the catholyke fayth: and ha¦ue spoken agaynst that whiche was for the helth of my soule.
¶ Thyrdly / I haue ben so harde of herte & so roted in synne / that I wolde not be brou¦ghte out of it. ¶ Fourthly / that by presumpcyon I haue not dred god nor deth / nor the iugement of god / but I haue thought that I shall be sa∣ued without penaunce and good workes. ¶ Fyfthly: that I haue ben enuyous for the grace of god in another / whiche dyde with∣drawe hym selfe from synne / to good & ver¦tuous lyuynge. ¶ Syxtly / that I haue dyspysed to do pe∣naunce for my synnes. ¶ The .xix.

MOreouer / I confesse me to haue synned / & to haue offē¦ded god in my .v. wyttes & by all my membres. ¶ Fyrste / that I haue trym¦med and aorned the heer of my heed and browes with great pryde. I haue not ho∣noured nor showed reuerence to god / and my superyours with my heed / nor haue not ben obedyent therwith. I haue also gyuen
myne eares to here vnhonest wordes and cōmunycacyon / and to detraccyon. I haue not ruled and kepte myne iyes from the be∣holdynge of vnlawfull & dyshonest syght{is} I haue delyted to smell with my nose suche thynges as haue prouoked me to synne. I haue also opened my mouthe / to curse / to swere / to lye / and to deceyue. I haue also abused my tongue for to eate and drynke de¦lycyously: and my throte in syngynge wan¦ton and vnhonest songes. I haue also abu¦sed my handes to my self or to other / in vn∣clennes and lechery. I haue made my god of my body / in abundaunce of eatynge and drynkyng / and vnclennes. I haue had ma¦ny vnlawfull and vnclene thoughtes / & desyres in my herte: the whiche I wolde ha∣ue done in dede / yf shame of the worlde had not letted me. I haue mysused my legges and fete in goynge to places / where as I haue greatly greued god / wher¦of I am sorye / and I crye god mercy. ¶ The .xx. Chapytre / howe the man shall confesse hym selfe of the foure synnes cryenge vengeaunce afore god.
I Confesse me also yf I haue ī any wy¦se offended god / in the foure synnes cryenge to god for vengeaunce. ¶ Fyrste / in the synne agaynst nature: that is to saye / whan it is done in another place and in otherwyse / than nature and god ha∣ue ordeyned it. ¶ Secondaryly / that I haue shed innocent blode / or haue brought any persone to deth / without a cause. ¶ Thyrdly / that I haue oppressed and vn¦reasonably persecuted poore orphelyns: wy¦dowes / and poore folkes. ¶ Fourthly / that I haue withholden and not dewely payed those / whiche haue fayth fully serued and laboured for me / as they haue deserued. ¶ The .xxi.

I Haue yet synned ī the foure cardynall vertues / wher∣by I am bounde to lede & rule my lyfe. ¶ Fyrste: in me there is not wysdome & prudence to do and accōplysshe
my actes and dedes in tyme conuenyent / as I am bounde. ¶ Secondaryly / I haue not in me force & strength to resyste euyll and peruers incly∣nacyons and temptacyons to synne / but I haue ben lyghtly ouercome / and haue fal∣len in to synne. ¶ Thyrdly / I haue not in me the vertue of temperaūce and meane / for I haue trauay∣led / and laboured / fasted / prayed / done pe∣naunce / and other good dedes without dys∣crecyon / so that therby I haue to moche fe∣blysshed my body. ¶ Fourthly / I haue not in me the vertue of iustyce / for I haue not tourned my selfe from synne / in not doynge the vertue whi∣che I was bounde to do / & for myne owne profyte / I haue forsaken to do the cōmon profyte. ¶ The .xxii. Chapytre / howe a man shall cōfesse hym of the .iii. pryncypall ver¦tues / called Theologycall. I Haue syn̄ed ī the .iii. pryncypall vertues without the which I can not be saued. ¶ Fyrste / that I haue not in me / stedfaste fayth with good workes.
¶ Secondaryly / I haue not a sure hope of the heuenly goodnes for to come. ¶ Thyrdly / I haue not in me a feruent lo∣ue & charyte toward{is} god & my neyghbour. ¶ The .xxiii. Chapytre / howe a man shall confesse hym of the two cōmaunde∣mentes / in the whiche all the other be comprehende. I Haue synned / bycause I haue not lo∣ued my lorde god and creatoure with all my herte / my soule / and with all my myght and power. I haue ofte tymes set my herte more in the loue of folkes / and in the honoure and ioye of this worlde / in aornemētes & voluptuousnes of my body / and in the goodes / rychesse / and other va∣nyties of this worlde / than towardes god almyghtye. ¶ Also I haue not loued my chrysten bro∣ther & neyghbour as my self / doynge other∣wyse to hym / than I wold had ben done to me / wherof I am sory & crye god mercy. ¶ The .xxiiii. Chapytre / howe a man shal confesse hym / of the cogytacyons and thoughtes of his herte.
I Do accuse me also / to haue synned greatly by cogytacyons and thought{is} of my herte. ¶ Fyrste / that I haue receyued of our lorde god many good inspyracions: sterynge and mouyng me to amende my peruers & euyll lyfe / and to tourne me to penaūce / and that I shulde do good and leue the euyll. These and many other exhortacions whiche I ha¦ue receyued of god and of my holy aungell I haue resyste & withstande / as an ingrate and vnkynde persone. ¶ Secondaryly / I haue not resyste & with stande euyll thoughtes / whiche haue come vnto me by temptacyon of the flesshe or of the deuyll / but haue perseuered of a fre wyl and haue thought of them by consent / yf I myght haue had my purpose: and haue lefte it more for shame and fere of the people: thā for the loue or fere of god. In these and ma∣ny other synnes venyall and mortall / I knowlege me to haue ofte tymes offended my lorde god in herte. ¶ The .xxv. Chapytre / howe a man shall confesse hym selfe in generall of all his venyall synnes.
I Haue finally synned and do accuse me of al my ve¦nyall syn̄es / whiche be in great nombre / as of vay∣ne thoughtes / wordes / & dedes: & that I haue euyll and vnprofytably spent and lost my tyme and that I myght haue done moche more good thā I haue done. I haue not also said my prayers and penaūce so hertely and fer∣uently as I ought to do / and that I haue not so deuoutly and hertely made my con∣fessyon. I haue not praysed and lauded al∣myghty god in all his operacyons & work{is}. I haue fylled & nourysshed my body with eatynge and drynkynge more than was ne¦de or necessarye. ¶ Of these synnes and all other that I ha∣ue done in my lyfe / whether they be mortall or venyall / whiche be in my remembraun∣ce and knowen / or forgoten & not knowen by ygnoraūce / were it wakynge or slepyn∣ge / by daye or by nyght: al one or with a∣nother / I confesse me and knowlege me to haue offende god / cryenge hym mercy / and desyre absolu¦cyon of you my ghostly fa∣ther. Et Ideo precor. &c.
¶ The .xxvi. Chapytre / what thynge man receyueth / whiche worthely and in the state of grace / goth to the holy sacrament. WE haue nowe herde / howe & in what maner ye shall pre∣pare your selfe by confessyon for to go to the holy sacramēt and resteth to declare what vertues and fruytes the mā receyueth in his soule / whiche hathe so pre∣pared hym selfe. ¶ Fyrste / the man receyueth in the holy sa∣crament / the same blyssed body and flesshe that our lady mary the mother of god hath borne in her vyrgynall wombe / & the whi∣che hath hange vpon the crosse / by the whi∣che sacrament also the man is made parte taker of all the goodnes that our lorde hath done in all his lyfe / in fastynge / prayenge / prechynge / in watchynge / and in his harde and bytter passyon. Also the man therby is made parte taker of all the merytes of all the sayntes in heuen: and of all the good per¦sones in erth. ¶ Secondaryly / the man receyueth in the holy sacrament / the holy precyous & blyssed
blode of our lorde Ihesu chryste: & therby is pourged of al his syn̄es cōfessed & forgoten. And after the greatnes of his deuocyon / the multytude of his synnes be forgyuen hym. ¶ Thyrdly / the man receyueth in the holy sacrament / the noble soule of our lorde Ihe¦su chryste / the whiche he dyd cōmende han∣gynge on the crosse / to his father god almy∣ghty / wherby man pourchaseth a gayge of euerlastynge lyfe. For yf god gyue to man the greatest thynge / as his owne propre sou¦le: he wyll gyue also that whiche is lesse / as the perdurable and euerlastynge lyfe. ¶ Fourthly / he receyueth also in the holy sa¦crament / the lyfe vnyed with the body of our lorde Ihesu chryste / wherby the man is transfourmed in god. For as puyssaunce or myghte is ascrybed to god the father / to the sone sapyence or wysdome / and to the holy ghost pytie and benygnyte / so the man also by the vertue of the holy sacrament / becō∣meth myghty & stronge in prayer / to resyste the euyll temptacyons of the deuyll of hell. He becōmeth also sage and wyse for to cho∣se vertue and the good from the euyll. He doth pourchase also in hym selfe great good¦nes: as loue and charite towardes god / and pacyence and humylyte.
¶ Fyfthly / the mā receyueth by the holy sa∣crament / the dyuynyte of our lorde: wherby the soule of the man is rēplysshed with the swetnes of dyuyne grace. For the man whi¦che hathe worthely receyued the holy sacra∣ment / albeit that the breade or hoste is con∣sumed and vanysshed / yet hath he our lor∣de Ihesu chryste abydynge ī his soule with his grace / as a spyrytual meate of the soule: and so he receyueth the sacrament bodyly & ghostly. But yf he receyue it in deedly syn̄e: he receyueth it bodyly / as the very body of our lorde / but he dothe not receyue the ver∣tues aforesayde in his soule. For whan the sacrament is dygeste ī the body of man / our lorde god dothe retourne vnto heuen from whens he came by his grace / leuyng the sou¦le voyde of all vertue: and possessed of the deuyll of hell / as Iudas the traytoure was whiche receyued our lorde Ihesu chryste in the holy sacrament / in the last supper or col∣lacyon. And bycause that he was not in the state of grace but in deedly synne / therfore he receyued not the grace of god / also oure lorde dyd not tary with hym. And so there be foure maner of folkes / that receyueth the holy sacrament. ¶ The fyrst receyue it bodyly & not ghostly
¶ The seconde / receyue it spyrytually or ghostly and not bodyly. ¶ The thyrde: receyue it not neyther bodely nor ghostly. ¶ The fourthe / receyue it bodyly and not ghostly / as hereafter is declared to the helth of the soule. ¶ The .xxvii. Chapytre / of foure maner of folkes whiche receyueth onely the holy sacrament bodely / to the dāpnacyon of theyr soules. THey receyue the holy Sacra∣ment bodyly to the dampna∣cyon of theyr soules. ¶ Fyrste / those whiche wyl∣lyngly and knowynge them selfe in deedly synne do go to receyue it / for suche folkes be deed in theyr soules. And as saynt Austyne wryteth: that as the soule of the mā is the lyfe of the body / so is also god the lyfe of the soule / taryenge and dwellyn¦ge in the soule / And god and deedly synne can not dwell togyther in one place. Ther∣fore saynt Paule saythe / that a man shall proue and examyne hym selfe afore that he receyue the holy sacrament. A synner shall
examyne hym selfe in thre thynges / and so he may go worthely to the holy sacrament. ¶ Fyrste / yf he repent hym of all his syn̄es passed. ¶ Secondaryly / yf he be purposed neuer to synne more. ¶ Thyrdly / yf he haue mynde and wyll / & wyll accomplysshe that same wyll / to con∣fesse all his synnes / and after the counceyll of his confessour to make satysfaccyon for the same. All those hauynge thyse thre poyn¦tes be in the state of grace / & without deedly synne. And in case that they shulde dye so∣deynly / god wyll haue mercy of them. And may suerly receyue / vpon the mercy of god the holy sacrament. ¶ The other whiche receyueth the holy sa∣cramēt vnworthely be those whiche hauyn¦ge no knowleg of any deedly syn̄e by them cōmyt / be in a peruerse and euyll mynde & wyll to do synne / as wyllyngly to hurte a¦ny man: or to haunt lechery and vnclennes or to be prowde or other lyke. For in al deed¦ly synnes wherby a man may dampne his soule by the dede / so he maye also dampne it without the dede / onely by wyll & consent. So dyd Iudas receyue the holy sacrament beynge ī the myscheuous wyll and mynde
to betraye our lorde Ihesu chryste. And ther¦fore dyde he receyue within hym the deuyll of hell / and became worse after that he had receyued the sacrament / than he was afore. So also the people become worse and mo∣re obstynate in synne / whiche receyue the ho¦ly sacrament in an euyll and peruers myn∣de and wyll. They haue all an euyll myn∣de and wyll / whiche do not eschewe occasy¦on to syn̄e: wherby they shuld fall in synne. ¶ The thyrde maner of folkes / whiche re∣ceyue not well the holy sacrament / be the Ypocrytes whiche resemble to be good out∣wardly / but within they be full of all vn∣clennes / lechery / and enuye. They be suche whiche ones in the yere come to confessyon and do promyse to amende theyr lyuynge / but they do the contrarye. They be also su∣che whiche without occasyon by fayned hu¦mylyte / do ofte tymes refrayne to go to the holy sacrament / sayenge that they be not worthy to receyue it / in reprehendyng other whiche ofte tymes go therunto. Yf we wyll speke of the dygnyte / there is none worthy to receyue it / in heuen nor in erthe / neyther Mary the mother of god nor the apostelles. Nor god doth not desyre of vs suche prepay¦rynge as doth apperteyne to his mageste &
dyuynyte / but he desyreth onely of vs suche prepayrynge as is possyble to our power / nor he dothe not demaunde that we do not synne / or that we haue not synned / but he desyreth onely that after that we haue syn∣ned / that we be penytent and sory therfore / and that we be in purpose and wyll neuer to synne more. For saynt Peter in the laste supper dyd receyue worthely the holy sacra¦ment / yet neuertheles he renounced our lor∣de Ihesu chryste shortely after / and all the other apostelles dyd cōmyt a deedly synne with hym. Wherfore man shall do that that is in hym / goynge to the holy sacrament / & cōmendynge hym to god. ¶ The fourth maner of folkes / whiche re∣ceyue the sacrament vnworthely / be those whiche presūptuously go to the holy sacra∣ment in deedly synne / to moche trustynge to the mercy of god / thynkynge it not to be synne / whiche they do make no synne / whi¦che do not examyne theyr conscyence afore / nor remembre not theyr euyll and peruers lyuynge / nor also haue not contrycyon in theyr hertes / nor do not make theyr confessy¦on. And suche folkes albeit that they haue not knowlege of any deedly synne by them cōmytte / yet neuertheles they goynge to the
holy sacrament cōmytte a deedly synne / for they do put them selfe ī peryll. Saynt Pau¦le sayth / that the man shall examyne his cō¦scyence afore that he go therunto. O what nombre of people there is: which bere many and great synnes vpon them / and careth no thynge at all therfore. They do chose a confessoure whiche is very symple: whiche doth lede both the synner & hym selfe to hell. ¶ The .xxviii. Chapytre / howe greatly he synneth / whiche receyueth the sacrament vnworthely. THe greatnesse of the synnes of those / whiche receyue the holy sacrament vnworthely and in deedly syn̄e to theyr euerlastyn¦ge dampnacyon / maye be con∣sydered by foure reasons. ¶ Fyrste / for suche folkes be reputed afore god for murderers of Ihesu chryste the sone of god. And as saynt Gregorye sayth: they do cōmyt greater synne whiche do dyspyse god reygnynge in heuen / than those whiche dyd crucyfye hym in erth. O what penaun¦ce wolde a good catholyke man do / whiche shulde haue crucyfyed our lorde / what pe∣naunce
is he than bounde to do / which hath vnworthely receyued the body of oure lor∣de god. ¶ Secondaryly / suche folkes be oft tymes punysshed in theyr bodyes by syckenes / or by sodayne deth. And therfore cōmonly af∣ter easter cōmeth syckenes / pestylence / and other inconuenyence / And that is bycause the man so vnworthely and in deedly syn̄e receyueth the holy sacrament. ¶ Thyrdly / for they synne more enormely than the Iewes / for the Iewes dyd synne by ygnoraunce. And as saynt Paule sayth yf they had knowen it / they wold not haue crucyfyed the lorde of glorye. But the syn∣ners chrysten men knowlege god / & knowe well yt they be in great synne. The Iewes haue crucyfyed our lorde but ones / but the chrysten men do crucyfye hym very ofte / in so moche that wyttyngly they do go to the holy sacrament in deedly synne. ¶ Fourthly / suche folkes receyue vpō them the iugement of god / whiche he shall gyue vpon the dampned soules at the daye of iu∣gement / where he shall say: go ye cursed peo¦ple to euerlastynge fyre. ¶ Fyfthly / those that vnworthely receyue the holy sacrament / be lyke to Iudas the
traytoure / whiche dyd betraye and delyuer our lorde Ihesu to the Iewes. And it shall chaunce vnto them in hell / as it dyd to Iu∣das for after that he had vnworthely recey¦ued the holy sacrament: the deuyll dyd entre in to hym / so that he dyde betraye our lorde Ihesu chryste / wherfore afterwarde he fell in dyspayre and dyde hange hym selfe. So they become more obstynate in synne / those whiche receyue the holy sacrament dayly in deedly syn̄e / & they dare boldly do that thyn¦ge whiche other dare not thynke / ye and mo¦reouer do that thynge whiche the deuyll da∣re not do. And as Iudas delyuered our lor¦de to the Iewes: so in lyke case men delyuer our lorde Ihesu chryste / in as moche as they can / to the deuylles of hell. For they receyue our lorde Ihesu chryste in the place / whiche the deuyll doth possesse / and apperteyneth vnto hym. ¶ Syxtly / this is an vnkynde man / for he dyspyseth god his creatoure / which for hym hathe suffred bytter dethe vpon the crosse. This is yet a greater vnkyndnes ī the mā that the diuynyte & power of god is redy for to come to vysyte hym with his dyuyne gra¦ce inclosed in the holy sacrament / & the man maketh him self vnworthy to receyue hym.
¶ Seuenthly / suche persones be more vn∣happy than other / for the soueraygne good∣nes whiche is god: is hurtfull and dampna¦ble vnto them / & the medycyne of the soule is infyrmytie and deth vnto them. For as the holy sacrament is an euerlastynge lyfe vnto them whiche do receyue & vse it well so it is deth vnto those / whiche euyll & vn∣worthely receyue it. ¶ The .xxix. Chapytre / of those whi∣che receyue the holy Sacrament spyrytually and not bodely. THere be yet foure maner of folkes / whiche receyue the ho∣ly sacrament spyrytually or ghostly and not bodely / that is to saye / they receyue the gra¦ce of the holy sacrament secretly ī theyr sou∣les / albeit that they receyue it not vysybly in theyr bodyes / and shall be rewarded afo¦re god / as yf they had receyued it bodely. ¶ The fyrste sorte whiche receyue it spyry∣tually / be those whiche by feblenes of infyr¦mytie and syckenes can not holde meate in theyr bodyes / or whiche do coughe moche / or do cast and voyde fleume very sore & suche
other. These persones shall coueyte and de∣syre hertely to receyue it / in beholdynge it with great deuocyon sayenge. O good lor∣de I do thanke the that I maye paye / satys¦fye / and content the by a good wyll & myn¦de. O good lorde I thanke the / that in all places I maye fynde the. O good lorde I thanke the / that no persone maye hurte or hynder me towardes the. And I do thanke the good lord that whan I haue the / no per¦sone maye take me. ¶ The seconde sorte whiche receyue the ho∣ly sacrament spyrytually / be those whiche sodaynely be taken with sodayne deth / as maryners on the see / men of warre ī the fel∣de / women trauaylyng of chylde and other lyke / whiche can not haue a confessoure to confesse them / and to receyue the holy sacra¦ment. Suche persones hauyng contrycyon and repentaunce for theyr synnes and desy¦re to receyue the holy sacrament / haue afore god receyued the holy sacrament ī theyr sou¦les. Yet neuertheles they shall confesse them selfe afore yf it be possyble / & shall not trust to moche in that / to the entent that god do not withdrawe his grace. ¶ The thyrde sorte be those / whiche serue god in purenes of cōscyence / yet neuertheles
they refrayne somtyme through humylyte / to go to the holy sacrament / but they here masse with deuocyon reuerently beholdyn∣ge the holy sacrament / and by desyre to re∣ceyue it. Suche persones yf so and in suche maner they here masse / they shall be rewar∣ded afore god: as yf they had receyued the ho¦ly sacrament. ¶ The fourth sorte whiche spyrytually re∣ceyueth the holy sacrament / be those whiche be prepayred therto: and humbly desyreth to receyue it / but theyr confessours wyll not a∣gre therto. Also relygeous persones whiche after the rule of theyr ordre / maye not go to the holy sacrament / but on dayes ordeyned by theyr heedes. Yet notwithstandyng they desyre to receyue it somtymes / the whiche must be content: for afore god they haue re∣ceyued it spyrytually. And it is somtymes more acceptable to god that the man do ab∣steyne deuoutly with Centurio / than to re∣ceyue our lorde worthely with Zachee. Su∣che persones shal thynke that god hath seen some thynge in them / wherfore they maye not be admyt to receyue the holy sacrament bodely. And so they maye go afore the blys∣sed sacrament / and shall rede deuoutly these prayers folowynge / the which saynt Fraū¦cys
was wont to saye and rede with great deuocyon / or a man maye saye them in his chambre afore the crucyfyxe or crosse of our lorde god / thynkynge that the very sone of god doth hange there. ¶ The .xxx. Chapytre / what thynge a man shall rede whiche desyreth spy∣rytually to receyue the holy sacra¦ment with his dyuyne grace. THat man whiche spyrytually desy∣reth to receyue the body of our lorde Ihesu chryste with his dyuyne gra∣ce / vertue / and fruytes he shall hūble hym selfe perfoundely afore god. And shall rede these fyue prayers deuoutly vpō his knees or in his chambre ī the maner here showed. ¶ Here thou shalt knele on thy knees and shall saye. O Lorde Ihesu chryste here I am vpō my knees afore thy blyssed iyes and presence / as a synner and an euyll doer afore a iuge. And I knowe that after thy iustyce / I haue lost and forfayte my bo¦dy & soule. Wherfore I praye the good lorde Ihesu chryste / by the sentēce of deth wrong¦fully gyuen of the / that thou wylt be a mer∣cyfull
iuge to me / whan my soule shall de¦parte from my body. Amen. ¶ Pater noster. Aue maria. ¶ Nowe thou shalt ryse vp and saye. O Good lorde Ihesu chryst here I am afore thyne iyes and in thy presence: as a bonde man afore his lorde and mayster / whom I and all other creatures be bounde to serue euerlastyngly. I praye the good lorde Ihesu chryste that thou wylt lette me knowe thy dere wyll in all thyng{is} to be done / and to let it be acceptable to the / and lette me not do that thynge / wherby I maye lease thy loue euerlastyngly. Amen. ¶ Pater noster. Aue maria. ¶ Here thou shalt knele agayne / and shall saye hertely. O Lorde Ihesu chryst here I am on my knees afore thy blyssed face / as a po∣re begger afore a ryche kynge. I praye the O kynge of glory: that thou wylt cloth my soule with the vestment of thy dyuyne lo∣ue / and to enryche the same with thy grace in all vertue / & to aorne the same with the perles of pacyence / to the entent that so aor∣ned I may com to the soueraygne maryage
wherunto thou hast called me. Amen. ¶ Pater noster. Aue maria. ¶ Here thou shalt ryse with fere / and shall saye. O Lorde god Ihesu chryste here I am afore thy reuerēde presence: as a man afore his derest frende / whom I & al other creatures be bounde to loue / for thou haste made & delyuered vs by thy precyous blode. O benygne Ihesu chryste I pray the kepe and defende me alwayes / and graunt me to perceyue howe good and swete thou art / to the entent that therby all payne and ioye / and also all creatures maye be bytter vnto me. Amen. ¶ Pater noster. Aue maria. ¶ Nowe thou shalt knele agayne / and shall saye. O Lorde Ihesu chryste here I am hum¦bly on knees afore thy dyuyne iyes / as a chylde afore his father: of whom I haue receyued body and soule / albeit that I haue not ben at all tymes obedyent / as a true and faythfull chylde ought to be to his father. I pray the O my father euerlastyn∣ge by thy paternall loue / that thou wylt no¦rysshe
me here in erth with the heuenly brea¦de / and in chastysynge me for my faultes / haue mercy of me / to the entent that so I puryfyed of my synnes / we maye reioyse / thou in me and I in the / with all the saynt{is} in heuen euerlastyngly. Amen. ¶ Pater noster. Aue maria. ¶ The .xxxi. Chapytre / of those whiche neyther spyrytually nor bodely re∣ceyue the holy sacrament. THyrdly / there be some {per}sones whiche neyther spyrytually nor bodely / receyue the holy sacrament / and that do with∣drawe them selfe from the lyf¦ly fountayne of grace: wherby they become drye in theyr soules / as a braunche cut from a tree. ¶ Fyrste / they be those whiche be harde her∣ted / obstynate / and roted in theyr euyll and peruers lyuynge / and wyll not leue it / As those which be in adultery / those whiche do lede theyr lyues in a lyght and cōmon ma∣ner / those whiche do haunt olde fylthy / and vnhonest tauernes or lodgyng{is} / or whiche do possesse goodes vnryghtfully / or also
whiche be in enuye or suche lyke deedly syn¦nes. These persones / albeit that they synne lease bycause they do not go to the holy sa∣crament in suche an euyll and peruers lyfe: yet neuertheles they synne deedly / bycause that one ī the yere they do not prepare them selfe to the holy sacrament. For they myght leue theyr synne and confesse them therof / and so go to the holy sacrament / where as nowe they tarye in deedly synne and in the state of euerlastynge dāpnacyon: in the whi¦che they maye at all houres dye. ¶ Secondaryly / all Infydelles / as Tur∣kes / Sarazyns / Iewes / and paynyms / & other whiche do not byleue in Ihesu chryste the sone of god & in the holy catholyke chur∣che. All persones blynded in theyr malyce & synne / wherby they dyspyse the holy sacra∣ment / & mocke them that do receyue it. And bycause that they byleue not in the sone of god / and do not receyue hym in the holy sa∣crament / whiche is the lyfe of the soule / ther¦fore they abyde and dwell in dethe / and be deed in theyr soules. ¶ Thyrdly / there be yet some which do not receyue the holy sacrament / as Herytykes / that is to saye chrysten people / whiche vn∣derstāde the holy scrypture otherwyse than
the holy ghost doth speke it by the prophetes and that that is ordeyned by the holy chur∣che / as to go to confessyon / to faste / to go to the holy sacrament / to repute as no thynge excōmunycacyon / and not to sanctyfye the holy dayes / and to honoure our lady & other sayntes / or to gyue any almous in theyr ho¦noure to the poore folkes / to dyspyse and set at nought pardons & indulgences / and of suche other artycles they haue many. And these persones go not to the holy sacrament whan and where they may / for they byleue not in the holy sacrament. And yf they go to confessyon or to the holy sacrament / they do it without fayth / and bycause that they shall not be knowen from other / and in ly∣ke case they com to the churche to here masse. ¶ Fourthlye / they be those whiche take so great payne in worldly busynes / as to go in to the countre for marchaūdyse and other transytory thynges / that they forgette to re∣ceyue the holy sacrament. For there be some folkes which yf they dyd not gyue them sel¦fe therunto / they wolde receyue the holy sa∣crament more than ones in the yere / as on the foure pryncypall and solempne festes / and the feestes of our lady. But bycause yt they be colde in deuocyon / and that they be
loth to prepare them selfe & to confesse them they lette it passe lyghtly / and go not to the holy sacrament / wherof they shall gyue a compte afore god. For that man that goth so seldome to the holy sacrament / he becō∣meth so slouthfull / so colde and drye to war¦des god / that he is oft tymes wery and loth to thynke of god: to here of god / and to serue hym. And yf he do saye one Pater noster: he feleth hym selfe wery and thynketh it very tedyous. This is bycause that the soule is not ofte tymes fedde and refresshed / wher∣by it becōmeth feble / colde / and sycke / and inclyned to deedly syn̄e / wherin it doth ma∣ke an ende of the lyfe. ¶ The .xxxii. Chapytre / of them whiche worthely receyueth the holy sacra∣ment in grace: and howe a man maye knowe that he hath re¦ceyued it in grace. FOurthly / there be yet so∣me maner of folkes whi∣che receyue the holy sacra∣ment bodely and ghostly in grace / to the helthe of soules. These be all good catholyke persones / whiche haue prepayred
them selfe therto with all dylygence by true contrycyon and confession as is aforesayd. These persones wyll not prepare them self onely to receyue well and worthely the ho∣ly sacrament / but they be very dylygent in kepynge and holdynge it with them. And ther is .vii. tokens wherby a man may kno¦we stedfastly / that god resteth styll in his soule / and in the holy sacrament. ¶ The fyrste is / that so longe as a man is contryte & sory for his synnes passed whan soeuer he doth remēbre them: suche a persone lyueth styll in his soule. But whan a man reioyseth and taketh pleasure in remēbryn∣ge his synnes passed / than his soule begyn∣neth to dye: & god to departe from hym with his dyuyne grace. ¶ The seconde token is / so longe as a man is dylygent to ordre his thoughtes / wordes and dedes / to the profyte & helth of his soule and to the instruccyon and example of his neyghboure / and that he do all his busynes and workes with fere / to the entent that no man take any euyll example at hym: And that he desyre that god onely be honoured in all his good workes: suche folkes haue god inclosed in theyr hertes. ¶ The thyrde token is / so longe as a man
hath pacyence in his trybulacyon: for no mā can tell what a mā is in wardly / afore that he be proued outwardly. Some and many folkes esteme them selfe to be good and ho∣ly / yet they can not suffre or bere pacyently one lytell worde / the whiche is a token that they be farre from the waye of perfeccyon / for holynes consysteth in trybulacyon. For it is better to haue pacyence in trybulacyon than to do moche good dedes withoute pa∣cyence. ¶ The fourth token is / so longe as a man hath sauoure: pleasure / and ioye in the remē¦braunce of euerlastynge lyfe / in the worde of god / in the passyon of our lorde / and in other lyke / god is styll restynge in his soule. For yf he haue no pleasure nor sauoure in these thynges / it is a token that his herte is remplysshed and full of worldly and tem∣porall thyng{is} by carnall ioye and pleasure. And suche folk{is} haue chased our lorde Ihe∣su chryste from theyr soules: for carnall ioye & spyrytuall consolacyon / maye not dwell togyther in one place. ¶ The fyfth token is / so longe as a man is feruent and deuoute in sayenge his prayers to god / and that at that tyme he put awaye all rumoure and trouble from his herte in
as moche as he maye / and that he speke god¦ly and fruytfull wordes / and that he than∣ke god of all his benefytes and goodnes / as well for aduersytie as prosperyte. Suche a man hath god remaynyng styll in his herte: but whan he doth begyn to speke detraccy∣ons or backbytynges / to curse / or other euyl wordes / it is a token that he is deed in his soule / and that god is not with hym: For he that is of god / he wyll gladly here to speke of god. ¶ The syxt token is / so longe as a man fe∣leth hym self redy to serue god / and dylygēt to all good workes / it is a token that suche a man hath ben worthely at the holy sacra∣ment. For our lorde Ihesu chryste moueth the herte and the soule within / howe he shal lyue and kepe hym from synne / for the loue of god is neuer Idle ī man for to cause hym do well. ¶ The seuenth token is / so longe as a man hath in hym the loue of god and of his ney∣ghboure chrysten brother / in louynge god a¦boue all thynge: & doynge to his neyghbour as he wolde shulde be done to hym / as to cō¦forte those that be desolate and cōfortles / to helpe the poore in theyr nede / and suche lyke good dedes. This persone shall not doubte
but that he is in the grace & fauoure of god. ¶ The .xxxiii. Chapytre / of the .xii. ver∣tues and fruytes / whiche the man receyueth / that worthely goth to the holy sacrament. FYnally it is to be declared what vertues and fruyt{is} the good mā receyueth in goynge worthely / to the holy sacrament. Saynt Iohan in the apocalypse dyde se in Paradyse .xii. maner of fruytes. The tre is our lorde Ihesu chryste / whiche hath borne and lefte to vs in the holy sacra¦ment .xii. maner & sortes of fruyt{is} agaynst xii. maledyccyons or cursynges / the whiche our soules receyue in cōmyttynge a deedly synne. ¶ Fyrste / synne causeth the soule to be feble and redy to all euyll / but the holy sacramēt heleth the soule of syn̄e / and maketh it wor∣thy of all vertues. ¶ Secondaryly / by deedly synne man doth bynde hym selfe to euerlastynge payne and dampnacyon / but by the holy sacrament he is assoyled of all deedly synne. And after
the great deuocyon that he hath towardes the sacramēt / the multytude of paynes and tourmentes be remytted. ¶ Thyrdly / man dothe dyspoyle hym selfe by deedly syn̄e / of all the good workes that he hath done in all his lyfe / so longe as he is in deedly syn̄e. But whan he doth retourne to grace / doynge penaunce humbly for his synnes / and that he receyueth worthely the holy body of god / god restoreth agayne to hym all his good workes. ¶ Fourthly: deedly synne blyndeth man by neclygent ygnoraunce / & maketh hym loth to leue his syn̄e / but the holy sacrament put¦teth in to the soule of man by his vertue & myght: a lyght of knowlege the which doth illumynate the soule and puryfye it / so that from thensforth man knoweth the wyll of god / and the greatnes of synne. ¶ Fyfthly / deedly synne maketh place for the deuyll / by his temptacyons in the soule of man / but the holy sacrament doth arme the soule of man agaynst the deuyll and his dartes or temptacyons. For where he seeth the blode of our lorde / he flyeth from thens and the aūgelles do helpe the man to fyght agaynst the deuyll and enemye of hell. ¶ Syxtly / deedly synne inclyneth the man
and doth plucke hym to many other deedly synnes / yf it be not incontynent wasshed & taken awaye by true penaunce / but by the blyssed sacrament man becōmeth stedfaste and stronge in grace and redy to all vertue so longe as he doth not fall to syn̄e agayne. ¶ Seuenthly / by deedly synne man is bese¦ged of the deuyll / but by the blyssed sacra∣ment he is vnyed with god / so that he loue god: wherby he doth pourchase and obteyne taste and sauoure of euerlastynge lyfe. ¶ Eyghtly / the soule of man dyeth of euer∣lastynge deth by deedly syn̄e / so that it kno∣weth not what to do that maye be accepta∣ble to god / and to hym selfe profytable / but the holy sacrament doth preserue and kepe the soule of man from the deth of synne / so that he doth abyde in the lyfe of grace / And his work{is} be acceptable to god / and to hym selfe profytable. ¶ Nynthlye / deedly synne maketh a man sorowfull pensyfe & heuy of herte / and har∣de and euyll wyllynge to all vertue / but the blyssed sacramēt maketh the man wor∣thy mete & redy to all vertue / and tourneth all his inwarde myght towardes god / and spyrytuall ioye and gladnes. ¶ Tenthly / man doth depryuate hym selfe
by deedly synne of the passyon / payne / and tourment of our lorde Ihesu chryste / of ma¦ry the mother of god / and of all the sayntes. Also of all the good workes and cōmuny∣on of the holy churche / and of all the good∣nes in heuen and in erth / but by the holy sa∣crament man maketh hym selfe parte taker of all the goodnes that the sone of god hath done vpon the erth / and of all other good dedes. ¶ Eleuenthly / man is dayly cursed of god & of the holy churche for deedly synne / wher¦by man hath alwayes an inconstaunt and troubled conscyence / but by the holy sacra∣ment he pourchaseth in his soule / a swete spyrytuall ioye and gladnes / and great pea¦ce and rest in his conscyence / the which doth passe all gladnes & pleasure that man may haue in all his lyfe in this worlde. ¶ Twelfthly / man is for deedly synne put out of the gate of Paradyse and of euerla∣stynge lyfe: & dysinheryte of the soueraygne rychesse / but by well and worthely recey∣uynge the holy sacrament it is forgyuen: as to a chylde & heyre of the precyous treasure of the glory of heuen / the whiche they onely shall possede and euerlastyngly vse and en¦ioye / whiche worthely / bodely / and ghostly
receyue here in erth the holy sacrament / As chryste hym self sayth as it is wryten in the begynnynge of the thyrde boke. Hic est pa∣nis. &c. This is the breade descended from heuen / and all those whiche eateth of this breade shall lyue euerlastyngly / to the whi¦che brynge vs Ihesu chryste very god and man / inclosed and conteyned in the holy sa¦crament. Amen. ¶ This prayer shall a man saye whan he goth to the holy sacrament / or for to here masse deuoutly. I Do salute the moste holy body of oure lorde Ihesu chryste / conteyned in this sacrament / I do confesse & knowlege the with my lyppes / and with my hert I desyre & coueyte the / I pray the that thou wylte this daye come to conforte my poore soule gracyously / the whiche desyreth and coueyteth to receyue the holy oblacyon and fountayne of all grace / to the ende that I may be with the in ioye and consolacyon of thy presence / in body & in soule. O benygne lorde Ihesu chryste / haue not regarde to my
many folde synnes / but haue regarde to thy great mercy / for thou arte he by whom all the worlde is made & delyuered. Thou arte the innocent lambe which is offred vp this daye to the father of heuen / for all the worl∣de. O most swetest heuēly breade. O most ioyfull buurayge or drynke / Gyue to my mouth a swete sauoure of thy holsome pre∣sence / illumynate me with thy loue / take a¦waye my malyce and synne: and put in me vertue and grace to the helthe of my soule.

MY soule dothe magnyfye our lorde. And my spyryte hath reioysed ī god my sauyoure. For he hathe beholden the humylyte of his mayde ser∣uaunt / therfore all generacions shall blysse me. For he whiche is myghtye / hathe done great thynges to me / and his name is holy. And his mercy is from generacyon to gene¦racyon to them that fere hym. He hath ma∣de power in his arme / he hath sprede abro∣de the prowde herted men. He hath deposed and put downe the myghty men from theyr place / & hath exalted the humble persones. He hath rēplysshed and fyllyd the hungrye and nedy persones with goodes / & hath left the ryche voyde. He hathe receyued Israel his sone / remēbrynge his mercy. As he hath spoken & showed to our fathers Abraham / and to his sede for euermore. Glory be to the father / the sone / and the holy ghost / through out all the worlde for euermore. Amen.
¶ A man shal rede this prayer after that he hath worthely receyued the holy sacramēt. O Lorde Ihesu chryste / thankes & pray∣synges be to thy ineffable and incom¦parable benygnyte and goodnes: whiche so louyngly hathe made me parte taker of thy blyssed body / and precyous blode / wherwt thou hast now norysshed & fedde my soule. O penetrable and persyng lyght. O lyght reluysant and shynynge aboue all lyghtes. Illumynate and clere my vnderstandyng and shyne & perce my soule of all sydes. So that no maner of spotte do abyde there whe¦re as thy dygnyte hath come / thankes be to our lorde god the father in his puyssaunce & magestie / thankes be to oure lorde god / the sone in his sapyence and wysdom: thankes be to the holy ghoste / in his amyable pytie. O lorde Ihesu chryste / in these thre thyng{is} thou arte one. O amyable lorde god Ihesu chryste / I thanke the that thou hast vouche¦safe to here me / an vnworthy creature / and to reioyse & cōforte my pensyfe herte. That that I haue desyred of the / thou hast gyuen it me. And that whiche of longe tyme I ha¦ue coueyted and desyred / now I haue recey¦ued it. O lorde god / thou arte the fruytefull
tree of our helthe / the whiche thou thy selfe hathe planted in oure blyssed Lady thy mo∣ther / And of that same thy mother beynge a vyrgyne thou hast receyued nature humay¦ne / wherwith nowe I am fedde. O lorde god / nowe is the same selfe tree planted in erth where there is no humydyte nor moyst¦nes of grace. Wherfore I beseche the of mer∣cy / that in the same it may please the to sen∣de the swete moystnes and dewe of the ho∣ly ghost / the whiche shall cause the noble ro∣te whiche thou good Lorde hath planted in my soule to florysshe & sprynge. O hyghe power and mageste of the father entre in to my thoughtes. O sapyence and wysdome of the sone / entre in to my vnderstandynge & intellygence. O pyte of the holy ghost / en¦tre in to my wyll / so that these thre myghty vertues maye answere to thy trynyte: from whens they be com. And I beseche the good lorde for the great loue that thou hast to thy dere mother and to all sayntes / that frō hensforth thou gyue me grace to syn̄e no more / and to fulfyll thy wyl in all thynges to the whiche the father / the sone / and the holy ghost helpe & lede vs. Amen.
¶ Another prayer that a man shall say af∣ter that he hath ben at the holy sacramēt / wherby the the pope  gyueth moche pardon and indulgence. O Most holy soule of Ihesu chryste san¦ctyfye me. O most pure body of Ihe¦su chryste saue me. O most swete blode of Ihesu chryste make me entre in to thy loue. O most pure and clere water of the syde of our lord Ihesu chryste wasshe me from my synnes. O most bytter passyon of Ihesu chryste cōforte and strengthen me. O most feruent swete of the face of our lorde Ihesu chryste hele me. O good lorde Ihesu chryste here and exalte my prayer / and in thy woū¦des hyde me / and do not suffre me to be sepe¦rate from the: delyuer me from the deuyll & enemye of hell: at the houre of deth helpe me and let me be set nere to the / to the entent yt euerlastyngly I maye reioyse with all the aungelles in heuen / in gyuyng praysynges and thankes vnto the. Amen. ¶ Another prayer after that a man hath ben at the holy Sacrament. O Lorde Ihesu chryste I praye the / that thy body and precyous blode / whiche
I a poore synner haue receyued / maye rem∣plysshe and satysfye my soule / and graunt that in me there do not abyde any spotte of synne / where nowe the holy sacrament is entred. O good lord sauyoure of all creatu¦res / whiche doth not desyre the deth of syn∣ners: I beseche the most humbly by thy blys¦sed body & precyous blode / that thou wylte assure me from al fere & drede / and to graūt me peace with all men / and remyssyon of all my synnes / to the entent that the holy sa¦crament be not to my dampnacyon / but to the helth and medycyne of my soule. I bese∣che the also graunt me grace and felycyte / & helth to lyuynge persones / and euerlastyng rest to those that be deed: and specyally haue mercy of the soules of my father & mother / my brother or syster / and of all my frendes which haue done me good / or for the which I am bounde to praye. And whan the last houre of my lyfe shall come / that the holy aūgelles maye receyue me: and brynge and lede me to euerlastynge ioye. Amen. ¶ This prayer maye a man saye / whan he hath ben at the holy sacrament: & whan he goth therto / or eueryday in the we¦ke / whan a mā hath herde masse.
