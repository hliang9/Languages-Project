WHereas Charls Stuart late King of England, Ireland, and the Territories and Dominions thereunto be∣longing, hath by authority derived from Parliament, been, and is hereby declared to be justly con∣demned, adjudged to dye and put to death, for many treasons, marthers, and other hainous offences committed by him, by which Iudgement he stood and is hereby declared to be attainted of High Treason, wher∣by his Issue and Posterity, & all others pretending Title under him, are become uncapable of the said Crowns, or of being King or Queen of the said Kingdom or Dominions, or either or any of them: Be it therefore En∣acted and Ordained, and it is Enacted, Ordained and Declared by this present Parliament, and by authority thereof, That all the people of England and Ireland, and the Dominions and Territories thereunto belonging, of what degree or condition soever, are discharged of all Fealty, Homage and Allegiance which is or shall be pre∣tended to be due unto any of the Issue and Posterity of the said late King, or any claiming under him; and that Charls Stuart eldest son, and James called Duke of York, second son, and all other the Issue and Posterity of him the said late King, and all and every person and persons pretending Title from, by or under him, are and be disabled to hold or enjoy the said Crown of England and Ireland, and other the Dominions thereunto belonging, or any of them; or to have the Name, Title, Stile or Dignity of King or Queen of England and Ireland, Prince of Wales, or any of them; or to have and enjoy the power and Dominion of the said Kingdoms and Dominions, or any of them, or the Honors, Manors, Lands, Tenements, Possessions and Hereditaments belonging or appertain∣ing to the said Crown of England and Ireland, and other the Dominions aforesaid, or to any of them; or to the Principality of Wales, Dutchy of Lancaster or Cornwal, or any or either of them, Any Law, Statute, Ordinance, Vsage or Custom to the contrary hereof in any wise notwithstanding: And whereas it is and hath been found by experience, that the Office of a King in this Nation and Ireland, and to have the power thereof in any single person, is unnecessary, burthensom and dangerous to the liberty, safety and publique interest of the people, and that for the most part, use hath been made of the Regal power and prerogative, to oppress, impoverish and en∣slave the subject; and that usually and naturally any one person in such power, makes it his interest to incroach upon the iust freedom and liberty of the people, and to promote the setting up of their own will and power above the Laws, that so they might enslave these Kingdoms to their own Lust: Be it therefore Enacted and Ordained by this prefent Parliament, and by Authority of the same, That the Office of a King in this Nation, shall not henceforth reside in, or be exercised by any one single person; and that no one person whatsoever, shall or may have, or hold the Office, Stile, Dignity, Power or Authority of King of the said Kingdoms and Dominions, or any of them, or of the Prince of Wales, Any law, statute, usage or custom to the coutrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding. And it is hereby Enacted, That if any person or persons shal endeavor to attempt by force of arms or otherwise, or be ayding, assisting, comforting or abetting, unto any per∣son or persons yt shall by any ways or means whatsoever, endeavor or attempt the reviving or setting up again of any pretended Right of the said Charls, eldest Son to the said late King, James called Duke of York, or of any other the Issue & Posterity of ye said late King, or of any person or persons claiming under him or them, to the said Regal Office, Stile, Dignity or Authority, or to be Prince of Wales; or the promoting of any one person what∣soever, to the Name, Stile, Dignity, Power, Prerogative or Authority, of King of England and Ireland, and Do∣minions aforesaid, or any of them; That then every such offence shall be deemed and adjudged High Treason, and the offenders therein, their councellors, procurers, ayders & abettors, being convicted of the said Offence, or any of them, shall be deemed and adjudged Traytors against the Parliament and people of England, and shall suffer, lose and forfeit, and have such like and the same pains, forfeitures, judgements and execution, as is used in case of High Treason: And whereas by the abolition of the kingly Office provided for in this Act, a most happy way is made for this Nation (if God see it good) to return to its just & ancient right, of being governed by its own Representatives or National meetings in Councel, from time to time chosen & entrusted for that pur∣pose by the people, It is therefore Resolved and Declared by the Commons assembled in Parliament, That they will put a period to the sitting of this present Parliament, and dissolve the same so soon as may possibly stand with the safety of the people that hath betrusted them, and with what is absolutely necessary for the pre∣serving and upholding the Government now setled in the way of a Commonwealth; and that they will care∣fully provide for the certain chusing, meeting and sitting of the next and future Representatives, with such o∣ther circumstances of freedom in choyce & equality in distribution of Members to be elected thereunto, as shall most conduce to the lasting freedom and good of this Commonwealth: And it is hereby further Enacted and Declared, notwithstanding any thing contained in this Act, no person or persons of what condition and quality soever, within the Commonwealth of England and Ireland, Dominion of Wales, the Islands of Guernsey and Jersey, and Town of Berwick upon Tweed, shall be discharged from the obedience and subjection which he and they owe to the Government of this Nation, as it is now Declared, but all and every of them shall in all things render and perform the same, as of right is due unto the supreme authority hereby declared to reside in this and the successive Representatives of the people of this Nation, and in them onely.
