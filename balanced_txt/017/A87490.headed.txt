A LETTER OF ADVICE TO HIS EXCELLENCY The LORD General Monck, TENDING To the Peace and Welfare of this NATION. Printed in the Year, 1659.
May it please your Excellency, 'TIs not out of any fear or distrust of your good intentions to the publique good, that I assume the confidence, to ex∣cite you thereunto, your own inclinations I hope, though wrap'd up in ambiguous ex∣pressions, fixes on the same thing: I must ingeniously confess my affection and zeal to your person, whom I infinitely esteem, is the only Motive of this Address unto you▪ You cannot be insensible or ignorant, my Lord, how our expectations have been wea∣ried (by those ambitious and self-interessed persons, who have too long sate at the Stern of Government) with promises of an immu∣nity of our Priviledges and Liberties, and a firm and glorious establishment of the Com∣monwealth; and yet to our Misery, and anxiety of soule, We have been so far from enjoying the Fruits thereof, that our Slavery and oppressions are become more intolerable then the Egyptian bondage; the specious and smooth
pretences of those cunning So∣phisters, whereby they have deluded many thousand persons, was nothing else but a vi∣zard to disguise the cruelty of their wicked proceedings, their actions have alwayes run counter to their Protestations; and that pre∣tended Liberty, which they so sooth'd up and inflamed the vulgar withall, hath proved nothing else but an imaginary Chymera. My Lord, It is now perspicuous and evi∣dent to all the World, unlesse to those who are wilfully blind, that they never intended the publique welfare, or any settlement in Church or State; but to carry on their own ambitious designes and private ends; the Foundation whereof, they have laid on the ruines of many Ancient and Honourable Families. My Lord, It is not my intention, nor do I think it absolutely necessary to rip up and lay before your eyes, all the particular Grie∣vances of this miserable Nation, they are so many and so prodigious, that I should (see∣mingly) render my self guilty of notorious falsity to dilute them; I will leave that therefore to those, whose sufferings and un∣supportable Oppressions, will cry loud in
your ears, and penetrate your soul, which I hope will be so prevalent with your good∣nesse and clemency, that you will speedily put a period to this tyrannical Power, and convene a Free Parliament, unto whom all publique Grievances may be freely and am∣ply propounded and redressed. My Lord, God hath given you that power now, whereof you may make a ery good use, which certainly if you neglect to doe, your own ruine will infallibly follow: the Sword is now in your hand, it behoves you therefore speedily to cut off the head of that monstrous beast, that hath violated both Church and State, and rooted up both our Liberties and Priviledges, never think or imagine your self securely seated in their favour, by the services and obligations they have received from you; let the Examples of others, be a caution to you for that; and assure your self, if you destroy not them, they will ruine you; and your onely security depends upon their de∣struction; this must be the first thing you are obliged to doe, in which you happily open a
way for the calling of a Free Parlia∣ment: In doing whereof, give me leave to mind your Lordship of two or three Particu∣lars of high concernment. First, Let there be an especial care taken in the Elections, that the persons be pru∣dential and honest, and of considerable For∣tunes. Secondly, That they be unbiassed, and un-interess'd in the late Kings, Queens, Bi∣shops, or any other Lands, or otherwise. Lastly, That they may freely Debate, freely Vote, without searing the obstructing or menacing of an Armie; this is the way to make it a happie Parliament, and us a flou∣rishing People. My Lord, I have so high an opinion of your courage & heroical spirit, that I believe you dare attempt a more hazardous enter∣prize then this, for the dis-enslaving your Countrie; wherein I must confesse I cannot apprehend you expose your self to the least danger: several parts of the Nation have al∣ready declared for a Free Parliament, which if countenanced by so great a person as your Self,
no doubt but they wil venture their Lives and Fortunes, for the effecting thereof; and more then this, you are ascer∣tain'd of the Assistance and Conjunction of the powerful and populous Citie of London, whose Declaration you have alreadie seen, and whose Fidelity you need not doubt, and who are resolved never to own this Ar∣bitrarie and tyrannical power. I need not tell your Lordship, I suppose you are alreadie sensible of it, how the eyes of all people are fixed on you; and the great hopes they have alreadie conceived of your Lordships good intentions, have chained their Affections to you: 'tis on you Sir they look as their DELIVERER; and certainly 'tis in your power to make this a happy, or continue it a miserable Nation. My Lord, Give me leave to tell you the Advantages will accrue unto You, by the accomplishment of so glorious a Work, as the Establishment of this Nation: that sub∣limitie of grandeur You have raised your self to by your Sword, You need never fear a di∣minution of, the just and lawful Power you Erect, will not only confirm
and settle You in it, and your Posterity after you, but gratifie You with the highest Reward You can expect or imagine, as a Testimonie of their deep resentment of Your reall worth and merit: the Memory of Your Person will be Reverenced by succeeding Ages, and Your Name and Actions Recorded in the Annals of Fame, which neither Time nor Malice will be ever able to obliterate. Thus my Lord, I have briefly given You my ADVICE very faithfully, without flattery or fraud; God Almighty will bless You in the Management of it, 'tis the prayer of all good People, and of Me in particular, who am My Lord Your Lordships most faithful Servant, T. J.
