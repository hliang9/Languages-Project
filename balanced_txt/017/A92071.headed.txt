TWO SPEECHES IN THE HOVSE OF COMMONS: THE FIRST, Concerning a Contribution for the Poore, Naked, Hunger-sterv'd English, sent out of Ireland into England. THE SECOND, Concerning Tolleration of Re∣ligion in Ireland. Made by Sir Benjamin Rudyerd. London, Printed 1642.
THE FIRST SPEECH IN THE HOVSE OF COMMONS, concerning a con∣tribution for the Poore, Naked, Hun∣ger-sterv'd English, sent out of Ire∣land into England. Mr. SPEAKER, THis Day is appointed for a charitable worke, a worke of bowels and compassion: I pray God, wee may never have the like occasion, to move, to stirre up our cha∣rity. These miserable people, are made so, because of their Religion. Hee that will not suffer for his Religion, is not worthy to bee saved by it: and hee is unwor∣thy
thy to enjoy it, that will not releeve those that suf∣fer for it. I did know but the last yeare heere in England, some (and they no Papists) who were resolved to make Ireland their retreate, as the safer Kingdom of the two. We doe now see a great, a dismall Change, God knowes whose turne shall be next, it is wrapped up in his Providence. That which happens to one Coun∣trey, may happen to any. Time and Chance comes upon all, though guided by a certaine hand. The right way to make a man truely sensible of an others calamity, is, To thinke himselfe into the same case and condition, and then to doe as he would bee done unto. Wherefore, Master Speaker, Let our Guift bee a matter of Bounty, not of Covetousnesse, that it may abound to our account in the day of reckoning. He that lowes plentifully, shall reape plentifully. I am sure, He that lends to the Lord hath the best security, and cannot be a looser.
