BASILIUS VALENTINUS, OF Natural and Supernatural Things. CHAP. I. BEcause I have at this present underta∣ken to write of the of the first Tin∣cture, the Root of Metals and Mine∣rals, and to inform you of the Spiritual Essence, how the Me∣tals and Minerals are at first spiri∣tually
conceived and born cor∣porally; it will be necessary first of all to utter, and to acquaint you by a speech, that all things consist of two parts, that is, Na∣tural and Supernatural; what is visible, tangible, and hath form or shape, that is natural; but what is intactible, without form, and spiritual, that is supernatu∣ral, and must be apprehended and conceived by Faith; such is the Creation, and especially the Eternity of God without end, immensible and incomprehensi∣ble; for Nature cannot conceive nor apprehend it by its humane reason: This is supernatural, what Reason cannot apprehend, but must be conceived by Faith, this is a Divine matter, and be∣longs to Theology, which judg∣eth Souls. Moreover, there ap∣pertains to supernatural things,
the Angels of the Lord, having clarified Bodies, doing that by the permission of their Creator, which is impossible for any other Creature to do, their Works be∣ing concealed from the Eyes of the World, and so likewise are the Works of the Infernal Spi∣rits and Devils unknown, which they do by the permission of the most High God. But above all the great Works of God are found and acknowledged to be supernatural, not to be scann'd and comprehended by Humane Imaginations; such is in especial the great Grace and Mercy of God which he bestows upon Mankind out of his great Love, which indeed no man can appre∣hend or know, and other great and wonderful works which he hath manifested divers manner of wayes by Christ our Saviour and
Redeemer, for the confirmation of his Omnipotence and Glory: As when he raised Lazarus from the dead, Iairus his Daughter, the Ruler of the Synagogue, and the Widows Son of Naim. He made the Dumb to speak, the Deaf to hear, and the Blind to see, all which are supernatural, and Magnalia Dei; so also was his Conception, Resurrection, Descension, and Ascension into Heaven, too deep and mysterious for Nature; all which is only to be obtained by Faith. There belongs likewise to su∣pernatural things, the taking of Enoch and  into Heaven, the divine rapture of St. Paul in the Spirit into the third Heaven. Moreover, many supernatural things are done by Imagination, Dreams, and Visions; many won∣ders are done by the Imagination
witness the speckled Sheep by the speckled Rods laid in their watring places. God warned the wise men of the East by an espe∣cial Dream not to return again to Herod; likewise their three Per∣sons, their three Gifts, Presents, or Offerings, and the supernatu∣ral Star, have all their peculiar and mystical meaning. Nor was that Dream which hapned to Pilates Wife natural, who unjustly adjudged our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ to death. The Vision of the Angels which appeared to the Shepherds at the Birth of Christ, and to the Wo∣men at his Sepulchre, who sought his Body where they had laid it, cannot be accounted Natural. There are many other super∣natural things done at several times by the Prophets & Saints; so was the voice of the Ass spea∣king
to Balaam, contrary to the common course of Nature; as also Joseph's Interpretation of Dreams. And so God by his Angels preserves us oftentimes from infinite Evils, and delivers us out of manifold Dangers, im∣possible for Nature to do. All this & many others belong to Theology, and to Heaven, whereunto the Soul is to have regard. Now follows the super∣natural things of the visible Works of God, as we see them in the Firmament; to wit, the Planets, Stars, and Elements, which are above our Reason, on∣ly their Course and Motion is observed by speculation and reckoning, which belongs to Astronomy; it is a visible but incomprehensible Being, perform∣ing its operation in a Magnetick way, out of which likewise di∣vers
admirable things are found and observed, which arè alto∣gether supernatural; understand it thus, that the Heaven operates in the Earth, and the Earth af∣fords a correspondence with the Heavenly. For the Earth hath also its seven Planets, which are operated and bred by the seven Celestial, only by a spiritual Im∣pression or Infusion, even as the Stars operate all Minerals. This is done incomprehensibly and spiritually, and therefore it is to be accounted supernatural, even as two Lovers, their persons are visible, but their Love one to the other is invisible: Humane Bodies are tangible and natural, but Love is invisible, spiritual, intangible and supernatural, com∣parable to a Magnetick Attraction only; for the invisible Love which is attracted unto it spiritu∣ally
by the Imagination is, accom∣plish'd by the desires and fruiti∣on. In like manner when the Heaven hath a love to the Earth, and the Earth hath a Love, Incli∣nation, and Affection towards Man, as the great World to the lesser; for the lesser World is taken out of the greater, and when the Earth by the desires of its invisible Imagination doth at∣tract unto it self such a Love of the Heaven, there is thereby an Union of the Superiour and Infe∣riour, as Man and Wife are ac∣counted one Body together, and after this Union the Earth is im∣pregnated by the Infusion of the Heaven, and begins to conceive and bring forth a Birth sutable to the Infusion, and this Birth after its Conception is digested by the Elements, and brought to a per∣fect Ripeness, and this is reckon∣ed
among the supernatural things; how the supernatural Effence performs its operation in the natural. Among the supernatural things are like wise reckoned all Magical and Cabalistical Matters which depend thereon, arising out of the Light of true knowledge, not those which proceed from Superstition, Conjuration, or unlawful Exorcisme, such as the Sorcerers use; but I mean in this place such a Magick as the Wise men had that came out of the East, who by Revelation from God, and by true allowable Art judged rightly; or such an one, as those of old had before us, usu∣al among the Egyptians and Ara∣bian, before Writing was found, they noted, observed, and reser∣ved by Signs, Characters and Hi∣eroglyphicks. Such Blessings may
be used, which Christ the Son of God used, as the Scripture saith; He took little Children, laid his hands upon them, and blessed them. But whatsoever is contrary to God and his Word, ought justly to be rejected, and not to be tollerated, because they are not Godly, but Diabolical. But those Supernatural things which oppose not God and his Holy Word, belong unto Ma∣gick, and do the Soul no preju∣dice. As concerning Visions which Holy Men of God have often seen, it is reason they should be reckoned among those things which are not Natural; for whatsoever man speculates and comprehends by the Mind, is Su∣pernatural; on the contrary, whatsoever he can take, see, and hold is Natural.
Let us consider the third part of Natural & Supernatural things in Physick, the Virtues and Pow∣ers of each; this Medicine of every thing must first be driven out of a visible, tangible, natural Body, and be brought into a spi∣ritual, meliorated, supernatural operation, that the Spirit which at the first was infused and given to the Body to live, might be re∣leased, that it should operate and penetrate as a Spiritual Essence, and Fire, having its Vent-holes left that it might burn and have no opposition, which might suf∣focate, suppress, or hinder the burning Life; whereas otherwise, if the separation of the Soul and Spirit from the Body should not first be done, there could not succeed any operation either ef∣fectual, profitable, or necessary; for whatsoever is visible, to be
felt, and inseparably in a Body, that is Natural and Corporal; but so soon as there is a separation, the living departs from the dead, gaining its perfect operation, and the natural Body being separa∣ted, the spiritual Essence is free to penetrate, becoming a spiritu∣al and supernatural Medicine. In brief, all things (none excepted) which we can touch and handle, are natural, but they must be made supernatural, if you would prepare them for Physick; for the supernatural only hath a li∣ving power in it to operate, the natural hath only a dead tangible Form. For when Adam was made, he was dead, having no life of any virtue, but so soon as the o∣perative quickning Spirit came to him, then he manifested his li∣ving virtue and power by super∣natural admiration, so that in
every thing there is the natural and supernatural united in one, and bound together in their ha∣bitation, that every thing might be perfect; for all created things in the world are some supernatu∣ral, only what concerns the Soul and spiritual matters, and some are natural and supernatural, with what concerns the Elements and Firmament, as likewise the Mine∣rals, Vegetables, and Animals, which is known and found, when they are separated one from the other, that the Soul departs out of the Body, and the Spirit for∣sakes its Soul, leaving the Body an empty habitation. Moreover, you must under∣stand and consider, that the great and little World are made and formed of one first Matter, by an unsearchable Almighty Essence, at that time in the beginning,
when the Spirit of God moved upon the Water, who was from Eternity without beginning. The great World, as Heaven and Earth, was first, then was Man, the Little World, taken out of the greater; the Water was se∣parated from the Earth, the Wa∣ter was the Matter whereon the everlasting Spirit of God mo∣ved; the Little World was form∣ed of the noblest Earth, as its Quintessence, by the Aquosity which yet was in the Earth, and all was only Natural; but after the breathing in of the Divine heating Breath, immediately the Supernatural was added; so then the Natural and Supernatural were knit and united. The great World is perishable, yet there will be a New Earth or World; the Little World is E∣ternal, the Great, Created, Dis∣soluble
world will again be brought to nothing, but the little world will be clarified by the Spirit of God, because he pos∣sesses it, making a Celestial clari∣fied water out of the aforesaid Earthly water; then it will fol∣low, that the first matter will be turned into the last, and the last matter will become the first. Now the reason why the great world is perishable, is this, that the Spi∣rit of God hath not his dwelling or habitation in the great world, but in the little world; for Man is the Temple of the Holy Ghost, if he do not wilfully defile him∣self, adhering to the Hellish Fire, which makes a breach and diffe∣rence. For he remaines in the little world, which he formed af∣ter his own similitude, and made him a consecrated Temple; other∣wise there is every thing in the
little world which is to be found in the great, as Heaven and Earth, with the Elements, and what depends thereon, or appertains thereunto. We find also that in the first Creation, which was performed of nothing, three things arose; to wit, a Soulish, Spiritual, In∣visible Essence, which represent∣ed a Mercurial Water, a Sulphu∣rous Vapour, and a Terrene Salt; these three gave a compleat and perfect, a tangible and for∣mal Body to all things wherein especially all the four Elements are contained, as I have already mentioned in my Writing where I treat of the Microcosme. But that I may yet give a little more information of Natural and Supernatural things, as well spi∣ritual as corporal: We find that the Canaanitish Woman was
cured of her Flux of Blood which held her twelve years, on∣ly by a bare touch, when she touched the Garment of the Son of God, her Disease being na∣tural, but the Medicine or Cure was Supernatural, because by her Faith she gained help from the Lord Christ. Likewise we have an excellent, high and supernatural Miracle in the three Children, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who were cast into the fiery Furnace, by the Command of King Nebu∣chadnezzar, yet by God wonder∣fully delivered, and not consu∣med, Dan. 3. So also the Confusion of Tongues, and Infusion of divers Speeches at the foolish structure of the Tower of Babel, which should have reached up to Hea∣ven, is esteemed for a Superna∣tural
Miracle. And so was that a Supernatural Sign, when the Children of Israel did lap water as Dogs do, when a small Num∣ber at Gods Command, fought a∣gainst the Midianites, Judg. 7. 6. So the sending of the Dove by Noah out of the Ark, when she brought an Olive Branch in her Bill, a Sign of Mercy, and a Di∣vine Supernatural Message. When the Holy man of God Moses struck the Rock with his Rod, that the hard Rock yielded Water, is beyond humane Rea∣son; so was the turning of the salt water into sweet and drink∣able, supernatural. As also the dry passage of the Children of Israel through the Red Sea; and the Budding of Aarons Rod, are all supernatural. In brief, the Resurrection of Christ the Eter∣nal Son of God out of the grave,
for all the Tomb-stone, his ap∣pearing to the two men going to Emas, his revealing himself to his Disciples when the Door was lock'd, are all Divine and Super∣natural. Divers Examples more might be recited out of Divine Writ, which for Brevities sake I omit. Among Supernatural things are accounted all Mineral Signs, as the Appearance of Spirits, Re∣presentations, Pigmies appearing diversly and numerously, giving notice of good or bad Luck, Ruine or Riches; so also those Figures, Shapes, or other works found in the Ores of Metals, as of Men, Fishes, and other Crea∣tures, so formed and represented by the imagination of the three first Principles, then ripened and fully digested by the Earth, and other Elements. Hereunto ap∣pertain
the Monsters of the Earth, and such things as are found within the Earth at certain times of a wonderful form and shape, but not at all to be found when that time is past, yet ap∣pear again and are to be found at some other time. Hereunto also belong all Visi∣ons and Appearances performed by Water, Glasses, Cristal, or other means, as also those done by Sigils and Characters, which yet are so various, some being only Natural, yet affording Su∣pernatural appearances or sights; but the others which are per∣formed by Conjurations, are nei∣ther Natural nor Supernatural, but Diabolical, belonging unto Sorcery, and are prohibited all good Christians; so likewise all those Means which oppose Holy Writ, Gods Word and Com∣mandments,
are to be rejected and refuted by true Natural Ca∣balists; I say this, because a cer∣tain distinction and sure order ought to be found of the Natu∣ral, Supernatural, Unnatural things. In like manner there apper∣tains unto Supernatural things, all the Water-Spirits, as the Syrens, Succubi, & other Water-Nymphs, with their Relations, as like∣wise the Terrestrial Spirits, and those which inhabit the Air, who sometimes are heard, seen, or per∣ceived, sometimes foretelling Death or other Disasters, some∣times they discover by their Ap∣parition Riches and good For∣tune in certain places, and the Fiery Spirits appertain here also, which appear in a fiery shape, or like a burning Light; all these are Spirits having untangible Bo∣dies,
yet are they not such Spi∣rits as the right Hellish Spirits, who hunt after mens Souls as an Eternal Jewel, even as the Infer∣nal Lucifer, the Devil and his Dependents do, who were eject∣ed with him; but these are such Spirits which are above Nature, set before Men for admiration, and are only maintained by the Elements, whereby they are nou∣rished and fed; but when this Earthly world shall cease, they also shall decay and vanish with it, because they have no Souls to be saved. I will say no more hereof at present, but refer the opening of such Circumstances more at large to another oppor∣tunity, where I shall particularly treat of Visions and spiritual Ap∣pearances, which are esteemed Unnatural by most part of the World, yet truly are Natural,
but they are found to be Super∣natural in their Operations and wonderful Qualities. That I may further confirm my Assertion, I say likewise, that there are many things to be found in Physick, which yield and ma∣nifest their workings supernatu∣rally in a Magnetical way, ope∣rating only by an attractive spi∣ritual power which is attracted to it by the Air; for the Air is the Medium between the Physick and the Hurt or Distemper, even as the Magnet ever doth direct and turn it self towards its Pole∣star, though the star be many thousand Miles distant from it, yet the spiritual operation and sympathy between them is so pre∣valent, that it is attracted toge∣ther at so vast a distance by the Medium or middle Band of the Air; but because this attractive
power is only known unto peo∣ple in general, or as a thing com∣mon, it is therefore become cu∣stomary, and is so esteemed, there being no notice taken of any further Secret whence this o∣perative Faculty hath its Source or Original: In like manner Hurts and Distempers may be healed and cured, though the Patient and Physitian be very far distant one from the other; not by Charmes, Exorcismes, or other unlawful prohibited means, which are opposite to God and Nature, but by such means wherein the attractive Magnetick Virtue lies to accomplish it. As when a wounded person goes a Journey, leaving the Weapon wherewith he was wounded, or else of his Bloud which issued out of the wound with his Physician, where∣with he proceeds rightly and by
orderly means, as is usual in dressing a wound, without all doubt he shall be absolutely cu∣red, this is no Witchcraft, but the cure is performed only by the attractive power of the Me∣dicine, which is carried to the Sore by the means of the Air, wherewith it is mundified, that it may perform the Spiritual O∣peration. Some will think these hard sayings, and impossible in Na∣ture, and many will say it is con∣trary to Nature, whereby many will be excited to dispute it, and raise Arguments one opposite to the other, whether it be Natural or no, whether it be possible or no, or whether it be Sorcery: I will thus resolve them, that this Cure is natural, but as it operates it is supernatural & spiritual, be∣cause it is performed meerly by
an attractive incomprehensible means, and that this manner of Cure is no Sorcery: I affirm it hereby, that it is not mixt or accompanied with any Sorcery, nor with any other un∣natural Means, contrary to God the Creator, or his holy and sa∣ving Word. But it is only Na∣tural, out of its supernatural, in∣visible, incomprehensible, spiritu∣al, and attractive power, which received its Original from the Sydereal, and performs its Ope∣ration by the Elements. Lastly, I likewise approve this Cure to be no Sorcery, because the Devil rather delights in all Mischief to Mankind, than to assist any manner of way for their benefit, which yet is impossible for him to do without Gods permission. Much more might be written of this Magnetick
Form, but I chuse rather to be silent; referring it till I come to treat of the Natural Miracles of the World. The grosser sort of foolish Wits, who imagine themselves to be wise Philosophers, and all others who are not in their per∣fect senses, know no difference in this case, but the wise and truly discreet well know how to distinguish betwixt that which is natural and that which is super∣natural. For do but observe this com∣parison, to be proved by a gross Example, how many Creatures are there which dye absolutely in the water, so that no life is left therein, but so soon as the pleasant Summer appears, the natural heat gives a new life, & the Body quite restored in the same substance as it was before in
its living Motion; even as an Herb, which dies in the Winter, but in the Spring it manifests it self anew. The death of these things is to be esteemed natural, but the return of a new life in its knowledge is supernatural; but because we are accustomed to all these things, the least part of us consider what is worthy of further Meditation in this case, letting both natural and supernatural go away together. Most people overpass, that na∣tural custom which yet is super∣natural, as also monstrous Births, and those that bring signs and marks with them into the world; which may all be natural, but manifest themselves supernatu∣rally, by the imagination which caused them: These supernatu∣ral forms and customs, the Mo∣ther of the Child caused by in∣tervening
thoughts, which un∣expectedly happened to her, as it were by accident: Even as we often see and find, that many Men naturally are born with some gestures, which he can never leave, though he endevour with all his might to do it. The na∣tural gestures of these Men are natural, but the conception in the Womb which caused the imagination of these things is su∣pernatural, and subject to what the Heaven imprints. To conclude: I say, that none can defend the supernatural not to be true by good grounds and reasons, except he have learn'd to know the natural, which hath its original, and gained its shape from the supernatural; after he hath learned this, he may evi∣dence it by sure proofs, that he will be conquerour over those,
who will not believe what is su∣pernatural; and he will convince the opinions of those who dis∣pute of natural things, and yet know not the grounds, saving on∣ly a bare pretence, much talk, te∣dious and unprofitable Debates.
CHAP. II. Of the first Tincture and Roots of Metals. BUt now to come to my in∣tent, and by Gods permissi∣on to accomplish the same. I undertake to certifie of the first Tincture, Root, and Genera∣tion of Metals and Minerals: Know that the first Tincture and Root of all Metals, is likewise a supernatural, flying, fiery Spi∣rit; which preserves it self in the Air, seeking its habitation naturally in the Earth and Wa∣ter, wherein it can rest and o∣perate: This Spirit is found in all Metals, more abundant in other Metals than in Gold, be∣cause
Gold, by reason of its well digested, ripened, and fixt body, is tight, close, and compact, and therefore no more can enter into its body than is just requi∣site; but the other Metals have not such fixt bodies, for their pores are open, and far exte∣nuated, therefore the Tincture Spirit can the more abundantly pass thorough and possess them. But because the bodies of the other Metals are inconstant, the Tincture cannot remain with those inconstant bodies, but must depart. And whereas the Tin∣cture of Gold is found in none more plentiful than in Mars and Venus, as Man and Wife, their bodies therefore are destroyed, and the tinging Spirit taken out of them, which makes Gold sanguin, being first opened and prepared, and by their food and
drink it becomes volatile, where∣fore this volatile Gold being sa∣tisfied with its food and drink, assumes its own bloud to it self, dries it up by its own internal heat, by the help and assistance of the vaporous fire, and there is a Conquest again, which is quite fix'd, makes the highest Constancy, that the Gold be∣comes an over-fix'd Medicine, by reason of abundance of Bloud it yields no Body, except another superfluous Body be again put to it, wherein the abounding fix'd bloud may disperse it self; this additional Metallick Body, by reason of the great heat of the fix'd Lions bloud, is penetrated as by fire, and purged from all impurity, and forthwith through∣ly digested to a perfect ripeness and fixedness: That first of all the Servant brings the Master unto
Riches, because the Master before could not spare any of his Cloaths to give away, seeing that Nature had lent and endow∣ed him with one Noble Suit only; on the other side, the King, when he hath received his Aides and Contributions from his Subjects, can then distribute possessions, and permanent Liveries, that the Lord and Servant may remain both together; and do not think it strange, that the King needs to borrow of his Subjects, because their Bodies are unfix'd and in∣constant, for they receive much, and yet can keep but little Cre∣dit: But if the King can partici∣pate thereof, he will the better overcome heat and Frost, than the Leprous Metals can; and henceforth by this Receipt he becomes particularly a Domina∣tor and Conquerour of all other,
with a great Victory and triumph of Riches and of Health to long Life. I hope you have from the beginning sufficiently understood concerning this Natural and Su∣pernatural Advice, and the first tinging Root of Metals and Mi∣nerals, whereon the Corner-stone is placed, and where the true Rock is grounded in its kind, wherein Nature hath placed and buried her secret & deeply con∣cealed Gifts; to wit, in the fiery tinged Spirits, which Colours they gained out of the starry Heaven by the operation of the Elements; and they can more∣over tinge and fix that which be∣fore was not tinged and unfix'd, seeing that Luna wants the Robe of the Golden Crown, together with the fixedness, as likewise Saturn, Jupiter, and Mercury do; and although Mars and Venu's
need not this Rayment, but can communicate it to the other five, yet I say, that they can perform nothing to attain any thing with wealth without the Lion, because they are not sufficiently accomodated with a fixedness of their Mercury, and a gentleness of their Salt, except it be that the Lion overcome them, that they have triumphed on both parts, and gained a remarkable Melio∣ration altogether; this Meliora∣tion lies concealed in their Sig∣nate star, or Magnet, out of which all Metals have themselves received their Gifts. Now I will proceed, and par∣ticularly step to the Birth and Generation, how the Archaeus manifests its power; pouring it forth, and daily reveales it, whereby all Metallick and Mine∣ral Forms are visibly proposed,
and made formal, tangible, and corporal by the Mineral, intangible, flying, fiery Spirits: Un∣derstand therefore further, and observe with diligence and care, that by forgetfulness you let not that which is weighty pass away, nor yet neglect or overlook that which is most profitable, and on the contrary observe the bare words at length, passing over the Truth; for what I write herein, is undoubtedly held and esteem∣ed that the highest is undoubted∣ly by many esteemed for the lowest, and the lowest for the highest Mystery, and is so to be reputed. Now you must first know, that all Metals and Minerals of the Earth have one only Matter and Mother, whereby in general they all received Conception, gaining a compleat and corporal Birth.
This Matter which comes out of the Center, first of all divides it self into three parts, to procure one corporal or certain form of each Metal. These three parts are only fed in the Earth by the Elements, out of their Bodies, and nourish'd till they be per∣fect. But the Matter which comes out of the Center is ima∣gined by the Stars, operated by the Elements, and formed by the Earth: It is a Matter to be known, and the true Mother of Metals and Minerals: It is such a Matter and Mother, whereof Man himself is conceived, born, nourish'd, and made corporal: It may be compared to the middle World, for what is in the great World is in the little World, and what is in the little World is also in the greater; and what is jointly in the great and
little World is likewise found in the middle World, which unites and conjoins the great and little world; it is a Soul which unites and copulates the Spirit with the Body. This Soul is compared unto water, and it is a right true water, but not so that it wets as other water doth, but it is a Ce∣lestial water, dry, found in a Metallick Liquorish substance; it is a Soulish water, which loves all Spirits, and unites them with their Bodies, conducting them to a compleat Life; therefore it is reasonably found out, and evi∣dently proved, that Water is the Mother of all Metals, which are heated by the warm aerial Fire, or Spirit of Sulphur, which by its digestion makes the Earthly Body lively, wherein the Salt is evidently found, which preserves from putrefaction, so that no∣thing
might be consumed by Corruption. At the beginning and birth Quick-silver is first ope∣rated, which stands yet open with a subtile coagulation, be∣cause little Salt is imparted to it, whereby he manifests a more spi∣ritual than corporal Body; but all the other Metals which follow out of its Essence, and have more Salt, whereby they become corporal, do all follow this; so that I now begin first with the Spirit of Mercury.
CHAP. III. Of the Spirit of Mercury. THough I have a peculiar Stile in writing, which will seem strange unto many, causing strange Thoughts and Fancies in their Brains, yet there is reason enough for my so doing; I say enough, that I may remain by my own experience, not esteem∣ing much of others prating, be∣cause it is concealed in my know∣ledge, Seeing having alwaies the preheminence before Hearing, and Reason hath the praise be∣fore Folly: Wherefore I now say, that all visible, tangible things are made of the Spirit of Mercury, which excels all earth∣ly
things of the whole world, all things being made out of it, ha∣ving their Off-spring only from it; for all is found therein which can perform all whatsoever the Artist desires to find; It is the beginning to operate Metals, when it is become a spiritual Es∣sence, which is meer Air flying to and fro without wings; it is a moving wind, which after it is expelled its dwelling by Vulcan, it is driven into its Chaos, where it again enters, and resolves it self into the Elements, where it is elevated and attracted by the Sydereal Stars after a Magnetical manner unto themselves, out of love, whence he proceeded be∣fore, and was operated, because it affects its like again, and at∣tracts it to it. But if this Spirit of Mercury can be caught, and made corporal, it resolves into a
Body, and becomes a pure, clear, transparent water, which is the true spiritual water, and the first Mercurial Root of the Minerals and Metals, spiritual, intangible, incombustible, without any mix∣ture of earthly aquosity; it is that Celestial water, whereof ve∣ry much hath been written; for by this Spirit of Mercury all Me∣tals, may if need require, be bro∣ken, opened, and resolved into their first Matter, without Cor∣rosive; it renews the age of Man or Beast, even as the Eagles; it consumes all evil, and conducts a long Age to long Life. This Spirit of Mercury is the Master-Key of my Second Key, whereof I wrote in the beginning; where∣fore I will call; Come ye Blessed of the Lord, be anointed, and re∣freshed with water, and embalm your Bodies, that they may not pu∣trefie
or stink; for this Celestial Water is the beginning, the Oyl, and the means, seeing it burns not, because it is made of a spi∣ritual Sulphur; the Salt Balsam is corporal, which is united with the Water by the Oyl, whereof I will afterwards treat more at large, when I shall write of them, and mention them. And that I may further de∣clare what is the Essence, Mat∣ter and Form of the Spirit of Mercury, I say, that its Essence is blessed, its Matter spiritual, and its form earthly, which yet must be understood by an incom∣prehensible way; these are in∣deed harsh Expressions, many will think, thy Proposals are all vain, strange Effusions, raising wonderful Imaginations, and true it is that they are strange, and require strange people to under∣stand
these Sayings; it is not written for Peasants, how they should grease Cart-wheels, nor is it written unto those who have no knowledge of the Art, though they be never so learned, or think themselves so; for I only account them Learned, who next unto Gods Word, learn to know Earthly things, which must be pondered and judged by the Un∣derstanding, founded upon a true Knwledge, to distinguish Light from Darkness, who chuse that which is good, and reject the evil. It is needless for you to know what the beginning of this Spi∣rit of Mercury requires, because it can in no wise help nor advan∣tage you, only take notice of this, that its beginning is super∣natural, out of the Celestial, Sy∣dereal and Elementary, bestow∣ed
on it from the beginning of the first Creation, that it may enter further into an Earthly Substance. But because this is necessary which hath been decla∣red to you, leave the Celestial to the Soul, apprehend it by Faith, and let the Sydereal like∣wise alone, because these Sydere∣al Impressions are invisible and intangible, the Elements have al∣ready brought forth the Spirit perfect into the world by the Nutriment, therefore let that a∣lone likewise; for man cannot make the Elements, but only the Creator, and remain by thy made Spirit which is already formal and unformal, tangible and in∣tangible, and yet is presented vi∣sibly. So have you enough of the first Matter, out of which all Metals and Minerals grow, and is one only thing, and such a
matter which unites it self with the Sulphur in the following Cha∣pter, and enters into a Coagu∣lation with the Salt of the fifth Chapter, that it may be one Body, and a perfect Medicine of all Metals, not only to bring forth in the Earth at the begin∣ning, as in the great World, but also by help of the vaporous Body to transmute and change, together with the augmentation in the lesser World: Let not this seem strange to you, seeing the Most High hath permitted, and Nature undertaken it. Many will not believe this, esteeming it impossible, despise and vilifie these Mysteries, which they understand not in the least, they may remain Fools and I∣diots till an illumination follows, which cannot be without Gods Will, but remains till the time
predestinate. But wise and dis∣creet, men who have truly shed the sweat of their Brows, will be my sufficient witnesses, and confirm the Truth, and indeed believe and hold for a truth all that which I write in this case, as true as Heaven and Hell are pre∣ordained, and proposed as Re∣wards of good and evil to the E∣lect and Reprobate. Now I write not only with my hands, but my Mind, Will and heart constrain me to it: Those who are highly conceited, illumina∣ted, and world-wise, hate, envy, scandalize, defame and persecute this Mystery to the utmost Rind, or innermost Kernel, which hath its beginning out of the Center; but I know assuredly, there will come a time, when my Marrow is wasted, and my Bones dried up, that some will take my part
heartily, after I am in the Pit; and if God would permit it, they would willingly raise me from the dead; but that cannot be; wherefore I have left them my Writings, that their Faith and Hope may have a Seal of Cer∣tainty and Truth, to testifie of me what my last Will and Testa∣ment was, which I ordained for the poor, and all the Lovers of Mysteries, though it did not be∣hove me to have wrote so much, yet I could not refrain without prejudice to my Soul, but to drive a Light or Flash through a Cloud, that the Day might be observed, and the dark Night, thick and gloomy, rainy Wea∣ther expelled. Now how the Archaeus ope∣rates further by the Spirit of Mercury in the Earth, or Veins of the Earth, take this Advice,
that after the spiritual Seed is formed by the impression of the Stars from above, and fed by the Elements, it is a Seed, and turns it self into a Mercurial Wa∣ter, as first of all the great World was made of nothing, for when the Spirit moved upon the Water, the Celestial Heat must needs raise a Life in the cold watrish and earthly Crea∣tures; in the great World it was Gods Power, and the Operati∣on of the Celestial Lights; in the little World it is likewise Gods Power, and the Operation to work into the Earth by his Divine and Holy Breath. More∣over the Almighty gave and Ordained means to accomplish it, that one Creature had ob∣tained power to operate in the other, and the one to help and assist the other, to perform and
fulfil all the Works of the Lord; and so an influence was permitted the Earth to bring forth by the Lights of Heaven, as also an in∣ternal Heat, to warm and di∣gest that which was too cold for the Earth, by reason of its humidity, as unto every Crea∣ture a peculiar fashion accor∣ding to its kind; so that a sub∣tile sulphurous Vapour, is stir∣ed up by the Starry Heaven, not the common, but another more clarified and pure Vapour, di∣stinct from others, which unites it self with the Mercurial Sub∣stance; by whose warm proper∣ty, in process of time, the su∣perfluous Moisture is dryed up, and then when the soulish pro∣perty comes to it, which gives a preservation to the Body and Balsam, operating first into the Earth by a spiritual and sydereal
iufluence, then are Metals gene∣rated of it, as it pleaseth the Mixture of the three Principles, the Body being formed accord∣ing as it assumes unto it the greatest part of those three. But if the Spirit of Mercury be in∣tended and qualified from above upon Animals, it becomes an Animal Substance; if it goes u∣pon Vegetables by order, it becomes a Vegetable Work; but if, by reason of its infused na∣ture, it fall on Minerals, it be∣comes Minerals and Metals, yet each one hath its distinction as they are wrought, the Animals for themselves, the Vegetables on another manner and form by themselves, and so likewise the Minerals, each one a several way, whereof to write particularly would be too tedious, and yield large and various Narrations.
Many one may here demand and not without cause, how such a Spirit of Mercury may be pro∣cured, how to be made, and af∣ter what manner it is to be pre∣pared to expel Diseases, and change all the kinds of the mean∣er and baser Metals, as if they were born in a little world, by transmutation and augmentation of their Seed; many expect this with impatience. I answer with∣out concealing any thing, but will truly discover as much as is permitted me by Gods Com∣mand, in manner and form fol∣lowing. In the Name of the Lord, Take a Red Quick-silver Ore which is like unto Sinople (or Vermilion) and the best Gold Ore you can get; grind of each a like quan∣tity both together, before they partake of any fire, poure an
Oyl of Mercury upon it made per se, of common, purified and sub∣limed Quicksilver, set it a month to digest, you have an Extract rather Celestial than Terrestrial; distil this Extract gently, as in Balneum Mariae, the Flegme as∣cends over, the Oyl remaining at bottom, being heavy, which in a moment receives all Metals in∣to it; poure thrice as much Spi∣rit of Wine to it, circulate it in a Pellican, till it be as red as Bloud, and become so sweet that nothing may compare with it; decant the Spirit of Wine to a Liquidness, poure fresh Spirit of Wine upon it, this reiterate so often, till the Matter be exceed∣ing sweet, and transparent red as a a Ruby, then put all together, poure that which ascended over upon white calcined Tartar, and distil, it strongly in Ashes, the
Spirit of Wine remains behind with the Tartar, but the Spirit of Mercury ascends over. If this Spirit of Mercury be mixt with the Spirit of Sulphur, to∣gether with its Salt, and so brought over jointly together, that they can never be separated, you have such a work which if it come over, and it get its ferment with Gold by solution according to a just measure and time ap∣pointed, and be brought to a perfect ripeness, unto the Plus∣quam perfection, nothing may compare therewith, for preven∣tion of Diseases, and poverty, and to a rich excessive recreati∣on of the Body and Goods. This is the way to obtain the Spirit of Mercury, which I have revealed as far as it is permitted me to do, by the Supremest Emperour; the
Manual Operations are found in the Work which I have revealed; you must wisely observe, that you may not endure a Bath in Hell for me, by my true admo∣nition to thee, forasmuch as a true opening of the Door which leads to the Royal Palace, is per∣formed but with one Key, which cures all Diseases, be it Dropsie, Consumption, Gout, Stone, Fal∣ling Sickness, Apoplexy, Leprosie, or howsoever called in general: This Medicine likewise cures all kinds of the French Pox, and all old Sores of long standing, be it Wolf, Noli me tangere, Letter, Ring-worm, Cancer, Fistula, and corroding hollow Sores; all which I have declared, and con∣cealed nothing. Last of all, ob∣serve, that you do not discover too much, or no more, because
all Art hath its Original or Source out of the Spirit of Mercury, which is refreshed and raised to Life by the spiritual Sulphur, that it becomes Celestial, & with and by the Salt they are made corpo∣ral and formal; but the begin∣ning of the Soul, of the Spirit, and of the Body, let it be and remain a Magnet, even as it is, and can be acknowledged to be nothing else. This is the summe in brief, that without the Spirit of Mercury, which is the only true Key, you can never make Corporal Gold potable, nor the Philosophers Stone. Let it re∣main by this Conclusion, be si∣lent; for I my self will at pre∣sent say no more, because Si∣lence is enjoyned thee and me by the orderly Judge, recom∣mending the Execution and
further, Search thereof to ano∣ther, who hath not as yet re∣duced the Matter into a right Order.
CHAP. IV. Of the Spirit of Copper. THE Star of Venus is very difficult, and not well to be calculated, as all Mathemati∣cians and Astronomers will bear me witness; for its course is found to be otherwise than that of the other six Planets, and therefore its Birth is otherwise; for the Birth of Venus possesses the First Table, after Mercury, as for what concerns the Gene∣ration of Metals. Mercury makes active, but Venus provokes, gi∣ving Lust and Desire, together with the Beauty which gave oc∣casionth ereunto; though I am accounted no Astronomer, nor do
I give my self out for one, who knows to calculate the Course of the Heavens; for I should spend my time in my Cell in Prayer, but that the spare hours after my De∣votion is ended, may not be spent in vain, I have ordered and proposed it as my aim and intent to exercise my self, and to spend those hours in the knowledge of Natural things. So likewise it is not well to be reckoned what a∣rises, grows or proceeds from Ve∣nus, or whence she arose, grew, or proceeded; for she is super∣fluously cloathed more than she needs, and yet must want that which she needs most of all in her Constancy. But you must be advertised, that Venus is cloathed with a Ce∣lestial Sulphur, which far surpasses the brightness of the Sun; for there is more and more abundant
Sulphur in her than in Gold; but it requires a knowledge what the Matter of that Gold Sulphur may be, which is, and rules so plenti∣fully in Copper, and whereof I make so great a Cry: know then that it is likewise a flying very hot Spirit, which can pass through and penetrate, as also ripen and digest all things, as the imperfect Metals into perfect, which the inexpert will not believe. And here a Question presents it self at hand; How the Spirit of Cop∣per can make other imperfect Me∣tals perfect, and make them ripe, whereas in its own Body it is imper∣fect and inconstant? For An∣swer, I say as I have often said, that this Spirit cannot possess or inhabit a permanent Body in Copper; for when the habitati∣on is burnt by Fire, the Spirit goes away with it, and must
with impatience leave its Lodg∣ing, for it dwells therein as a So∣journer; but it hath protection in the permanent fix'd Body of Gold, whence no man can expel it, without the Warrant of an especial Judge; for it is put into the inheritance as an Heir, and taken Root by her permanent Body, that she cannot easily be expelled. The Tincture which Venus hath obtained, is in like manner found in Mars, more powerful, high and Noble; for Mars is the Man, and Venus the Woman, which I speak more of, seeing I write of them. This Tincture is delivered in Verdi∣greece, and likewise it is found in Vitriol, as in a Mineral whereof a peculiar Book might be wrote. In all these things a combustible Sulphur is found, and yet a Sul∣phur which is incombustible, this
is a strange thing, one is a white Sulphur, the other is red in the operative generation; but the true Sulphur is incombustible, for it is a pure true Spirit, whereof an incombustible Oil is prepared, and it is the same Sulphur which is made out of one Root from the Gold-Sulphur. I open many Mysteries, which ought not to be; but what should I do? to conceal all is not answerable, but a measure is good in all things, as you may observe in my last Advice of pro∣testation; forget not my desire therein. This Sulphur may well be cal∣led the Sulphur of the Wise; for all Wisdom is found therein, unto the Mercurial Spirit which ex∣cels it, which together with the Salt of Mars must be put toge∣ther by a spiritual Conjunction,
that three may come into one understanding, and be advanced to equal operations. This spiri∣tual Sulphur proceeds in the same manner and form out of the up∣per Region, as doth the Spirit of Mercury, but in another manner and kind, whereby the Stars ma∣nifest a separation in fix'd and un∣fix'd, in colour'd and uncolour'd things. The Tincture consists only in the Spirit of Copper, and most of all in that of his Bed-fellow; it is a meer Vapour, stinking and ill-sented in its beginning; this Mist must be dissolved in the manner of a Liquor, that the stinking, incombustible Oil may be prepared thereof; but yet it must have and take its beginning out of Mars; this Oil unites free∣ly with the Spirit of Mercury, as∣suming all Metallick Bodies spee∣dily
unto them, if they be first prepared in all points as I have advised in my Keys. I observe not the Order of the Planets, and not without just grounds; for I observe the order of their Birth, by which I am directed; for because Venus hath much Sulphur, she is sooner di∣gested and ripened together with Mars, before other Metals; but because unconstant Mercury shew∣ed them both too little assistance, therefore no room is left him to work harder, by reason of the superfluous Sulphur, so that they could obtain no melioration of their unfixt Bodies. Now I will reveal a Secret unto thee, that Gold, Copper, and Iron have one Sulphur, one Tincture, and one Matter of their Colour; this Matter of the Tincture is a Spi∣rit, a Mist and Fume, as aforesaid,
which can penetrate and pass through all Bodies, if you can take it, and acuate it by the Spi∣rit which is in the Salt of Mars, and then conjoin the Spirit of Mercury therewith in a just weight, purging them from all impurity, that they be pleasant and well sented, without all Cor∣rosives, you have then such a Medicine, whereunto none in the world may compare, being fer∣mented with the bright shining Sun, you have made an entrance penetrating to work, and to trans∣mute all Metals. O Eternal Wisdom from the beginning! how shall we thank thee for such great Mysteries, which the Children of Men do no wayes regard, but are despi∣sed by the greater number, to know what thou hast concealed in Nature, which they see before
their Eyes, and know it not; they have it in their Hands, and comprehend it not; they deal with it, and know not what they have, nor what they do, because the Internal is concealed. I will yet reveal this unto thee in truth, and by the Love of God, that the root of the Philosophical Sulphur, which is a Celestial Spirit, is found with the root of the spiritual supernatural Mercu∣ry, as also the beginning of the spiritual Salt, are in one, and found in one Matter, out of which the Stone is made, which was before me, and not in many things, though all Philosphers speak as if the Mercury, Sulphur, and Salt were each one a part by themselves and distinct, that the Mercury is found in one, the Sul∣phur in another, and the Salt in a third; yet I tell you, this is only
to be understood of their super∣fiuity, which is found to abound most in each, and may be used and prepared divers ways parti∣cularly with profit, both for Phy∣sick and transmutation of Metals; but the Universal, which is the supreamest Treasure of Earthly Wisdom, and of all the three Principles, is one only thing, and is founded and extracted out of one only thing, which can make all Metals into one, it is the true Spirit of Mercury, and Soul of Sulphur, together with the spiri∣tual Salt, united together, inclo∣sed under one Heaven, and dwel∣ling in one Body, it is the Dra∣gon and the Eagle, the King and the Lion, the Spirit and the Bo∣dy, which must tinge the Body of Gold o a Medtcine, that it may gain power plentifully to tinge his other Companions.
O thou blessed Medicine given by God thy Creator! O thou Celestial Magnet of great attra∣ctive Love! O thou valid sub∣stance of Metals, how great is thy power, how uninventive is thy virtue, how durable is thy constancy? happy is that man on Earth who knows thy Light in truth, which all the world takes no notice of; he shall not see poverty, no Disease shall touch him, nor no sickness hurt him, till the appointed time of death, and till the last hour pre∣destinated for him by his Hea∣venly King. It is impossible for all the tongues of Men to utter the Wisdom which is laid in this Treasure of the Fountain, all Orators must be silent and asha∣med at it, yea terrified and not able to speak a word, when they shall behold and discern this su∣pernatural
Glory, and I my self am afraid when I consider that I have discovered too much. But I hope to prevail with God by Prayer, that he will not charge it on me as a deadly Sin, because I began the Work in his Fear, obtained it by his Grace, and revealed it for his Glory. O thou holy everlasting Tri∣nity! I praise, honour, and mag∣nifie thee with Heart and Mouth, that thou hast revealed unto me the great wisdom of this earthly World, next unto thy Divine Word, whereby I have known thy. Almighty Power, and super∣natural Wonders, which Man will not discern; I heartily be∣seech thee to give me more un∣derstanding and wisdom, that I may bestow the use and profit thereof with a continual Sacri∣fice of Praise before thee, unto
the Christian-like Love of my Neighbour, and to my own wel∣fare both spiritual and corporal, in power and virtue, that thy Name may be made glorious, honoured, and praised, for all thy Works in Heaven and Earth; and that my Enemies may know, that thou art the Lord full of eternal Wonders, that they may repent and be converted, and not be drowned in the falshood of Darkness. God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost help me, and all of us, from his heavenly Throne, exalted above all Glo∣ry, Might, and Majesty, whose Wisdom hath neither beginning nor end, and before whom all Celestial, Earthly, and Hellish Creatures must tremble with fear, to him be Glory forever, A∣men. O Seraphin! O Cherubin! how
great are thy Wonders and Acti∣ons, look graciously upon thy servant, and be entreated to be pacified that he hath manifested this. The Reader must moreover know concerning the Generation of Copper, and observe, that it is generated of much Sulphur, but its Mercury and Salt are in an equality, for there is found to be no more or less of the one than of the other, seeing then that the Sulphur in quantity ex∣cels the Mercury and the Salt, thence arises a great coloured redness, which possesses the Me∣tal, that the Mercury cannot per∣form its fixation, that a fixt Bo∣dy should be generated thereof. Observe and understand it so of Copper, that the form of Venus Body is so stated as that of a Tree, which abounds in Rosen,
as the Larch Tree, the Firr, the Pine, Deal Tree, and other forts of Trees more, the Rosen of the Tree is its Sulphur, which it evacuates at sometimes by rea∣son of its superfluity, for it can∣not bear it all; such a Tree which is tinged with abundance of fatness, by the digestion of Nature and the Elements, burns quickly and freely, and is not ponderous, nor so durable as is the Oak, or other hard wood which is close and compact, whose Pores are not so open, as those sorts of light wood, and wherein the Sulphur doth not so predominate, but the Oak hath therefore the more Mercury, and a better Salt than the Pine, Firr, and Deal trees have, and such wood doth not float so well a∣bove the water, as the Deal, be∣ing bound & closed up compact∣ly,
so that the Air is easily pre∣vented in bearing it up. So is it to be observed of Metals, and especially of Gold, which by reason of its abundant, fixt, di∣gested and ripe Mercury, hath a very close, fast and compact, fixt and invincible Body, which nei∣ther Fire nor Water, Air, nor a∣ny Corruption of the Earth can prejudice, that the consuming power of the Elements can do them no harm; this fixedness & close compacted Conjunction gives evidence of its natural ponderosity, which cannot be e∣videnced in other Metals, which is to be observed, not only by weighing it in the scales, but like∣wise you will find it thus; if you lay but a scruple of pure Gold up∣on a hundred weight of Quick∣silver, it immediately sinks to the bottom, whereas all other Metals
being laid upon Quicksilver in like manner, float on the top of it, and sink not to the bottom, because they are more open, that the Air or Wind can penetrate them and bear them up. Now what further concerns the Spirit of Venus or Copper in Physick, you must last of all take notice and observe, that it is throughout in its virtue and pow∣er discerned to be very wholsom and beneficial, not only that Spi∣rit which lies in the first Ens, but also that very Spirit which is found in the last Matter, its vir∣tue, power and operation is, that it is preferred before all other Medicines in the Rising of the Matrix: It's like is not yet found particularly against the Falling Sickness. This Spirit hath also received an especial gift to dry the Dropsie up; it preserves
the Bloud from put refaction, di∣gests all which is adverse to the Stomach, breaks the Stone, of what kind soever it be. Exter∣nally in Wounds, this Spirit lays a ground to heal: Noli me tangere and all other Sores can∣not defend themselves, nor their ill Qualities, but this Spirit doth assault them, and prepares a good ground for their Cure; external∣ly it mundifies and searches out that whereby the Medicine may operate, fasten, and make a be∣ginning of the Cure. Internally this Spirit penetrates through & through, searching out all that is evil in the Body; even as doth the noblest Vulnerary potion; No Imposthume can withstand this Spirit, but is reformed by it. I say briefly, observe the Spirit of Venus very well, it will manifest it self to admiration both inter∣nally
and externally, that many will esteem it to be incredible & supernatural. Last of all, you must understand that this Spirit of Copper is a fiery Spirit, pene∣trating, searching and consuming all evil Humours, and superflu∣ous Flegme in Man and Metals, and may in reason be accounted the Crown of Medicines; it is very fiery and sharp, incombusti∣ble, but spiritual and unformal, and therefore as a Spirit it can particularly help to make unformal things fiery, digest and ripen them; and if you are a true Na∣turalist, I recommend this Spirit unto thee; it will not fail thee in the least, in any necessity of Health or Wealth, in case you observe it rightly, and execute according to Justice. I hope my Call and Request will at last take place, and have a hearing with
those who regard Nature, and have an earnest and longing de∣sire to search out, and learn, whereby they may whet their Wits, open their Eyes, and let their Ears hear, and learn such a thing out of my Advice, which was never taken notice of, or learn'd before, and is to be found in this Spirit of Copper, inter∣nal and external. He that doth not observe, or truly under∣stand my Writings; will not fa∣thom many Secrets, nor search out to purpose and in truth; nor learn to advantage without me, therefore no Man can direct me, as concerning the Spirit of Cop∣per, except he hath beforehand inverted and turned the Copper inside outwards, and truly lear∣ned all the Mysteries of its inter∣nal Virtues; as I have done, if he can find out any thing better,
which I know not, I earnestly desire him not to conceal any thing, so shall his instruction be well rewarded, with a thousand∣fold advantage, and recommend you herewith to the Highest Cre∣ator. Vain Reason cannot alwayes ap∣prehend Each matter which Venus can bring to an end: No man can find it presently in sence, Vain Reason banns it far away from thence; Such a Spirit only can all things speed, So that Mercury be joyn'd with it indeed.
CHAP. V. Of the Spirit and Tincture of Mars. MArs and Venus have a Spi∣rit and Tincture as well as Gold and other Metals, be that Spirit which is in each Metal ne∣ver so mean and little. It is un∣deniable and known to all, that many men have many minds, though all men originally are of one first Matter, born and produ∣ced from one Seed; yet have they divers different Minds, be∣cause the Stars have so operated them, and not without cause; for the influences of the great World operates the next to it in
the little World; for all Opini∣ons, Natures and Thoughts, toge∣ther with the whole complection of Man proceed alone from one Influence of the Stars, manifest∣ing themselves according to the Course of the Planets and Stars, so that nothing can prevent, nor can such Influences hinder it, when the Birth hath attained to the end of its perfection. As a man is naturally inclined to study; one delights in Divini∣ty, another in the study of the Laws, a third in Physick, a fourth will be a Philosopher; moreover there are many Wits who are na∣turally inclined to the Mecha∣nicks; as the one is a Painter, another a Goldsmith; the one a Shoomaker, the other a Taylor, a Carver, and so forth, divers and innumerable; all this happens by the Stars influence, whereby the
Imagination is supernaturally founded & fortified, and where∣upon it is resolved to rest; as it is found, that what a man hath once conceived in his Mind, and framed a foundation thereof, none can divert him from a con∣stant resolution and relying there∣on, except Death, which at last concludes all. So is it to be un∣derstood of Alchymists, who are set upon the search of Natures Secrets, they intend not to cease, till they have discover'd Nature, absolved it quite, and brought all to an end, which cannot well be done. Even so is it to be understood of Metals, according as the In∣fluence and Imagination is from above, so is the Form; and al∣though the Metals be called Me∣tals in general, and are such, yet you have understood by the va∣rious
minds of men, which yet proceed from one Matter, that there may be manifold and divers Metals, one hot and dry, another cold and moist, a third assuming a mixt Nature and Complection to it self. Therefore the Metal of Mars being ordained in its de∣gree by a gross Salt before others in the greatest quantity, is found to have the hardest, ungentle, strongest, and grossest Body, which Nature appropriated and granted to it, it hath the least portion of Mercury, but more of Sulphur, and most of Salt, hence, and from such a mixture or com∣position is its corporal essence de∣scended, and born into the world by help of the Elements. Its Spirit is like to the other Spirits in operation, but if you can know the right and true Spirit of Mars, I tell you truly, and in true Wis∣dom,
that one grain of its Spirit or Quintessence drunk with the Spirit of Wine, strengthens the Heart, Courage, and Senses, so that you shall fear no Foes; it raises up in him the Courage of a Lion, and provokes a desire to hunt and fight at Venus sports. When the Conjunction of Mars and Venus are rightly placed in a certain Constellation, they bring Fortune and Victory in Love and Affection, in Battel and joy, remaining in unity though the whole World should be against them: But because I am an Ecclesiastick under Church Government, and dedicated my Soul to God, without provoca∣tion of humane desires, and lusts of the Flesh, for they lead a di∣rect way to Hell without leave; but Gods Commands, Fear, and a rejection of Mans Will, which
are tollerated by his Commands, prepare a way to Heaven, if they continue in the true calling upon, and in the true and right Faith of the only Throne of Grace, Mediator and Patron Jesus Christ our Saviour. All Martial Disea∣ses are expell'd, cured, and heal∣ed in an admirable manner by this Spirit; such as are the Bloody Flux, the Disease or Menstruous Fluxes of Women, both white and red, and all other Fluxes of the Belly, and open Sores in the Legs, or any part of the Body, together with all those Diseases, both internal and external, how∣soever they are called, which bloody Mars hath caused, which I omit to nominate particularly, being well known unto the dis∣creet Physician what Diseases are subject to the jurisdiction of Mars. If the Spirit of Iron be
truly known, it hath a secret affi∣nity with the Spirit of Venus, so that both may be conjoined in one, both becoming one only matter, of a like operation, form, substance and being, healing and expelling the self-same Diseases, as also to bring the particulars of the Metals into a change with profit, praise, and excess. But properly Mars must be observed thus with its virtues, that in his Corporal form he only hath an earthly Body, which may be used in many things, for to stanch Bloud, externally in Wounds, to graduate Luna, internally to stop or bind the Body, which yet is not good at all times, and may be used both internally & exter∣nally in mans Body, as likewise in Metallick affairs; because without the true known means, which Nature hath in her secret
Closet, much profit cannot be gotten per se. One thing more I must at pre∣sent propose, that the Magnet and true Iron perform almost a like benefit in Corporal Distempers, having almost one kind of Na∣ture in and with them, as it is with it in the Celestial, Spiritual, and Elementary Intellect, be∣tween the Body, Soul, and the Chaos, out of which the Soul and Spirit went, the Body at last was found out of the Composi∣tion. How shall we now do? the gross dull-witted Lads will not apprehend it, the middle sort of Wits will take no notice of what I write, and the supernatural wits will descant too much upon it; I must find out a remedy, and would willingly preserve all these over-wise-people to be my
Friends still. I will now teach, instruct, and presently inform you, seeing that the Argument it self declares and pronounces its definitive sentence, therefore the resolution lies open, and can be declared and resolved, reserved nor directed to any o∣ther sentence of the understand∣ing, further than for it self. Last of all, reserve this here∣upon in this Chapter, that there can be no House kept to stand in unity between the Married Cou∣ple, if the one of them turn his Coach and drive to the East, and the other towards the West, for they are not equal, so that they cannot draw the Coach to∣gether in an equal weight, where∣by there arises a great dissention and hinderance, in obtaining that which wat intended: but if true Married People will carry on
their House-keeping with a right subsistance, they must be of one spirit, mind, judgment and vir∣tue, to accomplish all whatsoever is in their heart and mind, and that the one operate into the o∣ther, if their Love and Truth shall be permanent; for want of one of these things, the three principles cannot be truly toge∣ther; for the Mercury is banisht, and too little by reascn of the firmness and constancy; the Sul∣phur is too little, it cannot warm the Body of Love, because it is very much extinct; the Salt like∣wise hath not its right, conveni∣ent, natural kind, but is too hard and too much, seeing it makes a hard coagulation, is sharp and biting, because it doth not manifest it self in truth and con∣stancy. Even so it goes now in the World, which goes astray,
and is pregnant with such Vices, for the constancy is but small, the Love little, and Truth as lit∣tle. I hope you will take this Phi∣losophical Example in good part, because Syrach doth both praise and dispraise the goodness, truth, and wickedness of a false Wo∣man, and both after a different manner; and herewith I bid Mars Farewell, saying, that no man knows how to distinguish the Sentence of one, much less of all things, but he who hath in this point taken notice of them, learned and experimented their Nature and Properties, and tru∣ly known and discovered them. God our Heavenly Father, the Everlasting Power, proceeding from all beginning, separate us so in the Form, that the terre∣strial corruptible Body may again
attain unto, contain, and receive the Celestial, Spiritual and Incor∣ruptible Revelation. Amen. M aist thou not know me alone in∣deed, A nd procure a pure help for me in need; R esolve then, and hear what I do speak or say, S o shalt thou find what I can do for aye.
CHAP. VI. Of the Spirit of Gold. THE Clearness of Heaven hath now commanded me to govern my Pen, to reveal a matter of valour and of perma∣nency; for the Sun is a burning and consuming Fire, hot and dry, wherein is concealed the right and true virtue of all Natural things; this virtue of the Sun worketh Understanding, Riches, and Health. My Mind is very much grieved, and my Spirit is terrified within it self to discover it publickly, which was not pub∣lish'd in common before, and to make it vocal, which was con∣cealed in the deep with great secresie.
But if I consider in my self, and enter into my Consci∣ence, I could find no alteration, nor catch at any thing to disturb my mind, or bring it to another resolution, which might cause many Obstructions: Yet will I speak with discretion, and write understanding, that no evil with may follow, but rather that I may gain a grateful profit, which I have pourtrayed after the man∣ner and occasion, as the Philoso∣phers before me have done. Mark now, give your Mind perfect Thoughts, refrain all strange matters, which are not serviceable to your speculation of Philosophy, but rather cause a ruine of that benefit, which you pursued with so much dili∣gence; and know if you have a hearty desire and strong affection to gain the Golden Magnet, that
in the first place your prayer be truly directed to God, in true Knowledge, Sorrow, Repentance, and true Humility, to know and learn the three distinct Worlds which are subject to Humane Reason; as, there is the Super∣celestial World, wherein the right immortal Soul hath its seat and residence, together with its first coming, and is according to Gods Creation the first moveable Sense, or the first moving sensi∣ble Soul, which hath operated the Natural Life from a Super∣natural Essence; this Soul and Spirit is at first the Root and Fountain, the first Creature which arose to a Life, and the first Mover, whereof there hath been so much Disputing among the Learned. Now take notice of the second Celestial World, and observe it
diligently, for therein the Pla∣nets rule, and all the Stars of Heaven have their course, virtue and power in this Heaven, per∣forming that Service therein whereunto they are by God or∣dained, and in this service they operate the Minerals and Metals by their Spirit. Go now out of these 2 distinct Worlds into the third, wherein is contained and found what the other two have wrought, to wit, the Super-celestial and the Cele∣stial worlds; out of the Super-celestial arises the Fountain of Life, and of the Soul; out of the other Celestial world the light of the Spirit; and out of the third or Elementary world, the invincible Celestial Fire, which yet may be felt, out of which, that which is tangible is digested; these three Matters and Sub∣stances
produce and generate the Form of Metals, among all which Gold hath the pre-eminence, be∣cause the Sidereal & Elementary Operation hath digested and ri∣pened the Mercury in this Metal the more perfectly to a sufficient ripeness. And even as the Male-Seed is injected into the Womb, and touches the Menstruum, which is its Earth, but the Seed which goes out of the Male into the Fe∣male, is operated in both by the Sydereal and Elementary, that they be united, and nourished by the Earth unto the Birth. Even so understand it likewise, that the Soul of Metals which is formed and conceived out of the Chaos by an intangible, in∣visible, incomprehensible, con∣cealed, and supernatural, Ce∣lestial Composition of Water
and Air; afterwards it is further concocted by the Celestial Ele∣mentary Light and Fire of the Sun; whereby the Stars move the Powers, when its heat is perceived in the inward parts of the Earth, as in the Womb, for the Earth is opened by the warm operating property of the upper Stars, that their infused Spirit yield a nourishment unto the Earth, that it may bring forth somewhat, as Metals, Herbs, Trees and Animals; where each one in particular brings its Seed with it for its farther augment a∣tion and encrease: And as hath been mentioned, even as Man is begotten spiritually and heaven∣ly, Soul and Spirit, and by the nourishment of the Earth in the Body of the Mo∣ther is formally brought up to perfection; even so, and in like
manner, is to be observed and understood of the Metals and Minerals in all points. But this is the true mystery of Gold, which I will make good to you by an Example and Parable to certifie you, whereby the possibility of Nature, and its Mystery is to be found after this manner. It is evident, that the Celesti∣al Light of the Sun is of a fiery Quality and Essence, given unto it by a Celestial, fixt and perma∣nent sulphurous Spirit, by the most High God, Creator of Hea∣ven and Earth, to preserve its substance, form, and body; which creature, by its swift motion and course, is enflamed and kindled by the Air through that swiftness in a continued manifestation of it; this inflammation can never be extinct, nor decay in any of
its power, so long as its Course last, or this whole Created visi∣ble World shall remain and con∣tinue, because there is no com∣bustible matter at hand which is given unto it, by whose consum∣ption this great Light of Heaven should fall to decay. Even so Gold is so digested, ripened, and made into such a fixt invincible Nature by the Su∣periours in its Essence, that no∣thing can hurt it in the least, be∣cause the superiour Stars have past through the inferiour, that the inferiour fix'd Stars by the in∣fluence and donation of the su∣periour, cannot in the least give place to its like, for the inferiour have obtained such a fixedness and permanency from the superi∣our; this you may well retain, observe, and take notice of as concerning the first Matter of Gold.
I must yet produce one com∣parison according to the Philoso∣phical custom, of the great Light of Heaven, and of that little terrestrial fire here daily kindled, and made to burn before our Eyes; because that great Light hath a magnetick simulation and an attractive living power with the small fire here on earth, but yet it is unformal and incompre∣hensible, only it is found to be spiritual, invisible, insensible and intangible. It is to be observed and remem∣bred, as experience manifests, and is proved, that the great Light of heaven bears an especial sym∣pathy, affection and inclination to the little earthly fire, by means of the spiritual Air, whereby they are both promoted and preserved from Mortality; for behold, when the Air receives into it a
Coruption, by too great humidity attracted up by it, that Clouds are generated by Mists, and farther coagulations, which hinder the Sun-beams that they cannot have a reflection, nor get a right pe∣netrating power. So likewise the small terrestrial fire doth not burn so lively in dusky, dark, rainy weather, nor manifests it self with joy in its operation, as it doth when there is a fair, pure, serene, unfalsified heavenly Air; the reason is, because the sympa∣thy is bound and hindered by the obstruction of those Acci∣dents and the waterish Air, so that the attractive power is grie∣ved, that it cannot accomplish its compleat Love and Operation as it should, for this hinderance brings the aquosity to the contra∣ry Element. Now even as the Sun, the
great Light of Heaven, hath a peculiar community and sympa∣thy with the small terrestrial fire to attract unto it, after a Magne∣tical manner; So also the Sun and Gold have a peculiar under∣standing, and an attractive pow∣er and sympathy together; for the Sun hath wrought the Gold by the three Principles, which have their Magnets, being near∣est related to the Sun, and hath gained the next degree to it, for that the three Principles are found to be most mighty and powerful therein, Gold immedi∣ately succeeds it in its corporal Form, being composed of the three principles, and hath its be∣ginning and off-spring from the Celestial and Golden Magnet. This is the supremest Wisdom of this world, a wisdom above all wisdom, yea a wisdom above
all Natural Reason and Under∣standing; for by this wisdom is comprehended first of all Gods Creation, the heavenly Essence, the Firmamentary Workings, the spiritual Imagination, and the corporal Essence, it contains all qualities, and properties, and all whatsoever sustaines and pre∣serves Mankind. In this Golden Magnet sticks and lies buried the resolution and opening of all Metals and Minerals, their domi∣nation, as also the first Matter of their generation, their power o∣ver health; and again, the coa∣gulation and fixation of Metals, together with the operation of expelling all Diseases: Take notice of this Key, for it is Ce∣lestial, Sydereal and Elementary, out of which the terrestrial is generated, it is both Supernatu∣ral and Natural, and is genera∣ted
Celestially of the Spirit of Mercury, Spiritually of the Spirit of Sulphur, and Corporally of the Spirit of Salt; this is all the way, the whole Essence, the beginning and end; for the Spirit and the Body are bound up together in one by the Soul, that they can never be separated, but produce a very perfect, durable Body, which nothing can hurt. Out of this spiritual Essence, and out of this spiritual Matter, out of which first of all Gold was made into a Body, and became corporal, out of it is made a more true and compleat Aurum potabile than out of Gold it self, which must first of all be made spiritual, before a potable Gold can be prepared out of it. This Spirit cures and heales the Leprosie and the French Pox, as being an over-fix'd Mercurial
Essence, dries up and consumes the Dropsie, and all running and open Sores, which have raged a long season, it strengthens the Heart and Brain, makes a good Memory, generates good Blood, brings Lust, Delight and Desires in humane incitation unto Natu∣ral Affections. If the Quintes∣sence of Pearl be mixt with the Tincture of Coral, and be ad∣ministred with an addition of an equal quantity of this Spiritual Essence of Gold, the Dose of two grains taken at once in a just observation, you may be bold & confident of the truth, that no dis∣aster of any Natural Distemper can harm you, or happen to you, to the prejudice of your health, because the nature resides only in the Spirit of Gold, to alter, re∣move and amend all weaknesses, so that the Body shall be adjudg∣ed
perfect and free from any Dis∣ease. The Quintessence of Pearl corroborates the Heart, and make a perfect Memory, of the five senses. The Tincture of Coral expels all poison, and evil Spirits which fly from the good. So can the Soul of Gold in a Wa∣ter turn the spiritual Essence of the Pearl, and the Sulphur of the Coral united in one, perform such a thing which otherwise Na∣ture could not be intrusted with, but seeing that Experience hath manifested it, and confirmed the undeniable Truth, therefore this Cordial in this temporal Life is, and ought in reason to precede all other Cordials with admiration and admirable Effects, be they called by what name soever. I am an Ecclesiastical person, obe∣dient to the Ecclesiastical degree, related to the Benedictine Order
by a Spiritual and Divine Oath, by which Order with my internal Prayer, I obtain comfort and promises of Gods Word, a re∣freshment to my Soul, but in a corporal temptation of my weak∣nesses, and for my Brethren I have not found and used a better corroboration by Gods Blessing, than these three Compounds uni∣ted: God give, bless, and in∣crease this Virtue and Power unto the End of this temporal World, which Man must change together with Death. O thou golden power of thy Soul! O thou golden intellect of thy Spi∣rit! O thou golden operation of thy Body! God the Creator keep thee, and grant unto all earthly Creatures, who love and honour him, the true understan∣ding of all Gifts, that thy Will may be done in Heaven and on
Earth: This is enough reveal∣ed at present concerning the Spirit of Gold, until the com∣ing again of Elias. Hereunto I add a short Process: Take a Spirit of Salt, there∣with extract the Sulphur of Gold, separate the Oil of Salt from it, rectifie the Sulphur of Gold with Spirit of Wine, that it be plea∣sant without Corrosive; then take the true Oil of Vitriol, made of the Vitriol of Verdi∣greece, therein dissolve Mars, thereof make a Vitriol again, and again dissolve it into an Oil or Spirit, which rectifie in like manner as before with Spi∣rit of Wine, conjoin them, and abstract the Spirit of Wine from it, resolve the Matter which remaines dry in Spirit
of Mercury, according to a just weight, circulate and coagulate it when it is fix'd and perma∣nent without Ascention, you have then a Medicine to tinge Man and Metals, if it be fer∣mented with prepared Gold.
CHAP. VII. Of the Spirit of Silvor THE Tincture and spirit of Silver manifests its Colour of a Watchet or Sky-colour, o∣therwise it is a waterish Spirit, cold and moist, not so hot in its degree as that which is found in Gold, Mars, and Venus; for Luna is more phlegmatick than fiery, though it be brought by the Fire out of its waterish Substance into a coagulation; and even as the Metals gain their tinging Spirits and Coagulation, in like manner do stones get their fixedness, and colour, as out of one Influ∣ence. A fix'd coagulated Mercury is found in the Diamond, there∣fore
it is fixeder and harder than the other stones, and cannot be so broken; so the tincture of Mars, or the Sulphur of Iron is found in the Ruby, the Sulphur of Venus in the Emerald, the Soul of Saturn in the Granate; in Tin the tincture which is found in the To∣paz; and Crystal is appropria∣ted to common Mercury; in the Saphir is found the Sulphur and Tincture of Luna, but each one according to a peculiar under∣standing, and according to its kind, and in Metals according to their form and gender; for when the blew Colour is taken and ex∣tracted out of the Saphire, its Rayment is gone, and its other Body is white as a Diamond, wanting only the hardness that is in a Diamond; even so when Gold hath lost its Soul, it yields a fix'd white Gold Body, which
by searching Students and young Artists is called fix'd Luna. Wherefore you must now un∣derstand and observe, that even as I have declared unto you con∣cerning the Saphire, for your ap∣prehension, even so on the other side, you must learn to what pur∣pose my Speech is intended, for your Instruction concerning Me∣tals. For this blew Spirit is the Sul∣phur and the Soul, whence the Silver receiveth its Life, both in and above the Earth, by Art, and the white Tincture of the Silver upon white stands in the Magne∣tick form of an everlasting thing, or Creature, wherein is likewise found the first Ens of Gold. O ye high qualified Orators! where is your voice in this case to explain this Mystery? And you conceited Naturalists, where is
your Writings and Advice of Reason? And you Physicians, Whither is your Opinion flown, to fetch somewhat afar off over the Seas for to cure the Dropsie, and all Lunary Distempers? You will say, that this my speech is too dark for you; is it so? then kindle the terrestrial Light, seek, and be not ashamed to make ac∣quaintance with Vulcan; and let nothing be irksome unto you, so will you find by the assistance of the Eternal God, that the Spirit of Silver contains in it to cure and expel the Dropsie quite alone, as the Spirit of Gold, and as that of Mercury can expel the Con∣sumption radically, or in the root, even so that the Center of those Diseases cannot be found any more. But that Luna in the veins of the Earth is not furnished with such a hot substance or qua∣lity
in its degree, but is subject∣ed to a Waterish Nature; this fault lies upon that great Light of Heaven, which by reason of its Waterish influence, hath im∣planted such qualities in the other Creatures, and Planets of the Earth, than it hath in Silver. And albeit that Silver contains a fix'd Mercury, which is generated in it, yet it wants a hot, fix'd Sulphur, truly to dry up and consume its Phlegme, whereby it hath not obtained a compact Body, unless it be done afterwards by the art of the Little World. And see∣ing that its Body is not compact by reason of the abounding wa∣tery substance, its Pores there∣fore are not rightly defended, nor closed to undergo the weight and endure a Battel with the E∣nemies; all which Virtues are to be found in Gold, if it shall over∣come
all Enemies, and endure all trials without defect. All things are difficult in the beginning, but wben they are brought to an end they are easie to be understood and apprehend∣ed. If you do truly observe the Spirit and the Soul of Luna, and learn to know it truly, you may quickly compass the midst of the Work, how it shall afford the end with profit; wherefore I will now propose to you an Ex∣ample, and instruct you by a Countrey-Rule, that you may apprehend it, and consider of it, as Childrens Play, in a high and weighty Matter, that you may search it out with advantage; as followeth: A common Peasant casts forth (or sows) his Seed in a Field well dunged and prepared, this Seed after putrefaction, sprouts forth
of the Earth by the operation and furtherance of the Elements, and sets before our Eyes the Matter of Flax together with its Seed which it brings with it aug∣mented; this Flax is pluck'd up, and separated from its Seed; but this Flax cannot be used and pre∣pared for any work profitably, except it be first putrefied and rotted in water, whereby the Body is opened, and gains an in∣gress of its doing good; after this putrefaction and opening, it is again dried in the Air and Sun, and by this coagulation it is again brought into a Formal Being, that it may do future service. This prepared Flax is afterwards buck'd, beaten, broken, peel'd, and last of all dress'd, that the pure may be separated from the impure, the clean from the filth, and the fine from the course;
which otherwise could not b done at all, or brought to pass without the preceding preparati∣on; this done, they spin Yarn of it, which they boil in water over the Fire, or else with Ashes set in a warm place, whereby it is pu∣rified afresh, whereby the filth and superfluities are fully separa∣ted from it, and after a due wash∣ing the Yarn is dried again, deli∣vered to the Workmen, and Cloth weaved of it; this Cloth is purified or whitened by a fre∣quent casting of water upon it, cut in pieces by Taylors, and o∣ther people, so converted to fu∣ture services in houshold affairs; and when this Linnen is quite worn out, and torn, the old Rags are gathered together, and sent to the Paper-Mills, whereof they make Paper, which is put unto divers uses.
If you lay Paper upon a Me∣tal or Glass, kindle and burn it, the vegetable Mercury comes forth and flies away into the Air, the Salt remaines in the ashes and the combustible Sulphur which is not so quickly consumed in the burning, dissolves to an Oil, which is a good Medicine for dim and defective Eyes. This Oil hath in it a great fatness, which is the Matter of the Paper, contained originally in the Seed of the Flax; so that the last Mat∣ter of the Flax which is Paper, must again be dissolved into the first Matter, which is the fat Sul∣phurous Oyliness of the Flax∣seed, together with the separa∣tion of its Mercury and Salt, that so the first may be made of the last, and the ground-work re∣vealed, so the Virtues and Ope∣rations known by the first.
And though this Discourse be gross and not subtil, yet you may learn thereby to know what is subtile and secret; for that which is subtile must be infused into the ignorant by course Examples, that thereby they may be taught to reject the gross, and to em∣brace that which is subtile. In like manner understand, that the first Matter of Metals must be observed, known, and found out by the revelation of their last Matter, which last Matter, as there are the perfect Metals, must be separated and divided asun∣der, that it may plainly appear singly before the Eyes of men. Out of which separation may be judged and learnt what the first Matter was at the beginning, out of which the last was made. Ac∣cept of this Advice concerning Luna at present. I could have
said more, but I must desist at this time until another opportu∣nity; and intreat you heartily, admonishing you by your Con∣science, that you observe all that which I have revealed unto you, of all those Letters which are contained in the middle between Alpha & Omega, & that you keep all the Speeches & Writings, that you may not undergo a denial of pardon for your Sins, & a conti∣nued perpetual Vengeance for Eternity; which I at last reveal unto you thus: Take the Sky-coloured Sul∣phur extracted out of Silver, rectified with Spirit of Wine, dissolve it according to its Quantity in the White Spirit of Vitriol, and in the sweet-sented Spirit of Mercury, coa∣gulate them together by the fixation of the Fire, you have
the White Tincture in your Hands with all its Medicines; but if you can get all their primum Mobile's, it is then need∣less, because you can perfect the Work at once.
CHAP. VIII. Of the Soul or Tincture of Tin. GOod Jupiter possesses almost the mean or middle place between Metals, it being not too hot, nor too cold, not too warm, nor too moist, it hath no excess of Mercury, nor of Salt, and it hath the least of Sulphur in it; it is found to be white in Colour, yet one exceeds the other in the three Principles, as it is evident∣ly found in its dissection, the right and true discovery of Na∣ture. It is generated of such a composition and mixture of the three first Principles, being ope∣rated,
coagulated into a Metal, and brought to the ripeness of perfection. Jupiter is a God of Peace, a Lord of Goodness, a Ruler and Possessor of the mid∣dle Region; as concerning its State, Essence, Function, Virtue, Form and Substance; for it holds the mean; no special Disease can happen, that Jupiter should cause any remarkable damage, if its Medicine be used a little at once, not too much in quantity; it is likewise thought needless, where its Medicines are not required, that they should be administred in strange cases with a just Call, but we should rather abide by those, where the Body and its Disease have an equal temper with the superiour Stars and their assistance, in vertue, power, and operation, and so accord toge∣ther in their juncture, that there
is not found the least contrariety in the Operation, nor in the O∣perative Nature. Jupiters Spirit is found not to be wanting in the least, in the ge∣neration of Metals, as likewise no one Spirit of all the Metals can be set backwards, because of necessi∣ty they accord together from the lowest to the highest degree, and must agree together, as a Metal is perfect in the great Earth, so should the transmutation & aug∣mentation succeed in the little world; understand it after this manner, that all the degrees from the meanest to the highest Metal must be passed through in all perfection, even as the Metals must finish their course, from Sa∣turn unto Gold, as concerning the permanency of Colour and Bo∣dy, not withstanding that Saturn possesses the highest place in the
highest Region, wherein the stars reign and perform their Course. The generation of Tin in and above the Earth, is brought to light even as Man is and other A∣nimals, which are originally nou∣rished and fed by the Mothers Milk; there is no Diet to be found on Earth more fit for the nourishment of all men than Milk; for its best part is chiefly an Ani∣mal Sulphur; which yields the Nourishment. Even in like man∣ner Tin is nourished by its Metal∣lick Sulphur, which likewise feeds it with the greatest acceptation, it assumes in and to it more heat than Saturn, therefore is Jupiter more digested & broiled, where∣by its Body likewise is more fixt and permanent in the degree of Salt. He causes in his Dominion and Reign, that good Rule be obser-
and Justice done to all men in his Court. The Spirit of Tin is a Preserver from all Distempers & Accidents whereby the Liver is consumed or put into malady; its Spirit is naturally to be com∣pared unto Honey in Taste, its Mercury being made volatile, gains a venomous quality; for it purges violently, and penetrates through by force, therefore it is not alwayes to be advised, that its opened Mercury should be u∣sed alone and simply, but if a Correction precede, there may an excellent benefit succeed, be∣ing used in those distempers and diseases, which are immediately subject to its Influence, that is, when its venomous volatility is taken away, and set in a better and fixeder state, which resists the poison. The Vulgar Physician cannot
understand this Description; for this Art and knowledge proceeds not from the bare Talking, but from Experience; the common Physician hath the foundation and egress in speaking, but our Preparation hath its Rise from speaking, and then its foundati∣on first of all out of a certain tri∣al, which manifests it by Expe∣rience, and this is firmed upon hard Rocks by manual Operati∣ons, but the other stands upon moving Reeds & Sand; wherefore in reason that which is strong and immoveable, made by Natures hand, ought to be prefer'd before bare Speeches, which proceed only from an inconstant phanta∣stical speculation, because the Work alwayes will praise the Master. At present I do not indeed speak according to my own Poe∣tical
manner, nor after such a way as I directed my stile, when I treated of the wonderful gene∣ration of the seven Planets in my occult Philosophy, nor after a Magical or Cabalistical manner and custom; much less do I ob∣serve the method which teaches, and diligently marks the Mysti∣cal, Secret and Supernatural Arts, to wit, of Hydromancy, AEro∣mancy, Geomancy, Pyromancy, Ni∣gromancy, and the like: But my present purpose and intent is di∣rected to reveal Natures Secrets, that all the Lovers of Art, and the Children which seek and de∣sire wisdom, may by Gods Grace, Blessing, and Permission, easily understand, observe, mark, and likewise after diligent observati∣on learn, & retain something that is beneficial; this concerns the generation of Metals in two
pares, in the great and in the lit∣tle World, as likewise what is the true Medicine contained in the inward part of those Metal∣lick and Mineral Forms, which must be apprehended and made moveable by their dissection, that their first beginning may be made notoriously visible in three di∣stinct things; Then is Nature stript, and her secret parts disco∣vered by laying off her tempo∣ral Cloathing, and all the secret Virtues, Powers, and Operati∣ons revealed for Mans Health. My Persecutors, and indiscreet Physicians will now tell me, thou talkest much of Geese, and knowest not a Duck; who knows whether all what thou writest be true? I will stick where I am, and remain by what I have tried, and bears the sway among all my Associites and Physicians; so
shall I not be deceived, and am assured that I shall not need to take paines to learn any new Matter. He that is of such a resolution, may remain with the Ducks; for he is not worthy of a roasted Goose, nor to learn what is concealed in Nature. But this in truth I acknow∣ledge, and confess it before the Supreme Trinity, speaking it to the hazzard of that most Noble Ecclesiastical Jewel, that all what I have wrote, and yet shall write in this point, is all true, and shall be found to be no otherwise in truth: But that every ignorant, or vulgar person, which are ha∣ters and persecutors of this My∣stery, do not well, fully, and clearly understand my Writings at first; alas! that cannot I help; pray unto God for his Grace, and ye Persecutors for pardon, la∣bour
without repining, read with understanding, then will no Mystery be withheld from you, but will be very easie for you to find out. I moreover admonish, that the finder of this gift of God, above all things give thanks unto God day and night without ceasing, with all reverence and due obedience, from the bot∣tom of his heart; because no Creature can yield sufficient praise which may recompense so great a henefit; but Diligence is known by a right and true indu∣stry according to our capacity. I have done my part, which I hope to justifie before God and the World; for what my Eyes have seen, my Hands felt, and apprehended by an undeceived Judgment, that shall no man take from me in this Life; only Death, which is the determiner of all things.
This my Speech hath indeed had no force to poure forth from it what is written by me herein; but what I have done is not out of curiosity, nor out of a desire of vain and transitory Glory; but I have been induced there, unto: by the Command of Christ the Lord, that his Glory and Goodness in eternal and temporal Matters, should not be conceal∣ed from any man, but to the praise, honour, and glory of his holy everlasting Name, that it might be exalted, acknowledged, and revealed in his Majesty by reason of his Highness and Al∣mightiness, through the confir∣mation of his wonderful Deeds. And secondly, I have been led thereunto by Love and Charity towards my Neighbour, for his good as for my own, and to heap burning Coals on my Ene∣mies
heads. And last of all, tha all Opposers may know, what er∣roneous waies others have gone against me, and whether I am most of all to be condemned, or they adjudged most just in what hath been written most truly of the concealments of Nature; & like∣wise that the supremest Mystery may not quite be suffocated in darkness, nor be drowned in o∣verflowing waters, but be deli∣vered out of the deep and fil∣thy mire of the Ideotish Crew by the right appearance of the true Light, and obtain many witnesses by the spreading abroad of a sure, true, and right Confession, who may follow me in the Wri∣tings of Truth. In my Nativity of the twelve Signes in the Zo∣diack, Sagitary and Pisces were allotted unto me; I was born un∣der. Pisces, for I was in Waterish∣ness
before my Life, but Sagitary set an Arrow to my Heart, whereby I lost my Waterishness, and by the heat I became worthy of the dry Earth; and although at the first the Earth was turned by the Water into a soft sub∣stance, yet you must understand that the Water was consumed by the heat of the drying Air, so that all the soft Matter of the Earth went away, and by this drying up was dignified with a Hardness; whereby thou Learner, and much Understander should carefully observe and take good notice, that Tin is subject to all the four Elements, as also to the other principal Planets; which Elements received their Center from above, and are ge∣nerated as others. To conclude, I let you know, and give you to understand, that
if thou extract out' of Benevolent Jupiter its Salt and Sulphur, and lettest Saturn flux well with it, Saturn assumes a fixt body unto it, purges it self, and becomes clear thereby, there being a full change and real transmutation of Lead into good Tin, which may be found to the height by a dura∣ble infallible proof. And though you may think this to be false, yet you must take notice, that seeing the Salt of Jupiter only by its Sulphur is made more corpo∣ral, yet likewise it hath obtained an efficacy and power to pene∣trate Saturn, the basest and most volatile Metal, and bring it to a melioration of its Equals, as you will find it in reality.
CHAP. IX. Of the Spirit of Saturn, or Tincture of Lead. SAturn to generate his Metal Lead, is placed in the upper Heaven above all Stars, but he possesses the lowest and vilest de∣gree in the under-parts of the Earth, even as the supreme Light of Saturn is mounted aloft in the highest supremacy of all the Ce∣lestial Planets, so hath its Chil∣dren of the lower Region suc∣ceeded it in Kind; and Nature hath permitted that Vulcan should conduct them to their like, if Saturn be content; for the up∣per light gives occasion thereun∣to,
having generated an unfixt Body of Saturn, penetrated with open pores, that the Air can pass through this Saturnine Body, that the Air can keep it aloft, but the fire can quickly assault it, be∣cause the body is not compact by reason of its unfixedness, so that it must decay, which must be in all points observed by him that will attain to the search of it; for there is a great difference between the fix'd and unfix'd bo∣dies, and of the causes of their Constancy and Inconstancy. And though Saturn hath an especial ponderosity above other Metals, yet observe, when they are pou∣red forth together, after their union in the Flux, the other Me∣tals alwaies settle at the bottom, even as it likewise comes to pass in the pouring of Antimony through with other Metals,
whereby it is evident, that the other Metals fall through equal∣ly, and are more compact than Saturn, for it must give place and preheminence to the other Metals, leaving the victory with them; for it must vanish and be quite consumed with the unfixt inconstant Metals; in it all the three properties of the three principles are most course; and because its Salt is very fluxible above that of other Metals and Planets, so is its Body more fluxible, inconstant, unfixt, and volatile, than any other Metal∣lick Body. As Saturn steps to its regeneration, so know that in like manner, as common Water is forced by the natural coldness, by the change of the Heavens, whereby it becomes a coagulated Ice, in like manner is it to be made evident, that by reason of
the great coldness which is found to be in the Salt of SAturn above other Salts; Saturn is also coagu∣lated and made corporal; Ice dissolves into water by heat; so likewise the coagulated Saturn is made fluxable by Fire, it hath most of Mercury in it, but it is inconstant and volatile; it hath least of Sulphur, and there∣fore according to its small quan∣tity its cold body cannot be made warm; it hath little Salt, but fluxible, otherwise Iron would be more fluxible and malleable than Lead, if the Salt alone could cause a malleableness and fluxi∣bleness, because Iron contains more Salt than any other Metal: Seeing then there is a difference to be found in this point, you must therefore observe and re∣member the difference, and how to distinguish between Metals.
All Philosophers have wrote as well as I, that the Salt gives the Coagulation and Body to every Metal; and it is true; but to prove it by an example, how and after what manner this Relation is to be understood: Plume Al∣lom is esteemed to be only a meer Salt, and is approved to be such, which in this particular may be compared to Iron, that the Salt of the Plume Allom is found to be a thing unfluxible as Iron is. On the other side, Vitriol likewise is a Salt, manifesting it self in a small quantity, but fluxible and o∣pen, therefore its Salt cannot yield such a hard congelation unto its appropriated Metal, as the other can; although all the Salts of Metals grew out of one certain Root, and out of one Seed, yet nevertheless you must observe a difference in their three Princi∣ples,
as also you must observe & remember, that a difference is found in one Herb from the o∣ther, and likewise how man dif∣fers from other Creatures and A∣nimals in Qualities, Original, and the three Principles; for one Herb is indued with more of this, another with more of that kind, which in like manner is to be un∣derstood concerning Man and o∣ther Animals. The Soul of Lead consists in a sweet quality, as also doth the Soul of Tin, and sweeter yet, that no∣thing almost may be compared to it, being first of all purified to the highest by separation, that the pure be well separated from the impure, that a perfect ac∣complishment may succeed in the Operation: Otherwise the Spirit of Lead is by nature cold and dry, wherefore I advise, that
it be not much used by Men and Women, because it over cools Nature, so that the Seed of both cannot perform their Natural Function; nor doth it much good to the Spleen and Bladder, but in other cases it attracts fleg∣matick Humours unto it, which raise up much Melancholy in Men; for Saturn is a Ruler, and such a Melancholicus, whereby a Man is confirm'd in his Melan∣choly, wherefore its Spirit is used, for one Melancholy Spi∣rit attracts another unto it, whereby Mans Body is freed and delivered from its infused Me∣lancholy. Externally the Soul of Saturn is so healing, in all Sores old or new, Cuts, Thrusts, or Accidents by Means or Nature, so that no Metal can do the like; it is cooling in all hot, tumified Members; but Noble Venus hath
the pre eminence to mundifie and cauterize all putrid Sores, and to lay a ground for their Cure, which have their access from within; for in her essence she is hot to dry up, but Saturn on the contrary is found to be cold in his Essence. The Celestial Light of the Sun is much hotter than the Light of the Moon; for the Moon is much lesser than the Sun, and accord∣ing to its dimension and division it contains an eighth part of the greatness in its Circle; if then the Moon in this her Magnitude of the eighth part could excel the Sun, as the Sun excels the Moon, all Fruits and Producti∣ons of the Earth must perish, and there would be a perpetual Win∣ter, no Summer to be found at any time: But the Eternal Cre∣ator hath in this case well ordain∣ed
a certain Order and Law for his Creatures, that the Sun should give light by day, and the Moon by night, and so all Creatures should be served. Those Chil∣dren which are subject to the in∣fluence of Saturn, are melancho∣ly, churlish, continually murmu∣ring, as old covetous people, who do no good to their own Bodies, and yet never have enough; they put their Bodies to much la∣bour, torment themselves with thoughts and whimsies, seldom recreate themselves, or are mer∣ry with other people, nor do they greatly regard the natural love of fair Women. In brief, I tell thee that Sa∣turn is generated of little Sul∣phur, little Salt, and much unripe gross Mercury, which Mercury is to be esteemed as a Froth that floates upon the Water, in com∣parison
of that Mercury which is found in Sol; and is much more hot in its degree, and therefore the Mercury of Saturn by reason of its great coldness, hath not so quick a running Life as that which is made of Gold, wherein more heat is to be found, whence that running Life hath its origi∣nal: Therefore in the inferiour world we must take notice of lit∣tle Vulcan in the augmentation and transmutation of Metals, as I have described those three Principles of Saturn, as concer∣ing their descent, nature, and complection. And every one must know, that no transmutati∣on of any Metal can follow out of Saturn, by reason of its great coldness, only and except to co∣agulate common Mercury; for the cold Sulphur of Lead can qualifie and take away the hot
running Spirit of the Quicksil∣ver, if the process be rightly or∣dered, wherefore it is not amiss to observe, that Mercury is so de∣tained, that the Theory should agree with the Practick, and meet together in a certain measure and concordance. You must not therefore quite reject Saturn, nor in all points scornfully neglect him, because its Natures and Virtues are known yet but unto few; for the Stone of the wise hath the first beginning of its Ce∣lestial, high-shining Colour only out of this Metal, and from the influence of this Planet, the Key of Constancy is delivered unto him by putrefaction, because the red cannot be made out of the yellow, except before-hand a white be made out of the begin∣ning of the black. I could yet treat variously, and
at large of many wonderful works of Natural and Superna∣tural things. But because other Labours prevent me therein, of making a longer Narration, I therefore put a Conclusion to this Treatise at present, referring the other concerning the concealed Secrets of Minerals until I have a purpose to write further, in a particular Treatise of Antimony, Vitriol, Brimstone, Magnet, and which in especial are endowed before others, and depend upon those, out of which Gold and Silver have their beginning, mid∣dle and end, together with the true transmutation particularly; which virtues and power they have received out of one thing, wherein all these lie to be genera∣ted invisibly concealed, together with all Metals; which matter is publick before the eyes of all
men, but because the vertues and powers are very deeply bu∣ried and unknown to the most part, therefore this matter is like∣wise esteemed as nothing, or of no value, and unprofitable, out of ignorance; even as the Disci∣ples of the Lord going to Emaus, their eyes were opened at the breaking of Bread, that they knew wonder above wonder, what the rich Creator hath pla∣ced in the vile creature, the name is Hermes, who carries a flying Serpent in his Shield, having a Wife whose Name is Aphrodita, who can know the Hearts of all men, and yet all is one, and one only thing, one only Essence, which is common in all Places, and known every where, every one grasps it with his hands, and uses it in vile matters, and of small value; he values the vile at
a high rate, and that which is high he casts away; it is nothing else but Water and Fire, out of which the Earth is generated by the help of the Air, and is yet preserved. Praise be to the most High for his Gifts: At present enough is revealed what my in∣tent was to shew in this Treatise, and so I depart hence; for in se∣paration all is to be found.
Of the Medicine or Tincture of Antimony, as well to preserve Mans Body in Health, and to divert all desperate and incura∣ble Diseases, as also to cure the Leprosie of Metals, to purifie and to transmute them into the best Gold. Written by that Noble and Learned Phi∣losopher, Roger Bacon. STibium or Antimony, as the Philosophers say, is compo∣sed of a Noble Mineral Sulphur, which they accounted to be the black secret Lead of the Wise. The Arabians call it Asmat or
Azmat; the Alchymists retain the Name Antimony. Addition. The Moors call it Antimony, others call it Alabaster, or Tarbason. By the Arabians and Spaniards it is called Alcohol. Avicennae c. 7. calls it Artemed. Alexius of Piedmont, in his se∣venth Book of Secrets, calls it Talck, even as John Jacob Wecker renders it in his Books of Secrets; but Talck is far different from Antimony. Pliny, Book 33. Chap. 6. of Antimony. Dioscorides gives a preparation of Antimony, Book 5. Chap. 39. They call it also Stibi, Stimmi, &c. The Germans call it Spies glass, or as George Fabricius would rather have it, Spies glantz. Gerlandius calls it Black Alcophil, Altofel, or Alirnu, others Cosmet, and it is twofold, Masculine and Feminine. It will lead us to the considera-
of higher Mysteries, if we be∣hold and discern that Nature wherein Gold is exalted, even as the Magi have found that this Mineral is by God ordained un∣der the Constellation of Aries, which is the first Celestial Sign, wherein the Sun takes its Exalta∣tion, though this be not regard∣ed by the Vulgar; yet discreet people will know, and the better observe, that even in this place also the Mysteries and Perpetui∣ty may in part be considered with great benefit, and in part disco∣vered. But some ignorant and indis∣creet people think, that when they had Antimony, they would deal well enough with it by Cal∣cination, others by Sublimation, and some by Reverberation, thereby to obtain its great Myste∣ry and perfect Medicine. But I
tell you, that here in this place it availes not in the least, either Calcination, Sublimation, or Re∣verberation, whereby afterwards a perfect extraction can or might be done or effected with profit, to transmute the meaner into a better Metallick virtue; for it is impossible for you. Be not deluded; some of the Philosophers which have wrote of such things, as Geber, Albertus Magnus, Rasis, Rupecissa, Aristo∣tle, and many others: But ob∣serve this: Some say, that if An∣timony be made to a Vitrum or Glass, the bad volatile Sulphur is gone, and the Oil which may be prepared out of that Glass, will be a very fixt Oil, and will really give an ingress and Me∣dicine of perfection to the im∣perfect Metals. These words and opinion are
good and true, but it will not be nor appear such indeed; for I tell you truly, without conceal∣ed speeches, that if you lose a∣ny of the aforesaid Sulphur in the Preparation or Burning, for a small fire may easily prejudice it, you then have lost the true penetrating Spirit, which should make the whole Body of Anti∣mony to a perfect red Oyl, which should also ascend over the helm with a delightful sent, and cu∣rious Colours; observe likewise, that the whole Body of this Mineral, with all its Members, should be but one Oyl, and a∣scend over the helm without any loss of weight, excepting the feces. How should the Body be brought to an Oil, or yield its pleasant Oil, if it be brought to the last being of its degree, for
Glass is in all things the utmost and last. You shall likewise know that you shall not obtain that perfect noble Oil in the least, if it be extracted with corrected Vine∣gar poured upon the Antimony, nor yet by Reverberation; and although its various colours may appear, yet is it not the right way; you may indeed get an Oil, but you must know that it hath no part of the Tincture, or pow∣er of transmutation in it. Now we come to the Manual Ope∣ration. Take in the Name of God, and of the Eternal Trinity, fine and very pure Mineral Antimony, which is fair, white, massie, and inwardly full of yellow Streaks or Veins, aud likewise of red
and blew Colours, and small Veins, this is the best; pound it to fine Powder, dissolve it by little and little in Aqua Regis, that the Water may conquer it. After Solution take it out immediately that the Aqua Regis may do it no prejudice; for it will quickly dissolve the Tincture of the An∣timony; for our Water in its nature is like to the Ostrich, which by his heat can digest Iron, and consume it to nothing; for the Water will consume it, and turn it to a Mud, that it shall remain only as a yellow Earth, and then is it quite spoiled. Take an Example hereof from Silver, which is dissolved, fair pure and fine in these our Waters but if it stand a night therein while the Water is strong and full of Spirits, I tell you, your good Silver will be corroded to no∣thing
in these our Waters; and though you would reduce it into a Massie Body, you cannot; for it will remain as a pale yellow Earth, and sometimes it will run together in the form of Horn, or of a white Horse Hoof, which you can by no Art reduce into a Body. Wherefore you must remem∣ber to take the Antimony out pre∣sently after the Solution, preci∣pitate and adulterate it accord∣ing to the custom of Alchymists, that it may not be corroded with its perfect Oil by the Water, and burnt up to nothing. The Water wherein we dissolve is thus made. R. Vitriol, a pound and a half, Salt-Armoniac one pound, Azinat one pound, Salt-nitre a pound
and a half, Salt-gemme one pound, Allom half a pound; these are the Ingredients which belong un∣to the making of the Water for the Solution of Antimony. Take and mix them well toge∣ther; at first distil very slowly, for the Spirits ascend with great∣er violence than those of any other common Aqua fortis; be∣ware of its Spirits; for their Fumes are very subtile and hurt∣ful in their penetration. When you have adulterated the Antimony well and purely from the corrosive Water, then put it into a clean Vial, poure good distilled Vinegar upon it set it forty dayes and nights to putrefie in Horse-dung, or in Balneum Mariae, it will be bloud∣red. Take it out, and see how much is yet to be dissolved, de cant off gently the pure and
clear, which is red into a Glass-Gourd, poure other Vinegar upon the Faeces as before, that if any thing should yet remain therein, it might be dissolved; this must be done four times in fourty days and nights; for if any good be in the Faeces, it will be dissolved in that time, then cast the Dregs away as unprofi∣table, being but Dirt, and to be cast to the Dunghill. Put all the Solutions in a glass-Gourd into Balneum Mariae, distil all the tart Vinegar from it, pour it on again, or else pour fresh, if this be too weak, it will quick∣ly dissolve in the Vinegar; distil it again from it, that the Matter be quite dry; then take com∣mon distilled water, wash all tartness from it with the Vinegar imparted to the Matter, then dry the Matter in the Sun, which is
of a very deep red, or else dry it very well at a gentle fire. When the Philosophers find our Antimony thus secretly pre∣pared, they say then that its ex∣ternal nature and virtue is invert∣ed internally, and the internal cast forth externally, henceforth becoming an Oil, which is con∣cealed in its innermost and pro∣foundest part, till it be well pre∣pared, and cannot any more be brought into its first Essence, un∣till the last Judgment; and it is true, for so soon as it feels the force of the fire, it flies away in a Vapour with all its parts, be∣cause it is volatile. Some of the common Labo∣rators, having thus prepared An∣timony, they take one part out because of its consumption, that they may the better operate it they mix with it one part of Sall
Armoniac, one part of the Vitrum (with others Titrum) one part of the Rebooth (with others Cadoli) wherewith the Bodies are clean∣sed; this mixture they cast upon a pure Luna, and if there were eight Ounces of the Luna, they found ten Drams of good Gold in the separation, and sometimes more; and by this work they gained wherewithal to bear their Charges, the better to attend upon, and attain unto the great Work. The ignorant called this an induction into the Silver, but that is false; for this Gold is not brought into it by the Spirits, but every kind of Silver hath one Ounce of Gold more or less in the Mark (or 8 Ounces) for Gold is so united with the Nature of Silver, that it cannot be separa∣ted from it, either by Aqua fort, or common Antimony, as the Gold∣smiths know.
But when the aforesaid Com∣position is cast upon the Luna in the flux, then happens such a se∣paration, that the Luna doth freely let go the Gold implanted therein into the Aqua fort, and is separated from it, letting it pre∣cipitate and sink to the bottom, which otherwise could not be done at all. Therefore it is not an induction into the Luna, but a bringing out of it. But we return again to our proposed Work; for we would have only the Oil, which was only known to the Wise, and not to the Ignorant. When you have rubified the Antimony very well according to the former Directions, you must have in readiness a Spirit of wine well rectified, pour it over the red Powder of Antimony, set it four daies and nights in a gentle
Balneum Mariae, that it may dis∣solve very well. And if then any of it remain undissolved, pour fresh Spirit of Wine upon it, set it again into the Bath as aforesaid, all will be well dissol∣ved; and if perhaps any more Faeces remain, they will be very few, cast them away, for they are good for nothing. Put the Solution into a glass-Gourd, with a Head luted upon it, set it into Balneum Mariae, with its recei∣ver to take the Spirits, distil slowly with a slack heat, till all the Spirit of Wine be come o∣ver, pour it in again upon the dry matter, draw it off again as before; this pouring in & abstra∣cting continue so often, till you see the Spirit of Wine ascend o∣ver the helm in various colours, then is it time that you follow it with a stróng fire, then will the
Spirit of Wine ascend red into the helm, and drop into the Re∣ceiver like a bloody Oil, and the tender Body ascends like a red Oil, dropping into the Receiver; truly this is the most secret way of the Wise, the so much applau∣ded Oil of Antimony; it is a no∣ble, well sented, virtuous, and powerful Oil, as you shall hear afterwards. But here I will teach and in∣struct you poor. Operators ano∣ther way, because you have not the Means to attend the great work, not as the Ancients did, with the separation of Gold out of Silver. Wherefore take one part of the Oil, or half an Ounce of Sa∣turn, four Ounces calcined ac∣cording to Art, pour the Oil up∣on the Calx of Saturn, mixing it, set it ten daies and nights in the
heat, into the secret Furnace; every two days augment the fire one degree, according to the ca∣pacity of the Furnace; after four days and nights set it into the third degree of Fire, therein let it rest three days and nights, then open the Door or Vent of the fourth degree, which must likewise continue three days and nights; afterwards take it out, the Saturn will be above black, like unto Charcole dust, but un∣der this black dust you will find other Colours, throughout pure, red, yellow, which flux with Ve∣netian Borax, you will find it converted into good Gold by the power of our Oil; so have you means again to set forward the great work. We return again to our pur∣pose, where we left off before. You have heard, and have been
instructed how to abstract the Spirit of Wine with the Oil over the helm into the Receiver, and to use it for the work to convert Saturn into Gold. But we will now hasten to the other work of the Tincture, and give advice concerning it. It will therefore be necessary to separate the Spi∣rit of Wine again from the Oil which do as followeth; Take the mixture of the Spi∣rit of Wine, and of the Oil, se it into Balneum Mariae; distil the Spirit of Wine only from the Oil with a very slack heat, so that you may be assured that there is no more of the Spirit to be found in this most precious Oil, which you may easily  when you see some of the drop ascend over with the Spirit of Wine, it is a sign that the Spirit of Wine is separated from the
Oil, then remove all the fire from under the Bath, how little soever it be, that it may cool the soon∣er. Take away the Receiver with the Spirit of Wine, stop it very close, for it is full of Spi∣rits which it hath retained from the Oil, as you will hear after∣wards: But in Balneum Mariae you will find that blessed Oil of Antimony red as Bloud; take it out, wash the Lute off by gen∣tle mollification, that nothing im∣pure may fall into that curious red Oil, when you take the head off; reserve it carefully, that by no means it may receive preju∣dice, for you have a Celestial Oil, which in a dark night shines like a glowing Cole, and this is the reason, because its internal power and soul is cast forth ex∣ternally, the hidden Soul being now revealed, shining through
the pure Body as a Candle through a Lanthorn, even so at the last day, these our invisible internal Souls shall be revealed, and seen out of the Body, shining as the clear Sun: So keep each apart, as well the Spirit of wine full of power, and wonderful in curing humane Distempers, as al∣so the blessed, red, noble, celesti∣al Oil, which transmutes all the Diseases of the imperfect Metals into the perfection of Gold; and the power of the spiritual Wine extends very far being rightly used. I tell you, you have obtained a Celestial Medicine, to cure all the Diseases and Distempers of Mans Body; its use is, as fol∣loweth;
In the Gout. Give three drops in a Cup of Wine fasting to the Party, just at the time when he feels the be∣ginning of his misery, anguish and pain to come upon him, the second and third, use it in like manner; it allaies all pain the first day how great foèver it be, and prevents Swelling; the se∣cond day it causes Sweat, which is very nasty, tough and thick, very soure in taste, and of an e∣vil sent, and most of all in those parts where the Members are u∣nited and joined together by the Joints; and if you should give none in the third day, yet will there be a purgation of the Veins, and of the Excrements, without any molestation or pain; is not this a great power of Na∣ture?
In the Leprosie. At the first time take six drops fasting, and cause the impure party to be alone, free from sound people, in a place far di∣stants and commodious; for all his Body will begin to send forth Fumes and Steams, like unto a stinking-Fog, and Vapours a∣bundantly; the next will Scalès and much Uncleanness fall from his Body; then let him have three drops of this Medicine, and let him take it in on the fourth day, afterwards on the eighth or ninth day by the assistance of Gods Grace and Blessing, he will be quite clean. In the Apoplexie. Let one drop fall upon the
tongue of the Patient, it will at∣tract it forth immediately like unto a Mist or Fume, and restore the party again; but if he were taken in the Body, or in the Members and Limbs, then give him three drops at once in good Wine, as you have been taught in the Gout. In the Dropsie. Give one drop in baulm wa∣ter, or Valerian water six days together, the seventh day give three drops in good wine, and it is sufficient. In the Falling Sickness, and its kinds, as Epilepsie, Catalepsie, and Analepsie. In the beginning of the Fit give the Patient two drops in
Sage-water, after three hours, give him three drops more, and it is sufficient. But if in case any thing should stir again, give him two drops, as hath been said. In a Hectick. Give the party two drops the first day in water of Violets, the second day two drops more in good Wine. In Agues. Give the party three drops in the beginning of the Fit, early in a morning, in good distilled water of St. John's wort, or of Succory, and the next day two drops more fasting.
In the Plague. Give the Patient seven drops in good Wine, let the infected party be alone, and let him sweat well upon it, by the Divine As∣sistance that poison will not pre∣judice him as to his Life. For a prolongation of a healthful Life. Take and give two drops at the beginning and entrance of the Spring, and in the beginning or entrance of Autumn likewise two drops; every one that so takes it, is freed, and well pre∣served from unhealthful and in∣fectious Air, except the Disease were by Almighty God ordain∣ed for the death of the party.
We will now step further to the Oil, and its Power, and shew how by it the Diseases of the impure Bodies of the Metals may be cured. In the Name of God, take very pure, fine, refined Gold, as much as you will, or think to be sufficient, dissolve it in a recti∣fied Wine, as is usual to make Aqua vitae; after solution of the Gold, set it a Moneth in digesti∣on; this distil in a Bath very slow and gently, distil the Spirit of Wine divers times from it, so long till you see your Gold lie at the bottom like a Juice: This is the true way and mean∣ing of some of the Ancients, to prepare Gold. But I will shew and teach you a way much readier, better, and more bene∣ficial; that in stead of this pre∣pared Gold, you take one part
of the Mercury of Gold, as I have taught the making of it in another place; abstract from it its water of Airiness, that it may be a subtle Dust, and take two parts of our blessed Oil, poure the Oil very slowly upon the Dust of the Mercury of Gold, till all be in it, set it in a Vial well sealed, in the heat of the first degree of the secret Furnace; therein let it stand ten dayes and nights, your Powder and Oil will be quite dry, of a black gray colour. After ten days give it the heat of the second degree, the gray and black colour will by little and little become white, till at last it will be of a heavenly white, and at the end of the ten days it will begin to be of a pure red, but let not this trouble you; for all these Colours proceed on∣ly from the Mercury of Gold,
which swallowed up our blessed Oil, and now conceals in the in∣ner most part of its Body; but our Oil will conquer this Mercu∣ry of Gold by the power of the fire, and cast it forth from with∣in, and the Oil will predominate over it with its hot red Colour, and be continually outwards. And therefore it will be time, after the expiration of twenty days, that you open the window of the third degree, wherein the external white Colour and Power will by little and little enter in into the inward part, and the internal red Colour will turn outward by the force of the fire. Keep this degree of heat ten days without diminution or aug∣mentation of it, you will see a Powder which before was white, to be now very red, but let not redness trouble you, for 'tis yet
unfix'd and volatile. And after these ten days are ended, thirty days being in all expired, then open the last window of the last degree of fire, keep it ten days in this degree, this high red pou∣der will then begin to flux, let it stand so in flux the ten days, then take it out, you will find at the bottom a very high, red, transparent stone of a Ruby Co∣lour, flux'd according to the form of the Glass, as is taught in the Treatise of Vitriol, where∣with you may make projection. Praise God for such his high Re∣velation, and thank him for ever, Amen. Its Multiplication. The Ancient Wise, having found the Stone, and prepared it to a perfect power, and muta∣tion
of the imperfect Metals into Gold, have a long time enquired whether a thing were not to be found to augment the power of the Stone; and they found two kinds of Augmentation, one of the power of it, so that the Stone may be brought much higher; of this multiplication you will find direction in the Treatise of Gold. The other Augmentati∣on is an augmentation of the quantity of the Stone, in its for∣mer power, so that it receives no more, nor loses any thing of its power, though it increase in weight, and augment more and more, that out of one Ounce ma∣ny Ounces arise and increase. The Augmentation or Multi∣plication is done as followeth; Take your Stone in Gods Name, grind it to a subtile powder, add to it as much of the Mercury of
Gold, as is taught before, put them together into a fine round Vial, seal it hermetically, set it into the fiery Furnace, proceed∣ing as you have been instructed before, only this time is shorter, for whereas before you had ten (thirty) days, now you need no more than four (ten) days, other∣wise the work is one and the same. Praise and give thanks to Al∣mighty God for his high Reve∣lation, continue in Prayer for his Grace and Divine Blessing in this Art and Operation, as likewise for continuance of Health and Prosperity; withal let the poor be recommended to your Help and Charity. Glory be to Almighty God.
A Work of Saturn, of Mr. John Isaac Holland. The PREFACE. Courteous Reader, THE PHILOSOPHERS have written much of their Lead which is prepared out of Antimony, as Basilius hath taught; and I am of the opinion, that this Saturnine Work of the most
excellent Philosopher M. John Isaac Holland is not to be understood of common Lead, (if the Matter of the Stone be not much more thereby in∣tended) but of the Philoso∣phers Lead. But whether the Vulgar Saturn, be the Matter of the Philosophers Stone, thereof you will receive sufficient satisfaction from the subsequent 17 Considerations or Documents. This is pub∣lished for the benefit of all the Lovers of this Art, be∣cause it expounds and declares the Stone of Fire. Vale.
A Work of Saturn In the Name of the Lord, Amen. MY Child shall know, that the Stone called the Phi∣lasophers Stone, comes out of Sa∣turn. And therefore when it is perfected, it makes projection, as well in mans Body from all Dis∣eases, which may assault them either within or without, be they what they will, or called by what name soever, as also in the im∣perfect Metals.
And know, my Child, for a Truth, that in the whole vege∣table work there is no higher nor greater Secret than in Sa∣turn; for we do not find that perfection in Gold which is in Saturn; for internally it is good Gold, herein all Philosophers a∣gree, and it wants nothing else, but that first you remove what is superfluous in it, that is, its im∣purity, and make it clean, and then that you turn its inside out∣wards, which is its redness, then will it be good Gold; for Gold cannot be made so easily, as you can of Saturn, for Saturn is ea∣sily dissolved and congealed, and its Mercury may be easily extra∣cted, and this Mercury which is extracted from Saturn, being pu∣rified, and sublimed, as Mercury is usually sublimed, I tell thee, my Child, that the same Mercury
is as good as the Mercury which is extracted out of Gold, in all operations; for if Saturn be Gold internally, as in truth it is, then must its Mercury be as good as the Mercury of Gold, there∣fore I tell you, that Saturn is bet∣ter in our work than Gold; for if you should extract the Mercu∣ry out of Gold, it would require a years space to open the body of Gold, before you can extract the Mercury out of the Gold, and you may extract the Mercury out of Saturn in 14 days, both be∣ing alike good. Would you make a work out of Gold alone, you must labour two whole years upon it, if it shall be well done: and you may finish a work of Saturn in 30 or 32 weeks at the most. And be∣ing both well made, they are both alike good; Saturn costs
nothing or very little, it requires a short time, and small labour; this I tell you in truth. My Child, lock this up in thy heart and understanding, this ♄ is the Stone which the Philosophers will not name, whose name is concealed unto this day; for if its name were known, then ma∣ny would operate, and the Art would be common, because this work is short, and without charge, a small and mean work. Therefore doth the name re∣main concealed, for the evils sake which might thence pro∣ceed. All the strange Parables which the Philosophers have spo∣ken mystically, of a Stone, a Moon, a Furnace, a Vessel, all this is Saturn; for you must not put any strange thing unto it, only what comes from it, there∣fore there is none so poor in this
world, which cannot operate and promote this work; for Luna may be easily made of Saturn, in a short time, and in a little longer time Sol may be made out of it. And though a man be poor, yet may be very well at∣tain unto it, and may be employ∣ed to make the Philosophers Stone. Wherefore my Child, all is concealed in Saturn, which we have need of, for in it is a per∣fect Mercury, in it are all the Colours of the world, which may be discovered in it; in it are the true black, white and red Colours, in it is the weight, it is our Lattin. Example. The eye of a man cannot en∣dure any thing that is imperfect,
how little soever it be, though it be the least Atome of Dust, it would cause much pain, that he can rest no where. But if you take the quantity of a Bean of Saturn, shave it smooth and round, put it into the Eye, it will cause no pain at all; the rea∣son is, because it is internally per∣fect, even as Gold and Precious Stones. By these and other Speeches you may observe, that Saturn is our Philosophers Stone, and our Latten, out of which our Mercury and our Stone is ex∣tracted with small Labour, little Art and Expence, and in a short time. Wherefore I admonish you, my Child, and all those who know its name, that you conceal it from people, by reason of the evil which might thence arise; and you shall call the Stone our
Laton, and call the Vinegar Wa∣ter, wherein our Stone is to be wash'd; this is the Stone and the Water whereof the Philosophers have wrote so many great Vo∣lumes. There are many and different works in the Mineral Stone, and especially in that Stone which God hath given us gratis, where∣of many strange Parables are written in the Mineral Book. But this is the true Stone, which the Philosophers have sought, because it makes proje∣ction upon all the imperfect Me∣tals, especially upon quick Mer∣cury, and moreover it makes projection upon all diseases what∣soever, which may come into mans Body, as likewise upon all Wounds, Cancer, Fistulaes, open Sores, Buboes, Imposthumes, and all whatsoever can come exter∣nally
upon mans Body, therefore this Stone is not under the Mine∣ral work, but under the Vege∣table. It is the beginning of the Ve∣getable Book, and the principal; this Stone is called Lapis Philoso∣phorum, the Mineral Stone is called Lapis Mineralis, and the third Stone is called Lapis Ani∣. This Stone is the true Aurum potabile, the true Quin∣essence which we seek, and no other thing else in this world but this Stone. Therefore the Phi∣losophers say, whosoever knows ur Stone, and can prepare it, needs no more, wherefore they bought this thing and no other. My Child shall take 10, 12, or 5 pound of Saturn, wherein is o mixture of any other Metal; minate it thin, have in readiness  great Stone Jugg, half full of
Vinegar, stop the Jugg very close, set it in a Lukewarm Bath every three or four days scrape off the calcin'd Saturn from the Plates, and reserve it apart, thus do so long till you have, or 6 l. of the calcin'd Saturn, then grind it very well on a Stone with good distilled Wine-Vine∣gar, so as you may paint there∣with, then take two or three great Stone-pots, therein put the Calx of Saturn which you ground, poure good distilled Wine-Vinegar upon it, that two parts of the Pot be full, stir it well together, stop the Pot close with a polished Glass or Pebble stone, set the Pots in a Bath, stir it four or five times in a day with a wooden Ladle, lay the Glass or Stone Stopple again over it, make the Bath no hotter than that you may well endure your
hand therein, that is, lukewarm; so let it stand fourteen days and nights, then decant that which is clear into another Stone-pot, poure other distilled Vinegar upon the Calx which is not well dissolved, mix them well toge∣ther, set it 14 days in the Bath, again decant it, and poure other Vinegar upon it as before. This decantation and pouring on con∣tinue so long till all the Calx of Saturn be dissolved, then take all the dissolved Saturn, set it in a Bath, evaporate the Vinegar by a small fire, the Saturn will become a powder or lump. Or stir it about until it be dry, you have a mass or powder of a dark yellow, or honey colour, then grind the powder again ve∣ry finely upon a Stone with di∣stilled Vinegar; put it into a stone-pot, stir and mix it well
together, set it again into a Bath, which is but lukewarm, so let it stand five or six dayes, stir it every day from the top to the bottom with a wooden Ladle, cover it again with the glass-Stopple, then let it cool, poure off that which is dissolved into a great stone pot, poure other Vinegar upon it, mix and stir them well together, set it into the Bath as before, reiterate this decantation and pouring on so of∣ten, till no more will dissolve, which try with your tongue, is it be sweet, it is not enough dis∣solved, or put some of it into a glass-gourd, let it evaporate, if any thing remain, it is not yet all dissolved which would be Gold, and then what remaines in the pot are Faeces, and sweet up∣on the Tongue; if you find any thing in the Gourd, it is not yet
all dissolved, then may you poure fresh Vinegar upon it, till all be dissolved, then coagulate it as before, poure other Vinegar up∣on it, stir it, set it again into the Bath, reiterate this operation of solution and coagulation so long till you find no more Faeces at the bottom, but all be dissolved in∣to a pure clear water, then is Sa∣turn freed from all its Leprous∣ness, Melancholy, Faeces, and blackness, being pure and white as Snow, for it is cleansed from all its uncleanness, because its coldness stands outwards as Luna doth, and its heat is internal, fluxible as wax, and sweet as su∣gar Candy. Why is it as white as Snow? Because it is purified from all its impurities, and because its
coldness stands external as Luna doth, and its heat is internal. Why is it sweet? Because the four Elements in it are pure, and separated from all sulphurous stink and blackness, which Saturn received in the Mine; it is almost Medicinal, and like unto Nature: And because it is so pure, it affords some of its internal virtue outwardly, as that of Sweetness; but the heat is so covered with the cold, that it cannot put forth its power exter∣nally by reason of the cold which is external (the heat of Saturn lies internal, even as in Salt-Ni∣tre) as doth the Taste, the Spi∣rit of Tasting is the most subtile in all things, as is taught more at large in the Book of Vegetables, how the Air doth dilate it self
from all Herbs and Flowers ex∣ternally; for the Spirit of the Air lies in the inward part of all things; for God created nothing in this world but it hath its pecu∣liar Taste or Air, the Air and the Taste are one Spirit, the Taste goes out of the Air, as Smoke from the Fire. But how comes it to pass, that a thing which hath a sweet Air, is bitter in Taste? The cause is, because the Faeces of that thing are putrid and stinking in the E∣lements, that is the Choler or Heat; for whatsoever is unnatu∣rally hot, hath a bitter Taste; the Air and the Taste are both one Spirit, and as the Spirit of the Air presses outwards through hot thing, so doth the Air race the Taste about, and ends the subtile Taste, that it should not be burnt by the vehe∣ment
burning Choler, as in the Herbal is at large express'd. But the cause why Saturn is sweet in Taste is, that it is almost pure and clean, having scarce any unnatural heat in it, which can burn the subtile Tast, there∣fore it hath the Taste externally, and the Taste hath the Spirit of the Air lock'd up in it. My Child, know what I said before, that a thing wherein is much burning heat, the Air locks up the Taste therein, because the Taste shall not be corrupted by the unnatural heat. So the Taste includes the Air in it, when it issues forth from a thing which is externally cold; for the sub∣til Spirits of the Air or Sent of a thing can endure no Cold, as we see daily in Herbs and Flowers that they yield no Sent in the Winter, as they do in the Sum∣mer;
but they hide themselves in the Winter, and the Spirit hath the Sent inclosed in it, and the Spirit of Sent of Air. Behold a man that hath taken Cold, im∣mediately he loses his Sent, and his Tasting is diminished. Even so it is here with Saturn; it is quite-cold, so that the Taste ma∣nifests it self with the Spirit of Sent; for the Spirit of the Taste hath the Smell in it. Look up∣on Sugar which is well clarified from its Faeces, how sweet it is in Taste, yet it yields no Sent, yet there is an extraordinary sweet∣ness in Sugar. What is the rea∣son of this? Sugar is very cold externally, therefore is it white as Snow, and of a sweet Taste; yet Sugar internally is hot and moist, of the temper of Gold, and of such great virtue that it is called the Philosophers Stone, as
it is approved, and very preva∣lent to cure all the Distempers of mans Body, as appears by its o∣peration. The reason why I say this, my Child, is, that you should altogether understand its internal & external, and the Spirits which are in these things, whereof we discourse; that thereby you should know Gods wonderful works, and what wonders he works in these inferiour things, which are all made for our use. What hath God in us, for whose sake he hath created all these wonders, and all these things? Wherefore, my Child, believe in God, love him, and follow him, for he loves you, as he makes it appear, and manifests himself in all things, as well in their Internals as in their Exter∣nals.
O how wonderful is our Lord and God, from whom all Wonders proceed! Now, my child, why is Saturn fluxible as Wax? By reason of its abounding Sulphur, which is therein; for I find no fluxibleness or fusibleness in any thing saving in Sulphur, Mercury and Arsenick, and all these three are in Saturn; so that Saturn is quickly fluxible, but all these three are cleansed with it from their uncleanness. And do you not know, that the Philo∣sophers call their Sone Arsenick, and a white thing; and they say their Sulphur is incombustible; they call it likewise a red thing, all this is Saturn, in it is Arsenick; for Luna is principally generated of a white Sulphur, as is plainly
taught in the Book of Sulphurs, and all Arsenick is internally red as Bloud, if its inward part be brought outwards, as is demon∣strated in the Book of Colours, &c. Saturn stands almost in the degree of fix'd Luna. So that in it there is a red Sulphur, as you see, when its internal is pla∣ced outwards, it will be red as a Ruby; there are no Colours but in the Spirits, so that there is in it a red and a yellow Sulphur. In it is Mercury, as may be seen, for Mercury is extracted out of Sa∣turn in a short time, and with lit∣tle labour. So that all three are in Saturn, but they are not fix'd therein, but they are clean, pure, incombusti∣ble, fluxible as Wax; in it are all things which the Philosophers have mentioned. They say, our Stone is made of a stinking men∣struous
thing: What think you, is not Saturn digg'd out of a stinking Earth? for divers are killed with the ill Sents and Va∣pours where Saturn is digg'd, or they live not long who labour in that stinking black Mine, whence Saturn is digg'd. And the Phi∣losophers say, our Stone is of lit∣tle value, being unprepared; they say, the poor have it as well as the rich, and they say true; for there are not poorer or more miserable people to be found than those which dig and work Saturn in the Mine; and they say it is to be found in all Towns and places, wheresoever you come Saturn is there. They say it is a black thing: What think you, is it not black? They say, it is a dry water, if Gold or Luna be to be refined upon the test, must it not be done with Saturn?
must be wash'd and tried with it, as a foul garment is made clean with Sope. They say, in our Stone are the four Elements, and they say true; for the four Ele∣ments may be separated out of Saturn. They say, our Stone consists of Soul, Spirit and Bo∣dy, and these three become one. They say true; when it is made fix'd for the white Mercury and Sulphur with its Earth, then these three are one. Whereby is to be observed, that the Philosophers have said true; they concealed its Name for the ignorants sake, who are not their Children, to keep them still in their Ignorance. Thus, my Child, the Ancients took care to conceal the name of the Stone; now let us return to our purpose. You have now Saturn wash'd
and cleansed from all its impuri∣ty, and made as white as Snow, fusible as Wax, but it is not fix'd yet; we will make it fix the Mer∣cury and Sulphur with its Earth. Take a Glass-Vial, put half of your purified Saturn into it, re∣serve the other half till you have occasion to use it; lay a polish'd Glass upon the mouth of the Glass, set it in a Cuple with sift∣ed Ashes upon a Furnace; or set it on the Tripos of Secrets, or in the Furnace wherein you cal∣cine Spirits; give it Fire so hot is the heat of the Sun at Mid∣summer, and no hotter, either a very little hotter, or a very lit∣tle cooler, as you can best hit it. But if you give it a greater heat, such as you may keep Lead in flux, then your Matter would melt as if it were Oil; and ha∣ving stood so, ten or twelve days,
its Sulphur would fly away, and your Matter would all be spoiled, for the Sulphur which is in your Matter is not yet fix'd, but is in the external. Wherefore the Matter melts presently, and though it be clean, yet it is not fix'd; wherefore give so gentle fire to it, that it may not flux so keep it six weeks; then take out a little of it, lay it on a glow∣ing hot Plate, if it immediately melts and fumes, it is not yet fix∣ed, but if the Matter remain un∣melted, the Sulphur is then fix'd which is therein; then strength∣en the Fire notably, till the Mat∣ter in the Glass begins to look yellow, and continually more and more yellow, like to pow∣dered Saffron, then augment the fire yet stronger, till the Matter begin to be red, then prosecut your Fire from one degree to
another, even as the Powder be∣comes redder and redder by de∣grees, so hold on your Fire, till the Matter be red as a Ruby, then augment the Fire yet more, that the Matter may be glowing hot, then is it fixt, and ready to pour the curious Water of Para∣dise upon it. My Child must know, that there are two ways of pouring on the Water of Paradise; I will teach you to make and prepare both, then may you take which you will; for the one is half as good again as the other. My Child, you may remem∣ber, that I ordered you to re∣serve the one half of the purifi∣ed Saturn, which take and put into a Stone-pot, pour upon it a pottle or more of distilled Wine-Vinegar, set a head on, distil the Vinegar again from it in a
Bath, the head must have a hole at the top to pour fresh Vinegar upon the Matter, and abstract the Vinegar again from it, pour fresh Vinegar again on, and a∣gain abstract it; this pouring on, and abstracting or distilling off must continue so long, till the Vi∣negar be drawn off as strong as it was when it was put in, then is it enough, and the Matter hath in it as much of the Spirit of Vi∣negar as it can contain; then take the Pot out of the Bath, take on the head, and take the Matter out, and put it into a thick glass which can endure the Fire, set a head on it, put it in a Cuple with Ashes, which set on a Furnace first make a small Fire, and so continually a little stronger, till your Matter come over as red as Bloud, thick as Oil, and sweet as Sugar, with a Celestial Sent
then keep it in that heat so long as it distils, and when it begins to slack, then increase your Fire till the Glass begin to glow; con∣tinu this heat till no more will di∣stil, then let it cool of it self, take the Receiver off, stop it very close with Wax, take the Matter out of the Glass, beat it to pow∣der in an Iron Mortar, with a steel Pestle; and then grind it on a Stone with good distilled Vine∣gar, put this Matter so ground into a Pot, poure good distilled Vinegar upon it, that two parts be full, set the Pot into a Bath with a head upon it, distil the Vi∣negar off, poure fresh Vinegar a∣gain upon it, distil it off again: thus do so long, that the Vine∣gar be as strong as it was when it was first poured upon it, then let it cool, take the Matter out of the Bath, take the head off, take
the Matter out of the Pot, put it into a stronger round Glass which can endure the Fire, as you did before, set it upon a Furnace in a Cuple with sifted Ashes, set a head on, and a Re∣ceiver luted to it, then distil it, first with a small fire, which aug∣ment by degrees, till a Matter come over red as Bloud, and thick as Oyl, as aforesaid; give it fire till no more will distil, then let it cool of it self, take off the head, break the glass-pot, and take the Matter out, powder it again, and grind it on a Stone with distilled Vinegar, put it a∣gain into the Stone pot, poure fresh Vinegar upon it, set it into the Bath, and its head on, distil the Vinegar from it, poure it on again as hath been taught, till the Vinegar remain strong as it was.
Reiterate this distillation in the Bath until the Matter hath no more Spirit of the Vinegar in it, then take it out, set it in a glass-pot, distil all that will distil forth in ashes, till the Matter become a red Oil, then have you the most noble water of Paradise, to pour upon all fix'd stones, to perfect the Stone; this is one way. This water of Paradise thus distilled, the Ancients called their sharp clear Vinegar, for they conceal its name. My Child, I will now teach you other ways to make the Wa∣ter of Paradise; this is an easie way, but not so good, nor doth it that high projection in humane Medicines, yet it cures all Dis∣eases within and without, but the other cures miraculously in a short time.
The second way of preparing the Water of Paradise. My Child, if you would make it after this manner, you must take the half of your prepared Saturn which I ordered you to keep, upon which poure the half of your fix'd and prepared Wa∣ter of Paradise, take the half, put it into a Stone-pot, poure weak Wine Vinegar upon it, mix it well together, then take two pounds of calcined Tartar, which is well clarified by solution and coagulation, so that it leave no more Faeces behind it, Salt, Armo∣niac one pound, which is like∣wise so clearly sublimed, that no Faeces remain after its sublima∣tion, pound both together to a Powder, put them speedily into a pot, and stop it close immedi∣ately,
or else it will run out; for so soon as the Tartar and Salt Ar∣moniac come to the Vinegar, they lift themselves up, and would immediately run out of the mouth of the pot, wherefore stop the pot presently, set the pot in a Vessel of Water, they will cool speedily, otherwise if the cold and hot Matter should come together suddenly, they would contest together, rise up, and become so hot, that the pot would break for heat, if it were not set in cold Water; therefore take heed, when you put the powders in, that you stop it im∣mediately, and set it in cold Wa∣ter before you put the other Powder to it, then will they u∣nite, let them stand a day and a night in that Vessel, then take them out, set them into a luke∣warm Bath two days and nights,
let it cool of it self, take the Stopple off from the pot, and set a head on, set the pot in sift∣ed Ashes upon a Furnace, distil with a small fire, and continually greater till all the Vinegar be o∣ver, then augment your Fire no∣tably, till you see quick Mercury drop out of the Pipe, when it ceases to drop, then augment the Fire by little and little and drive it so long as it drops; you may observe when it will leave drop∣ping, if in the spaceof one or two Pater-nosters one drop doth fall, then augment the Fire till the pot glow at the bottom, for twelve hours, and when the Mer∣cury is over, then should the Salt Armoniac sublime up into the head, and the Tartar remain with the Body of Saturn at the bottom of the Pot, which take out, put it into a Linnen Bag,
hang it in a moist Cellar, the Tar∣tar will dissolve, receive it in a Glass, the body of Saturn remains in the Bag, take it out, and calcine it in a reverberating Fur∣nace three days and nights, with a great heat, as is taught else∣where, then extract the Salt out, as is taught in the Mineral Book. You may make projection with the Salt, and coagulate your Tartar again, it will be as good or better than it was, likewise take your Salt Armoniac out of the Head, it is good again, and if you could have no Salt Armo∣niac, then take three pound of calcined Tartar, likewise so clari∣fied, that it leave no Faeces be∣hind, you then need no Salt Ar∣moniac, therewith may you like∣wise extract the Mercury out of Luna and Jupiter, wherewith you may do wonders, as is taught in
the Miner. Book, where is spoken of the Quintessence of Metals. Now my Child must know, that this Mercury or Quintessence of Saturn is as good in all works as the Mercury of Sol, they are both alike good, and herein all Philosophers agree. My Child, take this Mercury of Saturn, so drawn out of the Receiver, put it into a Glass Box. I have now taught you to make two sorts of the Water of Paradise; and know, my Child, that the first way is the best; though it be made with some danger, longer time, and more charge; for the Vinegar is all good, yet the red Oil is the best; its time is alike unto the end, and though it be more tedious before you obtain the red Oil, yet it fixes it self in a short time, if it come to the Matter of fix'd
Stone, into a simple Essence in greater redness; but when the Mercury comes to the fix'd stone, it holds on a long time in ascend∣ing and descending before it die, and when it is quite dead, it makes the red fix'd Stone again into a fixt colour, so covering the red stone with its coldness, that the red stone becomes white again, then must you boil it a∣gain gently with a small Fire, till it begin to be yellow, prosecu∣ting the Fire from one degree to another, as the Colour is higher and stronger, and that so long till it attain to a perfect redness, which requires a long time be∣fore it be done, which is not re∣quisite in the red Oil; for the red Oil dies or coagulates forth∣with the stone, the one fixing it self with the other into a simple Essence, in a short time. There∣fore
I tell thee, my Child, that the time of the Oyl is alike long in the end, though it appear to be of a shorter time with the Mercury, but it is equally long at the end of the Work, there∣fore I tell you the Art of both Works, that you may the better understand the Art to make the Oyl from the innermost Nature of the Stone, which is found afterwards. The Oyl was unknown to the Ancients, for my Grandfather with his Companions found it with great labour and length of time. So there are two ways to dis∣solve the Stone, and to poure upon it the clear water of Para∣dise. Our Ancestors called the Oyl their sharp Vinegar; there∣fore, my Child, keep the Name private, and I will teach you
first of all how you shall join the Mercury to your Stone, which you extracted out of Saturn, to dissolve it; afterwards I will teach you to bring over the helm that red Oil which you extracted out of your prepared Saturn, in∣to a fixt stone, to dissolve your stone. My Child, weight your fixt stone, take half as much of your Mercury, poure it upon the stone in the Glass, cover the Glass a∣gain with a polish'd Glass which may just fit it, set it in a Cuple with sifted Ashes, make a small Fire like the Suns heat at Midsum∣mer, and give no more Fire to it, until the Water of Paradise or Mercury become all a dead Pow∣der. And know, my Child, that the red or fixt Stone, which be∣fore was darkned, when it hath drunk up the Water of Paradise,
or Mercury, or how you will call it, that it be a Powder between black and gray, then augment the Fire from one degree to ano∣ther, till the Matter be perfect white, and when it is white, strengthen the Fire yet more, from one degree to another, till it be of a dark yellow Colour, then make it yet stronger, till it be of a perfect red then rejoice, for your Stone is perfect, and fluxible as Wax. Praise God, who gives unto us part of his Mira∣cles; and do good to the poor; you may see it with your fleshly Eyes, and use Gods goodness miraculously in this corrupt Life, for I tell you in good Charity, that if any one principally attain to this Stone, that it is given, afforded, and lent him from God. Whosoever hath this Stone, may live in a healthful state, to the
last term of his Life, appointed him by God, and may have all whatsoever he desires on Earth. He shall be loved and esteem∣ed of all people, for he can cure them all internally and external∣ly of all Diseases which may be∣fall them; but if the Stone doth not so, it is false, and deserves not the name of the Vegetable Stone, or Philosophers Stone. Therefore my Child, if God give you this Stone, look dili∣gently to it, that you keep your self from offending God, that you make not this Stone on earth to be your Heaven; govern and rule your self to Gods glory and to the comfort of poor people, that Gods praise may be aug∣mented, to the defence of the Christian Religion, and to the relief of poor exiled Christi∣ans.
I tell you, my Child, if you use it otherwise, God will leave you here a little while to your own Will, but afterwards he will speedily send a punishment, ei∣ther you shall be struck dead, or die by a Fall, or die some other sudden death, and go Body and Soul to Hell, and be damned e∣ternally, for your Ingratitude to God, who so graciously vouch∣safed you so precious and great a Gift. Therefore, my Child, look carefully to it, so to govern your self to Gods Glory, and the Sal∣vation of your Soul, that the e∣ternal Curse may not fall upon you; and therefore I have left you this Writing as my Testa∣ment. Enough hath been said to the wife, therefore look to your self.
The Multiplication of the Stone now perfected. Now my Child, you may take the half of your Powder, put it into a Glass and melt it, have in readiness a Mould made hol∣low, of Box-wood, great or small as you please, it must be made smooth and even within with an Instrument, anoint it with Oil Olive, and when your red Powder is flux'd, poure it into the Mould, it will be a precious Stone, red as a Ruby, clear and transparent, take it out of the Mould, and make projection upon the imper∣fect Metals, and in the Body of Man. Take ten times as much of prepared Saturn as I taught you before, by Coagulation and So∣lution,
till it leave no Faeces be∣hind, then take your precious red Powder out of the Glass, that two parts be full, set it into your warm Bath, and let it dissolve: when any thing is dissolved, de∣cant off that which is clear on the top into another Glass, poure other Vinegar upon it, let it dis∣solve again as before, decant and poure fresh Vinegar upon it so often, till all be dissolved into a clear Water, which is done usu∣ally in ten or twelve days, then set all that which is dissolved in∣to a Bath, and a head upon it, distil the Vinegar from it again, and coagulate the Matter so long till it be dry and shine, then put it into another Glass, which set upon a Furnace in a Cuple with sifted Ashes, laying a polish'd Glass upon the Mouth of the Glass.
My Child, know that your Matter is become fixt with the Stone in the solution, make an indifferent hot fire in the furnace, so hot as the heat of the Sun at Midsummer, or somewhat hotter; till the Matter begin to be yel∣low, then go on with the Fire from one degree to another, till you have a perfect yellow, then increase the Fire from one degree to another, till you have a per∣fect redness, which is quickly done, in half the time for the co∣lour to come, and in the multi∣plication, but operate as before in the beginning, and poure Pa∣radise water upon the Stone, as was taught you before in this Work, boil and mortifie it in e∣very point to a perfect redness as hath been taught. Then may you again take half of it out, and make projection
therewith, and multiply the other half again in all points as above∣said, so may you always continue working. Now I will teach you the o∣ther way, and the best that is to water your red fixt Stone or powder with the red Oil, that it be fusible; you must know how much your red powder weighs, then take half the weight of your red Oil, to the full weight of the Stone, and poure it upon the red powder, and when the Oil is poured into the Glass, you may set a small head on, upon a Fur∣nace in sifted Ashes, joining a Receiver to the Nose of the head, make a small fire under it, as the heat of the Sun in March, and no hotter; for there is yet some moisture of the Vinegar in the Oil, that it may be abstract∣ed, continue it in that heat, that
can perceive no moisture in the Head, then augment the fire a little, as the heat of the Sun at Midsummer, and if there be yet more moisture in it, you will per∣ceive it in the head, but if you perceive it not in 6 or 8 days, then take the head off, and lay the polish'd Glass again upon the mouth of your Glass, increase the fire, that you can scarce en∣dure your hand or finger in the Ashes an Ave-Mary while, conti∣nue the fire in that heat till the red Oil be all fixt with the Pow∣der in the Glass, which you may know thus; Take a little of the powder out of the Glass, lay it on a glowing Silver Plate, if the pow∣der melts as wax, and penetrates through the Plate as Oil doth through a dry Leather, and makes it Gold throughout, as far as
the powder went, then is the Stone finish'd, and if it do not this, you must then let it stand in that heat till it do so without fuming. Now, my Child, when the Stone is finish'd, take half of it out of the Glass, put it into a Glass melting-pot, and melt the powder gently, which should be done presently, for it melts as Wax; and being melted, poure it into the Mould of Box-wood as aforesaid, it will be a red stone, clear and transparent as Crystal, red as a Ruby, then make pro∣jection therewith, and set the o∣ther half again to multiply. Then take in Gods Name twenty parts of Saturn, which is prepared by Solution and Coa∣gulation, till it leave no more Faeces behind, as hath been said at the beginning. Dissolve these
twenty parts of Saturn, dissolve by it self in a Glass with distilled Vinegar; likewise dissolve the powder of your Stone alone by it self in a Glass with distilled Vinegar, and when both are dis∣solved into clear water, poure both the Solutions together into a great Glass, set it into a Bath, a head on, and a Receiver to it, distil the Vinegar from it in the boiling Bath, till the Matter be dry, then let it cool of it self, put it into a Glass, lay a polish'd Glass over the mouth of the Glass, and set it into a Furnace in a Cuple with sifted Ashes, make a fire under it like to the Suns heat in March, till the powder be perfect white, which is quick∣ly done. Then augment your fire from one degree to another, till the Matter become yellower and
yellower, to a perfect yellow; then increase it yet stronger, from one degree to another, till it be redder and redder, to a perfect redness; then poure your water upon the red powder with the red Oil, or with the water of Paradise, or with the clear sharp Vinegar, or call it how you will, doing in all points as hath been taught, till the red powder flux like Wax upon a Silver Plate, without fuming, penetrating it as Oil doth dry Leather, that it become good Gold within and without; then render thanks un∣to God, be obedient to him for his Gifts and Graces. You may again take one half out of the Glass, and make pro∣jection, setting the other half in again, as hath been taught, so may you work all your Life-time, for the poor, and perform other
duties to Gods Glory, and the Salvation of your Soul, as I have said before; enough to the wise. Projection upon Metal. Know, my Child, how and in what manner you must use this Stone, which makes projection upon Mercury, and all imperfect Metals and Bodies of Mars, Ju∣piter and Venus, whereof make Plates glowing hot, whereon straw the Stone, and lay Coals on for a season, that the Stoue may penetrate, but the Stones must be made quick with Gold, and Jupiter also, which is very labo∣rious, as is taught in the proje∣ction. But you must project up∣on Saturn or Luna, which need not be made quick, only flux them, and cast one part upon a thousand parts, it will be a Medicine, cast one part of these thousand parts upon ten
parts, it will be the best Gold that ever was seen on earth. It's Use in Physick. This Stone cures all Leprous people, Plague, and all Diseases which may reign upon Earth, or befal Mankind; this is the true Aurum potabile, and the true Quintessence which the Ancients sought; this is that thing where∣of the whole Troop of Philoso∣phers speak so wondrously, using all possible skill to conceal its Name and Operation, as afore∣said. Take of this Stone the quan∣tity of a Wheat-corn, lay it in a little good Wine in a small Glass, half full, or a quarter full, make the Wine warm, the Stone will melt like Butter, and the Wine will be red as Bloud, and very
sweet in your mouth as ever you tasted; for to speak compara∣tively, it is so sweet in taste that Honey and Sugar may be compa∣red as Gall to it; give this unto the Patient to drink, lay him in Bed, but lay not too many cloaths upon him, the Stone hastens forthwith to the heart, expelling thence all ill humors, thence di∣lating it self through all the Ar∣teries and Veins of the whole Bo∣dy, rousing up all humours, the party will sweat, for the Stone opens all the pores of the Body, and drives forth all humours thereby, so that the Patient will seem to have been in the Water, yet will this sweating not make him sicker, for the Stone expels only what is adverse to Nature, preserving what is consonant un∣to it in its being, therefore the Patient is not sicker or weaker;
but the more he sweats the stron∣ger and lustier will he be, the Veins will be lighter, and the Sweat continues till all evil Hu∣mours be driven out of the Bo∣dy, and then it ceases. The next day you shall take of it the quantity of a Wheat-corn, in warm Wine again, you will go to stool immediately, and that will not cease so long as you have any thing in your Body which is contrary to Nature, and the more Stools the Patient hath, the stronger and lighter at heart will he be; for the Stone drives no∣thing forth but what is adverse and prejudicial to Nature. The third day give the like quantity in warm Wine, as afore∣said; it will so fortifie the Veins and Heart, that the party will not think himself to be a Man, but rather a Spirit, all his Mem∣bers
will be so light and lively, & of the party will take the like quantity of a Wheat-Corn every day for the space of nine days, I tell you, his Body will be as spi∣ritual as if he had been nine days in the terrestrial Paradise, eating every day of the Fruit, making him fair, lusty, and young; there∣fore use this Stone weekly, the quantity of a Wheat-Corn with warm Wine, so shall you live in health unto the last hour of the time appointed for you by God. What say you, my Child, is not this the true Aurum potabile, and the true Quintessence, and the thing which we seek? It is a spiritual thing, a Gift which God bestows upon his Friends, therefore, my Child, do not un∣dertake this Divine Work, if you find your self in deadly Sins, or that your intent be otherwise
than to Gods Glory, and to per∣form those things which I taught you before. I tell you truly, you may see the Work, or begin it, but I am certain you shall never accom∣plish it, nor see the Stone, God will order it so, it will break, fall, or some one Disaster or other will happen, that you shall never see the Stone, or accomplish it. Therefore if you find your self otherwise, do not begin the work, for I know assuredly, you will lose your Labour; where∣fore deceive not your self. E∣nough to the wise. Its Use in External Diseases. My Child, there are some people who have external Di∣stempers on their Bodies, as Fi∣stulaes, Cancers, Wolf, or evil
Biles, or Holes, be they what or how they will, &c. give him the weight of one Wheat-Corn to drink in warm Wine two days, as is taught before, the whole body within and without shall be freed from all which is ad∣verse to Nature, and you shall deal with the open Sores thus; Take a Drachm of the Stone, seeth it in a pottle of Wine in a Glass, the space of two or three Pater-nosters, that the Stone may melt, the Wine will be as red as Bloud, therewith wash the Sores morning and evening, laying a thin Plate of Lead over, in a short time, as in ten or twelve days the Sores will be whole; and give him every day the quantity of a Wheat-Corn, in warm wine till he be well. If they be Fi∣stulaes or other concave Holes, that you cannot come at them,
to wash them, then take a Silver Syringe, and inject of that wine into them, it will heal him, as a∣foresaid. And if one had a pound of the rankest Poison in the world in his Body, and immediately drink a Drachme thereof in warm Wine, the poison shall forth∣with evacuate by siege, toge∣ther with all the evil Humors in his Body. My Child, here ends the most noble and precious Work which is in the Vegetable Book; on whomsoever God bestows this Stone, needs no other thing in this World, therefore keep it as close and well as you can, to Gods Glory, who grant that we may walk in his obedience, Amen. God is blessed in all his works. FINIS.
