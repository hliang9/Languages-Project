A WARNING TO ENGLAND With a Hand of True Pity and Compassion still held forth in the Love of God, to call you all to Repentance, that have not Repented of your Wick∣edness, and Horrible Provoking SINS, wherewith you have provoked the Lord, and kindled his Wrath more and more against you. Wherein is shewed the great Danger that you are in who hate te Light of Christ Jesus, and put his Day afar off from you. As also, Something is signified of the great Woes and heavy Judgments, that have been, and shortly will come upon the People of this Nation, that do not Repent, and turn to the Lord while they have time. And some Objections briefly Answered, to satisfie the true Seeker after the WAY of GOD. They would none of my Counsel, they despised all my Re∣proof; therefore shall they eat the Fruit of their own Way, and be filled with their own Devices: But whoso∣ever hearkeneth to me, shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of Evil, Prov. 1. 30, 31, 33. Printed in the Year 1679
A WARNING TO ENGLAND O England, England! THE Land wherein I was born, and love and pity above all the Kingdoms upon the Face of the Earth, because of the Lord's Appearances by his Light and Power in thee, above all other Lands in these last days: But most of you the Inhabitants of this Land have slighted and vilified God's Appear∣ance to you, and the pure and heavenly Manifestation of his Light & Power in and amongst you; wherefore Darkness is over you, and your Seers Eyes are closed through their Rebellion against the Light of the glo∣rious Gospel, which has shined both in their and your Hearts, to give you the Light of the Knowledge of God in the Face of Christ Jesus, and to open your blind Eyes, to recover your Sight, that ye might see your Evil Ways that ye have walked in, and those great Abominations that ye have committed in the
Land; for which Distress, Wo and Misery hath come upon the Inhabitans thereof; and doth more and more threaten you, if speedily and with all your hearts ye do not Repent, and turn to the Lord, who is Terrible to the Wicked, and whose Eyes are upon this and all other sinful Nations and Kingdoms of this World. And how are the People of England laden with In∣iquity? How have many of you let your Reins loose to all manner of Sins! What Cryes of Oppression and Cruelties have been heard, and are now heard in our Land, acted by them that profess Christ Jeus in words, and call themselves Christians! but there ne∣ver were any True Christians found in such Practices as many of you, the Inhabitants of this Nation, have been found in, notwithstanding the Favours and Goodness of God extended to you, beyond what other Nations have enjoyed. For, let me tell you▪ that have not yet repented, nor turned to the Lord. That had the Works and Mighty Wonders of God been done in some other Na∣tions, that have been done in thee, 'tis pssible they would have repented, and turned to the Lord with all their hearts before this. And because the Works and Wonders of the Lord have been abundantly more seen in thee, than in any other Nation, surely God hath required and doth require more from this. O Friends! its not the Renting of your Garments, but yur Hearts, that God requires; for ye have appeared something in shew of Religion, whilst your Hearts have been far from God. Truly, my Bowels are turn'd for You; I am full of Sorrow and Grief for my Country∣men, that have so abused the loving-kindness of a long-suffering God, who is slow to Wrath, neither shews he his
Wrath till his Mercy and Long-suffering be abused by a sinful Nation, or People laden with Iniquity, & guilty of manifold Transgressions. O! consider; is not this the state of many of you? have ye not followed a Multitude to do Evil, and the Wayes and Devices of your own Hearts? are ye not unsensible of the Day of God's tender Visitation to you wards, and of his pure Light that shines in your dark Hearts? And all you Evil doers every where, you hate the Light, and love Darkness rather than Light, that will be your Condemnation, That Christ Jesus is come a Light into the World; and if ever you come to be the Children of God and his Light▪ you must turn to his Light, wait and believe in it; for those that do not, remain in utter Darkness, not knowing whither they go, they are so uncertainly led by the Blind Guides of this World. This hath been and is certainly the State of many of you, the Inhabitants of England. How have ye been led by the blind Leaders of the Blind into the Ditch, and kept in the fall of old Adam▪ neither having seen or known what ye have been do∣ing, nor the By Pathes and Crooked Wayes you have walked in! and how hath every man of you walked in a Vain Shew, and disquieted your selves in vain, in getting the Worldly Riches, but cannot tell who must enjoy them after you, nor whether you may enjoy them while ye are here in the World! Therefore hear ye the Word of the Lord; O! hearken diligently that your Souls may live, and be saved in this Day of the Lord Jesus, who is come to seek and to save them that are lost, who is willing to bring and lead you all out of the Fall of Adam, which was by
Sin and Transgression; for he is the Saviour of the World, not coming to condemn the World, but that the World through him might believe and obtain Salvation. O People! look unto Him, and not to the Moun∣tains and Hills for Salvation, as long you have done, but all in vain; for, what Profit have ye had in look∣ing to Man, or the Mountains or Hills, when you were in Trouble and Distress? who could help or de∣liver, save the Lord Jehovah only? Now Friends, be awakened, ad truly consider, That your dayes are but short, till all must go, either into everlasting Joy and Happiness, or Wo and Misery. Now everlasting Joy and Happiness is prepared of God for the Righteous, but everlasting Wo and Misery for the Wicked; and they are wicked that do wickedly: And none of the Wicked shall understand the Works or Wonders of the Lord, which he hath done, and is doing; but the Wise shall understand; the Wise shall inherit Glory and Peace forever and ever; but the Fool, who saith in hi Heart (not with his Tongue, but in his Heart) There is no God, will to gain the World, and the Pleasures of Sin for a season, lose their own Souls; and what will this advantage any▪ if they could gain the whole World, and lose their own Souls? Truly a fool∣ish and miserable Bargain do all such make▪ even such as they can never be everlastingly Rich or happy by, al∣though they may be pleased with it for a season: These hings can never give true Content or Satisfa∣ction to the Soul, which is Immrtal, which is fed and nourished by that which is Immortal and Living, that comes from Heaven. So People, In the Name of the Eternal God I warn
and exhort you all to Arise, arise, and stand up from the Dead, and Dust of the Earth, and Graves of Sin and Iniquity, where you have lain long, and imagi∣ned an Everlasting Rest in; for this is not your Rest, it is poluted, and hath poluted you. O! come to Christ Jesus, who is that quickening Spirit, that is able to quicken you, and make you alive to God, and make you all Partakers of a true and living Hope and Faith to purge your Hearts and Consciences by, to purifie you, and make you Vessels of his Honour, who have been and are Vessels of Dishonour, in which state you are very unfit for the Lord's Use, how fit soever you have been and may be for the Devil's Use▪ as his Slaves and Vassels, and led captive by him at his Will, who hath taught you to say to your Souls, Take your Rest in that which is Poluted, and in your great stores of Goods, which some have gotten▪ and laid up for many years; not considering how shortly your Souls may be required of you, nor whose these things shall be then: for so hath the Devil, the Enemy of your Immortal Souls, besotted and benumbed many of you in this day, and kept you in Sin and Trespas∣ses, dead, unawakened to Righteousness, Everlast∣ing Life and Salvation. Verily I cannot but pity your sad state that you are in, and lament for you, and pray you in Christ's stead, to come out of it, to Him who desires not the Death of the Wicked, but rather that all such would turn from their Wicked∣ness, and live a Holy, Righteous and Godly Life in this present World. O ye People of England! how hath the Spirit of the Lord striven with you, and the Lord stretched forth
his Hand all the day long, notwithstanding your Re∣bellions, and your hardning of your Hearts against him? How hath the Lord waited to be good and gracious to this Land, and the Inhabitants thereof? How many Pledges of his Love and Favour towards it hath been given unto it, and scarce sooner given, but the Hearts of most people of this Nation have been lifted up within them, and the Lord hath been forgotten, who extended his Love and Favour uni∣versally, to leave all without excuse at his great Day of Judgment, when he will appear in Flames of Fire to render Vengeance against them that know him not▪ nor obey the Gospel, which was to be preached to every Creature▪ that all might believe in Christ Jesus, and know his Baptism, that saves, therewith to be baptized, who thereby washes the inside of Man and Woman, and not the outside only, as the Phari∣sees did the Cup and Platter. And let none talk of being saved and justified by Christ, who are not wa∣shed by him, and baptized by one Spirit into that Body whereof Christ Jesus is Head; for they that are not so baptized and washed, are not living Members of the Body of Christ, but Members of, and Plead¦ers for the Body of Death and Darkness, and to car∣ry that Body of Sin and Iniquity about with them till they come at their Graves, so are altogether kept uncapable of putting on the new Man, because they see not the Way how to put off the old Man with his Deeds▪ which certainly is the woful state of many of you▪ who are Inhabitants of this Nation of Eng∣land: What will it avail you to plead, that you be∣lieve in Christ Jesus, and are baptized into the true Chri∣stian
Faith, whilst you are not come to know a passing from Death to Life, and whilst your Hearts are evil, defiled with sin, and not purified? will not your Be∣lief be accounted of God and his Spirit for Unbelief, and your Faith a dead one, by which ye can never please Him, even God, or the Lord Jesus Christ, whom ye pretend to believe in, but are not come to witness him in you the Hope of Glory; you are to come to know him in you, to work in you by his mighty Power, else you are Reprobates: And if Christ be known in you, the Body of Sin you will come to leave and put off; then will ye put off the Old Man with his Deeds, and dye daily to Sin, which is the Devil's Work, and that Work Christ came and comes to destroy: He dyed not that people should continue in sin, and in the great Abuse of his Goodness and Kindness towards them, but that they might prize his Love, Goodness and Kindness towards Mankind in general, in coming to save them from sin, to finish Transgression, and to put an end to Sin, and bring in Everlasting Righ∣teousness, which hath been so shut ut of the Hearts of the Sons and Daughters of Men, and the whole World that lieth in Wickedness, thinking to cover themselves by a Righteousness, pretended Christ's Righteousness, imputed to them▪ and made to them in thir unrighteous and sinful state: Thus many cover themselves, and patch up a Righteousness and Justi∣fication which is not of God, nor will not stand them in any stead when God shall call them to an account, and come to judge the Secrets of their Hearts, whose pre Ee sees all the Unrighteousness of Men and Women, which is Sin, that renders people guilty of
Condemnation before God, notwithstanding all their fair Pretences of being righteous, and justified by a Righteousness imputed to them, whilst very Wicked and Unrighteous in the sight of God; and such that can discern between things that differ (even Good and Evil) dare not lean to or confide in such a Righteous∣ness, but account it as filthy Rags of Man's devising, and not of God, neither hereby are any made Righ∣teous in his sight. O! you Foolish and Unrighteous, Unsaved and Unsanctified, how dare ye presume to say, That Christ Jesus is made to you of God Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and Redemption? Must you not be Par∣takers of his heavenly and peaceable Wisdom, which is from above, before you can truly say so? And must ye not be Partakers of the Righteousness of Christ Jesus, and live Righteously in this World, before you can truly say, Christ Jesus is made to you Righteous∣ness? And is it not the greatest Deceit that is, and the Deceivableness of Unrighteousness to imagine you are what indeed you are not; for Drunkds, Lyars, Swearers, Fornicators, Unclean and Cove∣tous Persons, to say, Christ is made to them Wisdom, Righteousness, Sanctification and Redemption, who are foolish and disobedient, and far from the Righteous∣ness of God, who are as unholy as ever, and as much in the unredeemed state? What greater Presumpti∣on can there be for making void the Wisdom, Sancti∣fication and Redemption which is of God through Christ Jesus, then this? what greater Delusion can there be in the World then this? and what Multitudes of people settle here, looking upon themselves wise, righteous, sanctified and redeemed by Christ Jesus,
whilst nothing of this is experienc'd really and truly in them, or made unto them by Christ, in that foolish, un∣righteous, unholy, unredeemed State, which they by the Enemy of all Righteousness are kept in. So you, people, that are thus covering your selves herein, taking your ease in the Flesh, your Coverings are too short, they do not (nor cannot) hide you; for you are seen, your false Rests, wherein you have taken Ease, and leaned to, will prove all too short for you; for long you will not be able to stretch your selves thereon. Therefore come to Christ Jesus, who is the Rest of the People of God, and who will give you Rest, that are weary and sore burdened with your Sins▪ if you come to him, and learn of him, who is meek and low of Heart, you will certainly find, and not come short of that rest that remains for the People of God, which is certainly true and everlasting, into which the true Believers enter, and so come to cease to do evil, and learn to do well, coming to cease from their own Works, their own Righteousness, which formerly they were in, and rested upon. The true Believer in Christ Jesus ceaseth from Man, his Righteousness, his Teachings, and is taught of the Lord, what to do, and what to cease from; what to follow, and what to turn from: This is learned by coming to Christ Jesus, and learning of him, whom the Drun∣kards, Swearers, Lyars, Prophane, Covetous and Unclean Persons are not willing to come to, although there is no Life, but by Hm, no Salvation in any o∣ther, nor true Righteousness enjoyed by any other, which the true Blieves know, and are living Wit∣nesses of, Glory to the Lord God forever, through be∣lieving
in Christ Jesus, whom God hath sent, a Rem∣nant are come to lay down their Heads in that Rest in Christ Jesus, and Peace with God, that none can make them afraid; they are not afraid of what Man can do; their Hope and trust is not in Man, but in the Lord Jehovah; they know his Name, and there∣in trust, and thither flee for safety, when any Trou∣bles, Tryals or Sufferings come as an Exercise or Tryal upon them; so are not afraid of Evil Tidings, nor the Terrible Threats of the Wicked, being re∣solved to Trust in God, though they be Killed for their Trust and Confidence in him, or bearing their Te∣stimony for his Name's sake: But how can the Un∣circumcised in Heart and Ears (that always have been, and are Rebellious against the holy Spirit and Power of the Lord God) trust in th Name of the Lord, not having the Knowledge of it? such trust in Man, and put Confidence in Princes, vainly ex∣pecting Salvation out of your Troubles from the Mountains and Hills, but have not known Christ Je∣sus, the Rock of Ages. So how can such be built upon that Rock that is sure. Therefore the Gates of Hell have prevailed, and will yet more prevail a∣gainst you People of England▪ whose Faith hath not stood in God's Power: How have the Gates of Hell prevailed against you of all Sects & Professions! how have you given your Power to the Beast, and wor∣shipped the Beast, and cryed, Who is like unto the Beast, or able to make War with him? because your Battle∣ments were not the Lord's, but were by his Power to be taken away; for by the strength of Man it is in vain to encounter and make War with the Beast and False Prophet, while People are but in the strength
of Man they will be found adhearing to the Beast, worshipping of him, and receiving his Mark, either in their Foreheads or in their Hands, in some way, in some degree or other; and whosoever doth so, must assuredly drink of the Wine of the Wrath of God, and a dreadful Cup: truly its hard for me to utter what I see of Wrath, Wo and great Calamity that the Righteous and Just God will shortly bring upon such; he will not regard you, although you make many Prayers, they will be but to Him Abominati∣on: You that can worship the Beast, and have received his Mark on your Foreheads, or in your Hands, the Lord will find you out, the Lord will plague and punish you, and plead with you in his fierce Wrath, and now is he vexing of you in his Dis∣pleasure, although you are most apt to look at Men, as being the Cause of all your Dstress Disappoint∣ments and Troubles, that are come, or may come upon you. I do acknowledge, and verily am perswaded, that there have been & are many Evil Instruments at work, to hinder the Prosperity and Welfare of this poor Na∣tion; but search and find them out, and let them have Due Punishment, according to the Law of God, and righteous Laws of Men. Such as have Principles leading and binding them to Kill and Murder any, high or low, about Religion, because they are not of their Religion, nor their be∣ing in the World for their Interest; such that really are of such Hellish Principles and Practices, that lead them to thirst after Blood, and to bring Nations into Civil Wars, that are in Peace, delighting in War and
Bloodshed, I know the Hand of the Lord is and will be a∣gainst them, to scatter and confound them, and their wick∣ed Conspiracies he will bring to nought: be not afraid of them, nor what they can do; but O People of Eng∣land every where, fear the Lord, and work Righte∣ousness in your Day, you that yet have a Day; for ma∣ny have suffered God's Day to pass over them, not regard∣ing or taking notice of it. And all you that say, You have not the Spirit of the Lord, that the Holy Men of God, his Prophets and the Apostles of Christ Jesus received, walked in and worship∣ped God in it; how vain and unprofitable is your wor∣shipping of God! you that say, that None have that Spirit now, nor is to expect an Infallible Spirit to be led and guided by; but think you can serve and worship God aright by a Spirit which is fallible, in vain do you worship God, and all your Services are rejected of him; for you cannot offer to God (by a Fallible Spirit) that which is pure and holy, but the contra∣ry, that which is unclean and poluted, and with such Offerings and Services God is weary, and certainly doth not require them of you; for these are but the Offerings of the Deceiver, that hath a Male in his Flock, but offers that which is unclean; for God is a Sprit, and they that worship him must worship him in Spirit and Truth, which is holy, eternal and infallible; and you that have not this Spirit, are none of God's Chil∣dren, nor faithful Servants; you serve not the Lord Jesus Christ, whose Name you (it may be) often name and profess in words, but your own Bellies is the God of many of you, that call your selves Chri∣stians, and cry, Lord, Lord, and that you do many things
in his Name, and for the Honour of God, which are quite contrary, being done in your own Wills, and in a sensual earthly Spirit, which such a in and are led by to Evil, being so ignorant of what is Good, and what is Evil and Sin, that they think they do God good service, whilst they displease him in following the Imagina∣tions of their own Hearts; promising themselves, that it is well with them, and that no Evil shall come unto them; and so cry a false Peace and Rest to themselves, whilst Strangers to true Peace with God, and Rest in his Son Christ Jesus: And how many of you are there that would have Peace without Christ, the Way, Truth, and the Life, the Prince of Peace, while you rebel against him, and will not have him to rule and reign in your Hearts, whose Right it is to order, go∣vern, bear sway in and over every Man and Woman? Are not you his Enemies, though his pretended Friends, that refuse his Rule and Heavenly Govern∣ment to be set up in you? Why are ye not willing the Government should be upon his Shoulders, who is from Everlasting to Everlasting, King of Kings and Lord of Lords? Why are you against the raising up of this Righteous BRANCH, that he might reign and prosper, and execute Judgment and Justice? How can you expect true Justice and Judgment, till he come to take to him his great Power, to rule and reign in your Hearts? How are his Enemies scatter∣ed, but as he arises? So People, let not the Sun go down upon your Wrath, neither give place to the Rule and Govern∣ment of the Man of Sin and Son of Perdition in your Hearts, as formerly you have done, but wait dili∣gently
upon the Lord, who is able to cast out Satan, and chain him down from prevailing over you, by having a place, or reigning in you, as in times past. So all wait to feel the Finger of God at work in you, that ye may be sensible of the Kingdom of God to be come nigh unto you, and know that Kingdom set up in your Hearts, which stands in Righteousness, Peace and Joy in the Holy Ghost; wait to know the Antien of Dayes to sit, to whom shall be given Glory, Honour and Dominion, that all Nations and Kingdoms may serve and obey him, whose Kingdom and Dominion is Everlasting; First seek this Kingdom, and the Righteousness of it, and all other things will be aded: Its not a Talk of it will serve your turn, or your faint Wishes or Hopes, that God will receive you in∣to it at last (although you live in that in which the Devils Kingdom stands all your time you have to stay in the World.) But be diligent Seekers of the King∣dom of Heaven and the Way to it, that ye may find it, and have an Entrance administred into that King∣dom whilst it is called to day. But, O foolish People and unwise! how have ye set the World and the Glo∣ry of it before your Eyes, and neglected your Salva∣tion, the Kingdom of God and Power of his Son Je∣sus Christ! And how have the Pleasures of this World kept you from seeking after God, his King∣dom and Righteousness thereof, which first you should have eyed, minded and carefully sought! you have pleased your selves with the ad Way, although it will lead you to ute Destruction f Sol and Body; if ye come no out of it, into the Narrow Way, ye will certainly go to everlasting Destruction, and there will be no Remedy.
Friends and Countrymen, the Love of God con∣strained me thus to write unto you; I am troubled for you, and in a godly Sorrow for you; I know not a Man or Woman in the Land, or elsewhere, that I hate, although that which is Evil in any is to be ha∣ted, rejected and denyed, in Papist, Protestant, or whomsoever, and of what Nation soever: Sin is that which hinders peoples Acceptance with God, and keeps good things from them, and is a Shame to any Nation or People whatsoever; but Righteousness that Exalts, and is for the Honour of a Nation: God is no Respecter of Persons, but of every Nation he that fears God and works Righteousness is accepted of him. I can truly say, that I never loved the Principles nor Practices of the Papists, being certainly hurtful, and Inconsistent with the Peace and Quiet of the Land where they live, and under those Governments and Rule that are set over; I am for Good and Peaceable Principles, that induce people to live a Quiet and Peaceable Life; for those Principles are Hellish and Unchristian, that lead people to Stab, Murder and Massacree such as differ from them, because they can∣not forsake their own Religion, which they are per∣swaded is good, and embrace such a Religion as they know is not good, neither tending to the Honour of God, but to introduce Badness, with pernicious Ways and evil Contrivances, thereby to rob God of that Honour which is due to him alone. Now you that are not of those Bloody and Disturbing Princi∣ples, that occasion War and Bloodshedding to Nati∣ons and Kingdoms, where they can put in practice
their Wicked Devices, think not your selves happy or justified of God because of that barely, although as to that particular thing, or any other Evils, God will not hold them guilty that are clear and inno∣cent, though by men they may be deemed guilty, and the Guilty cleared: But except you repent from the bottom of your Hearts of your Sins, you may perish, notwithstanding you may be clear of those Princi∣ples and Evils before-mentioned, which are abhorr'd of God and all good men. But if you shall think your selves well and secure because you are not such great Sinners, as you suppose the Papists are, hereby then the Enemy of your Souls may get advantage against you, and make you conclude, that your State is good, when you are in the perishing State, even as they; although your Wickedness be not of such a scarlet Colour, yet there are many other great Evils and Abominations, enough to plunge your Souls into eternal Wo and Misery, if not repented of. There∣fore I say again to you, Repent of your Sins, be af∣flicted and humbled, let your Laughter be turned in∣to Mourning, and your Joy into Heaviness, and Weep bitterly; for who knows but God may turn away his Wrath that is kindled against you, and yet have Mercy on this poor Nation, and the Inhabitants there∣of, that you perish not: I dare say, and that in the Name of the Lord, Upon your true Repentance, humbling your selves before him, renting your Hearts, and turning to the Lord, that he will yet ex∣tend his Favour and loving-kindness unto you, and save this poor Nation from those Plagues, heavy Judg∣ments and great Desolations, that will certainly
come upon it, as a just Reward from God, due to a Wicked, Stiff-necked and Rebellious People, if you continue therein. What else can ye expect or look for, but the Viols of God's Wrath to be poured forth upon you more and more? O! be serious, moderate and sober-minded; fear God, and give Glory to him, for the Hour of his Judgments is come: Put away your Pride, that you have learned of the Prince and King of all the Chil∣dren of Pride; and put away your High and Luxu∣rious Living; for you have been wanton on the Earth, and you have nourished your Hearts as in a Day of Slaughter, many of you: How long hath the Just suffered by your Hard▪ heartedness! and there still remain great Oppressions and heavy Burdens upon the Innocent in this Land, whose Cause the Righ∣teous God will more and more plead against all, high or low, that have a hand therein. How have We the people of God called Quakers been bely'd and abused by all Sorts and Sects of People in this Nation, that have gone in Cain's Way! and what Unchristian Carriage and Behavi∣our from such have we met with, all along since God reached to us, and visited us with his Day spring from on high! What Mockings, Stockings, Stone∣ing, and Cruel Imprisonments, and Spoiling of Goods have we patiently endured, never desiring to render Evil for Evil! but we have endeavoured in the Name of the Lord, to overcome the Evil (which People have acted against us) with Good▪ knowing that to be the Will and Mind of our Lord and Savi∣our
Jesus Christ, by whom we have been taught to love our very Enemies, to do good to them that hated us without Cause, and to pray▪ for them that have de∣spightfully used and persecuted us, leaving the Recom∣pence of Vengeance to the Lord God, to whom it belongs, and who certainly will repay it upon the Heads of his Enemies, the Wicked of the Land: God hath not forgotten the Tryals of Cruel Mock∣ings, Bonds, Imprisonments, with other Cruel Sufferings and Losses, which the Righteous have met with, and sustained from a Wicked, Untoward and Hypocritical Generation in our Dayes; as his Ears have been open to our Cry, so oftentimes he hath appeared to help, succour and relieve us in our Afflictions and Sufferings. And we stedfastly believe, that he will arise, and shew himself a pre∣sent Help in all our future Tryals and Sufferings, although many have not regarded nor considered our Afflictions, but Wantonly▪ Slightly and Ma∣liciously have represented them, that's little to us, we know God will call them to an Account, and punish them for it, and reward every Man according to the Deeds done in the Body▪ whether they be Good or Evil, who is a Blessed Rewarder of all those that Diligently seek him although for seeking and waiting upon the Lord only, we have been, and some are at this day, by the Magistrates and Informers, recompensed with Prisons, great Fines and spoiling of Goods: But Glory to God forever, none of these things move the Faithful, or shake their Minds from their Obedience to the Lord, whom we must and ought to obey rather than Man, being things
appertaining to the keeping of our Consciences pure and good in the sight of God, to whom we chiefly owe our Obedience in matters Divine and Spiritual: And we have been led by the Lord, and made wil∣ling by his Power to give the Lord his due, and Caesar his due, notwithstanding the Cruel Laws that have been made and Executed to abridge us of that Liber∣ty, which the Righteous God allows in matters of Religion and Worship of Him, who clearly sees and knows the Ways, Doings and Counsels of Men, al∣though carried on with never so much Subtilty and Carnal Policy: they dig deep to hide their Counsel from him. Its in vain for any to hide their matters in Darkness from the Lord; for that which is spoken in Darkness shall be declared in the Light, and that which hath been done in Secret shall be published on the House tops; and Wo from the Lord God upon the Contrivers and Workers of Iniquity, that have contrived Wickedness against the Righteous, to root them out of the Earth, and could not rest nor be quiet till it was put in Executi∣on against those for whom it was intended; whoever they be, God will judge them, and ease him of such Adversaries to him, and Ill Wishers to his People's Welfare and Happiness: The Day comes, it hastens, that will discover such Vile and Wicked Ahitophels, to bring all their Wicked and Evil Counsels and Contrivances to nothing, and to bring Misery and Confusion of Face upon all that lean or bend to such Counsels and Contrivances: But the Counsel of the Lord, that shall stand, and be established in the Earth.
Therefore let none adhere, joyn to, or be one with the Counsel of the Wicked, which is unsafe, cor∣rupt and Abominable; People, learn to keep your Ear from it, and to avoid it, as that which is hurtful both to Soul and Body, and destructive to Princes and States, and all Civil Societies amongst men, as men; for Peoples following the Counsels of the Wicked, it makes them such as the Devil would have them, Vicious, Intemperate, Unchaste, Ungodly, and what not, that is Evil and Abominable in the sight of God. And now, how doth this poor Land abound in all manner of Ungodliness and Impieties, some scarce fit to be mention'd! which is even a Shame to the Land, and for which God will severely punish the Inhabitants thereof, that do not in their Day and Time repent of their Wicked Works and Abominable Pra∣ctices, which many declare as Sodom. How have you abounded in Pride, Wantonness, Fulness of Bread, in Whoredoms, Adulteries, and all manner of Unclean Words and Actions, for which the Righ∣teous. Holy and Just God is grieved and provoked to Wrath, who is Love, and hath stretched out his Hands of Love many times unto you, and hath said, Turn you, turn you; why will ye dye, and bring Ruinand De∣struction upon your selves? Now all the Checks, Re∣proofs and Judgments, which have come from God to you, were that you might turn to him that hath striven with you, smitten, checked, reproved and judged you, that you might turn to him, and know the Reproof of Instruction to be the Way of Life, that ye
might come to see and know the Way of Life, and walk therein. All you that have been and are High and Stout∣hearted against the Lord, Come down, come down, lie low, and abhor your selves in Dust and Ashes be∣fore the Lord; you are afar off from God and his Kingdom, and he beholds you as such, and resists you as such, and therefore doth the Lord with-hold his Grace and Good Things from you, which freely and plentifully he gives to them that wait low in his Fear to receive from him. Therefore take heed how you any more scoff and mock at waiting upon the Lord, which he requires of people; for the Lord is to be waited for and waited upon by all that seek him, or desire after him; and his Power is to be waited for, before it be received, or any can be strengthned and made strong in the Lord; for they that wait upon the Lord, shall renew their strength; but such as do not wait upon him for strength, speak and act in their Services and Worship of God in their own strength, by which they cannot do any thing well pleasing to God; and this is the state of many, even great mul∣titudes of people in this Nation, observing and fol∣lowing of that which doth not profit them at all, neither can they thereby bring forth Fruit unto God; but on the contrary, what Feastings without Fear, Revellings, Pipings, Dancing, Carding, Diceing, Playes to debauch Youth, Cursing, Swearing and Blaspheming the Name of the Lord hath got place, is practised, encouraged and brought forth by many in this Nation, that call themselves Christians, but are not, but rather are a Dishonour to that Name,
causing Reproaches to come upon it amongst the Heathen: How are they stumbled ad ffded to see them that pretend to be and are call'd Christians, worse in their Words and Actions then some Mahumitans and others, that do not confess to nor believe that Christ came and suffered for our Sins in the Body of his Flesh, nor that he was a Saviour, or could save or deliver any. How do you expect to convert them to the Chri∣stian Faith! Certainly never by Pride, Wantonness, feeding your selves without Fear, Whoredoms, A∣dulteries and unclean Actions, that cast a Stink all over the Land; for which if the Lord should bring Want and a FAMINE into the Land, and there∣by thin the People of it, who amongst you can say to the Lord, why dost thou send this Want and Scarcity a∣mongst us? Must we and our Families, that have been fed to the full, now want Bread and Outward Necessaries? Surely if you say so, then shall the Lord answer, and say unto you, Its because of your great Wickedness and Abominations, wherewith you have corrupted and defiled the Land; for which I will abase it, and bring down the High Looks and Stout Hearts of the Inhabitants thereof, from the Highest to the Lowest; and you shall know that I am the Lord▪ who at my Pleasure can plant and pluck up Nations and Kingdoms. Are you not sensible (People) that the Lord hath spared this Land and others long, in his Long-suffering and Goodness towards them? But he hath said, Now will I cry out▪ like a Travelling Woman, to devour at once▪ and to lay waste, and make Kingdoms desolate▪ to make them reel and stagger in my Fury. For that Nation and Kingdom that will not serve him, shall perish, and a Kingdom divided
against it self cannot stand, but is brought to Desola∣tion. So people, your standing and the Kingdom's is but slippery; there is but a small Remnant that know Christ Jesus their Rock and daily Refuge: Truly there are but few Righteous Lots in this Nati∣on, in comparison of the Multitudes of them that are like Sodomites; however, it will go well with them, when it shall go ill with all the Wicked & Un∣righteous. If God had not a few righteous Persons in this Nation, that have sighed and mourned for the Wickedness of it, doubtless it had been destroyed and utterly wasted before this time, its for their sakes this Nation hath been spared so long although the wicked Workers have not been willing▪ nor thought fit that such should have a being amongst them; forsuch have been as killed all the day long, & accounted as Sheep for the Slaughter, in Perils often, in Deaths often, often snared in Holes, and have been for a Prey to the De∣bauched and Ungodly of the Land, of whom the World is not worthy, though never so much slighted and hated of the World▪ its they that are a Happiness and Blessing to a Nation or Kingdom, and not the Prophane and Ungodly; such bring a Curse, Di∣stresses, Wo and Misery upon the Nations and King∣doms where they inhbit. Think of this all you that have any Desire towards God, or Good Will to your own Souls; hear and far the Lord, and answer when he calls unto you; O! reect not the Call of the Lord; for none ever did so and prospered: if you shall hear the Lord, and obey his Call, to come out of the Evil you have been in, to that which is good,
and continue in that, it will cause God to turn away his Wrath, and shew Mercy unto you. O the great Thunders, Earthquakes and Tempests that are come & coming upon this Nation & many others! What Noises of Armies, Wars and Rumours of Wars, Nation against Nation and Kingdom against Kingdom! What Desolation and Bloodshed hath there been to gra∣tifie the Wills and Ambitious Desires of High▪ mind∣ed Men, that matter not how much Blood be spilt, and Treasure spent, so their Ungodly Lusts be satis∣fied! yet for all this would be called Christians, and go under the Name of Christian-Magistrates. But God will pour out Contempt upon them, and hedge up their Way of Wickedness, and make them to wander in Desolation, which will come upon them, that have studied to make Nations desolate, and spoil them, that they might possess them as their own. How do Mens Hearts fail them for fear now at what threatens them, and the Nations that they inhabit in! and what Crosses and Disappointments happen al∣most to all Men and Women! And God knows whe∣ther what is past, or is now be any more then the be∣ginning of Sorrows. So in the Name of the Lord God I warn you all to be awakened to Righteousness, and Sin not, that ye may be hid in the Day of the Lord's fierce Wrath, which is near to break forth: for God hath a Rem∣nant of hidden Ones, that are hidden and kept safe, under the hollow of his Hand, out of which none can pluck them, and they shall never perish: O hap∣py People, and saved by the Lord, your Helper in the time of Need, Perils and Dangers! Cast out all
slavish Fear thorow the perfect Love of God, and all the Fears of Wicked Men; for the Rust shall eat them as a Canker, and the Wind shall drive them away like Stubble; they shall be sought for, and shall no be found; their Names shall rot, and not be record∣ed in the Lamb's Book of Life. So People, you may see the danger of being found Wicked men, when the Lord comes to make enqui∣ry into every mans state and condition, and none shall escape his all-seeing Eye, that is come to search mens Hearts, and to search Jerusalem with Candles; he will find out your Habitations of Darkness and Cru∣elty, where you thought to hide your selves from his Wrath; and the Candle of the Lord hath been light∣ted in you that are Wicked, but by your hiding it, as under a Bed or Bushel, it hath not given Light to your House, nor you have not come to see aright into the States and Conditions of your Hearts: Nay, by often Transgression against God, his Candle often is put out▪ which he lights at some time or other, in all mankind, to see with, and to leave wicked men without excuse by: this being a Talent of Gods Light, Grace and Spirit, that is given to every man to profit withal, and appears to all men for their good▪ and in order to their Salvation, and recovery from Sin, and from under the Power of Satan, which every man ought to mind, take heed to▪ be taught by, and walk answerably unto in their day; it is a Talent, not to be hid in the Earth, but diligently and well improved; its a Light not to be put under a Bed or Bushel, but set on a Candle-stick that it may give Light to the House that was in Darkness, and
them that sit in Darkness, and under the Region of the shadow of Death. So mind the Light, which God in love to your Souls hath bestowed upon you, that it may shine in your Hearts, to give you the Light of the Know∣ledge of God in the Face of Christ Jesus, whom with the Father to know is Life Eternal; and the Knowledge of God and Christ Jesus can never be come to other∣wise. Object. 1. But some may say, We believe in God the Father Almighty, that made Heaven and Earth, and in his Son Christ Jesus; and hope and dsire to know him as he is made known in the Scriptures, which we say is the Rule that we should walk by. Answ. Your bare saying you believe in God, with∣out a living evidence of it in your selves, proves no belief in him at all, nor that ye have Faith in his Son Christ Jesus, or Knowledge of either the Father or the Son, which many boast and talk much of. For how doth a true believing in God, and Faith in Christ Je∣sus, evidence or shew it self but by Works of Righte∣ousness wrought in God? how else is his Workman∣ship or the new Creature known or witnessed? You would shew a Faith without Works of Righteousness, which is a certain Evidence to such their Faith is a dead Faith, which will never purifie their Hearts, nor give them Victory over Sin, let them talk of belie∣ving in God and Christ Jesus as much as they will: But such as are in the living Faith that works by Love, they are ready and prepared of God, through this Faith to shew an evidence of it by Works wrought in
God, being his Workmanship, and Created in Christ Jesus thereunto; and you may Hope and Desire after the Knowledge of God all your dayes, and never come to the Knowledge of him, barely by the Letter of the Scriptures, without the help of Gods Spirit, though you read that all your dayes: Ye must learn to know God in his Light, and by his holy Spirit, that they received and knew God by, that gave forth the Scriptures, before you can come to know God, as the Holy men of God and Saints Recorded in the Scriptures did, otherwise ye know nothing as ye ought to know, but are out of the Knowledge of God and Christ, though ye have the Scriptures that declare thereof, and say, It is your Rule; I would to God ye were Reformed in Lives and Conversations, according to that true Declaration of the Mind and Will of God in the holy Scriptures; but your Words Lives and Conversations are so contrary thereunto, that it is a shame for you to say it is your Rule: I grant all the holy Scriptures were given forth by Divine Inspi∣ration, and is profitable for Doctrine, Instruction and In∣formation, and able to make the man of God Perfect, and Wise unto Salvation, through Faith in Christ Jesus, but not otherwise profitable, nor cannot give the Knowledge of God, witness the Multitudes that have them, who have not the Knowledge of God, not∣withstanding their often reading of them▪ seeking the Knowledge of God and Life in them, and calling them their Rule, which if they were ruled according to the Scriptures▪ they would be more tamed, and brought down into Subjection to God then they are, and would be better ruled in their Manners and Be∣haviour,
even sober and godly, as every one ought to be in this World; but whilst many profess the Scriptures to be their Rule, they err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the Spirit which they were in and moved by that wrote or gave forth the Scriptures; which is the great Cause of Peoples erring in Judgment, and going astray from the Wayes of God, being kept ever learning (by them that would have People alwayes paying of them) but not able to come to the Knowledge of God or the Truth, as it is in Jesus: The Hope of all such is but the Hypocrites, and their Desires but of a Sensual and Earthly Nature, that God will not re∣gard nor answer. Therefore, people, examine your selves, prove and try your selves by the Light and Spi∣rit of God, the most standing Rule to try your Hearts and Spirits by. Obj. 2. But we are Protestants, and against Popery, Popish Laws and Institutons, that are Repugnant to the Holy Scriptures, who force People to be of their Religion by Cruel Torments, Fire and Faggot; and are against Popish Masses. Answ. If you are True Protestants, and against that which is Bad in the Laws, Institutions and Govern∣ment of the Church of Rome, and against Popish Idolatry, and Superstition of that See, which I do acknowledge is Bad enough: Why do ye so much keep in their steps, as to Mass Days, pretended Hly Days, Feasts for Christ, and other Saints, who were more in Fasting than Feasting, who never requird any Dys or Feasts to be kept for them, that I read of in
the Scriptures, as hath been instituted, and the pra∣ctise thereof forced, by not only Papists but Prote∣stants; and such as call themselves Protestants have caufed Honest Sober People to Suffer, and reputed them as Papists, that could not so gratifie the Wills of Men, or Popish Institutions, as to keep Dayes of Feasting, as many of you Protestants do, therein be∣ing one with the Papists, as also in Mirth, Folly, Va∣nity, Excess of Rioting, Eating and Drinking; and you have been Angry with many Sober People, be∣cause they went not with you to the same Excess of Rioting, whereby more Dishonour to God and Christ Jesus hath come in a few Mass Days, than many days besides. I hope the Righteous God will manifest such that cannot keep those Days, nor go to that Excess of Riot with you that do, to be better Prote∣stants, although we Dissent from you and the Church of Rome therein, and in many other things, which ye follow, and are in practice of, which you have no express warrant for from the Scriptures, where-ever you have it: And the Papists, or any o∣thers, Forcing People to their Religion by Fire and Faggot, or other Cruel Torments, is Anti-christian and Abominable, it is a certain evidence, that their Religion is not Pure nor Undefiled before God, but stinks and is corrupted, and would Corrupt the Earth; for the Pure Religion, which is Uncorrupted and Un∣defiled before God, needs nothing but the Grace, Truth and Power of God, and Drawings with the Cords of God's Love into it, to Force or bring to be of it; not Whips, Prisons, Torments or Tortures, as the False Church and Mother of Harlots hath used to
bring People to be of their Religion and Church. Therefore, why have many that call themselves Pro∣testants, and to have renounced the Trash and Trum∣pery of Rome; but herein also have walked in their steps, and strengthened them in their using such Cruelties to Force to their Religion, which will ne∣ver conduce to make true Christians, but Deceitful Hypocries and Dissemblers, who are the worst of men, and the Woes of God are to: Will you Cry out against the Church of Rome, for the Force and Cruel∣ty, which they have used to bring People to their Re∣ligion? And will you use it to compell People to your VVay and VVorship? Ought you not first to cast this Beam out of your own Eyes, that more clearly you might see how to cast it out in others▪ and deal with Papists about forcing to their Religion VVay and VVorship? For what Force and Compulsion hath been used of late and former Years here in England a∣gainst such as indeed could not for Conscience sake conform to the Church of England in all their Princi∣ples and Practises, as sufficiently is known thorow the Nation, by the many Imprisonments▪ and Spoils of Non-conformists Goods, whilst such think them∣selves much better than the Papists, but walk too much in their steps. Obj. 3. But we have the Ordinances and Institutions of Christ, and receive the Sacraments in the best reformed manner; and we pray as Christ hath taught us▪ saying, Our Father which art in Heaven, Hollowed be thy Name, thy Kingdom come, &c.
Answ. If you were rightly sensible of God's Ordi∣nances and Commands in force to be practis'd by Chri∣stians in these Days of the Gospel, surely ye would be more Careful to keep them, and put them in practice than ye do: But how can you be said to keep the Or∣dinances of God▪ that refuse and resist his Power and Spirit, whilst you adore and dote upon outward Things, and Element; you have neglected the Weightier Matters, for paying a little Tythe, Mint and Anniss, having been busied more about the Outward Court Service, than that which is more Substantial. But retire within, and wait upon the Lord in stillness and submission to him, that he may make you worthy to eat and drink at his Table: To eat of that Living Bread that came down from Heaven, the Bread of God, which if a man eat, he shall live thereby; and to be made worthy to drink of that Wine, which he hath mingl'd which will never corrupt nor sowr, or lose its Vertue; otherwise your eating and drinking of that you call The Sacrament of the Lord's Supper, will be but your own Damnation. whilst you do not discern the Lord's Body, his Flesh, which is Meat indeed▪ and his Blood, which is Drink indeed: Not that I despise or vi∣lifie any thing that any were really reqired of God to do in remembrance of Christ Jesus, or a real shewing forth his Death in their time and season; but let a man Examin himself, or else he eats unworthily, not discer∣ning the Lords Body: And Christ Jesus said, Except ye eat my Flesh and drink my Blood you have no Life in you. And I may say unto you that have eaten outward Bred, and drunk outward Wine▪ What Life have you in you, or Salt to savour withal? Hath eating of that
Bread, and drinking of that Cup given you Life? Is it the Flesh of Christ, that is Meat indeed, and that Blood, which is drink indeed? then will the Life of Jesus be manifest in your Mortal Bodies, and you will discern the Lords Body, and be baptized into it, and be Members of it: And so come to the true Substance, which ends all Types, Figures and Shadows, and melts the Elements, which were insufficient to mini∣ster Life to the Souls of People, by reason of that In∣ability and Weakness that was in them. So come to him that giveth Life to the Soul, wait upon him diligently that he may make you worthy to discern his Body, and eat of that Bread that he gives the wor∣thy and prepared to eat, & whereby they live forever, that the Water of Life also you may drink of, and that it may be in you a Well of Life springing up in you to Everlasting Life, and then will you lrn of Christ Jesus, and be taught how to pray with the Spirit and Understanding also, to call God Father, to know where he is to hollow his Name, to receive his King∣dom, and no longer oppose or resist it; then will you do the Will of God on Earth, as it is done in Heaven, and have Living Bread daily in your own Houses to feed upon, beyond what is outward: And know forgiveness of Sin, and forgive them that Trespass against you, and feel the heavenly Deliverer near, that doth Deliver and set Free from all Sin & Evil. But when did Christ Jesus teach Wicked Men, that daily Dishonour his Name, to say, Our Father which art in Heaven; such who are not the Children of God? How is he their Father, as to any Spiritual relation? and how can they Hallow his Name? It is true, he
taught his Disciples and Followers so to pray, and that Prayer I own; but those words uttered by such as know not the Name of the Lord, nor learn of Christ Jesus how Unsavory and Unprofitable is it? Will not Christ Jesus say to such, what have ye to do to take my Name in your Mouthes, and to say, I have taught you that which I never taught you, nor required at your hands? for it is praying in the Spirit that that God who is a Spirit expects, and is only well-pleased with, and not using good words, that people may get into their Heads, which they have no true or heavenly Under∣standing of in their Hearts; for as Man believes in his Heart to Righteousness: So it is the Heart-Cryes, Brea∣thing and Prayer unto the Lord, that are accepted as Incense with him: the Prayer of Faith avails much with God; but the Prayers of the Wicked are Abomination to the Lord; although they fast and pray, God will not hear them, because they do it not in that holy Name and Spirit which gives the Saints Admission to God, and pure Acceptance with him, although but with Sighs and Groans that cannot be uttered▪ and that so the Lord may teach you all to pray, is the Desire of my Soul, that you may pray coninually, lifting up Holy Hands unto he Lord (without Wrath and Doubting, as commonly the Prayers of the Wic∣ked are) that so He that seeth in scre may reward you, and be not alwayes asking amiss, not receiving the things that you ask of God. Now my Friends and Country Men, I find Freedom in the Lord at present to cease writing any more to you; My Heart's Desire and Prayer to God is, To
open your Understandings, and give you an Eye to see, an Ear to hear Truth, and a Heart to Understand what is the acceptable Will of God, that at last you may come to Kiss the Son love and honour him, lest his Anger suddenly break forth against you, and the Lord cut you off in his Wrath, and you perish forever. Truly I cannot but lament for you, and am troubled for you day and night, having often been greatly bur∣dened with the exceeding great Wickedness of this Nation, in this Age we live in, for which God has begun to Waste it, and will crtainly make it Desolate, if it be not for the sakes of a few Righteous and Just Lots, that I know are in it. From the Lord God am I moved thus to Reprove and Warn you; whether you will Hear and Repent, or Forbear, as long you have done, the Lord will be clear of your Blood, it shall be upon your own Heads that Perish. Horslydown, the 14th of the 2d Moneth, 1679. From one that travails and labours for the Redemp∣tion of Mankind out of Death and Darkness, that they may be saved in this Day of the Lord Jesus, the Saviour of the World: JAMES PARKE. THE END.
