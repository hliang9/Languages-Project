And remembre the synnes done afore tyme shall neuer hurt you as to dampnacyon / yf they please you not now & that ye be sory for them. ¶Saynt Ierome sayth / yf one sholde take his sykenesse or his deth with grutchynge / it is a token yt he loueth not god suffycyently / all is ryghtwyse that we snffre. ¶De¦syre with saynt Austen of our lorde here to be cutte with trybulacyon & to be brenned with sekenesse & sorowe / so that ye may be saued herafter for euer. ¶Now meke your selfe & he sory that ye haue ben so vnkynde to please & to kepe his cōmaūdementes & presume not as of your self ony goodnesse / and saye with all mekenes thus. ¶Good lorde Ihesu Cryste I knowleche that I haue synned greuously / and by thy grace I wyll gladdely amende me yf I
sholde lyue / haue mercy now of me for thy bytter passyon. ¶Than aske hym thyse questyons folo∣wynge afore his deth. BE ye glad that ye shall deye in crysten byle∣ue. Lete hym answere / ye / knowe ye that ye haue not so wel lyued as ye sholde / ye / haue ye wyl to amende yf that ye sholde lyue / ye / byleue ye that Ihesu Cryste goddes sone of heuen was born of the blessyd virgyn Marye / ye / byleue ye also that Ihesu Cryste deyed vppon the crosse to bye mannes soule on good frydaye / ye / do ye thanke god therfore / ye / Byleue ye that ye may not be saued but by his pas¦syon & deth / ye / ¶As longe as the soule is in your body thanke god for his deth / and haue a sure trust by it & his passyon to be saued. And counseyll hym to saye yf that he may thyse folowynge wordes of grete vertue. I Put Crystis passyon betwix me & myn euyll werkes / and betwix me & his wrathe.

The thyrde is this. Gracyous lorde I haue good wyll to make an ho∣le confessyon of all my synnes / whan place & tyme cōuenyent may be had accordynge to thy cōmaūde∣ment{is} & al holy chirche. Thyse .iij. verytees or trew thes who so euer sayth with his herte vnfaynyngly in what place yt euer he be / he may be sure yt he is in the state of grace & saluacōn & yt he shall haue euer lastynge lyf though all he had done all the synnes of the worlde. And yf he decessed without ony other confessyon for lack of a preest as slepynge or sodey¦ne deth / he sholde be saue suffryng afore harde pay¦ne in purgatory / wherfore it is good coūseyl yt euery crysten man ones or twyes on ye daye erly or late or elles at lest on holy dayes examen his conscyence / & remembre yf yt he may with al his hert vnfaynyngly

of thy grete loue & passyon that thou had∣dest for man. ¶And yf it pleased the in the olde te∣stament with thyn angels nyght & daye to be assy∣stent & to here the prayers of thy seruantes in the temple / where was but flesshe & blood of vnresona¦ble beestes offred in sacrefyce / moche more we truste that thou wylt vysyte & be assystent to vs nyght & daye with thyn angels in this thy newe temple and chirche / where thyn owne body & very blood dayly is offred vp vnto thy fader of heuen / & therwith re∣ceyued accordynge to thy desyre & wyll of vs thy ser¦uaūtes though synners for our saluacyon & therto here the prayers of vs & other that entende to loue worshyp & thanke the in the best maner we can or may. ¶Now thenne blessyd lorde full of all mercy & pyte / that wyll that we calle vpon the & hath pro¦mysed to here the prayers of thy seruaūtes graūte now & at all tymes to vs and to all other of thy su∣perhabundant mercy & grace / that who so euer co∣me vnto this chirche or to ony other with deuocōn & praye in what caas that euer they be / prosperyte temptacyon / trouble / or aduersyte / that theyr pety∣cyon behouefull & necessary prayer may be herde / & that the pardone graūted to them may in her sou∣les & bodyes with all other thynges apperteynynge vnto them may take effect in euery parte gracyous¦ly. ¶And ouer this graūte vs of thy pyte / pease & accorde in thy chirche & realme / and to our foūders faders & moders / frendes / benefactours / and to all
crysten soules / forgeuenes of theyr synnes with re∣lesse of theyr paynes & Joye perpetual. And fynally we desyre of thy bounteuous goodnesse seasonable weder with fruytes & to exclude from vs pestylence hungre moreyne & sekenesse and all enemyes gho∣stly & bodely and therwith graunte vs of thy grace good lyf & endelesse blysse.
