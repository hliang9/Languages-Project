A SHORT CATE∣CHISME, SVMMARI∣LY COMPRIZING THE Principall points of Christian faith, somewhat corrected and aug∣mented by IAMES BALMFORD Mi∣nister. Prou. 24. 27. Prepare thy worke without, and make ready thy things in the field, and after build thine house. blazon or coat of arms AT LONDON, Imprinted by Felix Kyngston, for RICHARD BOYLE. 1607.
TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFVLL, THE Ma∣ster, Wardens, Assistants, and whole company of Carpenters in Lon∣don, IAMES BALMFORD, a Car∣penters sonne, and a builder, according to his calling and gifts, wisheth the continuall edification of their godly faith while they trauaile in this vale of teares, and at the last the end of that faith euen the saluation of their Soules. THis litle Catechisme hath been long in Print, but not yet dedicated vnto any. Being now to reprint it with o∣ther litle treatises, I haue thought it conuenient to dedicate it vn∣to you, as a monument of my thankefulnes for your many fa∣uours, but especially for your
charitable exhibition, when I was a poore student in Oxford; Hoping that this dedication wil not only incourage you to con∣tinue, and increase (as God shall inable) your Christian chari∣tie to Students of good hope in either Vniuersitie (than which I know not a more charitable, and fruitfull worke of faith) but also stirre you vp both to reade the Catechisme diligently your selues, & carefully to cause your families to learne it. For it is commonly seene; that (howso∣euer too many be newfangled, yet for the most part) men are rather moued with those Treati∣ses, which are expressely & spe∣cially addressed vnto thēselues, and that by such as, in some spe∣ciall sort, belong vnto them. This only I desire, that ye would take some paines in examining the
quotations, because they giue both light vnto the vnderstan∣ding, and warrant to the confir∣mation of the seuerall points of this Catechisme. I doubt not of your good wil; but whereas this Catechisme is likely to come into the hands of some, who will not, with you, in∣tertaine it fauourablie for my sake, I suppose this obiection: One generall, and well concei∣ued Catechisme doth most edi∣fie; therefore many are but to litle purpose: Whereunto I rea∣dily and freely answere; That, hauing experience how profita∣bly the studies of children haue been furthered, since diuersitie of Grammars hath been aboli∣shed, and one certaine Grammar generally to be taught, by act of Parliament established, I grant that one generall and well con∣ceiued
Catechisme doth most edifie, in respect of publike vse: But I am assured, that, as sundry Grammars, so sundry Cate∣chismes doe much good in pri∣uate studie, and vse. For the same method of teaching which see∣meth to some plausible & plea∣sant, plaine and profitable, doth not seeme so to other; And one Catechisme doth more cleerely lay opē some points of Christiā faith, than another, yea handleth some necessary point, which an∣other doth altogether omit. A∣gaine, It helpeth much to the confirmation of faith, when it is seene, that, howsoeuer sundry men in sundry ages & countries, publish sundry Catechismes, or make sundry confessions (be∣tweene which two there is no great difference) as to say with Iohn Baptist, Behold the Lambe ofJoh. 1. 29.
God which taketh away the sins of the world; or with Peter, Thou art the Christ the Sonne of the liuing God, the one publishing his office, the other confessing his nature; yet they hold the same Head, belieue in the same Christ, iustifie the same Wisedome, and professe the same Truth. What great profit do Gods children reape by the Harmony of cōfessions, as of Chur∣ches, so of ancient and late wri∣ters? What benefit hath, and doth redound to the Church of God by sundry Creeds, not only extant, but some of them in pub∣lique vse too, as the Apostolique, Nicene, and Athanasian, euery one doth know, and acknow∣ledge. In these considerations I conceiue hope, that this litle Ca∣techisme will bee offensiue to none, but acceptable to you, and profitable to all such, as with re∣ligious
humilitie will vse, & per∣use it. And the rather, because they shall find the most necessa∣ry doctrine of the Lords Supper more plainely set downe in this Catechisme, than in many other of no greater volume. Well, what good opinion so∣euer this Catechisme shall find in the hearts of other Readers, let me exhort you as a brother, to edifie your selues, with all ho∣ly diligence, especially in hea∣ring the Word preached, and (as you may) in reading first the Scriptures, and then other Godly Treatises; Vnderstanding that Edification, so much commēded and commanded in Holy Writ, doth signify Building. Of which spirituall building, your tempo∣rall building should daylie put you in mind; Lest otherwise yee incurre a censure and sentence,
like to that of the Prophet Hag∣gai,Hag. 1. 4. 6. 1. Cor. 3. 9. 16. viz. Can yee build houses for your selues, and other; and will yee carelessely suffer the Temple of the Lord (which is your selues) to lie waste? Yee shall therefore earne wa∣ges, and put them into a broken bag. But hoping (as I wish) that yee will more and more apply your hearts vnto wisedome, euen that wisedome which is vnto saluati∣on, I commend you to God, and the Word of his grace, which is able to build further, and to giue you an inheri∣tance among all thē which are sancti∣fied.

What is Faith? A. Hebr. 10. 22. 11. 1. 1. Tim. 1. 15. 16. A full perswasion that God is merciful to me for his Son Christ his sake. Q. If a true faith bee such a per∣swasion,
who then bee partakers of those foure meritorious workes of Christ? A. True faith is alwaies such in it owne nature, but beleeuers are not alwaies sensible of so great a comfort, because of their infirmities. Q. May I craue some proofe here∣of for my confirmation, & comfort? A. Consider well, 1. The quo∣ted proofes of the description of Faith. 2. That otherwise it should not differ, either frō Opinion Luke 24. 21. 25. Act. 26. 28. 29. which in it owne nature is doubtfull, or from the Diuels faith Iam. 2. 19. which trem∣bleth, because it doth not apply. 3. That the Godly Psal. 27. 13. & 77. 9. 10. Make 9. 24. 2. Cor. 12. 7. 8. 9 haue acknow∣ledged as much. 4. What power 1. Pet. 5. 5. 6. 7. Faith is of to preserue true belee∣uers from despaire, their great feares notwithstanding. And 5. That it is therefore Rom. 8. 15. 16. 26. 27. Matth. 14. 30. 31. like vnto the Spirit of Prayer, which the faithfull distressed feele weake in themselues, but find strong in the effect. Q. How may we know when we haue a true faith? A. When wee know that our
faith t is grounded on Gods Word;Rom. 10. 14. 17. Philip. 4. 4. 5. 1. Pet. 1. 6. 8. Reioyceth in the Lord more or lesse; but alwaies vnseignedly, not∣withstanding crosses and tribulati∣ons; and Mat. 7. 18. 20. Galat. 5. 6. Iam. 2. 18. In loue bringeth forth good fruits, which are good workes. Q. What callest thou good workes? A. Mat. 19. 16. 17. Those which God requireth in the ten Commandements. Q. What if good workes be wan∣ting? A. Iam. 2. 20. 21. 26. Titus 1. 16. Then is instifying faith wanting whatsoeuer we professe. Q. Can good workes iustifie? A. Iob. 29. Iam. 2. 18. They iustifie in declaring vs to be iust before men, Rom. 3. 27. 28. & 4. 2. 5. 6 but they do not iustifie in making vs iust be∣fore God. Q. Why so? A. Gal. 3. 10. & 5. 3. 4. 17. Hebr. 12. 13. Because they are not per∣fectly done of vs. Q. To what purpose serue they then? A. Matth. 5. 16. To glorifie. God, 1. Pet. 2. 12. and pro∣fit our brethren. Q. Touching our selues what vse haue they?
A. 1. Tim. 1. 5. Iam. 2. 22. They are certaine signes of vnfained aith▪ Rom. 2. 6. 7. and of GOD are well rewarded. Q. If good workes be rewarded, then they merite, if they merite, then they iustifie? A. Rom. 8. 17. 18 They are rewarded for Christ his sake, Hebr. 10. 36. 2. Cor. 1. 20. and because of Gods promise, Luk. 17. 7. 8. &c. but not for their owne worthines Q. How are Faith & good works begun in vs? A Rom. 10. 14. 17. By preaching of Gods word, and working 1. Cor. 12 3 4 2. Cor 4. 13. of his holy Spirit. Q. How are they increased▪ and continued in vs? A. Eph. 4. 1. &c. 2. Cor. 3. 18. By the same meanes, and further by the vse of the Rom. 4 11. Sacra∣ments and Marke 9. 24. prayer. Q. What are the Sacraments? A. Rom. 4. 11. Holy signes and seales of Matth. 26. 26. &c. 1. Cor. 12. 13. Iesus Christ▪ and his benefits. Q. How many Sacraments bee there? A. 1. Cor. 10. 2. 3 & 12. 13. Two: Baptisme, and the Supper of the Lord. Q Why be there two Sacraments and no more?
A. Hebr. 9. 15. Because the maker and Me∣diator of the new Rom 11. 27. Couenant Matth. 28. 9. 1 Cor. 11. 23. 25 or∣dained these and no more, Marke 1. 4. as seales of the same. Q. What difference is there be∣tweene these two? A. Baptisme signifieth our new Titus 3. 5. birth, or entring 1. Cor. 12. 13. into the Co∣uenant: and therefore we are but once baptised. Q. How doth the Supper of the Lord otherwise signifie? A. Our spirituall féeding or con∣tinuance in the Couenant, and ther∣fore Act. 2. 42. 46. & 20. 7. 1. Cor. 11. 24. 26 we receiue often, and not on∣ly once at Easter, which is Leuit. 23. 6. Ie∣wish. Q. Why are children baptized? A. 1. Cor. 7. 14. Because they be the séed of the faithfull, and therefore Gen. 17. 7. within the visible Couenant, so that the seale thereof is to be Act. 10. 44. 47. Gen. 17. 11. 12. administred vnto them. Q. Why receiue they not the Sup∣per of the Lord? A. 1. Cor. 11. 28. Because they cannot exa∣mine themselues. Q. Of how many things doth a
Sacrament consist? A. Two: a signe perceiued Mark. 1. 4. . 1. Cor. 11. 23. & 10. 25. 2. 3. 4 by sense, and a thing signified, not at all perceiued by sense. Q. In Baptisme which is the signe, which is the thing signified? A. Act. 8. 36. Water the signe: Christ his blood Eph. 5. 25. 26. Hebr. 9. 14. the thing signified. Q. Whath doth the washing of the body signifie and seale vnto vs? A. Act. 22. 16. Rom. 5. 9. & 3. 24. 25. The washing away of our sinnes by the blood of Christ, which is our Iustification. Q. What doth it else signifie and seale vnto vs? A. Rom. 6. 3. 5. 1. Cor. 6. 11. The reforming of our acti∣ons and affections in the name of Christ, Gal. 3. 27. 24. Ephes. 4. 23. which is our Sanctification. Q. In the Supper of the Lord, which is the signe, which the thing signified? A. 1. Cor. 11. 23. 24. 25. Bread and wine the signe, Christ his body and blood the thing signified. Q. What signifieth the breaking of the bread, and powring of the wine? A. 1. Cor. 11. 24. The breaking of his body
and Marke 14. 24 shedding of his blood. Q. What doth the eating and drinking signifie and seale vnto vs? A. Psal. 104. 15. That as bread and wine pre∣serueth our naturall life: so Iohn 6. 54. Christ his body and blood is our spirituall food vnto eternall life. Q. How so? A. Because Christ is our conti∣nuall 1. Iohn 1. 7. 9. Iustification and Rom. 8. 10. 11. Sanctifi∣cation. Q. Why callest thou the body and blood of Christ spirituall food? A. 1. Cor. 10. 3. 4. Ioh. 6. 35. 63. Ephes. 3. 17. Because it is spiritually re∣ceiued by faith, not corporally eaten with teeth. Q. Are not the body and blood of Christ called spirituall food, be∣cause the substance of bread & wine is transubstantiated into the substāce of Christ his very body and blood, though only the accidents of bread and wine remaine and be seene? A. No: For such a Transubstan∣tiation, is most contrary to this spi∣rituall banquet, for thrée reasons. Q. Which be they? A. If there be such a Transub∣stantiation,
then this Sacrament should want the outward signe. For the accidents; without the substance of bread and wine cannot nourish, and therefore there is no signe per∣ceiued by sense, to signifie spirituall feeding, not perceiued by sense. Q. What is your second reason? A. This Trausubstantiation be∣ing a miracle, should bee euidently séene (as was Joh. 2. 8. 9. 10. 11. the transubstantia∣tion of water into wine at the mari∣age in Cana) for confirmation of the word, especially in a Sacrament. Seeing both Marke 16. 20 miracles, and Rom. 4. 11. Sa∣craments be called Signes, in regard of such confirmation. Q. What is your third reason? A. By such Transubstantiation, the supposed spirituall food, should be a body and blood presently made of bread and wine, and not the body and blood of Christ crucified, and long since Galat. 4. 4. made of a woman, which this spirituall banquet doth signifie, and seale vnto faithfull re∣ceiuers. Q. If there be no such Transub∣stantiation,
how then can wee eate Christ his very body, and drinke his very blood, which are bodily sub∣stances Act. 3. 21. abiding in heauen, and that only by faith spiritually? A. As they who acknowledge his Maiestie to bee their only soue∣raigne, and do accordingly submit themselues vnto his gouernment, become members of the same poli∣tique body, whereof his very person is head: So they Ioh. 1. 12. & 6. 35. 37. Act. 4. 12. Ephes. 4. 13. 15. who by faith pro∣fesse Christ to be their only Saui∣our, and do accordingly committe themselues to his saluation, become members of the same mysticall body whereof his very person is the head. Q. You speake now of the whole person, & incorporation; but before of the body and blood of Christ, and feeding. A. As 1. Cor. 12. 13. Ephes. 5. 23. Ioh. 15. 1. 4. Incorporation, and other borrowed speeches of Holy writ, so & 6. 56. 1. Cor. 10. 16. Feeding signifieth our spirituall cō∣munion with Christ, yet with some further consideration. Q. What is that? A. To teach vs that we are in∣corporated
into Ioh. 12. 32. 33 Rom. 6. 3. Christ crucified. As wee are fedde with the flesh of beasts not liuing, Act. 10 13. but slaine. Q. Is not this the reason why both bread and wine be necessarily distributed in the Lords Supper? A. Yes: and further, 1. Cor. 11. 3. 24. 25. Matth 19 6. because of the institution: 1. Cor. 11. 26. for a liuely re∣presentation of Christ his death: Joh. 19. 32. 33. 34. differing from the thieues death: Leuit. 7. 2. and answering to the sacrifices: Psal. 104. 1. Ioh 6. 35. 54. 55. and for the comfortable assurance of our perfect nourishment. Q. Is not then our perfect nourish∣ment another consideration of our spirituall feeding, besides our incor∣poration into Christ? A. Yes: for Io 6. 57. if we eate Christ, we shall liue by Christ, and & 4. 49. 51. 52. that (as it were) with health, & 15. 4. 5. which is the effect of such incorporation. Q Expresse this yet more fully. A. As he who corporally feedeth with good digestion, feeleth his heart Act. 14. 17. 1. King. 19. 7. 8 gladded, and the whole man better inabled to performe the actions of naturall life: So be who spiritually féedeth by a true faith, feeleth Rom. 5. 1. 2. the
peace of consciente, and Galat. 2. 20. John 6. 57. the whole man better inabled to performe the actions of a spirituall life. Q. Then I perceiue that the Scrip∣ture vseth borrowed speeches in re∣gard only of Eating and Drinking, and not of Christ his body & blood; because our communion▪ though re∣ally and verily with Christ himselfe crucified, is yet by the spirituall meane of a true faith. A. It is so; As may be euidently séne in the 6. chapter of Iohn so of∣ten quoted. For whereas in the 54. verse Christ saith, Whosoeuer easeth my flesh, and drinketh my blood hath eter∣nall life; in the 35 verse he saith, He that commeth to me shall not hunger, and he that beleeueth in me shall neuer thirst. So that Feding▪ Comming, and Beleeuing are manifestly▪ th case, all on, And consequently our recei∣uing of Christ crucified must of ne∣cessity be spirituall. As it further ap∣peareth in the 12. verse of the first chapter of the same booke. Q. All that come to the Lords table, do they spiritually receiue the
body and blood of Christ? A. No: The wicked receiue on∣ly uke 1. 26. 27. & 22. 14. the signes▪ to their damnation, not Iohn 13. 2. & 6. 35. the things signified to their saluation. Q. Why so?2. Thess 3. 2. A. Mt 8. 11. 12. 1 Cor. 11. 27. Because they receiue vn∣worthily. Q. How may we receiue worthi∣lie? A. By comming to the Lords ta∣ble with Iohn 6. 35. Faith and 1. Cor. 11. 30. 3 Repentance. Q. What is repentance? A. A forsaking Ezec. 33. 11. of our sinnes and turning Jerem▪ 4▪ 1▪ 2. to God, by Matth. 4. 17. amend∣ment of life. Q. Can we beleeue and repent of our selues? A. Philip. 1. 29. Ezec. 11. 19. No: And therfore we must craue Marke 9. 24. Jeem. 31. 18. these and all other graces of God by hartie prayer. Q. What is prayer? A. Luke 18. 1. &c. An earnest request to God, in y• name Iohn 14. 13. of Christ for all things Iam. 4. 3. necessary. Q. How may we be sure to ob∣taine all things necessary? A Mar. 9▪ 22. 33 If we aske in faith: Matth. 21. 2▪ For
so God hath promised. To whom b glory for euer. Amen. A PRAYER. O Most mercifull and gracious Father, whereas we are not a∣ble of our selues to perceiue the things of the Spirit, 1. Cor. 2. 14. being na∣turall men, yea so foolish Ierem. 4. 22. and of no vnderstanding, that howsoeuer, we are wise to do euill, to do well we haue no knowledge, we most hum∣bly beseech thee for Christ his sake to remember thy Ier. 31. 33. Couenant, and teach vs by thy Ioh. 16. 13. holy Spirit, which searcheth all things, 1. Cor. 2. 10. 12. yea the deepe things of God, to know those things which thou hast giuen vs. Suffer vs not therefore, O Lord, with the 1. Ioh. 5. 19. 20. world to lie in wickednes, but giue vs a mind to know thy Sonne Iesus Christ, who is very God and eternall life. And open our Luke 24. 45. vnderstanding, that we Iohn 5. 39. searching may vnderstand the Scriptures, which are able to 2. Tim. 3. 14. 15. make vs wise vnto saluation. And
whereas sinne Hebr. 12. 1. 2 hangeth so fast on, that we cannot run the race that is set before vs, with an eye still looking to Iesus the Author and finisher of our faith, with groning spirits we intreate thee, to separate them from vs, as far as the East is Psal. 103. 12. from the West, that hauing laid a sure foundation Hebr. 6. 1. of re∣pentance from dead works and faith towards God, we may be led forward to perfection, and hauing learned the doctrine of the beginning of Christ, we may grow Eph. 4. 15. 13 vp into him which is our head, vntill we meete together in the vnitie of faith, and knowledge of the Son of God vnto a perfect man, and vnto the measure of the age of the fulnes of Christ. That so growing in 2. Pet. 3. 17. 18 grace and knowledge of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, we be not plucked away with the error of the wicked, and fall from our owne stedfastnes: but hauing the righteous∣nesRom. 1. 16. 17. of God reuealed to vs from faith to faith, we may perceiue indeed, the Gospel to be to vs the power of God to saluation, and so go from strengthPsal. 84. 7. to strength, till we appeare before
God in Zion. Which graces, with all other blessings spirituall and tempo∣rall, for our selues and euery member of thy Church, we beg of thee O holy Father in the name and mediation of our Lord and Sauiour Christ Iesus, further recommending our selues, our prayers and wants to thy fatherly consideration, concluding in that most holy prayer which our Mai∣ster himselfe hath taught vs, saying: Our Father which art in heauen, &c. FINIS.
