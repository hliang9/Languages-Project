Now, forasmuch as it appears, by an Act lately to Us presented, that a Consi∣derable Sum hath already been expended upon the said Work, and that the same is very well advanced; lest after so great an Expence, there should be any obstruction in so good a Work, We were Graciously pleas'd to give Our Royal Assent to a Bill in Parliament, for the term of Thir∣teen years, to Commence from the Twenty ninth day of Septemb. 87. by an Impo∣sition upon Coals: And do further hereby give and grant unto you the said Henry Lord Bishop of London, and to the Bishop of that See for the time being, and to you the present Dean and others Residentiaries of Our said Cathedral Church, and to

to the said Act, shall be paid to such Per∣son or Persons as by any six or more of you Our said Commissioners (whereof the Lord Bishop of London, or the Dean of St. Pauls for the time being, to be one) shall be from time to time chosen and ap∣pointed to Receive the same, and to give Acquittances and Discharges for it to such Person or Persons as shall pay it as afore∣said. And for the further easing and defray∣ing of so vast an Expence as this Work shall require, and in order to the better Recovery, and preservation of whatso∣ever hath or shall be given, or intended to be given, purchased or provided for that purpose, being very desirous that a true and perfect discovery may be made, as well of all such Legacies, Bequests, Gifts both of Lands and Sums of Money, or other Profits, as have been at any time hereafter, or hereafter shall be given, sub∣scribed, or intended for the Rebuilding, Maintaining, Repairing or Adorning of the said Church; as also of all Materi∣als, Instruments or Utensils at any time purchased or prepar'd for that Work, but Fraudulently and Sacrilegiously conceal'd,
detain'd, or converted to private use and advantage: We do by these Presents, give and grant unto you, or any six or more of you (whereof the Lord Bishop of London, or the Dean of St. Pauls for the time being, to be one) full Power and Authority, as well by the Oath of Ho∣nest and Lawful Men, as by the Exami∣nation of Witnesses upon their Oaths (which said Oaths both to Jurors and Witnesses, you or any six or more of you, as aforesaid, are hereby Authorised to Administer) or without Oath, and by all other Ways and Means whatsoever, from time to time to inquire and examine as well of and concerning all and every Sum and Sums of Money, or other Gifts whatsoever, which heretofore have, or hereafter shall be given, bequeathed, sub∣scribed, advanced, raised, collected or re∣ceived for or towards the Reparation or Rebuilding of the said Cathedral Church, or for Beautifying or Adorning thereof, or for providing of any Instruments, Uten∣sils or Ornaments for the same, and touching the Payment and Imployment thereof, and what remains yet unpaid or unaccounted for, and in whose Hands; as
also of and concerning all and every the Materials and Utensils at any time provided for the Repairing or Re∣building of the said Church, or any belonging to the same, or of the parti∣cular value thereof, and how, and by whom the same, or any part thereof, hath been taken away, disposed, con∣veyed and employ'd otherwise then to the use intended; and to send for and Convene, and Cause to come before you all such Farmers, Tenants, Trustees, Treasurers, Receivers, Accountants, Clerks, and other Officers and Mini∣sters, Parties and Witnesses whatso∣ever, which are any way concern'd, or can give Testimony touching the Premisses, and which you shall think necessary to call before you, and to Examine them severally upon their Oaths, and to Cause all and every Per∣son and Persons whom you shall think good from time to time, to bring and shew before you, either upon Oath or without Oath, all and singular such Books and Records, Registers, Sur∣veys, Accounts, Evidences, and other

And forasmuch as the Letters Pa∣tents granted in the Life time of Our said most Dear and Royal Brother, to Our said Commissioners, for procuring of Contributions and Subscriptions within Our Kingdom of England and
Dominion of Wales, have not brought in such Sums as was reasonably expe∣cted, for want of pursuing the Me∣thods and Directions in the said Letters Patents mentioned; and as We are Cre∣dibly inform'd, there hath been no Re∣turns made from a considerable number of Parishes, of Moneys therein Col∣lected by virtue of the said Letters Pa∣tents, for Rebuilding of the said Ca∣thedral: And to the intent so great Neglects for the time to come may be amended, and that all Moneys already given, may be truly paid in, We are Graciously pleas'd, and do hereby strictly Charge and Command all Our Clergy, and all other Persons exerci∣sing Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction within Our said Kingdom of England and Dominion of Wales, that they take especial Care to certifie under their Hands what Sum and Sums of Money have been collected and paid, and to whom: And We do hereby Require and Command all Sheriffs, Justices of of the Peace, Constables, Bayliffs, and all other Our Officers, Ministers, and
Loving Subjects whatsoever, upon any Warrant or Precept to be issued from you, Our said Commissioners, or any six or more of you, as aforesaid, to Return Jurors, serve Orders and Sum∣mons, and be aiding and assisting in all things tending to the effectual Executi∣on of the said Commission: And We do hereby Authorise you, or any six or more of you, as aforesaid, to demand and call for, and Order to be paid into the Hands of the Receiver or Receivers so appointed as aforesaid, all such Sum and Sums of Money as by the Means and Methods, and in any of the Cases aforesaid, now are, or hereafter shall be found to be remaining in the Hands of, or due and payable by, or Charge∣able upon any Person or Persons what∣soever, with Damages for the same; or such Compositions either of Principal or Damages as you shall think fit to be made therein; and in default of pay∣ment, to inform Us and Our Council of such Person, or Persons so found to be Indebted, which shall in Contempt of this Our Commission, refuse to pay
the said Debts. And out of such Mo∣ney as shall be so discovered, recovered, and received, to allow fitting and pro∣portionable Salaries, Gratuities and Rewards to such Clerks, Messengers, and others who shall any ways advance the said Service, or be imploy'd in dis∣covery or getting in the said Moneys. And lastly, Our Pleasure is, That this Commission shall continue in force; And, We do hereby Authorise you Our said Commissioners, or any six or more of you (whereof the Lord Bi∣shop of London, or the Dean of St. Pauls for the time being, to be one) to proceed in the Execution thereof, and of all and every the Matters and Things therein contained from time to time, as often as you or any six or more of you (whereof the said Bishop, or the said Dean for the time being, to be always one) shall think convenient, although the said Commission be not continued from time to time by Ad∣journment. And for doing of all this, and for using and exercising all and e∣very the Powers above herein granted,
or mentioned to be granted, in such manner as is above directed, these Pre∣sents shall be unto you, and unto every of you, and to all other Persons Em∣ploy'd therein, a sufficient Warrant and Discharge. In Witness whereof, We have caused these Our Letters to be made Patents. Witness Our Self at Westminster, the Twenty second day of January, in the First year of Our Reign.
