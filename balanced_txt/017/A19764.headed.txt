A new Northeren Iigge, called, Daintie come thou to me. VVIlt thou forsake mee thus, and leaue me in misery? And I gaue my hand to thee, onely with thee to die: Cast no care to thy heart, from thee I will not flee, Let them all say what they will, Dainty come thou to me. UUere my state good or ill, rich, or in misery, Yet would I loue thee still, prooue me and thou shalt see. Cast no care, &c. UUere you rich, were you poore, were you in miserie, I will beg from doore to doore, all for to maintaine thee: Cast no care, &c. UUere I Lord, were I Knight, came I of high degree, All my Lands should be thine, try me and thou shalt see▪ Cast no care, &c. If the Indie Gold were mine, and all the wealth of Spaine All that it should be thine, prooue me yet once againe: Cast no care, &c. Thy beauty doth excell, aboue all I loue thee, UUith thee I meane to dwell, try me and thou shalt see: Cast no care, &c. I promise for th sake, all other to forake, And onely thee to take, trye mee nd thou shalt see▪ Cast no care, &c. Let me thy loue obtaine, or else I am but slaine, Reuiue me once againe, sweet I desire thee. Cast no care, &c. If Friends doe frowne and fret, and Parents angry be, And Brothers griefe is great, yet I loue none but thee. Cast no care, &c. Heres my hand and my heart, faith and troth vnto thee, From thee I will not start, try mee and thou shalt see. Cast no care, &c. Thus my Friends I forsake, with thee my life to spend, Refusing no paines to take, vntill my life doth end: Cast no care, &c. Farewell my trusty Loue, true as the Turtle-doue. I will as constant proue, till we two meet againe. Cast no care, &c. Finis. Printed by the Assignes of Thomas Symcocke,
