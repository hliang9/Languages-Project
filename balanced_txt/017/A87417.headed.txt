JOYFULL NEWES, OF The KINGS most certain Resolution and purpose to come toward LONDON with His Army, that he may at a neere distance send some Propositions to the Parliament, to comply with them, and settle a much desi∣red peace in this Kingdome. Which is to be embraced by all well-affected persons, hoping that His Royall approach will prove very happy and prosperous to the City. ENGLAND hath long mourned in the shade of sorrow and discontent, the resplendent beams of Royall influence procee∣ding from the Kings Majesty, having shined most brightly in the Northerne,
and now in the Westerne parts of this Kingdome, but hath been totally ecclip∣sed from appearing in the Southerne Horizon, so that the City hath beene darkened and obscured with much dis∣content during the Kings absence. But now the Kings Majesty having so long withdrawne himselfe, being led about to divers places of this Kingdome by the advice and instigation of the malig∣nant Party, and being now with his Army resident at Worcester, by what meanes it is not knowne, unlesse some divine power hath wrought a transmu∣tation and alteration in his thoughts, to give him a full resolution & determina∣tion to advance with his Forces South∣ward: for upon Sunday in the morning my Lord Generall had notice that many of his Majesties army were coming to Bridgnorth, intending to goe forward to Coventry, or Warwick; whereupon my Lord Generall immediatly dispatcht an expresse Message to Warwicke, Co∣ventry
and Northampton, advising them to prepare for their defence, and advance with some considerable powers against the enemy, himselfe promising all the help he could spare. So that my Lord had certaine intelligence of the Kings purpose to carry his forces and all his Army into the Southerne parts, and to advance forward from one Towne to another in a warlike manner untill he had brought all his Army neere unto the city of London, that so at so neare a di∣stance from the Parliament, hee might propound some articles of accommoda∣tion and agreement unto both Houses, and so comply with them, to the setling of a firme peace throughout the whole land, upon such articles of reconcile∣ment as should bee drawne up by his Majesty, and sent out of the Campe unto the high and honourable Court of Parliament, or if matters should not succeed according to his desires, and that these endeavors should not succeed,
and that the great differences which gave the first being and originall to dis∣contents, feares and jealousies betweene His Majesty and the honourable and high Court of Parliament cannot bee composed in a most happy pacification and peaceable accommodation, to the prosperity and generall content of the whole Kingdome, His Majesty doth conceive that the approach of his Army neere to the City of London, and his owne Royall Person being so neere to the Parliament, will bee a meanes to quench the flames of civill discord, and to give a happy conclusion unto all mat∣ters in a desired peace: but if the Dove sent forth with the Olive branch in her mouth, shall not be received into the ci∣ty, and that the consideration of the great plenty, peace and happinesse that shall ensue, cannot perswade a generall reconcilement, and make this populous city open the gates of their hearts to re∣ceive the offer of peace, whose accesse
and coming should be welcome to all understanding people, to all true subjects and well-affected persons, as no doubt but it is generally desired: but if this ci∣ty should be so unmercifull unto them∣selves, as to resist the Kings peaceable in∣tents and purpose, concurring with his Parliament, His Majesty might be indu∣ced to inforce his desires, (if his Majesty would be so cruell to his own subjects) which misery heaven avert from this flourishing city, that it may never know the miserabla effects of warre, but that the Kings purpose of advancing hither may prove happy and prosperous to this famous city. There are 340. souldiers come out of Herefordshire to his Excellency for the service of the King and Parliament, and that the city of Hereford had sent to his Excellency, signifying their good affecti∣on to the Parliament, and their desire to have that city secured against the Cava∣liers, which they much feared would
come, there being a malignant party in the city, those that were well-affected, durst not shew their forwardnesse so much as they would, whereupon his Excellency sent one thousand foot, and foure troupes of horse to disarme the malignants, and to settle that City in a good posture of defence, and likewise ordered that a sufficient garrison should be left there for the safety and peace of those parts. FINIS.
