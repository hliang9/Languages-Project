QVERELA SIVE, DIALOGVS Animae & Corporis Damnati. Quem aiunt S. Bernardum ex nocturna Visione composuisse. Ex vetusto Codice discripta. Per GVLIEL. CRASH. LONDINI, Ex Officina Georgij Eld, sump∣tibus Leonardi Becket. 1622.
INTERLOQVVNTVR. Auctor. Anima separata. Corpus exanime. Daemones. AVCTOR. NOctis sub silentio, tempore brumali Deditus quodammodo somno spiritali: Corpus carens video spiritu vitali. De quo mihi visto fit sub forma tali. 2. Cum dormirem paululum vigilando fessus
Ecce quidam spiritus nouiter egressus De praedicto corpore, vitijs oppressus, Corporis, cum gemitu plangebat excessus. 3. Iuxta corpus anima stetit & plorauit, Et eam cum gemitu sic interrogauit: O caro miserrima! quis te sic prostrauit? Quam munus tam prospere pridie ditauit. 4. Nonne mundus pridie tibi subdebatur? Nonne te prouincia tota verebatur? Ʋbi nunc familia quae te sequebatur? Cauda illa florida iam nunc amputatur. 5. Non es nunc in turribus de petris quadratis,
Sed nec in Palatiis magnae largitatis, Nunc delata feretro Paruae quantitatis, Iaces nunc in tumulo Breuiore satis. 6. Quid tibi Palatia, prosunt vel quid aedes? Vix nunc tuus tumulus bene capit pedes, Quēquam falso iudicans a modo non lades, Per te data nobis est in inferno sedes. 7. Ego inquam anima nobilis creata, Ad similitudinem Domini formata. Donis & virtutibus multis decorata, At ab illa Anima quantum (heu) mutata. 8. O caro miserrima, mecum es damnata
Si scires supplicia nobis praeparata Vere, velis dicere heu quid fui nata, Ʋtinam ad tumulum de ventre translata. 9. Nec est mirum fateor, quia dum vixisti, Quicquam benefacere me non permisisti; Sed semper ad scelera pessima traxisti, Ʋnde semper crimus in dolore tristi. 10. In poenis acerrimis sum & semper ero, Nulla lingua seculi dicerent pro vero, Vnam poenam misera quam infoelix fero, Sed quod magis dole veniam non sper. 11. Ʋbi nunc sunt praedia qua tu congregasti,
Ʋel celsa palatia turres quas fundasti, Et nummorum copia quam tu plus amasti, Gemmae per quas annulis, digitos ornasti. 12. Vbi lecti strati sunt tam miri decoris: Ʋestis mutatoria varii coloris. Species aromatum placidi saporis, Ʋasa, mensa, gausapa niuei candoris. 13. Vbi modo volucres vel caro ferina, Ʋel murenanobiles, vel electa vina? Non vitulis nec redolent coquina. Talis peccatoribus imminet ruina. 14. Tua domus qualiter tibi modo placet
Eius nonne summitas super nasum iacet? Iam clauduntur oculi lingua tua tacet: Nihil tibi superest quod iam lucro vacet. 15. Quicquā dudum misero congregasti me, Dolo, fraude, foenore, metu, vel rigore: Longeua per tempora magno cum labore, A te totum rapiunt mors, humus, humore, 16. Non modo circumdaris amicorum choris, Cum per mortem cecidit flos tui decoris: Rapiter cuiuslibet vinculum amoris. Tuae iam tristitia cessauit vxoris. 17. In tuis parentibus Amodo non speres,
Quia sibi remanent Terrae, Bacchus, Ceres, Et thesauri copia pro qua poenas feres: Mortem tuam breuiter plangit tuus Haeres. 18. Non credo quod Mulier tua, siue nati Darent quinque iugera Terrae siue prati. Vt nos qui de medio sumus iam sublati, A poenis redimerent, quas debemus pati. 19. Iam scis caro misera, quàm sit male tuta, Mundi nequum gloria, fallax & versuta: Repleta doloribus, vitijs polluta, Et veneno daemonum nequetur imbuta: 20. Pretiosis vestibus non es nunc induta,
Tuum valet pallium, vix duo minuta, Paruo linteamine iaces inuoluta, Tibi modo pauperes non ferent tributa. 21. Et licet non sentias nunc tormenta dura, Scias quod supplicijs non es caritura, Nam testantur omnia, Scriptur arum iura, Quod tormenta post-modum mecum es passura. 22. Te qui pater pauperum non eras sed proedo, Iam rodunt in tumulo vermes & putredo: Sed vltra tecum nequeo stare, iam recedo: Nescis ad opposita respondere credo.
Respondet Corpus. 23. TAndem postquam Anima, talia dixisset, Sese corpus erigens quasi reuixisset, Postquam vero gemitus multos emisisset Quaerit quisnam talia loquutus fuisset. 24. Es tu, inquit, spiritus meus qui sic faris? Non sunt vera penitus cuncta quae causaris: Iam probabo plenius, argumentis claris, Quod si quaedam vera sint, in multis nugaris. 25, Fecite (confiteor) in multis errare, Et à bonis actibus Sepè declinare. Sed si caro faciat animam errare,
Plus est culpa spiritus, audi tamen quare. 26 Mundus & daemonium foedus pepigere, Et carnem miserrimam secum coniunxere, Quam si rigor animi cessit coercere, In peccati foueam cadunt ambo verè. 27 Sed vt mihi dixeras Deus te creauit, Et bonum & nobilem, sensu te ditauit, Et ad suam speciem pariter formauit, Ʋt ancilla fierem tibi me donauit. 28 Ergo si tu domina creata fuisti, Et dabatur ratio per quam debuisti Nos in mundo regere: cur mihi fauisti
In rebus illicitis & non restitisti? 29 Num carnem vt animā iustum est culpari, Quaese, cum sit domina, sinit ancillari? Nam caro per spiritum debet edomari, Fame, siti, verbere, si vult dominari. 30 Caro sine spiritu nihil operatur: Eius adminiculo viuens vegetatur. Caro quae per spiritum non suppeditatur, Per mundi blanditias mox infatuatur. 31 Caro quae corrumpitur, perse malum nescit, Carni sine spiritu nihil innotescit. Si quod iubes exequor culpa tibi crescit.
Caro sine spiritu, mortua quiescit. 32 Si voluntas spiritus in opus ducatur, Per carnem pedissequam caro quid culpatur? Culpa tangit animam, per quam imperatur, Id quod caro fragilis viuens operatur. 33 Carne quidem grauius tu peccasti crede, Carnis sequens libitum, fragilis & foedae. Sed rodunt mea viscera vermes in hac ade Iam non loquor amplius anima cecede. Replicat Anima. 34. AD haec dixit Anima, tecum volo stare, Et tua si potero dicta refroenare
Ʋt quid mihi loqueris corpus tam amare. Ʋolens mihi penitus culpam imputare. 35 O caro miserrimae, qua vineus fuisti Stulta, vana, friuola, à quo didicisti Ʋerba tam asperrima, qua iam protulisti? Licet in aliquibus recte respondisti. 36 Istud enim consonum scio veritati, Restitisse debui tuae voluntati: Sed tua fragilitas prona voluptati, Nugis mundi dedita, noluit hoc pati. 37 Quando to volebam, ô caro, castigare, Verbere, vigiliis, vel fame domare,
Mox te mundi vanitas coepit effraenare, Et illius friuolis coegit vacare. 38 Et ita dominium de me suscepisti, Perditrix domestica de mo sic fuisti. Per mundi blanditias me post te traxisti, In peccati puteum tandem me misisti. 39 Scio me culpabilem, nam in hoc erraui, Quod cum essem domina non te refranaui. Sed tu me deceperas fraude tam suaui, Quare tu deliqueras culpa magis graui. 40 Si mundi delitias dolos machinantis Despexisses fatui sed & incantantis,
Daemonis astutias, è coelo tonantis Adhaesisses monitis, essemus cum sanctis. 41. Sed tamen tripudijs mundi fraus arrifit Ac vitam diutinam firmiter promisit: Quod mori non putabas, sed mors haec emisit Quando de palatio ad tumbam to misit. 42. Hominum fallacium mundus habet morem, Quod magis amplectitur, quibus dat honorem, Illos fallit citius per necis rigorem, Et dat post diuitias vermes & foetorem. 43. Qui tibi, dum vixeras, amici fuere, Iacentem in tumulo olunt te videre.
Corpus hoc intelligens coepit quasi flere, Et verbis humilibus ita respondere. Respondet Corpus. 44. QVi vinendo potui multis imperare, Aurum, gemmas, praedia, nummos congregare, Castella construere, Gentes iudicare, Putasne quod credidi tumulum hunc intrare? 45 Optimè nunc video, & est mihi clarum, Quòd nec auri Dominus, nec diuitiarum: Honor, vis, scientia, virtus nec herbarum. Mortis possunt fugere stimulum amarum. 46 Ambo quidem possumus▪ à Christo culpari.
Et culpamur, fateor, sed non culpa pari, Tibi culpa grauior debet imputari: Multis rationibus potest hoc probari: 47. A sensato quolibet hoc non ignoratur, Iura clamant, ratio pariter testatur, Ʋt cui plus prae cateris, virtutum donatur, Ab eoplus vit{que} tandem exigatur. 48. Ʋitam & memoriam sed & intellectum, Tibi dedit Dominus, sensum{que} perfectum, Quibus tu compescere debebas affectum Pranum, & diligere id quod erat rectum. 49. Postquam tot virtutibus ornata fuisti,
Et tu mihi fatua pronam te dedisti, Meisque blanditijs minus restitisti, Satis liquet omnibus, quod plus deliquisti. 50 Addo: licèt refero, corde cum amaro, Quod mihi iam patens est argumento claro Exeunte spiritu, agitue quid caro? Mouet ne se posteà vel cito, vel raro? 51 Ʋidet ne, vel loquitur, hoc est ergo clarum: Spiritus vinificat, caro prodest parum. Si haberet Anima Deum suum charum, Nunquám caro vinceret vires animarum. 52 Si Deum dum vixeras, amasses perfectè,
Et si causas pauperum indicasses rectè, Nec prauorum hominum adhaefisses secta, Nec me mundi vanitas concepisset, nec te. 53. Qua viuebam spendidè sericis amicta, Ecce quae de omnibus sunt mihi relicta, Putredo cum vermibus, & haec domus stricta, Quibus post delitias mundi sum amicta. 54. Et scio praetereà quod sum surrectura, In die nouissimo, tecum{que} passura Poenas mortis perpetes: heu morsilla dura Mors interminabilis, fine caritura.
Anima fatetur. 55. AD haec clamat anima, voce cum obscura, Heu si nunquam fuissem in rerum natura, Cur permisit Dominus, vt sim creatura, Cum praescita fuerim esse peritura? 56 O foelix conditio peccorum brutorum, Cadunt cum corporibus spiritus eorum Nec post mortem subeunt loca tormentorum. Talis esset vtinam finis impiorum. Interrogat Corpus. 57. COrp{us} post haec loquitur Animae tam tristi: Si tu apud inferos Anima fuisti,
Dic mihi, te deprecor, quid ibi vidisti? Si qua spes sit miseris de dulcore Christi. 58 Quid ibi nobilibus paratur personis, Qui priùs, dum vixerant sedebant in thronis? Si sit illis aliqua spes redemptionis, Pro nummis, pro praediis, cateris{que} donis, Anima respondet. 59. COrpus, tua quaestio caret ratione, Cum infernum subeunt damnatae personae, Non est spes vlterius de redemptione, Nec pro eleëmosynis, vel oratione. 60 Si tota fidelium pietas oraret,
Si totam pecuniam mundus suam daret, Si tota religio ieiunijs vacaret, In inferno positum nunquam liberaret. 61 Non daret diabolus ferus & effraenis, Ʋnam vinctam animam in suis catenis Pro centenis millibus praedijs terrenis, Nec quando{que} fineret vt careret poenis. 62 Ad hoc quod interrogat quid ibi paratur Personis nobilibus: hoc pro lege datur, Quanto quis in seculo magis exaltatur, Tanto cadit grauius si transgrediatur. 63 Dines ergo moriens si impius, damnatur:
Grauibus prae caeteris poenis implicatur: Nam quanto delicijs plus delectabatur, Tanto poena grauior sibi deputatur. Auctor in visione. 64 POstquam tales Anima prompserat moerores, Ecce duo daemones pice nigriores, Quos penna describere non possunt scriptores, Nec mundi depingere, totius pictores. 65 Ferreos in manibus stimulos gestantes, Ignem{que} sulphureum per os emittentes, Similes ligonibus sunt eorum dentes. Ʋisi sunt ex naribus prodire serpentes.
66 Aures erant patulae sanie fluentes, Et erant in frontibus cornua gerentes. Per extrema cornuum venenum fundentes, Digitorum vngulae vt aprorum dentes. 67 Isti cum funiculis animam coeperunt, Quam secum ad inferos gementem traxerunt. Mox maligni spiritus passim occurrerunt, Qui vice tripudij dentibus striderunt. 68 Et ei cum talibus votis applauserunt, Quidam cum corrigis ipsam perstrinxerunt, Quidam vncis ferreis ipsam disruperunt: Quidam plumbum feruidū in eam fuderunt.
Daemones. 69. ADhaec dicunt daemones quasi fatigati, Ii qui nobis seruiunt, sic sunt honorati. Possis modo dicere sicut bufo crati, Sed debes in centuplum duriora pati. Anima exclamat. 70 POst haec tandem anima gemens suspirauit, Et voce qua poterat, parum murmurauit: Quando vero baratri limen subintrauit, Iiulans sonauit IESV fili Dauid.
Daemones respondent. 71. COnclamantes daemones responderunt ei: Tardè nimis inuocas nomen tui Dei. Parum prodest amodò miserere mei. Non est vltra veniae spes non requiei. 72 Non lumen de caetero videbis dici, Decor iam mutabitur tuae faciei. Nostrae sociaberis dehinc aciei. Erit apud inferos hoc solamen ei. Auctor concludit. 73 TAlia dum videram dormiens expaui, Et extra me positus statim vigilaui,
Mox expansis manibus ad Deum clamaui, Orans vt me protegat à poenatam graui. 74 Et mundū cum friuolis suis condemnaui. Aurum, gemmas, pradia, nihil reputaui. Rebus transitorijs abrenunciaui, Et me Christi manibus totum commendaui. 75 Ecce mundus moritur, vitio sepultus, Ordo rerum vertitur sapiens fit stultus, Exulat iustitia, cessat Christicultus. Et in mundo iugiter labor & tumultus. 76 Mundus ad interitùm pergit his diebus. Dij facti sunt iterum Iupiter & Phoebus.
Nam qui mundum possidet & abundat rebus, Hic vt Deus collitur sceptris, aciebus. 77 Et quae theologicae virtutes vocantur, Fides, spes, & charitas, ferè suffocantur. Fraus, & auaritia, & quae deriuantur Ex his, iam in seculo toto dominantur. 78 Si sis ortu nobilis, si vultu serenus, Si benignus, humilis, moribus{que} plenus, Haec nil tibi proderunt, si tu sis egenus. Sola nam pecunia formam dat & genus. 79 Dūmodo sim splendidis vestibus ornatus, Et multa familia sim circumuallatus,
Prudens sim & sapiens, & morigeratus, Ego tuus nepos sum, tu meus cognatus. 80 Ista cum deficrint statim euanescit: Nostra consanguinitas morte refrigescit, Cessat{que} notitia, ita quod me nescit Qui dum diues fueram surgens mihi cessit. 81 O miranda vanitas! ô diuitiarum Amor lamentabilis! ô virus amarum! Cur tot viros inficis faciendo carum Hoc quod tranfit cit quam flamma stuparum? 82 Si mundus diuitibus tria posset dare: Iuuentutem floridam & mortem vitare,
Pulchram & durabilem prolem procreare, Benè possent diuites nummos congregare. 83. Homo miser cogita, mors ista compescit. Quis est ab initio qui morti non cessit? Hic si viuit hodie, cras forte putrescit. Cuique prorsus hominum parcere iam nescit. 84. Quando genus hominum morti deputatur: Quò post mortem transeat quisquam, ignoratur. Ʋnde quidem sapiens ita de se fatur: Contremisco iugiter, dum mens meditatur,
Quid sum, & quò propero, quid mihi paratur. 85 De morte dum cogito, contristor & ploro, Ʋnum est, quòd moriar, & tempus ignoro: Tertium, quòd nescio quorum iungar choro. Sed, vt suis valeam iungi Deum oro. FINIS.
THE COMPLAINT OR DIALOGVE, BETVVIXT The Soule and the Bodie of a damned man. Each laying the fault vpon the other. Supposed to be written by S. BER∣NARD from a nightly vision of his; and now published out of an an∣cient Manuscript Copie. By WILLIAM CRASHAW. LONDON, Printed by G. E. for Leonard Becket, and are to be sold at his shop in the Temple neere the Church. 1622.
To the VVorshipful, my worthy beloued friends, Hugh Hare, Richard Brown∣low, George Crok, and Iohn Walter Esquires, Benchers of the honourable society of the inner TEMPLE. Mercy, Grace, and Peace. THe end, and highest hap∣pinesse of a Christian man, is to honour God in this life, and to dye well: the way to die well is to liue well; and no better prouocation to good life, nor prepa∣ratiue to a good death, then a continuall and serious meditation of the mortality of this life, the certainty of our end, the vncertainty when and how, the terriblenesse of the last iudgement, and the account that each one must make then, who haue not made it here before, & crossed the debt-book of their sins
by the Lambe of God. This made an ancient Father crye out: When I thinke of that day, I feare and tremble, for whether I eate or drinke, or what euer I doe, I thinke I heare that terri∣ble Trumpet sounding in mine eares: Arise yee dead and come to iudgement. And to this end, the holy men of elder times willingly en∣tertained all occasions that might helpe them in these holy cogitations. One euidence thereof is this short and sweet Dialogue, which (as a fore-runner of others that may follow) being diuulged, and desired by many to bee englished, I am therefore induced to make it common: This being an age that needs all helps to ho∣linesse, and inticements to deuotion: And this the rather in as much, as though it was made in the mist of Popery, euen not long after the Diuell was let loose; yet is it not tainted with Popish corruption, nor scarce smels of any superstition, whereas it is stuft with godly truthes, and wholsome instructi∣ons. My thoughts intended and dedicated it to your selues, and that worthy, vertuous, and religious Gentleman, now with God, (the brother to one of you in nature, and to you all in faithfull Christian loue.) But see∣ing he needs it not, God hauing prouided better things for him and his soule now feeding on finer foode in Gods glorious
presence, and blessed vision of the Deity: take you it therefore, and that part of pro∣fite that might heereby haue falne to him and that part of my loue which heerein I shewed, him diuide among you: and as hee hath left behinde him to this Society, and all that knew him, the sweete smell of a good name, for his many religious and morall vertues: so let me leaue behinde me this lit∣tle Monument of the much loue my heart owes you, and shall bee willing to testifie by my best seruice, as to this whole and hono∣rable Society in generall, so to your selues in particular. To whom (without wrong to any other, I speake it) I haue beene peculi∣arly beholden, and by whom my studies haue beene much aduanced. Now the God of Grace and Mercy, so guide you in the wayes of holinesse and good workes, that at your ends your body may not blame your soule, nor the soule the body; but both soule and body may haue cause to glorifie God their Creatour, Redeemer and Sanctifier, in whose loue I leaue you, and rest yours in all Christian duety.
THE SPEAKERS. 1. The Author. 2. A Soule departed. 3. A dead Carcasse. 4. The Diuels. THE AVTHOR. IN silence of a Winters night, A sleeping, yet a waking spirit: A liuelesse body to my sight Me thought appeared thus addight. 2. In that my sleepe I did descry,
A Soule departed but lately From that foule body which lay by, Wailing with sighes and loud did cry. 3. Fast by the body thus she mones, And questions it with sighes and grones. O wretched flesh, thus low who makes thee lye? Whom yesterday the world had seene so high? 4. Wast not but yesterday the world was thine? And all the Country stood at thy deuotion? Thy traine that followed thee when thy Sunne did shine Haue now forsaken thee: (O dolefull alteration!) 5. Those Turrets gay of costly Masonry,
And larger Palaces are not now thy roome, But in a Coffin of small quantity, Thou lyest interred in a little tombe. 6. Thy Palaces, what helpe they thee, or buildings? Thy graue vneth's of largenesse for thy feet: Henceforth thou canst hurt none with thy false iudgings, For thy misdeeds in hell we both must meete. 7. I, I poore soule oh I, a noble creature, Formed and made in likenesse of my God, Adorn'd with graces of most comely feature Am now so chang'd as fouler then a Toad. 8. O wretched flesh with me that art forlorne,
If thou couldst know how sharpe our punishment? How iustly mightst thou wish not to be borne, Or from the wombe to tombe to haue beene hent. 9. This I confesse no wonder, for in life To one good deed thou neuer wouldst agree; But to each greatest sinne didst runne with strife, For which, for euer we must damned be. 10. I am, and ay must be. in bitter paine, No tongue of liuing man hath power to tell One of the smallest torments I sustaine, Where (which is worst) I must for euer dwell. 11. Where be those Lord-ships thou hast laid together?
Thy lofty Palaces, thy Castles strong? Thy heapes of gold which were thy chiefest treasure, Thy Rings and Iewels which about thee hung? 12. Where thy rich beds, thy sumptuous Tapestry, Thy change of rayment, many coloured vesture? Thy dainty Spices (baites of luxury) Plate, Tables, Carpets, and rich furniture? 13. Where now thy wilde Fowle, and thy Venison, Thy dainty fishes, and thy chosen wine? In thy now Kitchin meate is dressed none Such plagues for sinners God doth still assigne. 14. How lik'st thou now poore foole, thy latter lodging,
The roofe whereof lyes euen with thy nose? Thy eyes are shut, thy tongue cannot be iogging, Nothing of profite rests at thy dispose. 15. What erst thou hast most wretchedly beene scraping, By vsury, deceit, rage and oppression, In all thy life, with toyle and greedy gaping, Are hid by death in earth and putrifaction. 16. Thou art not now begirt with troopes of friends, The flower of all thy beauty lies in dust: The bands of euery loue doe heere take end, Yea, thine owne wife now thinkes all teares vniust. 17. In thy left kindred henceforth trust no more,
For, for thy Vine-yards, fields of grasse and corne: And (which thy plagues encrease) thy treasured store: Few dayes (know foole) thy after Heires will mourne. 18. I doe not thinke thy Wife or Children left Would lose one penny, or one patch of lands: For vs which are from her and them bereft, Though it might quite vs, from these horrid bands. 19. Now wretched flesh thou seest how nought reputed Is the worlds glory, false, deceitfull, fell, With anguish fraught, with sinne and vice polluted, And clothed in the noysome bane of hell. 20. Thy garments wretched foole, are farre from rich,
Thy vpper garment, hardly worth a Scute: A little linnen shrouds thee in thy dtch, No rents nor gifts men bring, nor make their suite. 21. Thinke not, though yet no torments thou endure, Thou neuer shalt but sleepe for euer free: For all Gods Scriptures which are true and sure, Witnesse, at last, thou shalt be plagu'd with me. 22. Thee which the poore didst rob, and not defend, Wormes gnaw in earth and rottennesse thy bone: But longer stay I must not: heere I end, To this, I trow, answer thou knowest none.
The Body answereth. 23. THus said the Soule: at last the gastly Coarse Straines vp it selfe as being new reuiued: And with deepe grones as if it had beene hoarse, Askt, who such witlesse reasons had contriued? 24 Art thou, quoth it, my Soule which thus dost faine? All that thou saist is neyther true nor stable: For I will proue with arguments most plaine, If some be true in many thou dost fable. I (as thou saist) haue led thee oft astray, And from well-doing haue enforst thy loue: But if the flesh can leade the Soule away
The fault's more thine then mine, which thus I proue. 26 The world and power of hell did both conspire, And did the flesh to them associate; Which if the constant soule cause not retire, Both needs must enter at sins wretched gate. 27 But as thou sayst, our God did thee create, Good, noble, vnderstanding, he thee made; And like himselfe, he fashioned thy state, And made me seruant to what ere thou said. 28 Therefore, if thou my Mistris ought to be, And reason had, by which thy office was Vs both to gonerne: why did'st thou suffer me
Without restraint in wicked race to passe? 29. Is't iust to charge the Body, as the Spirit? Which being rightfull Mistris, yet will serue; To tame the flesh, the spirit ought of right With abstinence, and stripes, if she'l not swerue. 30. The bodies workes be from the soule deriued, By meanes thereof in life it floruisheth: That flesh which by the soule is not assisted; By easie baites the world soone vanquisheth. 31. The body of it selfe none ill hath knowne, All that it knowes proceedeth from thy head: If I doe what thou bidst the fault's thine owne,
For without thee the body resteth dead. 32 Why should poore hand-maid (flesh) be charg'd with blame, In working onely as thy instrument? The soule commandeth all, hers be the shame Of all my frailties, since I want iudgement. 33 Therefore I weene thy guilt exceedeth mine, In following my lust so fraile, and foule: But oh the wormes doe teare me in my shrine, I therefore say no more, farewell poore soule. The Soule Replies. 34 NAy (said the Soule) Ile stay by thee a while, And if I can, thine arguments confute:
Why rail'st thou on me in this bitter stile, Striuing to me thy whole guilt to impute? 35. Most wretched flesh which in thy time of life Wast foolish, idle, vaine, why dost thou wreake Thy wrath in railing words to make new strife? Though for the substance 'tis true that thou dost speake. 36. For truth it is, and stands with reason plaine, I should haue bridled thee and rul'd thy will, But thou through loue of pleasure foule and vaine, And sensuall appetites me resisted still. 37. When I would thee O body haue control'd, And haue subdu'd, with watching, fast, and paine,
Straights the worlds vanity did thee with-hold, And to his vanie delights drew thee againe. 38 So thou of me didst get the vpper hand, And of my mildnesse made so bad construction, That thralling me in wordly pleasures band Eternally hast drown'd me in destruction. 39 I know my guilt, and this my trespasse was, That being chiefe I did not thee restraine: But thou deceiuedst me with so faire a glasse, That thy offence the greater ought remaine. 40 The vaine worlds practices, baites and delights, If thou hadst left with stedfast constancy,
And so with-stood Sathans inchanting sleights, Heauen had beene ours, with Saints and Deity. 41. But flattering fancies of the world did please, And made thee hope a lasting life to haue; Thou neuer thoughtst to dye, till death did ceaze: And hal'd thee from thy Court to dirty graue. 42. The world, and subtile men, haue both one guise, Where most it smiles, and most bestoweth honor, There soonest it deceiues, soonest death cries, And changeth wealth to wormes, to stinch and horror. 43. He which in life did fawne and was thy friend, Will not now cast a looke vpon thy graue.
Then gan the body weepe weighing this end, And lowly, in his stile, such answer gaue. The body answereth. 44 I In my life, which had so great command, In iewels, riches, lands did so abound: Built Palaces, and iudged many a land. Think'st thou I thought of Tombe in this base ground? 45 Oh, now I see, and find it to my griefe, That neither gold; nor wealth, nor larger rent, Honour, strength, knowledge, nor soueraigne hearbs reliefe, Can cure deaths bitter sting, nor it preuent. 46 Before our God we guilty both doe stand,
And both in fault, but not both equally, The greatest burden lyeth on thy hand: And this to proue full many reasons lye. 47 No wit so meane, but this for truth it knowes: Iustice it selfe and reason both agree, That where most gifts of vertue God bestowes, There most is due, and ought repayed be. 48 Life, Memory, and powerfull vnderstanding God gaue to thee, and with it sense of might, Wherewith thou shouldst haue curb'd at thy commanding Concupiscence, and followed that was right. 49 Then since thy dower of vertue stretcht so farre,
And foolishly thou gau'st thy selfe to me, And my entisements neuer would'st debar, That thy fault greatest is all men may see. 50 Further I adde (with anguish of my heart) Which mine owne case doth plainly demonstrate: The flesh can nothing doe, if soule depar:, It neither moues, nor stirs, early or late. 51 It neither sees, nor speakes: then is this proued, The Soule giues life, no power in flesh doth rest: If then the Soule rightly her God had loued, The flesh had neuer her great power supprest. 52 If Gods loue, liuing, thou hadst holden deare,
And poore mens causes rightly hadst de finde, And vnto wicked counsels giuen no eare, Nor me nor thee worlds vanitie had twinde. 53 I that liu'd gay, and gorgeous in attyre, Loe, what of all now vnto me remaines; Wormes, rottennesse, and narrow lodge of mire. These after all delights, are left my gaines. 54 And (oh) I know, that at the later houre I shall arise and as I did offend With thee shall finde a second death most soure, An euerlasting death, death without end!
The soule confesseth. 55 VVIth hollow fearfull voice then howles the soule: Oh, had I not amongst the creatures beene, Why with his creatures, did God me enroule? Whom he foreknew should perish thus for sinne? 56 Happy are you bruit beasts, happy your state, You wholly dye at once, and only rot: Once dead, all torments cease, such is your fate. Oh! were such end for sinners, such their lot. The Body askes the Soule a Question. 57 THen, quoth the Body to his pensiue Ghost, If thou hast beene among the fiends in hell,
Tell me, I pray what sawest thou in that Coast? Is no helpe left from thence with Christ to dwel? 58 For Kings and great men what is their prouision, Which liuing, Lorded it in high degree. For them is any hope left of redemption, For money, lands, bequests, or other fee? The Soule giues answer. 59 THe question, senslesse body, wanteth reason: For when to hell the wicked damned be, Redemption then is hopelesse, out of season: Bootlesse are almes-deeds, prayers and charity. 60 If all the piety of men should pray,
If all the world in price were offered, If all good men should fast both night and day, For this not one should be deliuered. 61 The roaring diuell, cruell and full of rage, For infinite of worlds, or any gaine, Would not forgoe one soule, shut in his cage, Nor ease his torments, nor make lesse his paine. 62 And to thy question, what is there prepar'd For Lords and great ones, Gods Law is expresse: The more that here one is aduanc'd or fear'd, More fearfull is his fall, if he transgresse. 63 A rich man therefore dying in his sinne,
No man shall sharper torments feele then hee. How much more pleasures that he liued in, So much more grieuous shall his torment be. The Author in vision. 64. AFter the Soule had said these mournfull words, Behold, two fiends more blacke then pitch or night, Whose shapes with pen to write no wit affords, Nor any hand of painter pourtray right. 65 Sharpe steely prickes they did in each hand beare, Sulphure and fire flaming they breathed out, Tusked their teeth like crooked mattocks were, And from their nostrils snakes crawled round about.
66 Their eares with running sores, hung flapping low, Foule filthy hornes, in their blacke browes they wore, Full of thicke poison which from them did flow, Their nayles were like the tushes of a Bore. 67 These finds in chaines fast bound this wretched soule, And with them hal'd her, howling into hell. To whom, on flockes, ran other diuels more, And gnashing with their teeth, to dancing fell. 68 They welcom'd her with greetings full of woe, Some wrested her with cords, senselesse of dread, Some snatcht and tore with hooks, drawne to and fro; Some for her welcome powr'd on scalding lead.
Diuels. 69 SVch horror we doe on our seruants load, Then (as halfe wearied) the diuels cryed, Now art thou worse then was the crawling Toade, Yet thousandfold worse torments thee abide. The Soule cryes out. 70 AFter all this, the groaning Soule deepe sighed, And with what voyce it could, low murmured: But when within the gates of hell she entered, Shee howled out Iesus the Sonne of Dauid.
The Diuels answer. 71. THen all the diuels together loud did cry, Too late, too late, thou callest on thy God; Here is no roome for Miserere mei: o hope of easement from this bitter rod. 72 Neuer hence forth shalt thou the light behold, Thou must be alter'd to another hue: Thou art a Souldier of our Campe enrol'd; Such is the comfort that in hell is due. The Author concludeth. 73. THen I awaked full of feare, And much amaz'd my selfe did reare:
To God I said with folded hands O shield me from such grieuous bands. 74 I left the world and it forsooke: Of goods and lands no care I tooke: I did renounce each worldly thing, And gaue my selfe to Christ my King. 75 The world is drownd in sinne and vice, All order chang'd, not one man wise: Both Iustice, and Religion lost, And all the world in turmoile tost. 76 The world to ruine runnes amaine, False gods are now set vp againe:
Vnto the rich their hands men hold, He is the God, that hath the gold. 77 The vertues of Diuinity, Are chok't, faith, hope, and charity. The brood of couerise and craft, Beare all the sway, and sit aloft. 78 Be thou noble, wise and faire, Courteous, lowly, debonaire, And poore, thou maist do what thou can: But onely money, makes the man. 79 If I be clad in rich array, and well attended euery day, Both wise & good I shal be thoght; my kindred also shall be sought.
I am (say men, the case is cleere) Your cousin sir a kinsman neare. 80 But if the world doe change and frowne, Our kindred is no longer knowne: Nor I remembred any more, By them that honoured me before. 81 O vanity, vile loue of mucke! Foule poyson, wherefore hast thou struck Thy selfe so deep, to raise so high, Things vanishing so sodainly? 82 For if the world could three things giue, Lusty youth, and long to liue,
Children strong, and faire of feature, Riches then were a good treasure. 83. But know (poore foole) these end with death, From first till now, all lose their breath: Liuing to day, to morrow gone, All flesh must die, death spareth none. 84. And as it's certaine all must die, So whither they goe, none can descry, Which made a wise-man thus to say; I quake and tremble night and day, First thinking of my present case, Then of that strange & fearful place
To which I must: but specially Of that which ther's prepar'd for me. 85 Thinking of death I sigh & weep, For three things which in heart I keepe: That dye I must, but know not when, Nor who shall be my fellow then. Therefore to thee (my God) I pray That I may liue with thee for aye. THE END.
MANVALE Catholicorum; SIVE, Enchiridion piarum precum & Meditationum. Ex vetustissimis Manuscrip. pergamenus descripta. Per GVLIEL. CRASH. LONDINI, Ex officina G. Eld, sumptibus Leonardi Becket. 1622.
De Deo Patre, pia, & ortho∣doxa Confessio. ALpha & Omega Deus, Hely, Hely, Deus meus. Cuius virtus, totum posse: Cuius sensus, totum nosse. Cuius esse, summum bonum: Cuius opus, quicquid bonum. Super cuncta, subter cuncta: Extra cuncta, intra cuncta. Super cuncta, nec elatus, Subter cuncta, nec substratus. Extra cuncta, nec exclusus, Intra cuncta, nec inclusus,
Super totus praesidendo, Subter totus sustinendo. Extra totus complectendo, Intra totus es implendo. Super nullo sustentaris, Subter nullo fatigaris. Extra nusquam dilataris, Intra nunquam coarctaris. Mundum mouens, non moueris, Locum tenens non teneris. Tempus mutans non mutaris, Ʋaga firmans, non vagaris. Vis externa vel necesse, Non alternat tuum esse. Heri nostrum cras & pridem, Semper tibi nunc & idem. Tuum decus hodiernum, Indiuisum sempiternum.
Tu hoc totum prouidisti, Totum sinu perfisti. Ad exemplar summe mentis, Formam prabens elementis.
De Iesu Christo Deo & ho∣mine Confessio Ortho∣doxa. NAte Patri coaequalis, Patri consubstantialis: Patris splendor & figura, Factor factus creatura. Carnem nostram induisti, Causam nostram suscepisti: Sempiternus temporalis, Moriturus immortalis. Ʋerus homo, verus Deus, Impermixius homo Deus. Patri compar Deitate, Minor carnis veritate.
Hic assumptus est in Deum; Nec consumptus propter Deum: Non conuersus hic in carnem, Nec minutus propter carnem. Deus Pater, tantum Dei, Ʋirgo mater sed & Dei. In tam noua ligaturae, Sic vtra{que} stat natura. Ʋt conseruet quicquid erat, Facta quiddam, quod non erat. Noster iste Mediator, Iste noster Cogislator. Circumcisus, Baptizatus, Crucisixus, tumulatus: Obdormiuit & descendit, Resurrexit & ascendit. Sic ad coelos eleuatus, Iudicabit iudicatus.
De codem. QVem nobis voluit diuina potentia Natum, Quem natum sua fecerunt miracula Notum, Quem notum plebeia Cruci vult concio Fixum, Quem{que} crucifixum, voluit pia turoa Sepultum: Hunc Natum, Notum, fixum, terra{que} sepultum, Sustulit in summum, Diuina potentia Coelum.
De fancto Spiritu Confessio Orthodoxa. PAracletus increatus, Ne{que} factus, ne{que} natus. Patri compar filio{que} Sic procedit ab vtro{que} Ne sit minor potestate, Vel discretus qualitate, Quanti illi, tantus iste, Quales illi, talis iste. Ex qui illi, ex tune iste, Quantum illi, tantum iste. Pater alter sed gignendo, Natus alter sed nascendo.
Flamen ab his procedendo, Tres sunt vnum subsistendo, Quis{que} trium plenus Deus, Non tres tamen Dij sed vnus. In hoc Deo, Deo vero, Tres & vnum asseuero. Dans OVSTA vnitatem, Et personis trinitatem. In personis nulla prior, Nulla maior, nulla minor. Vna{que} semper ipsa, Sic est constans at{que} fixa. Ʋt nec in se varietur, Nec in vllam transmutetur.
Conclusio cum deuotissima Precatione. HAec est fides Orthodoxa, Non hic error siue noxa. Sicut dico, sic & credc, Nec in prauam partem cedo. Inde veni bone Deus, Ne desperem quamuis reus. Reus mortis non despero, Sed in morte vitam quaero. Quo te placeam non pretendo, Nisi fidem quam defendo. Fidem vides hac imploro, Leua fascem quo laboro.
Per hoc sacrum cataplasma, Conualescat agrum plasma. Extra portem iam delatum, Iamiam faetens, tumulatum. Vittaligat, lapis vrget, Sed si iubes, hic resurget: Iube, lapis reuoluetur, Iube, vitta disrumpetur. Exiturus nescit moras, Si tu clamas, exiforas. In hoc Salo, mea Ratis Infestatur a Pyratis. Hinc assultus, inde fluctus, Hinc & inde mors & luctus. Sed tu bone Nauta veni, Post me ventos mare leni. Fac abscendant hipyratae, Duc ad portum salua Rate.
Infoecunda mea ficus, Cuius ramus, ramus siccus, Incidetur, incindetur, Si promulgas quod meretur. Sed hoc anno dimittatur, Stercoretur sodiatur. Quod si nec dum respondebit, Flens haec dico tunc ardebit. Ʋetus hostis in me furit, Aquis mersat flammis vrit. Inde languens & afflictus, Tibi soli sum relictus. Ʋt hic hostis euanescat, Ʋt infirmus conualescat. Tu virtutem ieiunandi, Des infirmo, des orandi. Per haec duo (Christo teste) Liberabor ab hoc peste.
Ab hoc peste solue mentem, Fac deuotum poenitentem. Da timorem quo proiecto, De salute nil coniecto. Da spem, fidem, charitatem, Da discretam pietatem. Da contemptum terrenorum, Appetitum supernorum. Totum Deus in te spero, Deus es, te totum quaero. Tu laus ma, meum bonum, Mea cuncta tuum donum. Tu solamen in labore, Medicamen in languore. Tu in luctu mea lyra, Tu lenimen es in ira. Tu in arcto liberator, Tu in lapsu releuator.
Mecum perstas in labore, Spem conseruas in dolore, Si quis laedit tu rependis, Si minatur tu defendis. Quod est anceps tu dissoluis, Quod tegendum tu inuoluis. Tu intrare me non sinas, Infernales officinas. Ʋbi moeror, vbi metus, Vbifaetor, vbi fletus. Ʋbi probra deteguntur, Ʋbi rei confunduntur: Ʋbi tortor semper caedens: Vbi vermis semper edens. Vbi totum hoc perenne, Procul sit haec mors gehennae. Me receptet Sion illa, Sion Dauid vrbs tranquilla.
Cuius faber Auctor lucis, Cuius portae, lignum Crucis: Cuius claues lingua Iesu, Cuius ciues sine metu: Cuius muri lapis vinus, Cuius custos rex festinus: In hac vrbe lux solemnis: Ver aeternum, pax perennis: In hac odor impleni Coelos, In hac semper dulce melos. Non est ibi corruptela, Non defectus, non quaerela: Non minuti, non deformes, Omnes Christo sunt conformes. Vrbs coelestis, vrbs beata, Supra petram collocata: Ʋrbs in portu satis tuto, De longinquo te saluto:
Te saluto, te suspiro, Te affecto, te requiro. Quantum tui gratulentur? Quam festiue conuiuentur? Quis affectus eos stringat? Aut quae gemma muros pingat? Quis Chalcedon, quis Iacincthus, Norunt illi qui sunt intus? In plateis huius vrbis, Sociatus pijs turbis. Cum Iob, Mosedech, & Elia, Pium cantem Alleluiah. Amen.
Meditatio piissima, de ho∣minis miseria, & Dei mise∣ricordia, vna cum deuota precatione. VTiucundas Ceruus vndas, Estuans defiderat: Sic ad Deum, Fontem verum, Mens fidelis properat. Sicut riui Fontis viui Prabent refrigerium. Ita menti Sitienti Deus est remedium.
Quantis bonis, super bonis, Seruos tuos Domine: Lesel aedit, Qui recedit A superno lumine. Ʋitam laetam & quietam, Qui te quaerit reperit: Sed laborem & dolorem, Metit qui te deserit. Sipacem donas, & coronas, His qui tecum militant: Cuncta lata sine meta, His qui tecum habitant. Heu quam vana mens humana, Lusione falleris?
Cum te curis, Nocituris, Imprudenter ingeris. Cur non caues Lapsus graues, Quos persuadit proditor? Noc affectas Ʋias rectas, Quas ostendit Conditor. Resipiscas At{que} discas Cuius sis originis: Ʋbi degis, Cuius legis, Cuius sis & ordinis: Ne te spernes, Sed discernes Homo gemma regia: Te perpende, Et attende Qua sis factus gratia,
Recordare, Quis, & quare Sis à Deo conditus: Cuius haeres, Nunc maneres, Si fuisses subditus. O mortalis, Quantis malis Meruisti affici, Cum Auctori, Et doctori Noluisti subijci! Sed maiores Sunt dolores Infernalis carceris, Quo mittendus Et torquendus, Es, si male vixeris. Cui mundus, Est iucundus, Suam perdit animam:
Pro re leui, At{que} breui, Vitam perdit optimam. Ergo caue, Ne tam suaue Iugum spernens Domini: Et abiecta Lege recta, Seruias libidini. Si sint plagae, Curam age, Ʋt curentur citius: Ne si crescant Et putrescant, Pergas in deterius. Ne desperes, Nam cohaeres Christi esse poteris: Si carnales, Quantum vales, Affectus excluseris.
Si formidas, Ne diffidas, Sed medelam postula: Noxam plange, Corpus ange, Dilue piacula. Si viuorum, Et functorum, Christum times Iudicem: Debes scire, Quod perire, Non vult suum supplicem. Preces funde, Pectus tunde, Flendo cor humilia: Poenitenti, Et gementi, Non negatur venia. Exorando. Et laudando, Iesum Christum memora:
Nam delere Potest vere, Quaecun{que} facinora. Et si quando, Te temptando Durus serpens laeserit: Suspiranti, Et oranti, Iesus Christus aderit. Quod si forte Mortis portae, Tu vicinum senseris, Crede tamen, Quod inuamen, Per cum receperis. Hunc require Qui lenire Solet corda tristium: Certus esto Quod est presto, Votis se precantium.
Ipse multos Iam sepultos Fecit reuiuiscere; Hic auersos, Et subuersos Potest Deo iungere. Ipsum ama, Ad hunc clama, Mentem tuam eleua: Ʋt sustentet, Et praesentet Te ad coeli gaudia, Ipsum cole, Ʋt de mole Criminum te liberet: Hunc appella, Ne processa, Vitiorum superet. Ipsum posco, Quem cognosco, Posse prorsus omnia:
Ʋt euellat, Et repellat, Cūcta qua sunt noxia. Ipse donet, Ʋt quod monet Eius verbum faciam: Ʋt finita, Carnis vita Latus hunc aspiciam. Pater Deus, Fili Deus, Deus alma charitas, Per aeterna Nos guberna, Secla Deus Trinitas. Amen.
A MANVALL for true Catholicks. OR A HANDFVLL: OR Rather a heartfull of holy me∣ditations and prayers. GATHERED Out of certaine ancient Manu∣scripts, written 300. yeares agoe, or more. By WILLIAM CRASHAW. LONDON, Printed by G. E. for Leonard Becket, and are to be sold at his shop in the Temple neere the Church. 1622.
The Contents. 1. A Holy and orthodoxall confession of the Trini∣tie: The Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost. 2. A godly confession of sins, and prayer for pardon, and for eternall life. 3. A godly meditation of mans miserie, and Gods mercy, together with a deuout prayer. 4. The manner of preparing sicke persons to death in the an∣cient times, euen in Popery.
An Orthodoxall Confession of God the Father. FIrst and last, one God diuine, All mens God as well as mine. In thy vertue all things framing, In thy knowledge all containing. In thine essence chiefest good, Working all that is of good. All supporting, all excelling, Without all, yet in all dwelling. All supporting, vndeiected, All excelling, vnaffected. Without all, yet not excluded, In all, neuer yet included.
Ouer all in Domination, Vnder all in sustentation. Comprehending all without thee, Filling all things round about thee. Nothing vnder thee can raise thee, Nought aboue thee can debase thee. Nought without giues thee dimen∣sion, Noght within giues thee extension. Mouing all, thy selfe abiding, Placed without circumscribing. Changing time, thy self most stable, Varying all, inuariable. Force, necessity, nor art, Alter thee in any part. Time past, present, and to come, Are one with thee, both all & some. All the glory now thou hast, Vndiminisht aye must last.
Onely thou art all fore: seeing, Onely giuing all their being. As thy wisdome did foreshow, Thou fram'dst the elements below
A holy and orthodoxall Confessi∣on of God the Sonne, Iesus Christ the Sauiour of Mankind. SOnne, thy Fathers peere in all, With him consubstantiall. His figure and his splendor pure, Creator, made a creature. Thou our humane flesh putst on, Thou our cause hast vndergone. Temporall, yet time defying, Euer liuing, yet once dying. God and Man without illusion, Both in one without confusion. Thy Father like in Deity, But not in fleshly verity.
God humanity assuming, The same preseruing, not consu∣ming. The God-head in this vnion, yet Of his Godhead lost no whit. God to God and not toth'other, Was Father, but Mary to both was Mother. Thus both natures kept their statiō In this wondrous Combination. Preseruing in the essence true What was, and thence producing new. This our Mediator is, Our leader to the Land of blisse. Circumciz'd, baptiz'd by Iohn, Suffered, buried, and vpon The third day: whence he had de∣scended, He rose, and so to heauen ascended. Whence he shall come, when time doth call, (Tho iudgd himself) to iudge vs al.
Of Christ againe. HE whō Gods power for man∣kind, would haue borne, Whom borne, his miracles proclaimed haue, Who thus proclaim'd, vpon a Crosse was torne, To whom thus torne, the godly buriall gaue: This borne, proclaimed, torne, entombed King, Gods power againe, to heauenly blisse did bring.
A True and Orthodoxall Con∣fession of the Holy Ghost. SPirit vncreated euer, Neuer made, begotten neuer. From the Persons two proceeding, Full their equall, not exceeding. Not preferring them in Deity, Nor seuerall from them in quality. In quantity all three combine, In quality alike Diuine. With the Father and the Sonne, Neuer ending nor begun. One is Father; for he begot, The Sonne one borne, all men wot.
Frō these the spirit proceeds alone, Thus one is three, & three are one. Each of these is God truely, Yet still but one, & not Gods three. But in this Deity, I asseuer, A Trinity vnited euer. In the substance is full vnity, In the Persons perfect Trinity: But in these that I haue reckoned, None in power is first or second. But all as one we must adore, Fix'd and firme for euermore. Nor in selfe for euer changed, Nor from it selfe at all estranged.
The Conclusion, with a deuout and holy Prayer. THis is Christiā faith vnfained, Orthodoxall, true, vnstained. As I teach all vnderstand, Yeelding vnto neither hand. And in this my soules defence, Reiect me not for mine offence. Thogh deaths slaue, yet desperation I flye in death to seek saluation. I haue no meane, thy loue to gaine, But this faith, which I maintaine. This thou seeft, nor will I cease, By this to beg for a release.
Let this sacred Salue be bound Vpon my sores, to make thē sound. Thogh man be carried forth, & ly∣ing. In his graue and putrifying, Bound and hid from mortall eyes, Yet if thou bid, he must arise: At thy will the graue will open, At thy will his bounds are broken. And forth he comes without delay, If thou but once bid, Come away. In this sea of dread and doubt, My poore Barke is tost about, With storms & Pirats, far & wide, Death and woes on euery side. Come thou Steeres-man euer blest, Calme these winds, that me molest. Chase these ruthlesse Pyrats hence, And shew me some safe residence.
My tree is fruitlesse, dry and dead, All the boughes are withered. Downe it must, and to the fire, If desert haue his due hire. But spare it (Lord) another yeare, With manuring it may beare. If it then be dead and dry, Burne it, alas, what remedy? Mine old foe assaults me sore, With fire and water more & more. Poore I, of all my strength bereft, Onely vnto thee am left. That my foe may hence be chased, And I from ruines clawes released. Lord vouchsafe me euery day, Strength to fast, and faith to pray. These 2. means thy selfe hast taught To bring tēptations force to noght.
Lord free my soule frō sins infecti∣on, By repentances direction. Be thy feare in me abiding, My soule to true saluation guiding. Grant me faith (Lord) hope & loue, Zeale of heauen and things aboue. Teach me prize the world at noght, On thy blisse be all my thought. All my hopes on thee I found, In whom all good things abound. Thou art all my dignity, All I haue, I haue from thee. Thou art my comfort in distresse, Thou art my cure in heauinesse: Thou art my musicke in my sadnes, Thou art my medicine in my mad∣nes. Thou my freedome from my thral, Thou my raiser from my fall.
In my labour thou relieues me, Thou reformes what euer grieues me. Al my wrongs thy hand reuengeth, And from hurt my soule defendeth. Thou my deepest doubts reuealest, Thou my secret faults concealest. O do thou stay my feet frō treading In paths to hell and horror leading: Where eternall torment dwels, With fears, & teares and loathsome smels. Where mans deepest shame is soun∣ded And the guilty stil cōfounded. VVhere the scourge for euer beateth, And the worme that alwaies eateth. Where all those endlesse do remain, Lord preserue vs from this paine. In Sion lodge me (Lord) for pitty, Sion Dauids Kingly Cittie.
Built by him that's onely good, Whose gates are of the crosses wood. Whose keies are Christs vndoubted word. Whose dwellers feare none but the Lord. Whose wals are stone, strong, quicke and bright, Whose keeper is the Lord of light. Here the light doth neuer cease, Endlesse spring, and endlesse peace. Heere is musicke, heauen filling, Sweetnesse euermore distilling. Here is neither spot nor taint, No defect, nor no complaint. No man crooked, great nor small, But to Christ conformed all. Blessed Towne, diuinely graced, On a Rocke so strongly placed. Seated sure from feare of warre: I salute thy wals from farre.
Thee I see, and thee I long for, Thee I seeke, and thee I groane for. O what ioy thy dwellers tast, All in pleasures first and last? What full enioying blisse Diuine, What Iewels on thy wals do shine? Ruby, Iacinth, Chalcedon, Knowne to them within alone. In this glorious Company In the streets of Syon; I With Iob, Moses, and Eliah, Will sing the heauenly Alleluiah. Amen.
A holy Meditation of mans misery, and Gods mercy, to∣gether with a deuout Prayer. VVIth longing cheere, The thirsty Deere, do seeke the Brooke: In such a kinde, The faithfull minde, for God doth looke: And as the Springs, Refreshment brings, In drought and sweat: So God doth coole, The thirsty Soule in all her heate.
O Lord what floods Of glorious goods, dost thou bestow, On those that be Thine? blest is he that well doth know. Eternall blisse, His guerdon is that Iesus maketh His rest: but he Reapes misery that him forsaketh. Thou mak'st them glorious And victorious, who serue thee well: In endlesse ioy From all annoy with thee they dwell. But oh humanity, With how great vanity, art thou betost?
To dote in care, On things that are so quickly lost? Why dost thou yeeld, And leaue the field, to sinnes inuasions? Not well respecting, But ill reiecting, thy Gods perswasions. Open thine eyes, And well aduise, of whence thou art: Thy life, thy birth, Thy state, thy worth, obserue each part. From carelesnesse, Thy selfe still blesse, O man, Gods Iewel: How he placed thee, And graced thee, obserue and view well.
To what intent, Hath God thee sent, obserue with care: To whom (but Pride Drew thee aside) thou hadst beene heyre. O mortall sonne, Affliction is thy due hire: That broke the band Of Gods command, through vaine desire. But oh take heed, Those paines exceed, that rule in hell: Whose fire so cruell, Hath those for fuell, that liue not well. The man that ioyes In worldly toyes, his soule orethrowes:
Respecting nought, What Christ hath bought full deare God knowes. Then neuer grudge, If God thee iudge, his yoake to beare: Let not lust draw Thee from his law, but hold it deare. And soone apply His remedy, vnto thy sore: Lest it increase, To worse disease, and plague thee more. Doe not despaire, Thou maist be heire, with Christ in ioy: By casting out Corruptions roote, thy soules annoy.
Still feare thou must, But not distrust, and beg thy cure: For errors weepe, Thy body keepe lowly and pure. If to thy feare, Thy Iudge appeare with angry face: Know he will lose Not one of those, that beg his grace. Pray without rest, And knock thy brest, humble thy minde: All that bewaile Their errors fraile, haue pardon fign'd, And doe not spare, In hymne and prayer, Iesus to prayse:
For mercy still, Is at his will, at all assayes. And when the Diuell, The prince of euill, attempteth thee: Then if thou pray, Christ will not stay to set thee free. Albe thou were, To death most neare, yet still be sure: And vnderstand That his high hand, containes thy cure. Be he thy quest, That giues all rest, from restlesse woes: Who so adore, And him implore, shall come to those.
For many a one, Dead long agone, hath he reuiued: And saued more That were before of grace depriued. Be all thy loue, On God aboue, lift vp thy spirit: That thou maist taste The Saints repast, through his sole merit. And honour him, That he from sinne, may thee deliuer, That sinnes increase In thee may cease, in prayer perseuer. On him I call, That all in all hath in his power:
Against all harme, Be he mine arme, my shield, my towre. And this liues length Vouchsafe vs strength to keepe his hest: That at our end Wee may ascend to endlesse rest. Amen.
HEre followeth the meanes and manner how our forefathers in the time of Popery prepared themselues and others to die, consisting first of the confession of their faith; and secondly, of the Prayers which were made by them, and for them in their last sick∣nesse, by which it may appeare that though they were misled by the crafty Romish Clergie, in diuers errors and superstitions; yet in the great point of the meanes of saluation, they were of our religion, and were saued by it. Truly and verbatim englished out of the Latine, being an ancient Copie, and by any of that side vnquestioned, and heretofore in that kind published: By W. CRASH.
Questions to be expoun∣ded to sicke persons, whilst they haue the vse of reason, and power to speak, to the end that if any be not so well disposed to dye, hee may be better infor∣med and prepared: and the questions be these, according to Anselme the Reuerend Bi∣shop. 1. Let him be asked thus: BRother, dost thou reioyce that thou shalt die in the faith of Christ? A. I doe. Q. Doest thou sorrow and grieue, for that thou hast not liued so well as thou oughtest?
A. I doe. Q. Hast thou a hearty pur∣pose to liue better, if God giue thee time to liue? A. I haue. Q. Doest thou beleeue that thou canst not be saued, but by the death of Christ? A. I doe. Q. Doest thou beleeue that Iesus Christ the Sonne of God dyed for thee? A. I doe. Q. Doest thou giue thankes to God therefore from thy whole heart? A. I doe. Well then, good Brother, whilst thy soule is in thy bo∣dy, giue him hearty thankes, and settle all thy assurance vp∣on his death alone: haue no confidence in any thing else: trust thy selfe wholly to his
passion, couer thy selfe whol∣ly with it, fasten thy whole life on his Crosse, cast thy whole selfe into this Sea: and if the Lord God say hee will iudge thee; answere thou, Lord, I obiect the death of my Lord Iesus Christ, be∣twixt me and thy iudgement: otherwise I will not contend with thee. And if GOD say to thee, Thou art a sinner; answere, Lord, it is so, but I set the death of my Lord Iesus be∣twixt thee and my sinnes. If hee say thou hast deserued damnation; answer, It is true, Lord, but I place the death and merits of my Lord Iesus Christ betwixt thee and my ill deseruings, and I offer vp him and the most worthy me∣rits of his passion, for the me∣rits
which I should haue had, but alas, haue not. If the Lord say further, that he is angry with thee, answer: Lord, thou hast cause, but I set the death and sufferings of my Lord Iesus Christ betwixt thy wrath and my soule, Then let him say thrice, Lord, into thy hands I commit my spirit: and if he be so weake he can∣not, let the company that stand by say, Lord, into thy hands we commend his soule. And hee that doth this, is safe and sure that he shall neuer tast of eter∣nall death.
Also in another old Booke I find this written. THese bee the sixe signes vpon which a man may rest confident of his Salua∣tion. 1. If hee beleeue the Arti∣cles of Christian faith, as ma∣ny as are determined by the Church. 2. If hee reioyce to dye in the faith of Christ. 3. If he know that he haue grieuously offended God. 4. If he be heartily sory for it. 5. If hee resolue to forsake his sinnes, if God giue him leaue.
6 If hee hope and beleeue to come to eternall saluation, not by his owne merits, but by the merits of Iesus Christ. And Anselme saith, that these sixe questions are to bee asked of euery one at the time of his death, and saith further thus: Then say to the sicke per∣son, if Satan obiect any thing against thee, oppose thou the merits of Christ betwixt thee and him: and thus without all doubt he shall be saued. This consolation of the sicke, and preparation to their death, is in ancient Copies ascribed to Anselme, who li∣ued more then 500. yeares a∣goe, euen when Popery was almost growne to perfect age. Now if any man make que∣stion, how our fathers were
saued in these later and worse times, when Popery preuailed in a great measure; I answere, that euen almost the same pre∣paration, and same questions were vsed long after Anselme, euen in the deepest darknesse of Popery: for in the most euil time, about the Councell of Constance, some two hundred yeares agoe, thus I find it writ∣ten in an ancient Booke, and it is ascribed to Gerson.
Euery Christian, whether se∣cular or regular, is thus to be examined and informed in his sicknesse, touching his saluation. 1 DOest thou beleeue all the principall Articles of faith, & all that is contained in the whole body of holy Scripture, according to the ex∣position of the Catholike and Orthodoxall Doctors of the holy Church? and doest thou detest all heresies and errors, and superstitions condemned or reproued by the Church?
and art thou glad that thou diest in the faith of Christ, and vnitie and obedience of thy mother the Church? 2 Dost thou know and con∣fesse, that thou hast many waies and grieuously offended thy God and thy Creator? 3 Doest thou sorrow from thy whole heart, for all thy sinnes committed against Gods Maiesty, his loue and mercy? art thou truly sorrow∣full for the euils that thou hast committed, and the good that thou hast omitted, and the grace that thou hast neg∣lected? and art thou agrie∣ued not so much for feare of death or any punishment, as for that loue that thou ough∣test to beare towards God? 4 Doest thou beg pardon for all these thy sinnes, of Iesus
Christ, desiring that by him thy heart may bee enlightned truely to see and know thy sinnes, that so thou mayest particularly, and more serious∣ly repent of them? 5 Doest thou propound, and resolue truely to amend thy life, if so be thou liue, and neuer hereafter to sinne so a∣gaine, but rather to lose any thing how deare soeuer vnto thee, yea, euen life it selfe, then to offend thy God againe? 6 Doest thou also desire of God grace to continue in this purpose, that thou maiest not fall againe? 7 Doest thou forgiue from thy whole heart any that haue done thee any wrong in word or deede, for the loue of Christ Iesus our Lord and Sa∣uiour, and as thou hopest for
pardon from him? and doest thou heartily desire to bee forgiuen of all men whom thou hast any way offen∣ded? 8 Wilt thou that there bee full restitution made accor∣ding to thy power, yea, though it should extend to thy whole estate, if other∣wise there cannot be satisfacti∣on made? 9 Doest thou beleeue that Christ dyed for thee, and that thou canst be saued no other∣wise but by the merits of Iesus Christ? and doest thou giue God thankes for this from thy whole heart, as much as thou art able? And whosoeuer can giue true answer to these questi∣ons affirmatiuely, out of a good conscience, and faith
not fained: It is an euident and sufficient testimonie of saluation, and let him not doubt but if he so depart, hee is one of them that shall bee sa∣ued. Behold heere (good Reader) our Religion practised in the most misty times of Popery: be∣hold here the true holy Catho∣like and ancient way to heauen: Namely, by Christ and his me∣rits alone. Here is no trusting on mans merits, either our owne or others: Here is no mention of Agnus dei, or woodden Cru∣cifixes. Hee is not bid to trust in the prayers, suffrages, requiems, dirges, Masses, Trentalls, or o∣ther obsequies that shall bee said for him after his departure. Hee is sent to no Angell, no nor to the Ʋirgin Mary, for matter of Saluation: Nay all are excluded,
and Christs death alone, euen it alone is made the meanes of his Saluation: And the makers hereof were so resolute, and zea∣lous in this point, that they vsed such variety of words, as though they could not sufficiently expresse the excellencie and the necessity of cleauing to Christ alone in the matter of Saluation. And if any man suspect that this is but deuised by vs, and fals∣ly fathered vpon Antiquity, let him know, that not onely we haue the ancient Copies, whose age will speake for themselues, but Gasper Vlēber∣gius in lib. de Causis. Causa 14 pag: 462. edi∣tionis Colon. 1589. euen the better sort of Papists, that be learned, doe know this well enough. A learned Papist of this age writeth, that in a Church in Colaine this very booke is ex∣tant (Manuscript) and that he hath seene it, and that this
manner of comforting the sicke, was vsed in former ages, and con∣fesseth that it containes the very treasure and kernell of Christian religion. And saith further, that this manner was vsed not in Ger∣many onely, but ouer all the Christian world. Indeede to the Iesuites I confesse, this is held a ridiculous manner of comforting the sicke, (such a spirit possesseth them:) Thus doth Gretzer their Champion flout vs Lu∣therans (as he cals vs) for thus doing. The Lutherans (saith he) do Iac. Gretz. in resut. Leyseri. de hist. Ord. Ie∣suit. thus comfort their sicke, Re∣lickes, Crucifixes, Agnus deis, and such matters, are but dead things, & nothing worth, the Scripture hath not a word of them: it is therefore very vn∣godly to trust in them; but God is our hope, and God is
our strength: trust in him, &c. On this wise fashion doe these godly comforters comfort their sicke persons. Thus in the Iesuites iudge∣ment it is but a silly course to trust in Gods mercy, and Christs merits in point of saluation: here∣by it may bee discerned of what spirit they are. But let them mock vs, as long as with vs they mocke the Scriptures, Antiquitie, and the better sort of their owne side: for we appeale to this that hath beene said, whether this manner of comforting the sicke, were not in vse long before Luther was borne. Now if any obiect, that in the same bookes there is mention of the Crucifixe, and that it is ap∣pointed to be in the presence of the sicke person: I answer, it is true, but not that he should worship it,
(as now the Iesuites teach, and Greg. de Valent. Gretzer Vasquez Chrys. à visit. &c. all the approued Romish writers) but that it may put him in minde of Christ, which though it bee a needlesse superstition, yet it is not that impietie and Idolatrie, which now at this day is practised and maintained in the Romish Church: and my purpose is not to discharge those times, nor our forefathers in those times of er∣rours and superstitions, but of the idolatry, impietie, and blas∣phemie of the present Church of Rome. And the same answer is also to be giuen to another obie∣ction, That in the same book there are prayers to the Saints and An∣gels. It is so, and from that errour those ages cannot be cleared: but withall let vs still obserue, that those praiers are not to help them in matters of saluation, (as are many blasphemous prayers now
vsuall in Popery,) and that sinne in those misty times (being a sin of ignorance) no doubt was par∣doned vnto them in the mercy of God, seeing that for their recon∣ciliation with God, and eternall saluation, they beleeued to at∣taine it onely by the merits and passion of Iesus Christ. But let not vs feede on their infirmities, but louingly passe by them, and let this content and comfort vs, that their meanes of saluation, which they vsed and trusted vn∣to, is the same with ours at this day. For better testimony where∣of, let vs set downe some of their prayers, being such as the best Christians may vse at this day with much comfort.
Certaine Prayers vsed by our forefathers in the darkest times of Poperie: in the time of a mans sicknesse, some to bee made for the sicke, and some by the sicke person: gathered out of the same Ancient Bookes. When the sicke person feeles his strength to faile, then let him commend his soule to God in this prayer. O Most high and Soue∣raigne GOD, whose goodnesse and mercy is in∣finite.
O most glorious Trini∣tie, which art loue, and mer∣cie, and goodnesse it selfe, haue mercy vpon mee most miserable sinner, for vnto thee and vnto thy hands I commend my spirit: O Lord my most louing God and Fa∣ther of mercies, shew thy mer∣cie on me thy poore creature, and forsake me not in my last need: but stand with me, and helpe my succourlesse soule, saue my poore and desolate soule, that it be not deuoured of the infernall dogs. O most louing Lord and sweete Sauiour Iesus Christ, the Sonne of the liuing God, I beseech thee for thy honor, and by the vertue of thy most blessed passion, command that I may bee receiued into the number of thy Saints, and
seruants, O my Sauiour and my Redeemer, I here yeeld vp my selfe wholly vnto thee: O graunt me thy grace and thy glory, vouchsafe mee pardon of my sinne, and giue mee a portion of thy glory. But ô my deare Lord, I challenge not a place in heauen for any wor∣thinesse of mine owne merits, for I am but dust and ashes, and a most wretched sinner; but for the vertue of thy most blessed passion, by which thou diddest vouchsafe to re∣deeme me miserable man, and to purchase heauen for mee, e∣uen with the price of thy pre∣cious bloud: I beseech thee therefore by the most blessed and bitter passion which thou sustainedst on the Crosse for mee, especially in that houre when thy blessed soule did
leaue thy body, that thou wouldest haue mercy on my poore soule at the time of my departure. Then let him lift vp his heart with ioy and thankesgiuing, and say, Lord, thou hast broken my bonds, therfore I will offer to thee the sacrifice of praise.
After, if his weakenesse grow so, that he lose the vse of his speech, let some of the by-standers say these Prayers following, o∣uer him, or more if he lue so long. MErcifull God and Fa∣ther, we beseech thee for the multitude of thy mer∣cies, looke fauourably vpon this thy seruant (our deare brother) who with true and hearty confession, seekes par∣don
for all his sinnes at the hand of thy mercies: O Lord, heare vs for him, and wee beseech thee for him, most holy Father, to renue in his heart whatsoeuer is corrup∣ted by the frailty of his flesh, and restore that grace, which the wily and malicious ene∣mie the Diuell hath stolne out of his soule: O Lord, re∣call him to the vnity of thy Church, ingraft him into the body of thy Sonne: O Lord, take pittie of the sighes and sobs of his soule, and grones of his heart: O Lord, look vp∣on his teares, gather them in∣to thy bottle, and be good to him, who hath no hope, com∣ort, nor confidence, but in hy mercy, seale vp the assu∣ance of his recōciliation with hee. O most holy father, we
humbly commend the soule of this thy seruant and our brother into the hands of thy vnmeasurable mercies, hum∣bly beseeching thee, accor∣ding to the greatnesse of that loue in which the blessed soule of thy Sonne did commend it selfe into thy hands, that for the worthinesse of that infinit loue of thine, in which thou diddest receiue that holy soule vnto thy selfe, thou wouldest vouchsafe in this our brothers last houre, to receiue his poore soule also, and make it parta∣ker of the same loue. And thou most sweete Sa∣uiour and most merciful Lord Iesus, thou that dying on the Crosse, wast so pressed with anguish and torments for vs, as made thee sound out that pitiful voyce vnto thy Father▪
My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken mee? we beseech thee estrange not thy selfe, and turne not away thy face from thy seruant our brother, now in the houre of his soules af∣fliction, when his strength faileth, and his spirits are so spent, that he cannot cal vpon thee: heare vs, ô Lord, heare vs for him, and for that thy glorious victory, in which thou diddest triumph on the Crosse, and for thy precious passion and bitter death think of him the thoughts of mercy and not of iustice: shed thy mercies in his soule, and speak comfortably to his consci∣ence, deliuer his soule out of all spirituall diseases, saue him from the torments due vnto his deseruings, and bring him for thine owne merits sake, to
eternall rest. O Lord Iesus Christ, which didst redeeme vs with thy precious blood, write with thine owne blood in the soule, and ingraue thy wounds in the heart of this thy seruant, that in them hee may see and reade thy dole∣full sufferings, and thy sweete loue: thy sufferings, that they may be effectuall to ransome him from those sorrowes, and torments, which he hath me∣rited by his sin; thy loue, that it may vnite his heart to thee, in indiuisible and inseperable bonds, so as he may neuer bee separated from thee, nor thy Saints, for euer and euer. And Lord Iesus Christ, we beseech thee make his soule partaker of all the merits of thy most sacred incarnation, passion, resurrection and as∣cension,
make him partaker of the vertue of thy most bles∣sed Sacraments, and all thy holy mysteries: make him partaker of all the prayers and good deeds done in thy whole Church; make him partaker of all thy blessings, graces, and comforts of all thy elect; and grant that with them all hee may liue in thy presence for euermore: O Lord, which powredst out thy prayers for vs on the Mount Oliuer, and sweatst water and blood: wee beseech thee, let that precious bloud of thine, which thou diddest so aboun∣dantly powre out for our sal∣uation, let it be presented and offered to thy Father, to stand against the multitude of the sinnes of this thy seruant, our brother: Lord be with him at
his last houre, and then deliuer him from the anguish and torments which for his sinnes hee may iustly feare. Graci∣ously receiue his soule in the houre of his departure, open the gate of heauen vnto him, and giue him a portion with thy Saints in glory for thy owne most glorious merit, O Lord Iesus Christ, who with God the Father and the ho∣ly Ghost, liuest, and raignest one God for euermore. Amen.
And when the sicke mans strength begins to faile, and the soule is ready to depart, then let the soule be commended to God by one of the by stan∣ders, on this manner. The commendation of the Soule, to be said at a mans death. I Here commend thee to Al∣mighty God, most deare Brother; and I doe commit thee to him whose creature thou art: goe forth therefore
O Christian soule; get thee gone out of this filthy world, goe forth in the name of the Almighty Father, who crea∣ted thee: In the name of Ie∣sus Christ, who dyed for thee: In the name of the holy Ghost who hath beene powred out vpon thee. And when thou, happy soule, art deliuered out of the prison of the body, the glorious Quire of heauenly Angels meete thee, and the company of all holy Saints entertaine thee, the louing countenance and cheerefull grace of Iesus Christ shine vp∣on thee: a mercifull Iudge be he vnto thee, that thou maist haue sentence to sit for euer a∣mongst his Saints, on his right hand: thy dwelling bee in peace, and thy habitation in the heauenly Ierusalem for e∣uermore:
farre be it from thee euer to feele or know, how horrible the darkenesse, how terrible the flame, and how intolerable the torments of hell are. Sathan and all his hellish guard, bee they con∣founded at thy presence: and if he dare set vpon thee, victo∣ry & triumph be on thy side; shame and trembling fall vp∣on him: from the presence of Gods Angels be he banished, into the blacke mists, and confused Chaos of eternall darkenesse. But let the Lord arise, and let his enemies bee scattered; as the smoake va∣nisheth, so let them flye away. But let the iust be exalted and reioyce in the presence of the Lord: let the infernall legi∣ons not dare to touch thee, nor
presume to hinder thee, and hee who disdained not to dye for thee, be hee thy Sauiour and deliuerer from all spiritu∣all vexation. Be the gates of Paradise open vnto thee, and thy Christ giue thee thy place and mansion in the same. And he that is the true Pastor and great Shepherd of the sheepe, acknowledge thee for one of his true sheepe, and receiue thee into his folde. IESVS Christ absolue thee from all thy sinnes, and place thee on his right hand amongst his elect, that there thou maiest see thy Redeemer face to face, and in the societie of blessed soules maiest enioy the com∣forts of heauenly contempla∣tion, and the blessed vision of God for euer and euer. Amen.
A Meditation of Saint Bernard, sweete and comfortable to fore∣run a happy end. DƲlcissime Iesu Christe, sit vltimum verbum tuum in cruce, vltimum verbum meum in hac luce, & amplius fari non possum, exaudi finale cordis de∣syderium.
In English. SWeete Iesus Christ, let thy last wordes vpon thy Crosse, bee my last vpon my Couch, and when I can speake no more, Lord, heare the vtmost desire of my heart.
To the Reader. SEe, Christian brother, how in the worst times they were pre∣pared to die, & commended to God: if the Ancient Books did not pro∣claime this truth, some would not beleeue but that they had beene made in this latter time. But seeing the truth cannot be denyed. I desire thee with me to obserue these few col∣lections, arising out of due consideration of the premis∣ses.
1 Here is answer to that great question, how our fore∣fathers were saued, euen by the same faith as we are at this day. 2 How truly Christ per∣formed his promise: namely, that the gates of hell should not preuaile against the true faith, for so we see that in the vilest times this faith hath beene preserued. 3 Obserue how here is no touch, nor once mention of Purgatory, nor of any thing to be done for their good after this life. 4 Here is no relation to any pardons or indulgences from the Pope. 5 Here is no necessity laid downe of sending for a Priest to bring his hoste, and his Pix, and his Holy-Water, and
his Taper: These matters, it seemes, are rather comman∣ded & pressed vpon the peo∣ple, by the Romish Cleargy, then much regarded by the wiser and god her sort of our forefathers: neyther are they commanded to stay till the Priest come, but (saith the booke) let these prayers bee said, and the commendation of his soule, by one of the by∣standers. Lastly, let it bee obserued, that in all these prayers, and commendations, and questi∣ons (and these saith the booke are all that be of necessity to be said) here is not one smack of Popish Idolatry or super∣stition. In these respects I haue thought it no needlesse la∣bour to communicate these
to thee (deare brother,) I know there be store of godly Prayers and meditations al∣ready extant. But these are of a speciall vse more then others, and are venerable for their an∣tiquity, and are to be the more welcome, because God pre∣serued them in the hands of our very enemies. And though they were mingled with o∣ther things not so good; yet let vs know as S. Hierome tels vs, that it is no small point of wisedome, to seeke out gold out of mire and clay. Make vse of these, and helpe mee with thy prayers, and thou shalt shortly, if God permit, be partaker of more. Hereafter followeth an additi∣on of some new and late formes, and models of Prayer for sundry occasions, and purposes.
At thy vprising, thus, or in like manner commend thy selfe to God, saying. GRant, O good Father, that of thy mercy hast brought me to the beginning of this day, that in this same I may rise, and so walke in my calling, that thy name may be glorified, my conscience dis∣charged, thy seruant comfor∣ted, and all good men incoura∣ged by my example, for thy deare Sonnes sake, Amen.
Before thy going out, thus meditate. Morning Meditation. 1 THat many haue gone out of their houses abl and well, that haue neuer re∣turned backe aliue, as fo ought thou knowest may be∣fall thee. 2 Remember that thy con∣science shall bee the quiet in the night, when thou sh call to minde thou hast beg in the Lord, and so careful discharged thy duty in t day. 3 That to goe forth in
the world, is to encounter with many troubles, to passe some dangers, and to per∣forme many duties, and there∣fore rush not forth into such an vndertaking, before thou hast thus, or in like manner prayed to God to assist thee, without whose blessings and fauour towards thee, thou vn∣dertakest in vaine, for thy la∣bour will not prosper.
That done, thou maist thus further call vpon God in thy Morning Prayer. MOst gracious God, & mercifull Father, wee render vnto thee most humble and hearty thankes for all thy benefits thou hast from time to time bestowed vpon vs, as for the quiet rest and repose thou hast this night giuen vs, to the refreshing & strength∣ning of our wearied bodies, & mindes; so wee beseech thee likewise being thus renewed, and taken vp from that image of death, that laid vs in our
beds, the representation of our graues, to consider the waste of time, our owne liues, and decay of all sublunarie things, how with their easie lengths, their spannes and fadomes, since the comman∣dement was first giuen, Let there bee day, and night, and times, and seasons: they haue brought age and maturity, the sithes & sickles that haue reaped downe whole haruests of flesh, and laid generations in the dust. Teach vs, O Lord, with this remembrance to weigh our mortalitie, and so to frame our liues and actions thereafter, that when∣soeuer thy good will and pleasure is to binde vp our bones in peace and rest, wee may yeelde vp our soules and bodies into thy hands
with full confidence and assu∣rance that our sinnes are wash∣ed away in the bloud of that pure and immaculate Lambe, Christ Iesus, and shall not condemne vs. And to that end prosper vs wee pray thee, in all our actions, and giue good successe to our true en∣deuours, and then wee shall not attempt in vaine: and grant that this day, and all the daies of our life hereafter, may bee so accomplished by thy counsell, fauour, and directi∣on, that we may so beare our selues throughout this vale of misery, that at the last we may raigne with thee in glory. Amen.
Euening Meditations be∣fore thy going to bed. 1 REmember that many goe to bed, and neuer rise againe, till they bee awa∣ked by the sound of the last Trumpet; and therefore pre∣sume not to close thine eyes, till thou hast committed thy selfe into the hands of God by Prayer. 2 At the putting off of thy cloathes, thinke that the day is comming, when thou must be as barely vnstript of al thou hast, as thou dost now thy
selfe of thy cloathes. 3 Fixing thine eyes vpon thy bed, let it put thee in mind of thy graue; thy bed-clothes, of the mold of the earth, that must couer thee; the sheetes, of thy winding sheete; thy sleepe thy death; thy waking, thy resurrection. Then at thy lying downe, thou maist thus addresse thy selfe vp to God, saying: Into thy hands, most mer∣cifull Father, I commend my soule and body this night and euermore: be mercifull, graci∣ous and good vnto me, bless me, saue me, preserue and keepe me for thy deare mercy sake. Amen.
Or thus further with Dauid thou maist pray. I Will lay mee downe and rest in peace in thy mercy for it is thou Lord onely that makest me dwell in safety.
Euening Prayer to be said either before or after thy going into bed. O Eternall God, and om∣nipotent Father, which art the Lord of heauen and earth, of Angels and men, principalities, and powers, light and darknesse, day and night, in whose hands i contained that ouerflow o goodnesse, that filleth al the empty and indigent crea∣tures in the world, who or∣dainest times and seasons▪ successions and descents, old age and childhood, a begin∣ning and an ending, a rest and
labour, a perpetuall motion and change ouer all things in the world: the liuely witnesse whereof is this day, which not many houres since broke out of darknesse, and cleared the world with her light, and the Sunne arose as a Bridegrome out of his Chamber, and re∣ioycing as a Gyant to runne his course, whose beames are now steeped in darknesse, the true resemblance of all earthly glory, and transitorie pleasures and delights, which haue their increase, their height and sudden decrease againe, being no continu∣ance in any thing vnder the Sunne: and by this motion and change, the time is now come that thou hast appoin∣ted for rest, which, O Lord, so giue vnto vs, wee pray thee,
that thereby we may bee ina∣bled to walke more carefully in those duties and callings thou hast appointed vs. And further we beseech thee, that as the night darkneth and shadoweth al things, that they are vnseene: so for thy deare Christs sake, thou wilt hide all our sinnes from thy sight, that they neuer be brought to iudgement with vs; euer so remembring vs, that we neuer forget that fearfull and finall account that must bee rende∣red vnto thee, at the day of thy appearing: that as our bo∣dies hauing the rest of sleepe this night, so our mindes, through thy mercy in Iesus Christ, may inioy the rest of a quiet conscience for euer: and to that end let thy mercy and prouidence, so watch
ouer vs, that as our actions in the day, so our thoughts, nor our imaginations, neither watching, nor sleeping this night, may be such as may displease thee; but that all may tend to the good of our soules and bodies, and the honour and glory of thy great name, and that for Christ Ie∣sus sake, Amen. In whose most blessed name we conclude this our imperfect Prayer, in that absolute forme of Prayer that thy blessed Son hath taught vs to honour thee, saying: Our Father, &c.
A godly Prayer to bee said at all times. O Lord my God, what may I render vnto thee as an acceptable sacrifice, for all the benefits thou hast be∣stowed vpon mee? for my Election, Redemption, San∣ctification, and Preseruation from my youth vnto this pre∣sent day, and houre; that thou hast indued mee with health, strength, knowledge, continency, when so many more worthy then I, in mine owne eyes, are denied of these thy good fauours: for
all which I can giue no rea∣son for, but thy good plea∣sure▪ and if thou shouldest take all backe againe, I haue nothing to say, but that thou art iust: yet▪ O Lord, to these many I entreate thee adde this more, that I may keepe a heart that may truly acknow∣ledge them, and a tongue that may thankfully praise thee for them all the dayes of my life: and to that end I be∣seech thee, protect mee from all euill that may hurt mee, from all sinne that may of∣fend thee: be thou assistant to all my good in deuors, purpo∣ses, & intentions, and let thy good Spirit so rule my heart, that all that I shall doe, thinke or speake, may be to thy glo∣ry, and the good of all men: giue me, O Lord, a charitable
heart to relieue thee in thy members, a compassionate heart, to make other mens in∣firmities mine owne; a belee∣uing heart, that thy promises are yea, and Amen. And so blinde me not, O Lord, with the carnall man, that though I beleeue thou wilt one day raise my body from the bed of darknesse, when thou shalt say to the sea, Giue; and to the earth, Restore my sons and daughters; when no crea∣ture shall bee able to keepe backe one bone that it hath receiued, that I should de∣spaire in thee for a crust of bread in temporall mainte∣nance, and endeuour. Bee neere, O Lord, vnto all such as faithfully call vpon: thy name, comfort all such as be sicke, or comfortlesse, and by
daily and hourely presidents of death, and mortalitie be∣fore mine eyes; teach mee to bee mindfull of mine owne end, and to make my prepa∣ration by faith, and repen∣tance thereafter; that whe∣ther I liue, or die, I may rest with thee in thy eternall glo∣ry, through Iesus Christ, my onely Sauiour and Redeemer. Amen.
Agurs prayer for content. O Lord, giue mee neither erty, nor riches; feed me with food conuenient, lest I be too full, and deny thee; and say, who is the Lord? or lest I be poore and steale, and so take the name of my God in vaine; and if I aske any thing which is euill, deny my igno∣rance; if I aske any thing which is good, remember thy promise.
S. Augustines Prayer. Miserere mei Domine, in∣digna facientis, & digna pati∣entis. English. BE mercifull vnto me, O God, doing vnworthily vnto thee; and yet receiuing that from thee, that more wor∣thy then I are denied at thy hands; O Lord continue this mercy, and let not my ilnesse weary out thy goodnesse, for thy tender patient mercies sake. Amen.
A Thanksgiuing vnto God the Father. LEt all true Christians say, and acknowledge with one heart, and mouth: say also with them, O my soule, say in this mortall body, with∣out this mortall body, Glory, honour and praise bee vnto thee, most mercifull God, throughout all ages and ge∣nerations of the world, which hast not spared thine onelie Sonne, but offered him vp a bleeding sacrifice, for the sins of thy people, giuen him to death, euen to the death of the Crosse, for most wretched mankinde, to that end that
through him, we might bee saued, and deliuered from de∣struction, and brought into the liberty of euerlasting life: grant vnto vs, by thy Spirit that we may perfect, and con∣tinue in this thy grace and fauour, for euer and euer. Amen. Another short eiaculato∣ry praier English and Latine. ODeus omnium miserati∣onum, Pater, te praecor vt abissus misericordiae tuae absor∣beat abissum peccatorū meorum. O Father of goodnesse and mercy, I humbly intreat thee, that the depth of thy mercy may swallow vp the depth of my sinnes.
Martin Luthers Prayer. COnfirme in vs, O God, that which thou hast wrought, and finish the worke thou hast begun in vs, to the glory of thy name, and the sa∣uing of our soules at the dread∣full day of thy visitation, for thy deare mercies sake. Amen. A few short remembran∣ces, or most materiall rules of good life, for the practice of euery true Christian, here inserted. 1. FEare God: for not to feare him, is to feare e∣uery thing. 2. Loue thy brother: for if thou loue not him whom
thou hast seene, how shalt thou loue him whom thou hast not seene? 3. Bee charitable to the poore, which is to relieue Christ in his members, and be not greatly curious, so thou knowest them no notorious ill liuers; for if Lot, had beene so in the entertainment of his strangers, he had not receiued Angels in stead of men: and withall, because it is better to giue many counterfeits, then that one truly needy should depart vnreliued. 4. Sweare not, but what thou truly knowest: as to ma∣nifest a doubtfull truth, and that vpon vrgent occasion; for by an oath may God be great∣ly honoured, or dishonored. Honoured, as when we shall bring him to testifie a truth,
which is himselfe the God of truth: dishonor, whē we bring him to witnesse a falshood, which whosoeuer doth, the Lord will not hold him guilt∣lesse. And to auoid this, make conscience of thy word, and it shall be to thee as a oath: for it is the man that giues credit to the oath, more then the oath to the man. 5 Perswade thy selfe, ra∣ther then thy friend, to keepe thy counsell: and whatsoeuer discord shall arise betwixt thee and him; as thou tende∣rest the reputation of an ho∣nest heart, neuer let malice in hatred make thee to reueale, that which loue & friendship before boūd thee to conceale. 6 Hate no man, no not thy enemy, lest God loue him; for to hate where he loues, is a
fearefull opposition. 7 Whatsoeuer is deare vn∣to thy body, forbeare it, be∣ing any way preiudiciall to thy soule. 8 Desire in any thing, ra∣ther to bee in substance with∣out shew, then in shew with∣out substance. 9 Desire to liue godly: though poorely in this world, for hee that vngodlily dies rich, shall haue many mour∣ners to his graue, but few com∣forters at his iudgement. 10 Thinke of God with wonder, speake to God with reuerence, serue him in loue, obey him in feare, and doe no∣thing, but as in his presence and sight, & thou shalt liue the life of the godly, & go the way of the blessed, liue in his feare, and die in his fauour.
In laudem operis & Authoris. VVHat attribute's worth thy deseruing paine, (Deare friend) since thy endeuour blesseth vs, Whose serious houres, spent onely to reclaime The stubborne, stffe- neckt, and idolatrous? For what their fathers gathered with much care, For holy penitentiall legacies, Children peruert the deads will, and prepare,
Hardnesse of heart for their Apostasies. Goe boldly forwards, though they iudge like Dan, Our people with the gall of bitternesse: Yet vnto them be a Samaritan, Powre oyle into their wounds with cheerefulnesse: And blest be thy endeuour, and each thought, Till to the promist Land thy spirit be brought. W. Lort.
A conclusion to the Au∣thor and his Booke. TRadition and anti∣quity the ground, Whereon that erring Church doth so relie, Breakes out to light, from darknesse to confound The nouell doctrine of their heresie, Which plainaby these most sensible degrees, Doth point the wayes it hath digrest to fall; Where each obseruing iudgement plainly sees, From good to bad, from bad, to worst of all It is arriu'd: so that it can aspire,
Obscure, deface, sup∣presse, doe what it may, To blind this truth to no step any higher, By any policy it can essay. These holy Hymnes stuft with religious zeale, And meditations of most pious vse, Able their whole to wound, our wounded heale: Free from impiety, or least abuse, Blot out all merit, in our selues we haue, And onely, solely, doe on Christ rely. Offer not prayers for those are in the graue; Nor vnto Saints that heare not, doe not crie. Then in a word, since God hath these preseru'd
From the Inquisitors most cruell rage, Though in their worth they else might haue deseru' To passe among the good things of this age: Yet are in this respect of more regard, Since God would haue them to these times appeare, So many hauing perisht, and be heard With more true zeale, that God hath kept so deare. By all which I conclude: from thine owne heart, Thou wicked seruant, that might know & would no He hath discharg▪d himselfe in all and part; That would haue cur'd your Babel, but he could B. L. FINIS.
