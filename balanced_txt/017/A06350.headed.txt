The pa∣ter noster spoken of ye Sinner: God an∣swerynge him at euery pe∣ticyon.
The pr̄ nr̄ spoken of the sinner. ¶ The synner. O Oure father whiche arte in heuen / what a great space is be∣twene the and vs? Howe therfore shall we thy chil¦dren here on erthe / banysshed and exiled from the in this vale of mysery and wretchednesse / come home to the into our natu¦rall countrey? ¶ God. ☞ The chylde honoureth his father / & the seruaunt his mai∣ster. If I be your father / wher is myne honour? If I be your lorde / where is my feare? Ma¦lachias .i. For my name tho∣rowe you and by your meanes is blaspemed / rayled vpon / and euyll spoken of. Esaias .lii.
¶ The synner. ☞ Helas o father that is truth / we knowlege our synne and tre¦space / neuerthelesse / yet be thou a mercyfull father / and dele nat with vs accordige to our deser∣uynges / neither iuge vs by the rygorousnesse of thy lawe / but gyue vs grace that we maye so lyue / that thy holy name maye be halowed & sancttfyed in vs. And kepe oure hertes that we neither do nor speake / no / that we nat ones thinke our purpose any thynge / but that whiche is to thine honour and praise / and aboue al thīges make thy name and honour to be sought of vs / and nat our own name & vaine glorie. and of thy myghty
po∣wer brynge to passe in vs / that we maye loue and feare the / as a sonne his father. ¶ God. ☞ How can myne honour and name be halowed amonge you / whan your hertes and though∣tes are alwayes enclyned to e∣uyll / and ye in bōdage and cap∣tiuyte vnder synne: moreouer seynge that no man can synge my laude and prayse in a straū∣ge countrey. Psal. cxxxvi. ¶ The synner. ☞ O father that is truthe / we fele our membres / ye / and also the very hertes of vs prone and redy to synne / and that the worl¦de / the flesshe / and the deuyll / rule in vs / and expell the dewe honoure of thyne holye name. Wherfore we beseche the moste
mercifull father / for ye loue that thou hast vnto thy sonne Christ helpe vs out of this myserable bondage / and let thy kyngdom come to dryue out the synne / to lose the bondes of Sathan / to tame the flessh / to make vs righ¦tuouse and parfeyte / and to cle∣ue vnto the / that thou only mai∣ste raygne in vs / and that we maye be thy kyngdome and pos¦sessyon / and the obey with all our power and strength / bothe within and without. ¶ God. ☞ Whom I helpe / them I di∣stroye. And whom I make ly∣uynge / safe / riche / and good / them I kyll / condempne / and cast them awaye / make theym beggers / and brynge them to
nought. But so to be cured of me ye wyll nat suffre. Psalmo. lxxvii. Howe than shall I hele you / ye / and what can I do mo¦re? Esaias .v. ¶ The synner. ☞ That is to vs great sorowe and grefe / that we can neither vnderstande nor suffre thy hol∣som hande / wherfore helpe dere father / open our eyes / and wor∣ke pacience in vs / that we may vnderstande thi holesom hande and also paciētly suffre thy god¦ly wyll to be fulfylled in vs. Furthermore / though thy most holesome cure be neuer so payn¦full vnto vs / yet go forwarde therwith / punisshe / bete / cutte / burne / distroy / brīge to nought dampne / cast downe vnto hell /
and do what so euer thou wilte that thy wyll onely may be ful∣fylled and nat ours. Forbydde dere father / and in no wyse suf∣fer vs to folow our owne good thoughtes and imagynations / neyther to prosecute our owne wyll / meanynge / and purpose. For thy wyll and ours ar clene contrary one to the other / thyne onely good / though it otherwy¦se appere vnto our blynde reasō and our euyll / though our blin∣denesse se it nat. ¶ God. ☞ I am well serued and delte with all / that men loue me with their lyppes / and theyr hertes are farre fro me / and whan I take them
in hande to make them better and to amēde them / than rōne they backwarde / and in the middes of their cure / whi¦le their helth is a workyng / thei withdrawe them selues fro me: as thou redest. Psal. lxxvii. Conuersi sūt in die belli. They ar tourned backe in the daye of battayle. That is to saye / they which began well / and commit¦ted them selues vnto me / that I shulde take them in hande / and cure them / are gone backe fro me in tyme of temptation / and kyllynge of the flesshe / and are retourned to sinne and vnto dis¦honourynge of me agayne. ¶ The synner. ☞ O father it is true / no man can be strōge in his owne stren¦gth / in the seconde chapyter of the first of the Kynges. ye /
and who is able to suffre and a byde before thyne hande / if thou thy selfe strength & conforte vs nat: wherfore most mercyfull father take vs vnto thy cure / fulfyll thy wyll in vs / that we may be thy kingdome and inherytaūce vnto thy laude and praysynge. Also dere father / strength and confort vs in such busines with thy holy worde. Gyue vs oure dayly bred / graue & prynte thy dere sonne Iesus in our hertes / that we strengthed thorow him maye cherefully and gladly suf¦fer and endure the distroyenge and kyllynge of our wyll / and the fulfyllynge of thy wyll / ye / and shede out thy grace vpō all christente / and sende lerned pre¦stes and prechers to tech vs thy
sonne Iesus purely / and to fede vs with the worde of thy holy gospell / and nat with the dreg∣ges and chaffe of fables & mens doctryne. ¶ God. ☞ It is nat good to cast perles before swyne / neyther to gyue holy thinges / and the childrens bred vnto the dogges and hoū∣des. ye synne contynually with out ceassyng / and though I let my worde be preached amonge you neuer so moch / yet ye folow nat neither obey / but dispyse it. ¶ The synner. ☞ O father haue mercy on vs / and denye vs nat that breed of loue / it greueth vs fore / euen at the very herte rotes of vs / that we can nat satisfye thy worde and folow it. we desyre the ther
to haue pacyence with vs thy poore and wretched chyldrē and to forgyue vs our trespace and gyle / and iuge vs nat after thy lawe / for no man is rightu∣ouse in thy presence. Loke on thy promyses / we forgyue oure trespacers / and that wyth all our hertes / and vnto suche hast thou promysed forgyuenes / nat that we thorowe such forgyue∣nesse ar worthy of thy forgyue∣nesse / but that thou arte trewe / and of thi grace and mercy hast promysed forgyuenes vnto all them that forgyue their neygh∣bours / in this thy promyse ther¦fore is all our hope and truste. ¶ God ☞ I forgyue you ofte / & loose you ofte / & ye
neuer abyde sted∣faste / children of lytle fayth are ye / ye can nat watche and endu¦re with me a lytle whyle / but at¦tones fall againe into tēptatiō. Mathe. in the .xxvi. chapter. ¶ The synner. ☞ Weake are we o father / and feble / and the temptacyon great and manyfolde in the flessh and in the worlde. Kepe vs father with thy mightye power / and let vs nat fall in to temptatyon and synne agayne: but gyue vs grace that we maye abyde stā∣dynge / and fyght manfully vn∣to the ende / for withoute thy grace we can do nothynge. ¶ God. ☞ I am rightuous / and right is my iudgement / and
therfore synne may nat be vnpunisshed / ye / and ye must suffre euyll and afflictiō / and as touchyng that ye haue tēptatyon therby / that is your synnes faute only / whi¦che compelleth me thervnto / to kyll it & to heale you. For sinne can with none other medycyne be drawen out of you / but tho∣rowe aduersyte and suffrynge of euyll. ¶ The synner. ☞ For as moch than as aduer¦syte / trybulatiō / afflyction / and euyll / whiche fyghte agaynste synne gyue vs temptacyon / de¦lyuer vs out of theym / fynisshe thy cure / and make vs thorowe hole / that we losed from synne and euyll / maye be vnto the a kyngdome / to laude / to prayse / and to sanctify the. Amen
And seynge thou hast taught vs thus to praye / and hast pro∣mysed also to here vs / we hope and are sure that thou wylt gra¦ciously and mercyfully graūte vs our peticions for thi verites sake / and to the honourynge of thy trueth. Amen, Fynally some man wyll saye happely: what and if I can nat beleue that my prayer is herde. I answere. Than do as the fa∣ther of the possessed dyd in the .ix. of Marke / whā Christ sayd vnto him. Yf thou couldest be∣leue / all thynges are possyble vnto him that beleueth. The father answered: I beleue lorde helpe myne vnbelefe.
That is to saye: Hele myne vnbelefe / and gyue me perfyte belefe / and strength the weak∣nesse of my faith / & encrease it. AMEN ¶ Printed at London by Thomas Godfray. Cum priuilegio Regali.
