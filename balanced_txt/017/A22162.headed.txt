THe Kings most Excellent Maiestie, whose princely care and study is and alwayes hath beene to ease and releeue his louing Subiects in all their necessities, and to preuent all mischiefes and inconueniences which may befall vnto them: being certified by the right honourable Francis Lord Verulam Lord Chancellor of England, the right honourable Sir Henry Mountague Knight, Lord chiefe Justice of his Maiesties Bench, Sir Anthony Benn Recorder of the Citie of LONDON, and Sargeants and others learned in the Lawes: That in respect the Commissioners appointed for the execution of the Statutes against Bankrupts haue power to sell the lands, goods, chatels, debts and estates of all such as shall become Bankrupt, and are not bound to make any returne of their Commissions, nor of any of their doings, into any of his Maiesties Courts of Record, as all other Commissioners doe, but all their pro∣ceedings doe remaine in scattred papers, some with the Commissioners themselues, some with a Clerke of their owne appointment, and some with the Creditors, in such sort as those which doe buy the lands, goods, chattels, debts, and estates of such Bankrupts, being oftentimes called in question for them againe by the Bankrupt or his friends, haue no meanes to furnish themselues with the Copies of the arts and proceedings of the Commissioners, whereby they should defend their titles and interests to the same, neither are the copies thereof, as they haue beene vsed and made, so authentike as may be gi∣uen in euidence at trials, or pleaded. And that diuers other his Maiesties louing Subiects, who are often grieued and preiudiced by the decrees and orders of the Commissioners, and yet cannot see them in respect no record nor memoriall cer∣taine hath beene kept of them.
