A True Narration of the Title, Government, and Cause of the death of the late Charls Stuart King of England. THe Title of William the Conqueror, (by some sirnamed the Bastard) who first compelled our English Necks to bear his Norman Yoke, (whatever others may pretend) was by his sword only, by power whereof, his successors (even to this Charls Stuart, late King of England) have, as it were, forced the suffrage of the people to their several Elections and Coronations, and by the same power have maintained all their Actions, howsoever Injust, Tyrannous, and Il∣legal, contrary to that ancient, known, and re∣ceived opinion in Law, that the King is Singulis major, universis minor; by which unjust, usurped, and Tyrannous power of Kings, they are become indeed (instead of shepherds, careful to defend their flocks) most ravenous Wolves, whose panches are never longer full, then they are de∣vouring the silly sheep, as may most plainly ap∣pear in the late Bloody, and Tyrannous raign of this Charls Stuart, whose boundlesse prerogative (had his sword prevailed) had like a general in∣undation, at once swallowed up both the Laws of the Land, the Liberties of the Subject, the
Priviledges of Parliament; and turned the sweet, and pleasant streams of the Gospel (into that sea of Antichrist) into popish superstition. In the times of Peace, he was the most Covetous P. that ever raigned in England not caring how his Sub∣jects were impoverished or abused, so his private Coffers were inriched. He never cared to main∣tain the Laws,Witnesse the Mono∣polies, and Ship-mo∣ney. Witnesse the long vacancy of Parlia∣ments, and the Illegal, proceed¦ings a∣gainst the Earl of Castle ha∣ven; the overawing the Judges about ship∣money, and the Tyranni∣cal pro∣ceedings of the Star-Chamber. except such as conduced to his own particular profit, or to the augmenting his Prerogative to that unlimited Power, that his Will like the great Turks, might-command the lives and fortunes of all his subjects. In point of Religion, his intents may be easily discerned, by intruding the new liturgy on the Kirk of Scotland, and that too immediately after his Coronation there, he well knowing that it could be no way consistent with the Covenant by them taken, and maintained for some ages before, as also by en∣joyning, and compelling the Communion Tables in England to be removed, and set Altar wise, with Altar-worship, (thereby making way for the introducing of Popery,) it being contrary to the known Laws of this Kingdom: We let slip his ambition of rule, though by common fame sealed in his fathers blood. And fall to the point of that unparaleld piece of Tyrannie begun against the Scots, and since prosecuted against us, his late sub∣jects of England: To begin therefore with the Scots, who after many humble Petitions, and fruit∣lesse answers, were forced, for their own safeties, to take arms, yet with all submission (upon a Treaty, taking the Kings solemn engagement)
laid them down, notwithstanding the great charge they had been put to, and their unability to bear the same; after which peace, the end of war be∣ing then expected; the conditions of the Treaty were so well kept, that the Spring following they were again forced, (for their refuge) to take Arms, in which then successe is so notorious to all men, that the King not able to raise, or maintain an Army able to oppose them, was by necessity com∣pelled to call a Parliament, only (as by the issue it appeared) to borrow moneys, (without any intent to satisfie the Subiect) which when he found he could not accomplish, he not only suddenly dis∣solved, and imprisoned the Members, but by power of his own royal prerogative, as he cals it, (without consent of Parliament) endeavored to impose on the free people of England the heavy tax of Tunnage and Poundage; which when he found that he could not wade through,The Scots ly still ly∣able to be questioned for their first com∣ing into England, not being authorized by King, nor Parli∣ament. the Scots at that time being come into the Kingdom, ne∣cessity once more compelled him to call another Parliament, who in their wisdoms, Contracted with the Scots for a great sum of money to depart the Kingdom, and willingly condiscended that the King should go into Scotland, to compose, and settle businesses there; which was no sooner effected; and he well rid of the Scots, and recei∣ved into the City of London with Joy and Tri∣umph, but he had presently his design on foot, how to be rid of this Parliament also, which by reason of the Act of Continuation, could not be otherwise effected, then by bringing up his Nor∣thern
Army (not then, disbanded) which sailing, he resolved to render his Act of Continu∣ation (of Grace he called it) as fruitlesse as pos∣sible might be; whereupon he first makes way to send the Queen beyond Seas with the chief Jewels of the Crown, endeavoring, through her means, to move forraign Princes to send him aids, to make war upon his Rebellious Parliament, (as he called them) after whose departure, (contrary to all Laws, or the president of any his prede∣cessors) he associated with a company of rude and uncivil fellows, armed, came to the house of Commons to demand the five Members, and notwithstanding he received the assurance of the house for their forth-coming, never so much as brought in any Charge against them, but finding himself frustrated in that his Tyrannous design, immediately left the Parliament, and repaired to Windsor, where he mustered together many de∣boysed persons, and Cavaliers, with promise of great preferments, and moneys, if they would at∣tend him at York, which they accordingly did; he in the mean while trifling out the time (under the pretence of a Treaty about setling the Militia,) with the Parliament, first at Tyballs, after at Newmarket, & at last at York in the mean time, demanding the Town of Hull, and providing Arms, Money, and Men to make an Army (the Parliament not yet dreaming of any such matter) which he soon after performed, by setting up his Standard at Nottingham. And as this Army was trecherously raised, under the cunning pretence
of a Treaty; so he hath proceeded with them,Witness the falling on at Brainch∣ford, on Col. Hollis his Regi∣ment. to destroy the good people under the same colour ever since, so long as he had an Army; in which time, on both sides, above an hundred thousand of the good people of England have been murthered and destroyed. And since the said Armies by him raised, have been routed and dispersed, and he himself as a prisoner at the dis∣pose of Parliament and Army; how many new commotions (in Wales, Scotland, Kent, Essex, Surrey, and the West) he hath contrived (as much as in him lay) to the utter destruction of this whole Nation, is sufficiently manifest to all men, who are not more blinded in affection to the name of King, then in love with their own just liberties. And in the last Treaty in the Isle of Wight, it did most evidently appear to the High Court of Justice, upon the examination of sufficient wit∣nesses, That Charls Stuart (what pretences so ever he made, or what assurances soever he pretended to give) never did, nor ever would decline the late murther of his Subjects, but would ever ap∣prove it as an act most just. Yet notwithstanding all these tyrannies (so unwilling were the Parlia∣ment to depose him, much more to take his (long since forfeited) life; that had he not sent his two sons beyond Seas, with Commission to in∣vade this Nation, and to rob and murther his good Subjects, both by Sea and Land (and at this very instant time of Treaty, plotted and en∣devored a new disturbance, by all means, labor∣ing to engage the City of London to joyn with
him in the same bloody designe) he might have yet remained unquestioned. Thus having given the Reasons that forced on the Kings ruine, and in him the disabling the Norman Line for the future. All those that are true lovers of Liberty, the Laws, Religion, and the Kingdoms welfare, may both feel and see themselves unloosed from the Norman Yoke, un∣der which our forefathers have suffered for the space of five hundred sixty and two yeers; for which let all true Englishmen rejoyce, and with the Author, cry, Vivat Lex, Exercitus, vera Religo Senatus populusque Angliae. FINIS.
