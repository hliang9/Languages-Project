THE Great Case OF TOLERATION Stated, And endeavoured to be resolved in order to Publick Security and Peace. With Allowance. LONDON, Printed and Sold, by Andrew Swole at the Three Keys, in Nags-Head-Court, in Grace-Church-Street, over-against the Conduit, 1688.
THE Great Case OF TOLERATION Stated, And endeavoured to be resolved, in order to publick Security and Peace. Three things are to be considered on this Subject, First, Whether Toleration be consistant with the very nature and design of Christian Religion? Secondly, Whether it be reconcileable to the best Rules of Government and Policy? Thirdly, Whether it stands with our safety in the pre∣sent Conjuncture and posture of Affirs? And if all these can be made good in the Affirmative, I know not what can be more desired, and why it is not seasonable to be Established and made Perpetual. TO the first Point, If there is some reallity mixt with so much profession and talk of Religion as is now in the World; If there is indeed a design of Gods Glory, and the Pleas of Conscience are not fictitious and pretended; let Man but
consider the nature of his Government over the World, which is to be glorified in afree and voluntary Obedience of his Rational Creatures, and such is to be pure, not forced, and nothing besides his own Command an inducement to it. How doth he disclaim it by the Prophet, Isa. 29.13. When their Fear towards me is taught by the Precepts of Men. How well this place agrees with that Com∣pulsion to the Sacrament, or such a Communion, let any one judge that will not pervert the mind of Scripture, and the nature of true Obedience. Chrisostom brings us an Argument why Men should be perswaded,Cited by Dr Hammon, of Death-Bed Repen∣ance, Sect. 35. not forced, to Reformation of any Fault or Error, because God rewards not those that upon necessity abstain from Evil, but only those that voluntary do it. If a Mans Servant would not do such a thing barely upon his own Masters Command, but another Person must first compel him, & then he doth it; What honour will it be to him, or will he care for such Service? Doth God want the aid of Man to make others Obedient unto him, sure∣ly not, nay it cannot be done by outward Violence; one hereby may be brought like a Beast to the Sacrifice, but still there is no∣thing of the subjection of the Mind. God values not hypocritical Services or a meer external submission, he may be as well glorified in having Bullocks or Goats, for they become subject unto the ut∣most, even to Death; but if Man who can give, if he requires, an Offering of a free Heart, which is only in his own power, not to be exerted by any human Authority, for this cannot reach so far, and if it could, yet it coming from that would not be accepted: I might multiply many Texts, but what would they all signifie? for there is a common custom through the proud and disdainful Igno∣rance, but yet Cunning of Men, to slight over what they cannot An∣swer, they are so presumptuous as to put off all means from the Word of the all-wise God for Foolish and Canting, which make against their own corrupt doings, though themselves will make use of them to maintain their own Interest and Humour against a diffe∣rent Perswasion; to such all these kind of Arguments signifie no∣thing, and truly no more need to be added, seeing so many are brought to this purpose by Dr. Taylor, in his Liberty of Prophesie, that even all those that have the Reputation for so much Learning & Reason cannot give a perfect and satisfactory Answer to them, they
have been and are now challenged to do it, for the Opponant is worthy their contending with, and it would be for their secular Ad∣vantage to keep up the Grandure and State of their Communion, and also their own Honour, and undoubtedly it had been done long since if possible; but that excellent Author argees so conclusively from Scripture, Reason, Primitive Authority, as is a demonstrati∣on it was the very Truth he contended for, which he made further clear. Some object That of Church Censures in the Primitive Times; but there was a great and manifest diversity between them, and what was lately used amongst us; for they were inflected on gross Here∣ticks, and they are only so on whom the Apostle speaks, Tit. 3.10, 11. And besides for scandalous Sins, the Incestuous Person, Adulte∣rers, Drunkards, and such like, and not for little Errors or diffe∣rence in Judgment, as just the contrary hath been used among us, that even it was a shame for Men to act such Severities towards Men, likewise much less should Christians; every one that hath but the com∣mon goodness & resentment of human Nature must abhor them; they did most stir up, whose duty it was in meekness to instruct Oppo∣sers, and hereby they gave occasion to indifferent and considering Persons to think (though they might have waved this) as if they wanted Arguments to convince, for there is also ratio ultima Cleri, who should teach Mercifulness, Love, Forbarance, Meekness, they did practice the contrary, as if what so many do make their Craft, was in danger to be set at naught, as they had run so far from the Practice and Experience of former times, whether that of Ezekiel 34.4. (The Diseased have ye not Strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was Sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken, nei∣ther have ye brought again that which was driven away, neither have ye sought that which was lost; but with Force and with Cruelty have ye ruled them) hath not been fulfilled in these latter Days, let any one seri∣ously reflect, and the true cause of all our Divisions, Sects and Par∣ties may not be learned from what is said in this Chapter. There might be many other things urged, but they have been al∣ready in Books, and there is no need of further Printing, where its granted by all unprejudiced, uninterested Men, by those who  discern any thing of themselves, and are not led by the Nose by them who meet for their Pride and Profit more then for the Truths
sake, as may be considered, because they will not comply with what they seem to teach, with obedience to the Truth, that they who are appointed Officers of Christs Kingdom, will not consent it should be so as he himself hath ordained it, he could have commanded twelve Legions of Angels, planted his Religion as the Imposter Mahomet did by the Sword, but he used none but that of his Mouth, no more did any of the first Founders thereof, and the same Word is con∣veyed down to us, which is able to keep the Fear and Worship of God in the Hearts of Men, (if managed aright) without aid from the civil Authority. Where the Rulers were Heathen, and set a∣gainst him, he did make good his Dominion over Men by Miracles, and an extrordinary Power and Assistance, but now they are Christi∣an, they are to give God the things that are Gods, a permission on∣ly that his Word and Truth be freely, and without molestation made known unto Men. The Divine Will and Pleasure should instant∣ly silence all other Reasons, and in a Christian Country all should comply there-with out of respect to him, without any further need of Argument, if People were indeed willing and obedient unto him, as he who at this present knoweth the Secrets of all Hearts, will one day judge and manifest them; yet in this degenerate Con∣dition of the World, or Apostacy from God, notwithstanding all their seeming to Honour him with their Lips, the Devotion and Obedience they pretend to give him, yet this is the most inconside∣rable Argument, and hath the least effect upon Men, and therefore we are to descend to the other. The first Consideration is from fu∣ture and invisible things, yet the certainty and greatness of them would take away this prejudice, for they also will be present and before us; for every Day the Gate of Death opens unto them, and single Persons enter in, and the most Healthful and Lustiest of us all haste to it; but seeing what is now seen and done doth most affect, therefore Peace and Safety, Conveniency and Interest came in, and is to be suspected will principally determine the Case; and so the second Question is somewhat to be discussed. Whether Toleration be reconcileable to the best Rules of Government. The end of which is Peace, that every one may live quietly and have his own, be Loyal and Obedient unto the King, Loving and
Kind to one another; now it is strange that Religion, which relies wholy upon Mans Obedience unto God, as he hath the same from all the Created Beeings of the World, which keeps them all in or∣der; so to Man, who is fitly called the little World, there being the like necessity to maintain Peace on Earth, and good will towards Men, as to keep up the whole course of Nature, yet this should be turned into Rebellion, Disobedience and Confusion. We learn hereby what is the difference of things in their own Nature, and in their Corruption. Think ye I come to send Peace on the Earth, I tell ye nay, but the Sword, said the Author of our Profession, and it hath been found true; for as all his Laws and Precepts are most excel∣lently contrived, as to the first, so upon the abuse and non-comply∣ance with them, the contrary effect hath followed. Who hath seen worse Subjects then the Religious? and yet it cannot be denied but the Gospel as strictly injoyns Loyalty, as any other Duty what∣soever, and tends very much to the Benefit and Welfare of the Common-Wealth. What can be the reason of all this, but only the Hypocrisie of some, and Ignorance of others? some who made this a bare pretence, and other silly Persons who were beguiled with it. That of Acts 4.19. hath been in every ones Mouth, but then the Established Laws of those Countries were against the Christian Religion in general: When the Governors became Christi∣ans, then sprang up Divisions and Errors, and then they began to take unto, and maintain one side, the differing Parties still thought themselves in the right, and the aforesaid place applicable to them also, and have hence taken occasion to behave themselves after the same manner as St Peter did: Others taking Advantage of their simplicity and real meaning, using them as Instruments to carry on their ambiti Designs and secular Interests; thus the Fire kindled and came forth into a Flame; I cannot so clearly express my self, and it would be tedious to run over the exact particular manner, but let any Impartial and Prudent Person examine this one thing, and consider it throughly, Whether constraint in matters of Reli∣gion hath not occasioned all the Disloyalty, wherein this was made the least pretext, or made any noise, not only in the four last Raigns in this Nation, but in all Christendom, and those several Ages since Christ and his Apostles were upon the Earth, how it occasioned those Persecutions and Cruelties even towards them and their Follow∣ers,
and after when it came likewise to be Established in Countries, (as Heathenism and Jewdaism were before) then (as afore noted) Divisions did arise and increase, and the Secular Authority descend∣ing, and interesting it self as to them, hereby became Trouble, and Insecure either by secret Plots and Conspiraces, or if strong enough, the open Seditions of those that smaried under it; Flesh and Blood are apt to be Mutionous, thinking it better to resist then be tamely Beaten, but when mistaken Conscience and deluded Zeal do further stir up, then it is much more so: At this time the crafty Politians came in, who were acted by Ambition and Interest, and did first lead along, and then became Leaders of the Faction. Now these had wanted a Pretext, and the other had not so much as had an Errone∣ous Principle to have gone by, had it not been for their aforesaid Compulsion. In truth the actings of both are Sinful and Unchristi∣an, in the one designed Hypocrisie, in the other it was Ignorance of that certain Duty of passive Obedience and Suffering for Conscience sake, rather then speaking Evil, and much less then, to lift up the Hand against the Lords Anointed; but as long as Covetousness and Pride did instigate the first, and when a sly Temptation did offer it self to the latter for avoiding the Cross, by those means which were disputable, and did not appear to them directly unlawful, the De∣vil who acts at the bottom of all human Affairs, can raise a fair ap∣pearance to excuse from outward Pain and Inconveniences; the il∣lusions of the Spirit of Error, and the Reasonings of the Carnal Man prompt them any way to save themselves from the Storm; one may thus trace out all the Factions and Rebellions that ever were, wherein Religion did make any noise, or was the least concerned, Cssnte causa, cessat effectus. Here some will cry, But this will be the way to let  Heresie, Er∣ror, and a thousand Inconveniences; but the Civil Magistrate is not so imediately concerned as to them; indeed himself is but a Potsherd of the Eartn, though of the greatest size, and consequently hath the same relation to that God with whom we have all to do, and therefore in general is obliged to keep up the Worship and Fear of God, and the right Faith contained in the Scriptures (if he would leave all things as they are there, and with the Muscovites forbid all Disputes) however that the Fundamentals be thought no more then comprized in the Apostles Creed, and what were judged by the
four first Councils as absolutely necessary to Salvation; if he per∣mit nothing to them of holy Life, and his own Government, but there is a distinct order of Men to convince Herericks and detest Error, the Weapons of whose Warfare ought to be Spiritual and not Carnal, Truth is strong and will prevail, for the Fundamentals here mentioned we are assured, but for all under them, or what may be immagined to be deduced from them, for that infinite num∣ber of Consequences and Questions among us, we know not what is Heresie or Error; it is not sufficient alone, when some have got the established Laws of their Country on their side, to call others Herericks and Erronious, which is sonner done then proved, and here too often happeneth, according to the old Proverb, The greatest Fool, &c. For though I do for my part believe the Church of England comes as near to the Primitive Pattern as any now in being, and that her Con∣stitutions are good and true, except some disputable Points which cannot be otherwise, when they come down to such particular De∣privations, as some may be seen in the Thirty nine Articles, yet if a false and corrupted Church should get the upper Hand, it would be an hard case if the bare forwardness and confidence of them should damm all others to Hell, but that not being in their Power is only Brutum fulmen; but what is worse, Oppress them here on Earth, who will not likewise be carried away with their Corruption, & so really involve themselves into that wherein they did only frighten & abuse them, for those Controversies and Questions were a fooling, they are rather the Skirts and Borders then the Substance of Religion; and it will be sad and riged to tye and confine Salvation unto any of them: What or who shall determine between the right and wrong? The Scriptures would do it even now, if sincerely considered with∣out Pride and Worldly end; however the Son of God is to judge out of them of every Mans Work; and were it not better to think the Truth. and follow his Directions, to go on peaceably now we are in the way to the same place which we all aim at and in some measure to begin that here, that is to be our Happiness hereafter, though all ignorant Zeal and Animosity cannot be laid aside, yet good Men in this Life should have that pretious Disposition where∣in their Spirits are to be made perfect, and all those things to be done away which render Conversation unpleasant in the World, but seeing this is not to be had, what ever bickering there may be
among fellow Subjects, which is also wished it might be hindered as much as possible, is but as the Squabbling of Children amongst themselves, and the Father of our Country might take his effectual care to keep his Authority over them, and yet be safe by letting them alone with their little Wranglings; he may be pleased to lash them into Peace and Quietness, but if he should side with any this would turn the rest against him. That vain Jangling, and many of those Questions in Religion now agitated amongst us, if compared with the weightier matters of the Law, do not deserve a better com∣parison then this, and for what Differences seem more material, why may they not still remain in that Liberty God hath left them? One Mans Opinion may vary from another, as he doth in Complexion and Stature, and still they are equally Men; one may Worship God after this manner, another after that, as long as God is Worshipped and Served he may be Glorified every way, for he hath prescribed no exact manner or form in his Word, only expressing himself a∣gainst the Sacrifice of false hypocritical & outward Devotion, when separated from the inward and spiritual. His appointed meanes are allowed, that all may be saved and come to the knowledge of the Truth: Indeed there is so little of the very Heart and Substance of Religion in those distinguishing Characters of Communion among us, that why may it not be also applyed, that in every Sect and Party, He that serveth God and worketh Righteousness is accepted with him, for to this alone do the Promises belong, without any mention of such a National Church or Congregation, the Kings Authority is subordinate and dependant on the Divine, he doth ex∣cellently discharge his Obligation by restoring unto God the imedi∣ate Dominion over the Souls of Men; as it is the best Policy, for every one of what ever Condition in this present Life to be faithful unto God, so for him who is his best among Men, in that he layeth the best Foundation for the Security and Happiness of his Government. In those Countries where Toleration is allowed, they have none, or very rarely Rebellions or Seditions, this manner of Policy some States have taken, for they are the most unsafe kind of Goverments, but by this way have made it most Secure, so that the Deduction is obvious, if what is in it self insecured be yet preser∣ved this way, much more would that excellent, and in it self safe. Form of Monarchy, be the more firmly Established.
As to the last Question, Whether it stands with our Safety in refe∣rerence to the present Conjunction and Posture of Affairs? I do not pretend to understand the intregues and Secrets of State; but if things are so indeed, as they are represented outwardly, if his Majesty may be believed (as my Chariy doth incline me so to do) who hath made so many Protestations, and in the most solemn manner as can be well expressed, that he hath no further Design then what is mentioned in his Gracious Declaration, that all things shall be continually observed as there specified, then there can be no such Danger as is surmised, and some People are so forward to instil into the Minds of his Subjects, fears of Popery and altera∣tion of Government is the general Whispering of those who have called the like in others, not many Years since, The Vice of Faction and Sedition, by the most subtil kind of Perswasion, (objecting to all those Folly and want of fore-sight who are not of the same Mind) they mightily get them over to their Opinion, raising more terrible Presages and Apprehensions then is ground for them. It hath been observed of an Order of Men, that going out of their Professions, and meddling with matters of State, have done more Mischief, and caused more Disturbance to Coun∣tries, then of all Callings or Trades besides, whether it holds true at this Day, let any one judge; all goes under the Name of Con∣science, but upon the strict scrutiny, it will appear Pride and Inte∣rest bares the greatest sway; if these were good Men, as all would be thought so, and it is hoped and believed many are, then them∣selves are not for being Lords over Gods Heritage; they will not stand so much for wordly Pride or Grandure, which is contrary to their spiritual Vocation, and they Condemn others for beyond Sea: If they believe in him whose Ministers (they say) they are, and will take their Lot with him whose Kingdom is not of this World, then they will not stand up so stifly for Temporal Juris∣diction and Command; but as it is most remarkable they should Live well and handsomely as other Men, and as the Necessity and Merrit of the Function is beyend any whatsoever, in respect of the good it doth unto Men, in Gods Name, as some little requital thereof, let them still enjoy the already Established, or greater Maintenance; for my part I do sincerely wish it were much better, and more equally disposed for the encouragement of good and
honest Men, and therefore if they have all the further assurance that possibly can be given, that they still have their Church Posses∣sions and Rights, and so it shall be as to Abby Lands, which are vested in the Gentry, and other Lay Men; if all the Care and Caution which can be thought of, as to this matter; if this be made as sure to them as Magna Charta, and Men have of their other Estates and Liberties; if they have all the Satisfaction and Assu∣rance that may be any ways proposed or found out, this would be the best Expedient to end those Fears and Jealousies, to allay the thoughts of Heat. If that which is already the Principal and E∣stablished Religion of this Country, be still confirmed and ratified so to be: If all Churches and happels, or Publick or Consecra∣ted Places be for the service of that only, and none be suffered be∣sides to enter into them; if to prevent Confusion and Disorder it be so provided, that one Communion doth not interfere with or molest the other; if that they keep within themselves, and use not the least outward Violence, nothing to be permitted beyond fair Argument and Perswasion, that all Truth may stand on equal ground and advantage, I know not why they should be against it, who have the most on their side, and the ablest Champions to de∣fend it: I would in no wise be thought to prescribe to my Superiours, but with the greatest Humility & Submission beg leave to offer thus much, that some Expedients they may find out, for the firm and happy Establishment of things: When reasonable Proposals are laid before any, and not accepted, it is a sign there is somewhat further in it then one sees, or is aware of; if there is no design but what is visible on all hands, if the end be sincere and good, the common means of Safety are neer and obvious.
