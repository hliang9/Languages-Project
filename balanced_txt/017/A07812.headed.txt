OF THE INSTITVTION OF THE SACRAMENT OF THE BLESSED BODIE AND BLOOD OF CHRIST, (by some called) THE MASSE OF CHRIST, Eight Bookes; Discovering the Superstitious, Sacri∣legious, and Idolatrous Abominations OF THE ROMISH MASSE. TOGETHER WITH The Consequent Obstinacies, Overtures of Perjuries, and the Heresies discernable in the DEFENDERS thereof. By the R. Father in GOD THOMAS L. Bishop of Coventry and LICHFIELD. LONDON, Printed by W. Stansby, for ROBERT MYLBOVRNE in Pauls Church-yard at the signe of the Grey-hound. MDCXXXI.
VTRIVSQVE ACADEMIAE CANTABRIG. & OXON. Praeclaris Luminibus ac Ornamentis; coeteris∣que Sacrae Theologiae candidatis, & sin∣cerioris Literaturae Studiosis Gratiam & salutem in CHRISTO IESV. SIquanto amoris studio Vtramque Academiam persequor, tanto Honoris testimonio adornare eas possem (Ʋiri Clarissimi) certè quidem hoc qualecunque Opus meum, vestro praesertim nomini inscriptum, usque adeò excellens & singulare fuisset, ut nec ad conciliandam gratiam Cujusquam, nec ad veniam deprecandam Praefatione a∣liquâ indigeret. In quo tamen si quaefortè vobis occurrant (ut sunt sanè plurima) nullo hactenùs, ex nostris parti∣bus, Authore praevio, in medium prolata; vestrae perspi∣cacitatis erit, quanti momenti illa fuerint, dijudicare: quorum duntaxat Apices aliquot saltem attingere operae∣pretium esse duxi. Sacramento Eucharistiae Resp. Christiana nihil un∣quàm sublimius, nihil sanctius habuit atque Augustius,
quo Christiani quodammodò in Christum ipsum transfor∣mamur. Hujus Institutionem in frontispicio libri, ex a∣liorum placitis, MISSAM appello: quam vocem ali∣quis fortassis omissam nimis velit. Quin estotu bono ani∣mo, quisquis es pius zelôtes, & Papisticae Missae exosor vehemens. Etenim nomen [Missa] secum omen suum apportat, quod cum à Dimittendis ijs, qui Eucharistiae participes esse nolunt, ortum suum traxit, Romanam Missam planè ingulat, quae (veluti Amasios suos) Spectatores meros omnibus lenocinijs ad se allicit atque invitat; ac si in illo uno Theatrico spectaculo Religio ip∣sa Christiana ferè tota consisteret: quos tamen Antiqui∣tas Catholica, apud Graecos , apud Latinos Dis∣cedere iussit; & in persistentes, ut in homines praefra∣ctos & impudentes, graviter acerbéque invecta est. Haec de Operis Titulo praefari mihi libuit, nè in isthoc voca∣bulo Missae, veluti in ipso vestibulo, impegisse videar. Ex parte Operis primâ, quam Practicam dicimus, constat Institutionis Christi Canones decem, per Tri∣dentinos Canones, in Romana Missa perfringi ju∣giter & violari; sed maiori nè impudentiâ, an impietate difficile est dicere: nam in Depravationibus istis patro∣cinandis mille annorum Consuetudini universali antepo∣nunt sequioris aetatis Diutissimè, scilicet, retentam (ut aiunt) trecentorum annorum modernae Ecclesiae Romanae (en!) sapientioris usum contrarium. De∣indè Praeceptum praximque Apostolicam à Pontifi∣ce Rom. Abrogari posse garriunt: quin & adversus Exemplum Christi, multis retrò seculis vel ab ipsis Rom. Pontificibus sanctè religiose{que} observatum, ob∣tendunt Consuetudinem contrariam habendam es∣se
pro lege: hoc parum est, quià, quamvis de contrario Praecepto Christi constaret, nihilominùs Ius ipsum divi∣num à Pontifice Romano relaxari posse, Iesuita blasphemo ore pronunciat. Sequitur pars altera, quam Dogmaticam nomina∣mus, in multa Membra se diffundens, ità tamen ut ho∣rum verborum Christi [HOC EST CORPVS MEVM, &c.] Expositioni literali Mysterij Romani de Eucharistia moles tota nitatur. Quanquàm dùm in istis explicandis Adversarij nostri, Tridentinorum Pa∣trum spiritu afflati, Tropum omnem ab eisdem longè exulare iubent; ipsi tamen (quae est vertigo mera) Tro∣pos sex, velint nolint, coguntur agnoscere. Porrò in una particula [HOC] totius Controversiae cardo verti∣tur: de qua cum quaeritur, quid ea propriè designet, Pon∣tificij Doctores in duas, eas{que} contrarias, Opiniones distra∣huntur. Alij enim per, Hoc, Christi corpus denotari vo∣lunt; alij ad aliud (quod ipsi commenti sunt) Indivi∣duum Vagum Pronomen illud referunt: ità ut utri{que}, Andabatarum more, à se invicèm vapulent, dùm hi priorem sententiam prorsùs Absurdam, illi posteriorem Absurditatum plenam non dicunt modò, verúm etiam solidis Argumentis evincunt. Iam igitur, hoc uno fundamento ipsorum Pontificiorum Contradictioni∣bus (ut olim Turris Babel) diruto at{que} dejecto, alia de Transsubstantiatione, de Corporali Christi Praesen∣tia, Coniunctioneque cum corporibus Communi∣cantium, de propriè dicto Sacrificio, & de divina deni{que} Adoratione, superstructa portentosa Dogmata omnia corruere, & labefactari necesse est. De singulis, si pla∣cet, pauca delibemus.
Primo in loco Transubstantiationis non Dogma modò, sed & vox ipsa (multò aliter quàm pisces) novita∣te sua foetent. Ecquid habent, quod opponant? nonnihil, nempè, Patres antiqui (inquiunt) de Conversione hujus Sacramenti verba facientes, Transformationis, Tran∣sitionis, Transmutationis, Transelementationis vo∣cabula frequenter usurpârunt: unde ipsissimam suam Transsubstantiationem dilucidè probarigens Romana clamitat & vociferatur. Cum tamen Adversarios no∣stros minimè lateat, eosdem Sanctos Patres pariliberta∣te sermonis iudicij{que} synceritate easdem voces singulas ad alias conversiones transtulisse, ut (exempli gratiâ) nunc Verbi praedicati in Auditorem, nunc Corporis Chri∣sti in Ecclesiam, nunc hominis Christiani in Christū, nūc deni{que} Corporum Christianorum in ipsam Chri∣sti carnem. Ʋndè sequitur, quâ ratione praeclari isti Disputatores unam duntaxat Transsubstantiationem astruere conantur, eâdem ex ipsa lege Parium (ô homi∣nes miserè fascinatos, alios{que} miserrimè fascinantes!) qua∣tuor alias tenentur admittere. In Membro tertio partis Dogmaticae quaestio de Cor∣porali praesentia Christi in Eucharistia agitatur; quae{que} hùc pertinent omnia ad hoc unum Caput reducuntur; Quid sit illud, quod, iuxta Christi institutionem, iam dicitur [Corpus meum?] Hoc Catholica Ecclesia per multa secula ab Apostolicis us{que} temporibus nullum aliud esse credidit, quàm quod à B. Virgine natum, u∣num, uno in loco Definitum, seu circumscriptum, Organicum quo{que}, & demùm Sensuum omnium absolutissimâ integritate juxtà & Gloriae perfectione cumulatissimâ praeditum. At quod Romanenses Car∣bonarijs
suis Discipulis obtrudunt, Deus bone! quale Corpus, & quàm minimè illud MEVM? Primò (id enim natura Transsubstantiationis necessariò exigit) Corpus, quale Pistores pinsunt, ex pane confectum; mox Corpus (nam{que} hoc discontinuitas locorum per se postu∣lat) multiplex, quale Geryonis illud fuisse fingitur: post, Corpus, (quià non definitivè in loco) quale esse nullum potest, Infinitum: dein Corpus, (quia totum in qualibet parte loci) quale quis vix somniare potest, Paraphysicum: insuper Corpus (ut ipsi aiunt) omni movendi, sentiendi, intelligendique facultate desti∣tutum, id est, coecum, surdum, exanime: Corpus de∣ni{que} nullis non sordibus cuiusvis sterquilinij, & locorum, quae honestè nominari non possunt, inhonestissimorum obnoxium. Qualia Opinionum portenta, ut omninò Hae∣retica, veteres Patres semper execrati sunt. Ʋerùm enimverò diversarum aetatum subrancidas, Historias, si numeremus, Tredecim proferunt, in qui∣bus memoria de verissimae carnis, verissimique sangui∣nis Christi in Eucharistia Apparentiâ verissimâ Le∣ctoribus commendatur. In quibus Miraculis, tanquàm in Dei testimonijs omni exceptione majoribus Adversa∣rij nostri mirificè gloriantur; & dici vix potest quanto∣perè miseros mortales hâc una Persuasione sua dementa∣runt: cùm tamen haec verissima, scilicet, si ponderentur, vanissima esse singula apparebunt. In quem finem bonis illis Historicis valedicentes, rectà Scholas petimus, explo∣raturi an Scholastici eandem insanirent insaniam. Hi tantum abest ut istis Legendarijs fidem assensionemve praebeant, ut in eiusmodi Apparitionibus vel veram carnem Christi, vel omninò veram carnem inesse
ausint non pernegare modò, verum-etiam contrariam hanc suam sententiam exquisitis rationibus defendere. Quanquam quid horum probatione opus est? quandoqui∣dem nemoferè est tàm muccosis naribus (modò non sen∣sus suos prorsus obstruat) cui non suboleat, imò qui non eas legendo planè odoretur, & persentiscat has fabulas à maleferiatis hominibus aniliter esse confictas. Quarto, In Corporali sua (ut vocant) Christi con∣junctione cum Corporibus Communicantium ni∣hil aliud cernere licet quam Capernaiticam quandam stupiditatem; quoties Pontificios audimus antiquas suas canere Cantilenas: se nimirùm Dentibus terere, gut∣turibus deglutire, hoc est, ut nos quidem interpretamur, verè devorare; atque insuper hominum visceribus permiscere; imo tàm canum, murium{que}, nec non vilissimi cujus{que} animalis intestinis, quàm vllius etiam sanctissimi viri, qui illius particeps esse potest. Quis deinceps miretur fuisse olim qui Philosophos se dicerent, qui asserebant, Nivem sibi atram videri, Coelum consistere, & Ter∣ram motione suâ eâ{que} perpetuâ rotari? Hosce scopulos praetervecti, in Contentionum labyrin∣thum dilabimur, de Sacrificio Missae, tot Amphibolo∣gijs & verborum involucris, tot Opinionum Antilogijs, ceu viarum anfractibus, & sinuosi Maeandris undique implicitam, ut abs{que} commoda aliqua Distinctione diffi∣ciles, imo impossibiles habeat explicatus; eò{que} magis, quòd apud veteres Patres (ut quod res est liberè fateamur) de Sacrificio Corporis Christi in Eucharistia Incruento frequens est mentio. quae dici vix potest quantopere quo∣rundam, alioqui Doctorum hominum, ingenia exercue∣rint, torserint, vexaverint; aut econtrà quam jactantèr Pontificiy de ea re se ostentent: cum tamen hic nodus uno
hoc Distinctionis quasi cuneo facilè discindatur. Cor∣pus Christi dupliciter sumitur, velut Subjectum Cele∣brationis Eucharisticae, velut Objectum ejus. Si Subje∣ctivè accipiatur pro eo, cui externa Accidentia insunt, tùm non potest non Corporalem Praesentiam Christi designare: sin verò Objectivè tantùm, habitâ Relatione ad Christi corpus, vel ut olim in cruce pendentis, vel ut nunc in Coelo regnantis, Praesentiam duntaxat Symbo∣licam declarat; quoniam Objectum, licet rei cruentae, ut in Scaena, ipsum est tamen Incruentum. Id quod sex Argumenta, ex veterum Patrum testimonijs depromp∣ta, dilucidè demonstrant. Eadem igitur Distinctione quivis poterit ità prorsùs , ut non habeant quod contrà mussitent. Quid? quod praetereà etiam Romana Missa Grandis Sacrilegij rea arguitur. Ad extremum, extremae & nefandae Idolomaniae Rom.  ipsum, quae est Sacramenti Eucharistiae divina Adoratio, in medium protrahitur; ubi id, quod adorant, Posse esse adhuc Panem, propter ferè infini∣tos Defectus, ipsi Adversarij ultrò concedunt: & Nos, Non posse illud non panem esse, juxta Ʋeterum sen∣tentiam, ex Rationibus circiter sexdecim evicimus: at{que} etiam quas Adorandi Formulas, ceu Pretextus, excu∣sationis ergò, sibi tanquàm larvas induxerunt, illis detra∣ximus, ut vultus eorum deformes horridi{que} appareant; us{que} eò ut illi Idololatricâ impietate Ethnicos aequare, Excusationis verò futilitate longè superare videantur. Quid tandem? tota ferè Missae defensio Maniche∣orum, Eunomianorum, Marcionitarum, Eutychia∣norum, aliorum{que} multorum Haerefibus scatet passim, ut in postrema nostra Synopsi, veluti in speculo, con∣templari
quivis possit. Dùm ista literis consigno, ostensae sunt mibi, inter alias, Theses duae, quas Isaacus Ca∣saubonus▪  in Adversarijs suis, propriâ manu scriptis, post se reliquit. Prima, Iusta Causa est (inquit) cur Transsubstantiatio rejiciatur, ut evitentur Ab∣surda. Altera haec est; Veteres nunquam dixerunt destrui Symbola, sed semper de Signis locuti sunt, quasi de re ipsa. Quae quàm verae sunt, & juxta Vete∣rum sententiam ad Causam nostram oppidò necessa∣riae, nostri muneris erit suo loco copiosè ostendere. Prius∣quàm verò perorare mihi liceat, vos orandi estis (Viri or∣natissimi) ut de Adversariorum nostrorum Iniquitate, de meoquè erga vos studio ac Benevolentia nonnihil at∣texam. Bellarmino, Alano, Maldonato, alijs{que} Romanae Missae Asserioribus suum, ut par est, ingenij acumen, exactum & perspicax ingenium, omnium de{que} tàm humanae quàm divinae literaturae accuratam cognitionem facitè tribuimus; ità tamen vt in ijs, dùm nostros Theo∣logos criminantur, veritatem; dum suas opiniones defen∣dunt, constantiam; dùm Patres, Patres crepant, obiectant, inculcant, fidem modestiam{que} defideremus. Ʋt nihil de Eorum Iuramentis dicamus, quibus se obstrinxerunt, non sine aliqua notâ Periurij; quod Synopsis nostra Secunda satis super{que} declarat. Ad nostram quod attinet Sacratissimā Eucharistiam; quia à Ministro Elementa consecrantur & benedicuntur, non minùs Sacramenta sunt, quàm est aqua Baptisma∣tis; quae tamen Istis non pudet probris suis contaminare, dum partem alteram merum Pistoris panem, alteram Oenopolae vinū nudū appellant nequitèr. Deindè (ut
alias eorū Calumnias praetervolem) quòd eorum de Cor∣porali Christi Praesentiâ in Eucharistiâ fanaticam opi∣nionem, tanquàm impossibilem, propter implicitam Contradictionem, oppugnamus; Illi, quasi hoc esset Dei omnipotentiae detrahere, in nos impotentèr debac∣chantur. Si cui lubeat singulas Operis huius Sectiones percurrere, vix in aliquam incidet aut Obiectionem Adversariorum prosua Missa, aut Responsionem, aut deni{que} Scripturae expositionem quam non facilè observet ab alijs Pontificijs Doctoribus aut luculentâ ratione so∣lutam, enervatam, explosam; aut deni{que} (quod maius est) per receptas Ecclesiae Romanae doctrinas oppugnatam. Nae illa praeclara est istorum hominum constantia, qui si minùs viribus nostris, suâ tamen imbecillitate & dis∣sentione vincuntur, at{que} succumbunt. Praetereà de Pontificiorum Doctorum versutia obstinacia{que} satis queri vix possumus. Versutia eorum cernitur cùm in rebus alijs, tûm praecipuè in abutendis veterum Patrum Testimoniis, sive per falsas Editiones Translationes{que} ea depravando; sive novo excogitato Commento illudendo; siue deni{que} adversis frontibus oppugnando: quorum omnium Exempla plurima Libri singuli sequentes vobis exhibent. Obstinaciae verò eorum specimen nullum potest esse illustrius, quàm (quod in altera Synopsi nostra videre est) ex Ʋeterum senten∣tijs facta Collatione Eucharistiae cum Baptismate. Illi ad sua Dogmata stabilienda de Praesentia Corporali Corporis Christi in Eucharistia, ipsius{que} adeò Adoratio∣ne Latreutica obijciunt Nobis, Patres negâsse Eucha∣ristiam esse nudum Panem. Nos reponimus, eosdem Patres paritèr negâsse, in Baptismate esse Aquam nu∣dam.
At opponunt, Veteres Eucharistiam Sacrificium vocâsse. Nos rursùs, Baptisma quoque Sacrificium nominant. Illi, At apud Patres Eucharistia Sacramen∣tum Terribile & Venerabile dicitur. Regerimus nos, à Patribus moneri homines ad Baptisma, utpote quod venerandum sit, cûm Tremore accedere. Pergimus dein, & per sexdecim  par pari referimus, quod Adversariorum nostrorum, nisi animos obsirment, Con∣scientias mordeat & lancinet; sed manu tamen medicâ, ut sanet. Eant igitur Antagonistae nostri, & cum de Antiquitate agitur nos (ut solent) Novatores appelli∣tent, nunquàm tamen efficiet, quin ipsi (ut praeclarè olim Clariss. vir Iosephus Scaliger) Ʋeteratores ha∣beantur. Redeo ad Vos tandem (dignissimi Viri) quorum intimos animorum conceptus audire mihi videor: quibus, quoad possim, & liceat, occurrendu esse duxi. Prim in loco, Fateor equidem me iamdiú in ist usmodi Polemicis ne∣gotijs exercuisse calamum; non quòd nesciverim à Detra∣ctione neminem esse immunem, nisi qui nihil scriberet: sed quòd abundè noverim pro salute Patriae, proquè patria salutis, at{que} adeò pro fidei synceritate nullum non labo∣rem esse subeundum. Secundò multos alios multo majo∣re cum profectu munere hoc defungi posse agnosco: ve∣runtamen, quatenùs praestare quicquam valeam, illud S. Augustini aures mihi vellicat, animum{que} stimulat: Qui mendacium docet (inquit) & qui veritatem ta∣cet, uterque reus est; alter qui prodesse non vult, al∣ter quia nocere desiderat. Nec profectò hanc Romu∣lei stabuli (cùm purgandi non datur) exagitandi pro∣vinciam, in re Missatica, alio animo suscepi, quàm ut
omnes (quibus veritas cordi est) intelligant, Nos An∣glicanae Ecclesiae Alumnos Causam nactos esse Divinis literis consentientem maximè, Catholicae Antiquitatis suffragijs comprobatam, mille omnis ordinis Martyrum sanguine testatam; imò etiam (addendum est enim) cuiusvis Christiani, si fieri posset, vel mille mortibus ob∣signandam. Praetereà, Romanae Ecclesiae Tyrunculis omissis, Antesignanos ipsos libentiùs aggredior, dupli∣ci ratione adductus; quià primò, his profligatis, illi non possunt consistere: deindè ut clariùs constet, in illam Ecclesiam quadrare illud Christi; Si lumen, quod in te, tenebrae, ipsae tenebrae quantae? Quos tamen, dûm Argumentis prosequor, non probris insector; quià in hoc altero Certaminis genere vincere vinci est: nam praecla∣rè olim Artaxerxes Rex militi, hostem convitijs pro∣scindenti, Non ut maledicas te alo, (inquit) sed ut pugnes. Cur verò vobis potissimùm has meas Lucubrationes dedicarem, plurimae me Causae impulerunt. Antiquitùs plurimi dicebantur Episcopi Catholicae sive Vniver∣salis Ecclesiae, non solùm quòd Catholicam tenerent fidem, sed etiam quòd suam pro incolumitate Ecclesiae Ʋniversalis curam Scriptis & laboribus testarentur. E∣gone igitur ut non illud studium ergà utramque Vni∣versitatem profitear meum, quod ipsi (ut ità dicam) Vniversalitati debeam? Huc accedit (nam quidni fidorum Amicorum literis fidem habeam?) quòd cum vos Opus nostrum aliud, tribus abhinc annis publici iuris factum, non vulgari animorum vestrorum significatione approbâsse intellexerim; hoc{que}, quod nunc ad umbilicū per∣duxi, non minori cum desiderio expectâsse (quorum illud
GRANDEM ROMANAE ECCLESIAE IMPO∣STVRAM detexit, hoc ROMANAE MISSAE I∣DOLOMANIAM, tanquàm immane monstrum, con∣fodicat) non committendum putavi, ut non grati animi meum hoc testimonium Vobis referrem. Quid? quòd Causae ipsius necessitas quoque id à me exigere videbatur, quae profectò in hac Causa homines Academicos ni∣hil minùs quàm Academicos & Scepticos esse sinet; nè quis vestrûm (quod detestabile omen Deus obruat!) in Rom. Artolatriam prolabatur, quò vel alijs scandalo, Majestati divinae odio, sibi ipsi deni{que} certo exitio esse possit. Postremò, in hanc spem adducor, nunquàm defuturos ex utra{que} Academia viros plurimos, Theologici juris con∣sultiss. omnibus{que} armis instructissimos, non modò ad hu∣jusce Causae patrocinium sustinendum, verumetiam ad Mataeologiam omnem Romanensium expugnandam. Pergite igitur ô macti antiqua prudentia & veritate, pergite, inquam, & Amantissimum Vestri diligite; quod rectius noveritis impertite, & precibus vestris adjuvate. In Christo Jesu valete, qui vos conservet in gloriam Gratiae suae! AMEN. Tho. Coven. & Lichff.
An Advertisement To all Romish Priests and Iesuites of the English Seminaries, con∣cerning the Necessity of this ensuing Treatise; as also of the Au∣thors Sincerity, and his Adversaries unconscionable Dealing in their Allegations of Authors. Grace, Peace, and Trueth in CHRIST IESVS. AMong all the Controversies held a∣gainst your Romish Religion, none were ever more hot, to draw Pro∣testants violently into the fier, than these two; first the denying of your Romane Church to be The Catho∣like Church, without which there is no Salvation: the second to affirme the Romish Adoration of the Sacrament of the Altar to be Idolatrous. Therefore have I especially vnder∣taken the discussion of both these Questions, that seeing (as S. Augustine truly said) It is not the punishment, but the Cause which maketh a Martyr; it might fully appeare to the world, whether Protestants enduring that fierie triall, for both Cau∣ses, were indeed Heretickes, or true Martyrs: and consequent∣ly whether their Persecutors were iust Executioners of persons then condemned, and not rather damnable Murtherers of the faithfull Servants of Christ. And I doubt not but as the first hath verified the Title of that Booke, to prove your Do∣ctrine of the Necessity of salvation in your Romish Church to be a GRAND IMPOSTVRE: So this second, which I now (according to my promise) present vnto you, will make good, by many Demonstrations, that your Romish MASSE is a very
Masse, or rather a Gulfe of many Superstitious, Sacrilegi∣ous, and Idolatrous Positions and Practises. And because the very name of Romane Church is common∣ly used as (in it selfe) a powerfull enchantment to stupifie every Romish Disciple, and to strike him deafe and dumbe at once, that he may may neither heare nor utter any thing in Conference concerning the Masse, or any other Controver∣sie in Religion, be the Protestants Defence never so Divine for trueth, or ancient for time, or universall for Consent, or ne∣cessary for beleefe: I therefore held it requisite, in the first place, to discover the falshood of the former Article of your Church, before I would publish the Abominations of the Masse; to the end that (for Idolatrie in Scripture is often ter∣med spirituall Adulterie) the Romish Church, which playeth the Bawd, in patronizing Idolatry, being once outted, your Romish Masse, as the Strumpet, might the more easily either be reformed, or wholly abandoned. This may satisfie you for the necessity of this Tractate. The next must be to set before you your owne delusorie tricks, in answering, or not answering Bookes written a∣gainst you; especially such as have beene observed from mine owne experience. One is to stangle a Booke in the very birth: so dealt Mr. Breereley long since by a letter writ unto mee, to prevent the publishing of my Answere against the first Editi∣on of his Apologie, when he sent me a second Edition thereof to be answered, which both might and ought to have beene sent a twelve-month sooner; but was purposely reserved to be delivered not untill the very day after my See the Protestants Appeale in the begin∣ning. Answere (cal∣led and Appeale) was published. Of which his prevention I have therefore complained as of a most unconscionable Cir∣cumvention. Another device you have, to give out that the Booke (whatsoever) written against your Romish Tenents is in answering, and that an Answere will come out shortly. So dealt Mr. Parsons with me In his Sober Rec∣koning. Certifying me and all his cre∣dulous Readers of an Epistle which hee had received from a Scottish Doctor, censuring my Latine Apologies to be both fond and false; and promising that his Answere to them, Printed at Gratz in Austria, should be published before the Michael∣mas
following: whereas there have beene above twenty. Mi∣chaelmasses sithence, every one giving Mr. Parsons his pro∣mise the flatt lie. A third Art is a voluntarie▪ Concealement and thus Maister Brereley, who hauing had knowledge of the fore-mentioned Booke of Appeale, manifesting his manifold Aberrations and Absurdities in doctrine, his ignorances and fraudes in the abuse of his Authors, as in other passages through-out that booke, so more especially the parts concern∣ing the Romish Masse, yet since hath written a large Booke, in defence of the Romish Liturgy or Masse, vrging all the same proofes and Authorities of Fathers; but wisely concealing that they had beene confuted, and his fashoods discouered. Only he and Master Fisher singling out of my Appeale an explanation which I gaue of the testimonie of Gelasius (in condem∣ning the Manichees, concerning their opinion of not admi∣nistring the Eucharist in both kindes) did both of them divulge it in their Bookes and reports also in many parts of this king∣dome, as making for the iustification of their sacrilegious dis∣membring the holy Sacrament, and fora foule Contradiction vnto my selfe: notwithstanding that this their scurrilous iusul∣tation (as is Booke 1. c. 3. §. 7. here proued) serueth for nothing rather than to make themselues ridiculous. The last, but most base and de∣uellish, Gullerie is a false imputation of Falshoods in the allea∣ging of Authors, which was the fine sleight of Master Parsons; a man as subtile for inuention, as elegant for expression, for obseruation as dextrous and acute, and as politike and per∣swasiue for application, as any of his time. He in an answere to some Treatises written against your Romish blacke art of Aequiuocation by mentall Reseruation, and other Positions fo∣menting Rebellion (to wit) in his bookes of Mitigation and Sober Reckoning, doth commonly leaue the principall Obiections & Reasons, and falleth to his verball skirmishes, concerning false Allegations: and (as turning that Ironicall counsaile into earnest, Audacter & fortiter calumniare &c.) he chargeth mee with no lesse than fiftie Falsifications. All which I spunged out in a Booke entituled an Encounter, and retorted all the same Imputations of falshood upon himselfe, with the inter∣est of above forty more. Which may seeme to verifie that
Cognizance, which your owne Brother-hood of Romish Priests in their Quodlibets have fastened on his sleeue, calling him The Quintessence of Coggerie. As for mine owne integritie, I have that which may iustifie mee; for howsoever any one or other Error may happen, in mis-alleaging any one Author, yet that I have not erred much; or if at all, yet never against my Con∣science. Heereof I have many witnesses; One within me, a witnesse most Domesticall, yet least partiall, and as good as Thousands, mine owne Conscience: a second is above me, God, who is Greater than the Conscience. A third sort of Wit∣nesses are such as stand by mee, even all they who have beene conversant with mee in the perusall and examinati∣on of Authors Testimonies, by mee alleaged; men of sin∣gular learning and iudgement, who can testifie how much they endeared them-selves vnto mee, when any of them happened to shew mee the least errour in any thing. (Hee that shall say, Non possum errare, must be no man; and hee that will not say, Nolo errare, as hating to erre, can be no Christian man.) The last witnesse for my integritie may be the Bookes of my greatest Adversaries, Mr. Par∣sons, and Mr. Brereley, whose many scores of falshoods have beene laid so open and published for above sixteene yeares past in two Bookes (one called an Encounter against the fore-man, the other an Appeale against the second) yet hath not any one appeared out of your Romish Seminaries for the vindicating of them heerein. By these Advertisements you may easily conceive with what confidence I may proceede in this worke, where∣in is displayed and layd open, in the discussing of these Eight Words of Christ his Institution of the Blessed Sa∣crament of the Eucharist, [HEE BLESSED; BRAKE; GAVE; TO THEM; SAYING; TAKE; EATE; DRINKE,] your Ten Romish Prevarications, and Trans∣gressions. Afterwards in the following Bookes are re∣veiled the stupendious Paradoxes, Sacrilegiousnes, and Idolatrie of your MASSE; together with the notori∣ous Obstinacies, some fewe Overtures of Periuries (out
of that great Summe, which may afterwards be manifested in your swearing to the other Articles of your new Romane Faith) and the manifold Heresies in the Defenders thereof: as also their indirect and sinister Obiecting and Answering of the Testimonies of ancient Fathers thorow-out, as if they conten∣ded neither from Conscience, nor for Conscience-sake. To Conclude. Whosoever among you hath beene fascina∣ted (according to your Colliers Catechisme) with that only Ar∣ticle of an Implicite Faith; let him be admonished to submit to that Duety prescribed by the Spirit of God, to Trie all things, and to Hold that which is good. And if any have a purpose to Re∣ioyne, in Confutation either of the Booke of the Romish Im∣posture, or of this, which is against your Masse; I doe adiure him in the name of Christ, whose trueth wee seeke, that a∣voyding all deceitfull Collusions he proceed materially from Point to point, and labour such an Answer, which hee belee∣veth he may answer for before the iudgement seate of Christ. Our Lord Iesus preserve us to the glory of his saving Grace. AMEN, Tho: Coven: & Lichff.

Discovereth the Novelty and (indeed) Nullity of the Romish Article of Transubstantiation: and proveth the Continuance of the substance of Bread, after Consecration. IV. BOOKE. Reveileth the manifold Contradictions in the Romish Defence of a Corporall Presence of Christ's Body in the Sacrament; and conse∣quently a necessary Impossibilitie thereof, without the impeachment of the Omnipotencie of God (yea with the aduancement thereof:) To∣gether with a Discovery of the falshood of their Thirteen Histories, relating so many Apparitions of True Flesh, and true Blood of Christ in the Eucharist: As also shewing the Determination of the Gene∣rall Councell of Nice upon the the point of Corporall Presence. V. BOOKE. Noteth the three-fold Capernaiticall Conceit in the Romish (pre∣tended) Corporall manner of Eating, Swallowing, and gt-receiving of Christ's flesh. VI. BOOKE. Displayeth the manifold and grosse Sacrilegiousnes in the Romish Masse; vpon their profession of a Proper and properly Propitious Sacrifice therein. VII. BOOKE. Proveth the abhominable-double Idolatrousnes of the Romish Masse, as well Formall as Materiall. VIII. BOOKE. Besides the Three Synopses or Summarie Comprehensions; First of the Superstitiousnes; Secondly, of the Sacriledge; Thirdly, of the Idolatrie of the Romish Masse; it further declareth the diverse Periuries, and Obstinacies of the Defenders; and also the many noto∣rious Heresies in the Defence thereof.
OF THE INSTITVTION OF THE SACRAMENT of the blessed Body and Blood OF CHRIST, &c. The first Booke. Concerning the Actiue part of Christ his Institution of the Eucharist; and the Ten Ro∣mish TRANSGRESSIONS thereof. CHAP. I. That the Originall of the word, MASSE, nothing ad∣vantageth the Romish Masse. SECT. I. DIvers of your Romish Nomen antiquis∣simum, Missa, (quod quidem fides Chri∣stiana profitetur) ex Hebraica vel Chal∣daica nomenclatu∣ra acceptum esse videtur, Missah, i. e. spontanea obla∣tio, conueniens in∣stituto Sacrificio. Ba∣ron. Cardin. Anno 34. num. 59. Est Hebra∣icum. Tolet. Ies. & Cardin. Instruct. Sa∣cerd. li. 2. c. 4. Qui∣dam, vt Reulin, Al∣cian, Xaintes, Pin∣tus, Pamelius existimant esse Hebraicum. At Azor.

Secondly, in time, more ancient than Christ. Thirdly, in signification, most Religious, deri∣ued (as They say) from the Hebrew word Missah, which signifieth Ob∣lation and Sacrifice; euen the high∣est homage that can be performed vnto God. And all this to proue (if it may be) that which you call THE SACRIFICE OF THE MASSE.
CHALLENGE. SO haue these your Doctors taught, notwithstanding many o∣ther Romanists, as well Iesuites as others of principall Note in your Church, enquiring (as it were) after the natiue Countrie, kinred, and age of the Word, MASSE, doe not onely say, but also prooue, first, that It is no Hebrew-borne. Secondly, that it is not of Primitiue antiquitie, because not read of before the dayes of S. Ambrose, who liued about three hundred seuentie three yeeres after Christ. Thirdly, that it is a plaine Latine word, to wit Missa, signifying the Dismission of the Congregation. Which Confessi∣ons being testified (in our Latinum, non Hebraicum est, vt Neoterici studiosè exquitunt. Binius Tom. 3. Conc. p. 110. E∣odem modo inter∣pretantur cōplures.

[It is the same with  in the Greeke Church: and with Ilicet amongst the ancient Romanes.] See the Testimonie following. Margin) by so large a consent of your owne Doctors, prooued by so cleare Euidence, and deliuered by Authors of so eminent estimation in your owne Church; must not a little lessen the credit of your other Doctors (noted for Neo∣tericks) who haue vainely laboured, vnder the word MASSE, falsely to impose vpon their Readers an opinion of your Romish Sacrificing Masse. That the word, MASSE, in the Primitiue signification thereof, doth properly belong vnto the Protestants: and iustly condemneth the Romish manner of Masse. SECT. II. THe word, MASSE, (by the Missa à Missio∣ne dicta est, quoniam Catechumeni â su∣sceptâ foras de Ec∣clesia emitterentur: vt in ritibus Pagano∣rum dici consueue∣rat, Ilicet, quod per Syncopen idem est ac, Ire licet.

Cassaud. Consult. Art. 24. As also in his Tract. de solit. Missa p. 217. with others. (See more hereafter, Chap. 2. §. 5. where this point is discussed.)

Which furthermore your Ies. Maldonate, out of Isidore, the most ancient Authors, and all
the Liturgies, is compelled to confesse to be the Alij, ut Isidorus de diuin. offic. dixe∣runt Missam appella∣tam esse quasi dimis∣sionem, à dimitten∣dis Catechumenis antequam Sacrifici∣um inchoaretur: quā sententiam colligo esse verissimam ex antiquiss. Authori∣bus.—Clama∣bat enim Diaconus post Cōcionem, Ca∣techumeni exeunto, et qui communicare non possunt: vt constat ex omnibus Liturgijs, vbi non potest nomen Missae accipi pro Sacrificio. Maldon. Ies. lib. dc 7 Sacram. Tract. de Euch. §. Primum. p. 335. Most true mea∣ning of Antiquity. Which Custome of exempting all such persons, being euery where religiously taught and obserued in all Protestant Churches; and contrarily the greatest devotion of your Worshippers, at this day, being exercised onely in looking and gazine vpon the Priests manner of celebrating your Romane Masse, without communi∣cating thereof, contrary to the Institution of Christ; contrary to the practice of Antiquity; and contrary to the proper vse of the Sacrament: (All which See Chap. 2. Sect. 9. hereafter shall be plentifully shewed) it must therefore follow, as followeth. CHALLENGE. VVHereas there is nothing more rife and frequent in your speeches, more ordinary in your outhes, or more sacred in your common estimation, than the name of the Masse; yet are you, by the signification of that very word, convinced of a mani∣fest Transgression of the Institution of Christ: and therefore your great Boast of that name is to be iudged false, and absurd. But of this Transgression more See below, Chap. 2. Sect. 5. hereafter. The Name of CHRIST his MASSE how farre it is to be acknowledged by Protestants. SECT. III.

And how often doe wee heare your vulgar people talking of Christ his Masse? Which word MASSE (in the proper signification already spe∣cified) could not possibly haue beene so distastfull vnto us, if you had not abused it to your fained, and (as you now see) false sense of your kinde of Proper Oblation and Sacrifice. Therefore was it a superfluous labour of Mr. Liturg. Trac. 1. §. 1. Brereley, to spend so many lines in prouing the Antiquity of the word, MASSE. CHALLENGE. FOr otherwise Wee (according the aboue-confessed proper Sense thereof) shall, together with other Protestants in the Confess. Aug. Cap. de Coena Domini. Augustane Confession, approue and embrace it; and that to the iust Condemnation of your present Romane Church, which in her Masse doth flatly and peremptorily contradict the proper Signi∣fication thereof, according to the Testimonie of Micrologus, say∣ing;
Microl. de Eccl. obseruat. c. 1. Prop∣ter hoc certe dicitur Missa, quoniam mit∣tendi sunt foràs, qui non participant Sa∣crificio, vel commu∣nione Sancta. Teste Cassand. Liturg fol 59. The Masse is therefore so called, because they that communicate not, are commanded to depart. By all which it is euident, that your Church hath forfeited the Title of Masse, which shee hath appropriated to her selfe as a flagge of ostentation (whereof more See below. c. 2. sect. 9. hereafter.) In the Interim, we shall desire each one of you to hearken to the Exhortation of your owne Waldensis, saying, Attende Missam Christi, &c. Waldens. de Missa. ATTEND, and obserue the Masse OF CHRIST. Of the CANON OF CHRIST his MASSE, and at what wordes it beginneth. SECT. IV. CHrist his Masse, by your owne Hoc officium Christus instituit, u∣bi dicitur, [Acce∣pit Iesus panem] Du∣rand.

[And Iesus tooke bread, &c.] which also we doe as absolutely professe. What Circumstances, by ioynt consent on both sides, are to bee exempted out of this Canon of Christ his Masse; or the wordes of his Institution. It is no lesse Christian wisedome and Charitie to cut off vnne∣cessary Controversies, than it is a serpentine malice to engender them; and therefore we exempt those points which are not in∣cluded within this Canon of Christ, beginning at these wordes; [And Iesus tooke bread, &c.] To know, that all other circum∣stances, which at the Institution of Christ his Supper fell out acci∣dentally, or but occasionally (because of the then Iewish Passe∣ouer, which Christ was at that time to finish; or else by reason of the custome of Iudaea) doe not come within this our dispute touching Christ his Masse; whether it be that they concerne Place, (for it was instituted in a priuate house:) or Time, (which was at night:) or Sexe, (which were onely men:) or Gesture, (which was a kind of lying downe:) or Vesture, (which was wee know not what:) no nor yet whether the Bread were vnleauened, or the Wine mixed with water, two poynts which (as you know) Prote∣stants and your selues Antiquissimus decumbēdi usus mo∣re accumbendi non∣dum inuento, ex Phi∣lone lib. de Ios pho.—Iudaeorum mos jacendi inter Epulas.

but in their owne nature Indifferent; and onely so farre to bee observed, as the Church, wherein the Christian Communicants are, shall for Order and Decencie-sake prescribe the use thereof. The Points contained within the Canon of Christ his Masse, and appertaining to our present Controuersie, are of two kindes, viz. 1. Practicall. 2. Doctrinall. SECT. V. PRacticall or Active is that part of the Canon, which concer∣neth Administration, Participation, and Receiuing of the holy Sacrament, according to this Tenor, Math. 26. 26. [And Iesus tooke Bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gaue it to his Disciples, and said, Take, eate, &c. And Luc. 22. 19, 20. Doe this in remembrance of mee. Likewise also after Supper be tooke the Cup, and gaue thankes, and gaue it to them, saying, Drinke yee all of this.] But the points, which are especially to bee called Doctrinall, are implied in these words of the Euangelists; [This is my Bodie: And, This is my Blood of the New Testament, which is shed for you, and for many for remission of sinnes.] We begin with the Practicall. CHAP. II. That all the proper Active and Practicall points (to wit, of Blessing, Saying, Giving, Taking, &c.) are strictly commanded by Christ in these words [DOE THIS,] Luc. 22. Matth. 26. & 1. Cor. 11. SECT. I. THere are but two outward materiall parts of this Sa∣crament, the one concerning the element of Bread, the other touching the Cup. The Acts concerning both, whether in Administring, or Participating thereof, are charged by Christ his Canon vpon the Church Catholike vnto the ends of the World. The Tenour of his Precept or command, for the first part, is [Doe this:] and concerning the other likewise saying, 1. Cor. 11. 25. [This doe yee as often, &c.] Whereof your owne Doctors, aswell Iesuites as

Ies. in Mat. 26 super illa verba [Coenantibus autem.] &c. you say were put in, not for example, but on∣ly by occasion of the Passeouer, then commanded to be observed. Thus you. CHALLENGE. THis Command of Christ, being thus directly and copiously acknowledged by the best Diuines in the Romane Church, must needs challenge on both sides an answerable performance. Vpon examination whereof, it will appeare vnto euery Conscience of man, which Professors (namely, whether Protestants or Ro∣manists) are the true and Catholike Executors and Obseruers of the last will and Testament of our Testator Iesus: because that Church must necessarily bee esteemed the more loyall and legiti∣mate Spouse of Christ, which doth more precisely obey the Com∣mand of the celestiall Bride-groome. Wee, to this purpose, ap∣ply our selues to our busines, by enquiring what are the Actiue Particulars, which Christ hath giuen in charge vnto his Church by these his expresse wordes [Doe this.] All which wee are to discouer and discusse from point to point.
TEN TRANSGRESSIONS, And Preuarications against the Command of Christ [DOE THIS,] practised by the Church of Rome, at this day, in her Romane Masse. SECT. II.

Neuerthelesse, be∣cause there is in yours the substance of Bread, therefore we will not contend about Accidents and shadowes; but wee insist vpon the words of his Institution. The first Transgression of the (now) Church of Rome, in contradicting Christ his Canon, is collected out of these words, [AND HE BLESSED IT;] which concerne the Conse∣cration of this Sacrament. SECT. III. FIrst of the Bread the Text saith [He blessed it:] next of the Cup it is said [When he had giuen thanks:] Which words in Non dubium est quin apud Euange∣listas  idem sit quod : nam quod Matthae∣us & Marcus dicunt [] post de calice loquentes, di∣cunt [:] & vicissim quod Matth. & Marcus de pane dicunt [,] Lucas & Paulus dicunt .] Maldon.

of these words of Christ [This is my body,] and [This my blood.] &c. and that from the iudgement (as Communis sen∣tentia est non solùm Theologorum recen∣tiorum, led etiam ve∣terum Patrum, Chri∣stum consecrásse his verbis [Hoc est cor∣pus meum.

Hactenus ex Archiep. Caesarien. that the Consecration, vsed by our Sauiour, was performed by that his Blessing by Prayer, which preceded the pronouncing of those words, [Hoc est corpus meum:]
[This is my bodie, &c.] To this purpose hee is bold to averre that Thomas Aquinas and all Catholikes before Caietane have confessed that Christ did consecrate in that his [Benedixit, that is, He blessed it.] And that Saint Iames and Dionyse the Areopagite did not Conse∣crate only in the other words, but by Prayer. Then he assureth vs that the Greeke Churches maintained that Consecration consisteth in Bene∣diction, by Prayer, and not in the only repetition of the words afore-said. After this hee produceth your subtilest Schooleman Scotus, accompanied with divers others, Who Derided those, that attribu∣ted such a supernaturall vertue to the other forme of words. After steppeth in your Lindan, who avoucheth Iustin (one of the an∣cientest of Fathers) as Denying that the Apostles consecrated the Eucharist in those words, [Hoc est, &c.] and affirming that Conse∣cration could not be without Prayer. Be you but pleased to peruse the Marginals, and you shall fur∣ther find alleadged the Testimonies of Pope Gregorie, Hierome, Ambrose, Bernard, and (to ascend higher) the Liturgies of Cle∣ment, Basil, Chrysostome, and of the Romane Church it selfe; in gain-saying of the Consecration, by the only words of Institution, as you pretend. And in the end he draweth in two Popes, contradi∣cting one the other in this point, and hath no other meanes to stint their iarre, but (whereas the authoritie of both is equall) to thinke it iust to yeild rather to the better learned of them both. Whoso∣ever requireth more, may be satisfied by reading of the Booke it¦selfe. It will not suffice, to say, that you also vse Prayer in the Romish Liturgie: for the question is not meerely of Praying, but where∣in the forme of Benediction and Consecration properly doth consist. Now none can say, that he consecrateth by that Prayer, which he belieueth is not ordained for Consecration. We may furthermore take hold, by the way, of the Testification of Mr. Tract. of the Masse, pag. 105. Brereley a Ro∣mish Priest, who out of Basil and Chrysostome, [calling one part Calix benedictione sacratus] alloweth Benediction to haue beene the Consecration thereof. All this Armie of Witnesses were no better than Meteors, or imaginarie figures of battailes in the aire, if that the Answere of Bellarmine may goe for warrant, to wit, that the only Pronuntia∣tion of these words [Hoc est corpus meum] imply in them (as hee Verba haec [Hoc est corpus meum] pronuntiata à Sacer∣dote, cùm intentione consecrandi Sacra∣mentum, continent implicitè Invocatio∣nem. Bellar. lib. 4. de Euch. c. 14. §. Quintū arg. saith) an Invocation, or Prayer. Which words (as any man may perceiue) Christ spake not supplicatorily vnto God, but declara∣tiuely vnto his Apostles, accordingly as the Text speaketh, [Hee said unto them:] as is also well See the former te∣stimony, letter (g.) observed by your fore-said Arch-bishop of Caesarea, out of Saint Hierome. But none of you (we presume) will dare to say that Christ did Invocate his Disciples. These words therefore are of Declaration, and not of Invocation.

[To whom might be added Cyprian de coena Domini, Calix benedictione sacratus.] you answere that some Fathers did use such speeches in their Sermons to the people, but in their secret instraction of Priests did teach other∣wise. Which Answere (besides the falsitie thereof) Wee take to be no better than a reproach against Antiquitie, and all one, as to say that those venerable Witnesses of Truth would professe one thing in the Cellar, and proclaime the contrarie on the house-top. It were to be wished, that when you frame your Answeres, to direct other men's Consciences, you would first satisfie your owne, espe∣cially being occupied in soule's-businesses. We conclude. Seeing that Forme (as all learning teacheth) gi∣veth being vnto all things; therefore your Church, albeit shee vse Prayer, yet erring in her iudgement concerning the perfect manner and Forme of. Consecration of this Sacrament, how shall shee be credited in the Materialls; wherein she will be found, aswell as in this, to haue Transgressed the same Iniunction of Christ, [DOE THIS?] Neuerthelesse, this our Conclusion is not so bee interpreted, as
(hearken It was M. Bre∣reley his error, Liturg. p. 101. in alleaging I∣renaeus lib. 5. cap. 1. Quandò mixtus ca∣lix, & fractus panis percepit verbū Dei, fit Eucharistia. [Here by verbum Dei, is not meant the words of Hoc est, &c. but Prayer, and the word of Blessing, comman∣ded by the Word of Christ, who blessed it, and commanded his Church, saying, Doe this: as appeareth by Iraen. lib. 4. c. 34. when he saith, Panis percipiens vo∣cationem (for Invocationem) Dei, non est communis panis.] In the next place Ambrose. l. 4 c. 4 dc Sacr.

We see then that the Latine Church had this forme (Fac) even as the Greeke had their : both in Prayer, but neither of both without reciting the forme of Institution.] Mr. Brereley) to exclude, out of the words of this Ce∣lebration, the Repetition and pronunciation of these words [This is my Bodie: and, This is my Bloud of the new Testament.] Farre be this from vs, because wee hold them to be essentially belonging to the Narration of the Institution of Christ; and are vsed in the Li∣turgie of our Church: for although they be not words of Bles∣sing and Consecration, (because not of Petition, but of Repetition) yet are they Words of Direction; and, withall, Significations and Testifications of the mysticall effects thereof. Your Obiection out of the Fathers is See at the former letter (o.) answered. The second Romish Transgression of the Canon of Christ his Masse, is in their Contradicting the sence of the next words of. In∣stitution, [HE BRAKE IT.] SECT. IV. HE brake it.] So all the Evangelists doe relate. Which Act of Christ plainly noteth that hee Brake the Bread, for distribu∣ting of the same vnto his Disciples. And his Command is mani∣fest, in saying as well in behalfe of this, as of the rest, [Doe this.] Your Priest indeed Breaketh one Hoast into three parts vpon the Consecration thereof: but our Question is of Fraction or Breaking, for Distribution to the People. The Contrarie Canon of the (now) Romane Masse. Ecce, in coena Christus fregit pa∣nem: & tamen Ec∣clesia Gatholica mo∣dò non frangit, sed integrum dat. Salme∣ron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 34. §. Nam. p. 275. BEHOLD (say you) Christ brake it; but the Catholike Church (meaning the Romane) now doth not breake it, but giueth it whole. And this you pretend to doe for Reverence-sake, Lest (as your Amulto tempo∣re non usupatur fra∣ctio, sed singuli pa∣nes, seu minores hostiae consecrantur, ad evitandum periculum decidentium micarum. Lorin. Ies. in Act. 2. 42. Bonâ ratione, nè micae aut particulae panissacri pereant. Salmeron quo suprà, aliquantò post. Iesuite saith) some crummes of Bread may fall to the ground. Nei∣ther is there any Direction to your Priest to Breake the Bread, either before or after Consecration, in your Romane Masse; especially that which is distributed to the people.

Vsus autem Ecclesiae & eius celebrandi ordo nos docent, qualis fuit Christi Missa, & quo illam ordine celebravit▪ Archiep. Caesar. var. Tract. pag. 27. Doctors, whereby is witnessed, first, that Christ brake the bread into twelve parts. Secondly, that this Act of breaking of bread is such a principall Act, that the whole Celebration of this Sacrament hath had from thence this Appellation given to it, by the Apostles, to be called Breaking of Bread. Thirdly, that the Church of Christ alwayes observed the same Ceremonie of breaking the bread, aswell in the Greeke as in the Latine (and consequently the Romane) Church. Fourthly, that this Breaking of the Bread is a Symbolicall Ceremonie betokening not only the crucifying of Christ's bodie vpon the Crosse, but also (in the common participation there∣of) representing the vnion of the mysticall bodie of Christ, which is his Church, Communicating together of one loafe: that as many graines in one loafe, so all faithfull Communicants are vnited to one Head Christ, as the Apostle teacheth, 1. Cor. 10. thus, [The bread which we breake, is it not the Communion of the bodie of Christ? for we being many are one bread.] We adde, as a most speciall Reason, that this Breaking it, in the distribution thereof, is to apply the re∣presentation of the Bodie crucified, and the Bloud shed to the heart and soule of every Communicant; That as the Bread is given bro∣ken to vs, so was Christ crucified for vs. Yet, neverthelesse, your Church contrarily professing, that although Christ did breake bread, yet (BEHOLD!) she doth not so; what is it else, but to starch her face, and insolently to confront Christ his Command by her bold Countermand (as you now see) in effect saying; But doe not this. A SECOND CHALLENGE. AS for that truly called Catholike Church, you your-selves doe grant vnto vs, that by Christ his first Institution, by the Pra∣ctice of the Apostles, by the ancient and universall Custome of the whole Church of Christ, aswell Greeke as Latine, the Ceremonie of Breaking bread was continually observed. Which may be vnto vs more than a probable Argument, that the now Church of Rome doth falsly usurpe the Title of CATHOLIKE, for the better countenancing and authorizing of her novell Customes, although neuer so repugnant to the will of Christ, and Custome of the truly called Catholike Church.
In the next place, to your Pretence of Not-Breaking, because of Reverence, We say; Hem, scilicet, Quanti est sapere! As if Christ and his Apostles could not fore-see that your Necessitie, (namely) that by the Distributing of the Bread, and by Breaking it, some little crummes must cleaue sometimes vnto the beards of the Communicants, or else fall to the ground. Or as though this Alteration were to be called Reverence, and not rather Arrogance, in making your-selves more wise than Christ, who instituted; or then all the Apostles, or Fathers of primitiue times, who conti∣nued the same Breaking of bread. Therefore this your Contempt of Breaking what is it but a per∣emptorie breach of Christ his Institution, neuer regarding what the Scripture saith; 1. Sam. 15. 22. Obedience is better then Sacrifice. For, indeed, true Reverence is the mother of Obedience; else is it not Devotion, but a meere derision of that Command of Christ, [Doe this.] The third Romish Transgression of the Canon of Christ his Masse; contradicting the sence of the next words of Christs Command, viz. [—GAVE IT VNTO THEM.] SECT. V. IT followeth in the Canon of Christ his Masse, [And hee gaue it vnto them;] euen to THEM, to whom hee said, [Take yee, eate yee.] By which pluralitie of persons is excluded all private Massing; forasmuch as our High Priest Christ Iesus (who in insti∣tuting and administring of this Sacrament would not be alone) said hereof, as of the other Circumstances, [Doe this.] The Contrarie Canon of the (now) Romane Masse.

A man may indeed possibly talke alone, fret alone, play the Traytor alone: but this Communicating alone, without any other, is no better Grammar than to say that a man can conferre alone, conspire alone, contend, or Couenant alone. Caluine saith indeed of spirituall Eating, which may be without the Sacrament (as you also Qui dicunt Christum manducari spiritualiter à fidelibus posse, etiamsi Sacramentaliter non manducetur, at{que} eo cibo animam ali, ve∣ra quidem asserunt.

Genebrard for his Treatise vpon this same Subiect of the Priuate Masse) albeit he agreeth with the execrable Execration and Anathema of the Coun∣cell of Trent, against them that hold Solitarie Masses to be vnlawfull; yet after the expence of much paper, to prove that some private Masse must needs haue anciently beene, because Primitiuely Masse was celebrated almost in all Churches euery day; and that S.

For Conclusion, heare the said Deane of the Romane Cardinals (from whom a Sacerdos di∣cit [Pax omnibus vobis:] quoniam au∣tem pro se invicem precari est praecep∣tum Apostolicum, propterea populus quo{que} ei ipsam pa∣cem precatur, di∣cens, [Et cum spi∣ritu tuo.] Nic. cabas.

Witnes M. Harding Art. 1. Divis. 29. apud Iuellum. decreeing, as most conuenient, (for Answere vnto the Priest's Vobiscum, and Orate) that there be two at least besides the Priest. An One that of late writ to a Popish Ladie, not discouering his name. Anonymus, not long since, would needs perswade his Reader that by [Vobiscum] was meant the Clerke of the Pa∣rish. But why was it then not said, Dominus tecum, The Lord be with thee? O, this forsooth, was spoken to the Clerke in civili∣ty, according to the ordinary Custome of intitling singular persons in the plurall number: and this Answere hee called Saluing of a doubt. But any may replie, that if it were good manners in the Priest to call vpon the Clerke with [Vobiscum] in the plurall num∣ber for Civility-sake, it must then be rusticitie in your Church, to teach your Clerke to answere your Priest [Et cum Spiritu tuo: And with thy Spirit.] And againe, the Answere is impertinent, for where the Priest is found thus parling with the Clerke, he can∣not be said to be Alone. And so the Answere of this man must be indeed not Saluing, but (as the rest of his manner of answering) a Quack-saluing rather, and a meere Delusion.
A THIRD CHALLENGE Against the same Custome. A Custome Commendable, say your Fathers of Trent; Condem∣nable, say wee, euen from your owne Consciences, because you were neuer hitherto able to produce either any Commendable, yea or Tollerable example, expresly recorded within the many Volumes of Antiquitie, of any celebration of the Eucharist, without a Communion; no, not in that only obiected place of Chrysost. in E∣phes. Hom. 3. Frustrà habetur quotidiana oblatio, frustra sta∣mus ad altare, cum nemo est qui parti∣cipet. Ob. à Bellar. lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 9. [Not that in these dai∣ly Celebrations None at all did communicate with the Priest: for he was accompanied, at least, with some Eccle∣siastiques; as is implyed in the words, (Stam{us} ad Altare) And it is no rare Hyperbole in Chrysostome to vse the word, , for, a Paucitie.] Chrysostome, whose Speech is not a Grant, that absolutely All were absent from his administration of the Eucharist: but certain∣ly it is a vehement Invective against all wilfull Absents. So farre was he from allowing, much more from Commending Communica∣ting alone, who else-where, against such as neglected to Communi∣cate with the poore, taking his Argument from the example of Christ, That Supper (Chrysost. Illa coena (Christi) communiter omnes accumbentes habuit. Tom. 4. in illum locum Pauli; Oportet Haereses esse. 1. Cor. 11. 19. saith he) was common to All. The very Ar∣gument of Saint Hierome, saying (yet more obligatorily) Hieron. Coena Domini dicitur, quia Dominus in coena tradi∣dit Sacramenta. Dominica coena debet omnibus esse communis. In 1. Cor. cap 11. The Lord's Supper ought to bee common to All. Such Reverencers were the Primitive Fathers of the Ordinances of Christ. And as tou∣ching [For againe, if it should be strictly racked, so should he himselfe not have participated, and then was it no Masse at all. But Chrysostom's Rheto∣rique, in Hyperbolizing, is noted especially by your Senensis; as may be obserued in Chrysostome's like Invectiue against the carnall securitie of men, even in the word, Nemo: Nemo divina sapit: nemo terrena contemnit: nemo ad coe∣lum attendit. Hom. 12. ad Heb. Now, None is so sencelesse as to thinke hereby that Chrysostome thought himselfe abso∣lutely to be wholy alone.] [Nemo, No man] in the testimonie of Chrysostome, it is knowne to be taken restrainedly, for Few; and so [Frustrà stamus, &c.] Ex quibus verbis apparet, in his quotidianis Missis solos ferè Ministros & Clericos, paucos verò autnullos à populis communicâsse. G. Cassander de Liturg. Chrysost [Yea and Epenseus durst not relie vpon this Testimonie. acknowledged by your selves in the place objected. The fourth Romish Transgression of the Canon of Christ his Masse, contradicting the sence of the next words, [—SAID VNTO THEM.] SECT. VI. IN the aforesaid Canon of Christ his Masse it followeth, [And he said vnto Them.] Christ Saying or speaking to his Disciples, by commanding them to Take, &c. did, doubtlesse, so speake, that they might heare his Command; to wit, in an audible voice. Which done, he further commanded, concerning this same Cir∣cumstance, ioyntly with the rest, saying, [Doe this.]
The contrarie Canon of the Romane Masse. But your late Councell of Si quis dixetit, Ecclesiae Rom ritum, quo submissâ voce pars Canonis, & ver∣ba Consecrationis proferuntur, dam∣nandum esse, Ana∣thoma sit. Conc. Trid. Sess. 22. Can 9. Trent pronounceth him Anathema, who shall condemne her Custome of the Priest, uttering the words of Consecration in a lowe voice. Whereby (saith your Quibus verbis Conc. verba Consecrationis altâ voce proferri prohibuit. Ledesima Ies. de Script. quavis ling. non legend. p. 161.

Col. 2. confesse (namely) first, that The Example of Christ and his Apostles is against this uttering those words in a lowe and in∣audible voice. Secondly, that The same Custome was controlled by the practice of the whole Church of Christ, both in the East part thereof (from the testimonies of ancient Liturgies, and Fathers) and in the ancient Romane Church, by the witnessing of two Popes; in whose time the People hearing the words of Consecration pronoun∣ced, did answere thereunto, AMEN. Thirdly, that the same In∣novation was much misliked by the Emperour Iustinian, who severely commanded by his Edict (as Novellâ Constit. 123. Iustiniani severè praecipitur Sacerdoribus, ut in Eucharistiae celebratione verba clarâ voce pronuntientur, ut à populo exaudiantur—[Which made Bellar. to bluster after this manner:] Ad No∣vellam responderi possit imprimis, ad Imperatorem non pertinere de ritu sacrificandi leges ferre: proinde non multum referre quid ipse sanxerit. Bellar. l. 2. de Missa c. 12. §. Ad Novellam. you know) that The Priest should pronounce the words with a cleare voice, that they may be heard of the people. Whose authority you peremptorily contemne, as though it did not belong to an Emperour to make Lawes in this kind. But forasmuch as the King of Kings, and the High Priest of Priests, the Sonne of God, hath said of this, as of the other such Cir∣cumstances, [Doe this,] who are you, that you should dare to contradict this Injunction, by the practice of any Priest, saying and speaking (yet not as Christ did, vnto Them) but only to him∣selfe, without so much as any pretence of Reason, Vtile est, ad reverentiam tanti Sacramenti (ut Basil. rectè docet l. de Sp. Sancto c. 27.) & multum confert ad dignitatem & reverentiam mysteriorum ut non assuescant homines eadem saepius audire: vel potiùs ut non offerrentur ad aures vulgi. Et in Liturgijs Graecis Basilij & Chrysost. praescribunt quaedamsub silentio dicēda.—In Liturgijs Chrysost. Sacer∣dos orat , quod non significat moderatâ voce, sed planèsecretò. In Latinis Liturgijs, Innocentio reste, praecipua pars Missae secreta erat. Bellar. quo supra. [Wee oppose 1. Never were any words held secret, so, as not to be beard of them that were baptised, and were allowed to be Communicants. Basil. speaketh of the rites of Baptisme to be kept secret, but to whom? : and how secret? by silence of voice in the Congregation? no, but, Non convenit circumferri, . And of what? of words? nay, but . Neither doth Chrysostome's , nor Innocentius his Secreto inferre any more than such a Service, in respect of them that were not to be partakers of the Communion. Secondly, wee oppose, concerning the point in question, that the words of Institution were in thse times pronounced with an audible voice both in the Greeke and Latine Churches (as hath beene confessed, and their owne Writings doe verifie:) Basil. Liturg. Sacerdos benedicens panem, —altâ voce dicens; Accipite, Hoc est corpus meum. Chrysost. in 1. Cor. 15. Hom. 40. Vobis, qui mysterijs estis initiati () volo in me∣moriam revocare eam dictionem, &c.] secundùm Graec. Edit. which
might not likewise haue moued the ancient Church of Christ, both Greeke and Romane, to the same manner of Pronunciation? Where∣as the Catholike Church, notwithstanding, for many hundred yeares together, precisely observed the ordinance of Christ. THE SECOND CHALLENGE. In respect of the necessitie of a Lowde voice, especially by the Romish Priest, in uttering the words of Consecration. THe greatest silence, which is vsed by the Romane worship∣pers, is still in the Priests vttering, or rather muttering the words of Institution [Hoc est corpus meum: and, Hic est sanguis meus:] albeit here is the greatest and most necessarie Cause of ex∣pressing them, for the satisfaction of euery vnderstanding Hearer among you. For those you call the Words of Consecration, the iust pronunciation whereof you hold to be most necessarie: because if the Priest, in vttering of them, faile but in one syllable, so farre as to alter the sence of Christs words (which as you say may happen by six manner of Defects) then the whole Consecration is void; and the thing, which you adore, is in substance meerely See Booke 7. C. 5. §. 2. Bread still. If therefore the People shall stand perplexed in themselves, whe∣ther the words, which are concealed, be duely vttered by the Priest to himselfe, how shall it not concerne them to heare the same ex∣presly pronounced, lest that (according to your owne Doctrine) they be deluded in a point of faith, and with divine worship adore Bread instead of the person of the Sonne of God? Whereof we are to entreate at large in due Ibidem. place, if God permit. Your fift Romish Transgression of the Canon of Christ his Masse, is a second Contradiction against the Sence of the former words of Christ [—SAID VNTO THEM.] SECT. VII. AGaine, that former Clause of the Canon of Christ, to wit [He said unto them] teacheth that as his voice, Saying unto them, was necessarily audible, to reach their eares; so was it also Intelligi∣ble, to instruct their vnderstanding: and therefore not vttered in a Tongue vnknowne. Which is evident by that hee giveth a Reason for the taking of the Cup [Enim] For this is the bloud, &c. which particle [For (saith your [ENIM.] Ea particula intelligitur in forma panis. Bel∣lar. l. 4. de Euch. c. 14. Cardinall) is implyed in the first part also. Now, whosoeuer reasoneth with another, would bee vnder∣stood what he saith.
The contrarie Canon of the (now) Romane Masse. The Councel of Trent (saith your Concil. Trident. Sess. 22 c. 8. Statuit non expedire ut di∣vinum Officium vul∣gari passim linguâ ce∣lebretur. Azor. Ies. Inst. Moral. par. 1. l. 8. c. 26. §. Verum-enim∣verò. Iesuite) decreed, that it is not expedient that the Diuine seruice should be celebrated in a knowne tongue. Whereupon you doubt not to censure the contrarie Do∣ctrine of Protestants to be Asserere Missas celebrandas esse lin∣guâ vulgari, cōsilium est Schismaticum—Haereticum—& non acceptandum,—nè Ecclesia dormitâsse aliquandò, atque a∣deò errâsse videatur. Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 32. Sect. 5. p. 251 Hereticall and Schismaticall, and no wayes to be admitted. But why? Lest (say you) the Church may seeme a long time to haue beene asleepe, and to haue erred in her contrarie Custome. So you. Our Church of England contrarily thus: Article 24. It is a thing repugnant to the Word of God, and Custome of the Primitiue Church to haue publike prayer, and ministring of the Sacraments in a tongue not knowne of the people. This occasioneth a double Plea against your Church of Rome, first, in defence of the Antiquitie and Vniversalitie, next for the Equitie of Prayers in a knowne tongue, in the publike service of God. I. CHALLENGE. Against the Romish Alteration of the Catholike and vni∣versall practice of the Church, and the Anti∣quity thereof. IN the examination of this point, Consider in the first place your owne Confessions, given by your Tempore Apo∣stolorum totum po∣pulum respondere solitum in diuinis of∣ficijs—Et longo tempore post in Oc∣cidente & Oriente Ecclesia: tempore Chrysostomi, & Cy∣priani, atque Hiero∣nymi, eadem Con∣suetudo invaluit. Et Hieronym{us} scribit in praefat. lib. 2. ad Gal. In Ecclesijs vrbis Ro∣mae quasi coeleste to∣nitru audiri populum reboaniem, Amen. Bellar. lib. 2. de verbo Dei, cap 16 §. Sed ne∣que. Tempore Apo∣stolorum, cùm cele∣bratetur Sacrificium hoc, Sacerdos dixit, [Hoc est corp{us} meū] & populus responde∣bat, Amen.—Et hic usus manavit in totam Ecclesiam us∣que ad mille & am∣plius annos. Maldon. Ies. Disp. de Sacram. Tom. 1. de Euch. Conict. 1. §. Vbi Scribit. Iesuits, and others, acknow∣ledging that In the dayes of the Apostles, and a long time after, euen for a thousand yeares and more, the whole Church, and in it the Peo∣ple of Rome had knowledge of this part of service, concerning the Sacrament, and vsed to say, AMEN! So you. And this is as much as we need to require, concerning the judgement and practice of the true Antiquitie of this Custome. You will rather doubt (we suppose) of the Vniversalitie thereof, because you vsually goe no farther then your Dictates, which teach, that because there were generally but three generall and knowne tongues, Hebrew, Greeke, and Latine, therefore the divine seruice was celebrated tho∣row-out the Church in one of these three. And because these could not be the vulgar language of euery Christian Nation, it must fol∣low (say Bellar. lib. 2. de verbo Dei, cap. 15. & 16, and so Others also. they) that the People of most Nations vnderstood not the publike Prayers vsed in their severall Churches. And with this Per∣swasion doe your Doctors locke vp your consciences in a false be∣leefe of an vniversall Custome of an vnknowne service of God. Which you may as easily vnlocke againe, if you shall but vse, as a key, this one Observation, viz. That the three common tongues (namely) Hebrew, Greeke, and Latine, although they were not alwayes the vulgar Languages, yet were they knowne Languages commonly to
those people that vsed them in Divine Service. Which one only Animadversion will fully demonstrate vnto vs the truth of our Cause. It is not denyed but that the three Languages Hebrew, Greeke, and Latine were, in primitiue ages, most Tres hae linguae vniuersalissimae, ità ut Hebraica per to∣tum fere Orientem: Omnes enim Chal∣daicâ, aut Syriacâ. i.

Bellar. vniuersall; insomuch that the Hebrew was spoken (albeit corruptly) thorowout almost the whole Easterne Church. The Greeke was currant thorow the whole Greeke Church also, and in the lesser Asia. And the Latine was dis∣persed ouer a great part of Europe. It will now be fully sufficient to know, that the most of these languages were certainly knowne, in publike worship, vnto all them of whom they were vsed in pub∣like Sermons, and preachings. For your owne Church, howsoe∣ver she decreed of Praying, yet doth she forbid Preaching in an vn∣knowne tongue. Now therefore ioyne (we beseech you) the eyes of your bo∣dies and mind together in beholding and pondering our Margi∣nals, and you shall finde, first (if we speake of the [Concionatus est Graecè Chrysostomus a∣pud Antiochenos, apud Caesarinses Basilius, a∣pud Alexandrinos A∣thanasius, apud Hiero∣solymianos Cyrillus.] Thus from Constan∣tinople to Antioch, throughout Asia, was the Greeke Language universally knowne. Greeke Lan∣guage) that there was a generall knowledge thereof even among the vulgar people of the Churches of Antioch, Caesarea, Alexandria, and thorowout Asia. Secondly, if of the Latine, you may behold anciently the familiar knowledge thereof in the Church of Rome, whereof St. See about, at the letter (i.) Hierome hath testified, that The people were heard in the Churches of Rome resounding and thundring out their Amen! This in Churches vnmixt. Thirdly, in mixt Congregations of Greeke and Latine, that the Cum Ecclesia Rom. de Latinis & Graecis eset permix∣ta, singulae ectiones de utra{que} lingua re∣citabantur: nam ab una lingua recitan∣tes ab utrius{que} lin∣guae populis intel∣ligi non poterant.

Fourthly, your owne generall Confession, yeelding a common knowledge of the Latine tongue to the people of a great part of Europe: and wee say also of Africke, (insomuch that Au∣gustine doth openly teach that the [Augustini sunt plurimi Tractatus & Sermones ad Hipponenses suos.

Not to tell you of the now-Custome of the remote Christian
Churches, such as are the Egyptians, Russians, Ethiopians, Armeni∣ans, and others; All which exercise their publike Service in the vulgar and mother-tongues of their owne so distinct and different Nations. For the which cause they can finde no better entertain∣ment with your Iesuites; than to admonish you that Cer tum est (in∣quiunt Protestantes) Ruthenos, Aegypti∣os, Aethiopes, Arme∣nos, & quosdam ali∣os celebrare diuina Officia in Lingua vulgari.—Respon∣demus, nos non mo∣veri Barbarorū mo∣ribus.

Cor. 14. 11. Barbarousnes it elfe. With the same modestie might you scoffe at, and reproach other more ancient Nations and Christians, commended by primitiue Fathers for celebrating their Oblations, Prayers, and Psalmes in their Nationall tongues; so, that one repeating the words first, the whole people with ioynt voyce and heart accorded in inging.

For the Scla∣vonians. See hereafter. 6. Challenge at (d) Grecians, Egyptians, Thebaeans, Palestinians, Ara∣bians, Phoenicians, and Syrians. This from the Testimonies of ho∣ly Fathers. Whether therefore the tongue we pray in be barbarous or lear∣ned, it is not respected of God, but whether it be knowne or vn∣knowne, is the point.

By this time you see your Noveltie in your Romish practice. Behold in the next place the Iniquitie and prophanenesse there∣of, and how after the death of Pope Gregory the first, which was abou 608. yeares after Christ, your Romane Church degenera∣ted as much from the (then) Romane truth in this point, as shee did from her Romane tongue and Language it selfe. Wee are here constrained to pleade the whole cause, for the defence of a ne∣cessity of a knowne worship, in respect of God, of Man, and of Both. A SECOND CHALLENGE, Shewing the Iniquitie of Seruice in an vnknowne tongue. And first of the Iniury done by the fore-said Romane Decree vnto the soules of Men.

Salmeron. Ies. Com. sup. eum locum 1. Cor. 14. [which he confesseth of the Apostles times.] granting that The Apostles in their times required a knowne Language, Greeke in the Greeke Churches, and Latine in the Latine Churches: because that first this made for the Edification and Consolation of Christians. Secondly, that Man gaineth more both in mind and affection, who knoweth what he pray∣eth. As for him that is Ignorant, you say, He is not edified, in asmuch as he knoweth not in particular, although in generall he doth vnder∣stand. Thirdly, that the Apostle commandeth that all things be done to edification. Fourthly, that the knowne Service is fitter for Deuotion: and thereupon some of you haue furthermore Con∣cluded, that It were better that the Service were used in a Language knowne both to the Clergie and People. And againe, that People pro∣fit no whit by praying in a strange language. So your owne Writers, as you may obserue in the Marginals. Now what more extreame and intolerable Iniurie could you doe to the soules of Gods people, than by imposing a strange lan∣guage upon them, thereby (according to your owne Confessions) to depriue them, and that wittingly, of Edification, Consolation, and Devotion, the three chiefe Benefits that man's soule is capable off, in the seruice of God? Thus in respect of your Iniurie a∣gainst Man. A THIRD CHALLENGE, Touching the Iniurie done, by the same Decree, a∣gainst God himselfe. YEt all this notwithstanding, you are bent to cozen Christian people, with palpable Sophistry, by your Bellarm. lib. 2. de verbo Dei, cap. 16. De Canticis Spiritualib{us} tempore Primitivae Ecclesiae Tert. §. Por∣ro consuevisse.—Quoniam igitur ista Cantica fiunt ad Po∣puli consolationem, vult Apostolus, ut fi∣ant linguâ quae in∣telligatur: ut Idio∣ta, &c. Ibid. §. Quo∣niam—Praete∣rea tunc, quia Chri∣stiani erant pauci, omnes simul psallebant in Ecclesiâ & respondebant diuinis officijs: at postea, crescente po∣pulo, divisa sunt magis officia, & solis Clericis relictum est, ut communes préces & laudes in Ecclesiâ peragant. Ibid. §. Respondeo negando.—Deni{que} finis praecipuus illorum Canticorum erat instructio & consolatio populi,—& nisi linguâ nota facta fuissent—periisset praecipuus fructus ipsorum: At Divinorum offi∣ciorum nec est finis praecipuus instructio, vel consolatio populi, sed cultus Dei. Ibid. §. Deni{que} finis. Cardinall, who confesseth that the Psalmes in the dayes of the Primitiue-Church, were sung ioyntly of the people, Because they were ordayned for in∣struction & consolation of the people, as the chiefe end. But as for the Diuine Service, The Principall end of it (saith hee) is not the in∣struction and consolation of the people, but the worship of God. So hee. Whom when we aske, why the people then did all ioyne toge∣ther both in Singing of Psalmes, and Answering the Minister in Diuine Service, and Prayer? Hee saith it was because of the Paus∣citie
of people, and rarenesse of the Assembly. Whereby it seemeth he meant to maintaine Your Degenerate Romish Wor∣ship with Paradoxes; First, As if Psalmes, publiquely sung in the Church to Gods glorie, were not Divine duties and service. Se∣condly, As if the Primitive Church, using both Psalmes and other Prayers in a knowne tongue (as he confesseth) did not bold a neces∣sitie of the Common knowledge of both, for Instruction and Con∣solation. Thirdly, As if the Assemblies of Christians were of such a Paucitie in the dayes of Tertullian; when those Psalmes ordained for Instruction and Consolation were in use. And fourthly, as if People now adayes had not asmuch need of Instruction and Con∣solation, as they that lived in Primitive-times; yea, and more, especially such People, who being led blind-fold by an Implicite Faith, have reason to crave Instruction; and having their Conscien∣ces tortured and perplexed with multiplicities of Ceremoniall Lawes, have as just cause also to desire Consolation. As for your obiecting the Worship of God by vnknowne prayers; that may be sufficient, which your owne Catechisme (authorized by the Councel of Trent) teacheth you; where answering to that question, why God, although hee know our wants before wee pray, yet will be sollicited by our prayers? it Cur Deus, cùm sciat quib{us} indige{us}, vult oratione nostrâ sollicitari? Vult nos itè petendo petere fidentius—ut ma∣gis ad amorem in∣cendamur—ac ut saepiùs majori af∣fecti laetitiâ ad cum¦amandum atque co∣lendum incitemur ardentiùs. Catech. Trid. vl Rom. part. 4. Cap. 2. pag. 386. saith, that hee doth this to the end, that Praying more confidently, wee may be more inflamed with love towards God: and so being possessed with more joy, may bee exercised to a ervent worship of God. So your publike and gene∣rall Romane Catechisme. The case then is plaine. From more Edification there ariseth more Consolation; from more Consolation there issueth more Devo∣tion; from all these proceeds more filiall Loue and dutifull Wor∣ship of God. Which was long since shadowed (as Exod. 15. [Can∣emus Domino] Can∣abat Moses & Mi∣riam, nempè Moses, id est, pars intelle∣ctus, & Miriam, id est sensus purificatus: iustum enim est in∣telligibilite & sensi∣biliter Deo hymnes dici, utrumque in∣strumentum concin∣nè pulsari, tàm in∣tellectum quàm sen∣sum, in solius Dei sal∣vatorislaudem, & actionem Gratiarum. Hactenùs Philo Iudaeus. Pulcherrimus hic Tractatus moralis. Pe∣rerius Ies. in Exo. 15. Disp. 2. §. Exercitus porrò. Philo Iudaeus allegorizeth, witnessing your Iesuite) by Moses and Miriam singing unto the Lord: Moses signifying the understanding part, and Miriam betokening the Affection; both notifying, that we are to sing Hymnes both affectionately and understandingly unto God. Therefore, if you be men of Conscience, recant that your now objected Barbarous Paradoxe, Which (contrarie to all anciently-professed Divinity, and expresse Scripture, saying, 1. Cor. 14. 15. I will pray with my spirit, I will pray with my understanding also) doth thrust man's Vnderstanding out of God's worship, to the vtter abolishing of , that is, his Reasonable worshipping of God; by making man (as Saint Aug. Expos. 2. in Psal. 18. Me∣rulae, Psitaci, Corvi, Picae, & hujusmodi volucres saepe docentur ab hominibus sonare quod nesciunt: scienter verò cantare non avi, sed homini Divina voluntate concessum est. Augustine noteth) no better than Ozells, Parrots, Ravens, and Mag-pies, all which learne to prate they know not what.
THE FOVRTH CHALLENGE, Against the said Romish Decree, as ioyntly injurious both to God and Man, from the Text of the A∣postle, 1. Cor. 14. IN the fourth place VVee are to speake of the Iniquitie of your vnknowne language in Prayer, joyntly against both God and Man; because that without the vnderstanding of the Prayer it is impossible for a man (being of discretion) to pray vnto, or to praise God as hee ought: and consequently to obtaine any blessing by prayer from God, according to that Apostolicall Doctrine, 1. Cor. 14. where he saith of the man ignorant of the language of prayer, [;] How shall he say Amen, at thy giving of thankes, see∣ing he knoweth not what thou sayest? To which Argument of the Apostles, taken from the Impossibility, your Dici Apostolus [ut instruam] Expen∣de vocem hanc, n∣struam; quòd sit de paedicatione, non de Missae celebraione. Eckius Enchrid. Quaes. Missa Latinè, §. Quod ad. & Bellar. Aliqui respondent, non agiic de preci∣bus. Lib 2. de verbo Dei c. 16 §. Ad hanc. Eckius and some Others answere, that the Apostle speaketh of Preaching, and not of Praying. What, not of Praying, Eckius? May it not bee said of this your great Doctor, and Antagonist to Luther, that this man could not see the River for water? for (as your Imò sequitur [] quibus verbis Apostolus sig∣nificat precari, &c. Bellar. ibid. Cardinall confes∣seth) in the text it selfe the Apostle vseth these three words, Pray, sing, and give thankes. Will you now seeke an Evasion from Mr. Master Breerley in his Liturgie of the Masse, Tract. 5. Sect. 4. ad finem. Brereley Pr. collecting (as he saith) the Contrarie in the Apostle, as affirming that not the whole vulgar, but some one was especi∣ally appointed to supply the place of the vnlearned to say Amen? Which Reason he may seeme to have borrowed from your Providet sapi∣entèr Ecclesia, ut Mi∣nister vice totius po∣puli respondeat: imò hoc est quod Aposto∣lus ai, cùm subdit, Qui supplet locum Idiotae. Sixtus Ses∣Biblioth. lib. 6. Annot. 263. Hinc manifestè convincitur, fuisse tempore Apostoli Pauli unum, qui suppleretlocum populi. Ledesima Ies. de Scriptur▪ nonle∣gend. cap. 26. 27. §. Praetercà ex. & Sa. Ies. Coment. in hunc locum. Se∣nensis, who saith that The Apostle by him [That occupieth the place of the vnlearned] meant the Clarke of the Parish, and not the vul∣gar people. But this is thought of your Bellarmine, and others, to be but an vnlearned Answere, because that In the dayes of the Apostle (saith Tempore Apost lorum nullum fuis∣se pro Laicis constitutum, ex ustino constat: E Graeca vox [] non significat, secundùm usum Graecae liguae, vice diotarum, sed unum esse ex Idiotis. Bellar. lib. 2. de verbo Dei, c. 16. §. Sed non videtur.—Ità est secundùm phrasin Graecam, ut sit sensus: unus ex Idiotis. Salmeron. Jes. in 1. Cor. 14. Disp. 2. §. Illud etiam. And the English Rhemists in their Annot. on the same place. he) There was not any such office ordained, as is the Clarke of the Parish: and if there had beene any such, yet the Greeke phrase [] would not admit of any such interpretation. So hee. Lastly, it can be no lesse than an extreme Infatuation to appose (as Satisfacit Sacerdos, cùpreces e∣tiam non intellectas absolvit: etiam meretur, modò in Dei laudes preces non intellectas peroret. Sic in Mo∣nasterijs professae, & Monachi non pauci orant, quae intellectu non modò non assequuntur. Sic enin Pueri o∣rant, & est beneplacitum Deo. Eckius Tom. 2. Hom. 3. in festo Rogat. pag. 90. Etiam pueri oran, Ozanna, & pre∣ces eorum erant Christo gatissimae. Salmer. Ies. in 1. Cor. 16. Disp. 30. §. Septimo. So the Rhemists in Matth. 21. Verse 16. and in 1. Cor. 19. pag. 463. doe your Iesuite Salmeron, Eckius, and the Rhemists) the ex∣ample
of Children; because the Children crying Hosanna, and not un∣derstanding their prayers, were notwithstanding (say they) accepted of Christ. Ergò the Priest, Monkes, and Nunnes, in praysing God may be gratefull to God, although they vnderstand not that which they pray. So they. An Obiection taken (as you see) from Children, or rather, as it might seeme, made by Children, it is altogether so Childish. For the Apostle, as it were fore-seeing that this might possibly be fancied by some fond and obstinate Opposers to the Spirit of Truth, doth in the very same Chapter 1. Cor. 14. 20. pur∣posely prevent it, saying; Brethren, be not children in understanding. For although, when a Childe asketh his Fathers blessing only with clapping his hands together, or uttering halfe syllables, it joyeth the Father, because his Childe now expresseth his duty, according to the Capacitie of a Childe: yet if the same Childe, after hee is come to the perfect yeares of discretion, should performe that du∣ty in no better manner than by childish babling, would the Father hold this to be Reverence, and not rather plaine Mocquerie? So is the Case betwixt us and 2. Cor. 8. 12. God, who accepteth every one accor∣ding to that which he hath, and not according to that which he hath not: A Childe in the capacity of a Childe, but a man according to to the apprehension of a man. In which consideration the Apostle saith, 1. Cor. 13. 11. When I was a childe, I spake as a childe, but be∣ing a man I put away childishnesse. Away therefore with this your more than Childish Obiection. VVee returne to the Impossibilitie of praying duely in an vn∣knowne tongue, which the Apostle illustrateth by two Similitudes, the one taken from an Instrument of peace, Verse 7. He that know∣eth not the distinct sound of the Pipe [;] How shall he know what is piped? that is, it is impossible for him to apply himselfe to the daunce. The other from an Instrument of warre, Verse 8. If the Trumpet give an vncertaine sound, who shall prepare himselfe to bat∣tell? As if hee would haue said, It is impossible to know when to to march forward, or when to retraite. So it is said of vn∣knowne Prayer [;] How shall he that is ignorant of the language say Amen? that is to say (by the interpretation of your Populus ignorae linguae quomodò re∣spondebit, Amen? hoc est, animae prae∣bebit assensum, cùm more Babylonice cō∣fusionis qui dissident, nequaquàm sensu a∣nimis{que} conspirent. Acosta Ies. de Indorum salute cap. 6. p 37. e∣suite) How shall people, ignorant of the tongue, answere Amen? (that is) yeild consent unto the Prayer, seeing that they, who dissent among themselves after a Babylonish confusion, cannot consent in minde and affection. So he. Or, as your Quomodò di∣cet, [Amen?] Cum quid boni dicas non intelligit, nii bene∣dicas tantùm. Aquinas in hunc locum, 1. Cor. 14. I adde Sander. de visib. Monarch. ad Ann. 1563. [Si benedixeris spiricu] Quomodò dicat Amen? Significatur de precibus Ecclesiasticis, ateor, quas in spiritu, hoc est, in dono linguae peregrinae recitari nollet, ut in Latina Ecclesia Hebraeam, aut in Graeca Persicam: quià deëssent ple∣runque viri docti & periti illius linguae, qui populo interpretari possent. [Thus from the Apostle he granteth, that Prayers are not to be used, where the people have not the interpretation: although hee say, that Deus honoriic entiùs colitur perlinguam doctam, quam per indoctam & vulgarem. As though where there is no respect of persons with God, yet there should be respect of the Tongues.] Aquinas; How shall he say, Amen, who vnderstandeth not what good words thou speakest, but only know∣eth that thou blessest? Thus in one Transgression you commit a
double Sacrilege, to wit, by Robbing God of his due Honour, and Men of their spirituall graces and Comforts. To conclude. These Premises doe prove, that among many thousands of your people, assembled at a Romane Masse, and being ignorant of their Service, not any such an one (a miserable Case!) can justly be held to be a true Worshipper of God, who requireth of his VVorshippers the Hos. 14. 2. & Heb. 13. 15. Calves of their lips, and not (as now they make themselves) the lips of Calves. THE FIFT CHALLENGE, Out of the Doctrine of the Apostle, 1. Cor. 14. more copiously in confutation of your divers Objections. IT were an easie matter to bee superfluous in the prosecuting of this Argument, by proving the truth of this Doctrine out of the Testimonies of ancient Fathers, if it were imaginable that any Reply could be made to that which is alreadie said. But yet behold an In his afóre∣mentioned writing to a Ladie, &c. Anonymus, having had notice of most of these points, hath for∣med such Objections and Answeres, as his prejudicated and pur∣blinde Conceit could reach vnto. First, in answere to the places objected out of 1. Cor. 14. affirming (out of the Rhemish Anno∣tations) That the Apostle speakes not of the publike and set prayers of the Church, but of extraordinarie and spirituall exercises of Ex∣hortations, and suddaine Prayors. So he. Wherein the man contra∣dicteth your owne Alij dicunt A∣postolum loqui de divinis officijs, viz. Haymo, Primasius, P. Lombardus, D. Thomas, & alij qui∣dam ex Latinis. Teste Bellar. l. 2. de verb. Dei cap. 16. Schoolemen, but especially the Apostle his direct saying, Verse 23. If the whole Congregation meete together &c. what more publike than that Assembly of the whole Congrega∣tion? And (to suppose that they were extraordinarie Prayers) what is more consectarie and Consequent, than that if the Apo∣stle note it for an Abuse, to practice such extraordinarie Exercises of Preaching and Praying in a tongue vnknowne, even because the Hearers are not thereby Edified (doubtlesse) the same Abuse practiced in publike and ordinarie Service, being more notorious and Common, must needs be so much the more condemnable: as witnesse both Ancient Fathers, and your owne Brethren, who have taught the vse of a knowne Tongue, in all publique and ordi∣narie service of God, from this Text of Scripture, which (as you say) speaketh of Prayers extraordinarie. Yea, but It is sufficient (saith he) that the vulgar people know, in generall, although they vnderstand not the Prayers in particular. VVhich againe Contradicteth the Apostle, who in the sixteenth Verse will have the Private or Vulgar man to be able to giue con∣sent to the publique Prayer, in saying Amen. And therefore requi∣reth the Minister, Verse 7. as the Harper, to yeild in particular a Di∣stinction of tunes [:] and Verse 8. as a Trumpet∣ter, [] to give a certaine knowne sound; that which your owne Doctors have also confessed.
A third Instance is taken out of Bellarmine, who saith that Non reprehen∣ditur oratio non in∣tellecta, sed i ante∣ponitur oratio quae intelligitur, ut patet Verse 17. [Tu quidem benè gratias agis, sed alter non aedificatur] Bellar. quo supra. The Apostle reprehendeth not an vnknowne Prayer, but prefer∣reth a knowne Prayer before the other, saying Verse 7. Thou, indeed, prayest well, but another is not edified. Flatly contradictorie to the whole scope of the Apostle, throughout the Chapter, as your owne Salmeron. Ies. See above Challenge 2. at the let. (z.) Iesuite is forced to proclaime. The Apostle (saith he) would have the people to be edified, because then all things ought to have beene done to the Edification and Consolation of the Assembly: and therefore he would not have any Publike Prayer vsed among the He∣brewes but in the Hebrew-language; nor among the Grecians but in Greeke; nor yet among the Latines, but in the Latine tongue. The meaning then is [Thou indeed] namely, who art the Minister, and knowest the prayer, so far dot well; but in respect of others, which cannot understand, Not well, because, They are not edified. His fourth Obiection he wresteth out of the fourth Verse. [If I pray with my tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my vnderstanding is without fruit.] So he. As though that strange Tongue, here spoken off, were not vnderstood by him that prayed. Which contradict∣eth the Apostle, Verse 4. He that speaketh with the tongue doth e∣difie himselfe: for never did any denie that he, who had the mira∣culous gift of Speech in a strange tongue, did understand himselfe, although sometimes he wanted the gift of interpreting it, for the vnderstanding of all others. Therefore saith the Apostle, Verse 13. [He that speaketh with the tongue let him pray, that he may interprete it.] Fiftly, by the word [Spirit] Id est, si orē▪ do∣o linguae: nimirùm, quam non intelligam [Spiritus] id est Af∣fectus meus orat, sed mens est sine fructu. Ergo dicit Apostol{us}, non Orationem sed mentem esse sine fructu. Bellar. quo sup. And this Answere M. Breeely borrowed from Bellar. Tract. vpon the Masse, pag. 452. your Cardinall would have understood the Affection, as if Affection without understanding did profit him that prayeth: which is fully contrarie to the Apo∣stles Doctrine, as witnesseth Vox [Spiritus] à principio usque ad inem Donum Spiri∣tus peculiare signifi∣cat, quo impelleban∣tur linguis lequi. Si Apostolus in hac vo∣ceadmitteret Homo∣nymiam aliquā Grae∣ci Patres nos de eo admonuissent. Salme∣ron. Ies. in eund. locum. your Salmeron in plaine termes; shewing that the word, Spirit, thorow-out this whole Chapter, signifieth not the Affection, but the miraculous Spirituall gift of speaking in Strange tongues, as also the Vpon the same place both Ambrose, [Spiritu, id est, lin∣guâ ignotâ] and Chry∣sostome also. Fathers expound it. In the next place the afore-said Anonymus contendeth by Rea∣son, but such as others reached unto him. Fathers say (saith hee) the words of Consecration should be kept secret. True, to them that were not capable of this Sacrament, but never to the licenced Communicants; because that Christ, and his Apostles, yea, and the Vniversall Church primitive consecrated in an audible voice, and knowne language, as hath beene confessed. Yet furthermore, The Church (saith he) used the said Hebrew word, Allelujah, unknowne to the people. What then? know you not that in all Churches, of whatsoeuer language, is used also the Hebrew word, Amen? and if people doe not learne one or two words of a strange tongue, it is not for that they are witlesse, but because they are wilfull and carelesse. Their last Reason. Some languages (as for example that in Ita∣lie) were Romane and corupted by invasion of Enemies of divers languages, and in the end became Italian, &c. yet the publike
Service was not altered, but continued Romane as before. This Argument is à facto ad jus, all one with that Reasoning à Baculo ad angulum. Like as if some should Conclude, that because Stewes are allowed at Rome, they are therefore justly licenced. But wee demand, are men made for languages, or rather languages for men? if the first, then all men were bound to learne all langua∣ges. If the latter, then is that language to be used, which is knowne to serve best for the Edification and Consolation of God's people in his worship. A SIXT CHALLENGE, Out of the Doctrine of Antiquitie. ALthough it were preposterous to exact of vs a proofe, from Antiquitie, of condemning the Service in a strange tongue, seeing (as hath beene confessed) the Primitive practice is wholly for vs; and therefore no Abuse in those times could occasion any such Reproofe: yet shall we, for your better illumination, offer unto you some more expresse Suffrages of the ancient Fathers, after that wee shall have satisfied your Obiections, pretended to make for your Defence. Saint Augustine saith of the People, that their Safetie consisteth not in the vigour of their understanding, but in their simplicitie of believing. So indeed doth Aug. de Bap. l. 6. c. 24. Multi irruunt in preces, etiam ab Hae∣reticis compositas, & per ignorantiae sim∣plicitatem non va∣lentes decernere, u∣tuntur cis, & plerun∣que precis vitium su∣perat precantis affe∣ctus.—Non quià ista corrigenda non sint, ut populus ad id, quod planè intelli∣gat, dicat Amen Idem de Catechizand. rudi∣bus c. 9. Teste Cassandro in Liturg. pag. 0. Augustine forewarne the people, who although they knew the single words of the prayers of Heretickes, yet might possibly be deluded with the obscuritie of their Hereticall Sences. The Difference is extreme. For Saint Augustine's people vnderstood the language of those prayers, in the obscure and inuolued Sence whereof they were vnwillingly igno∣ant. But your Popish people are wilfully ignorant both of the Words and Sence. The oddes therefore is no lesse than this; they were simply, yours are sottishly ignorant, and Augustine wisheth that their Simplicitie were corrected; you hold your Peoples blindnesse worthy to be commended. Secondly, Origen saith, that when Christians are exercised in reading of holy Scripture, albeit some words be not vnderstood, yet is that reading profitable. This Sentence also is alleaged for counte∣nancing of Origen Hom. 0. in os Quae nos pro∣ferimus saepe non in∣telligimus, sed virtu∣tes intelligunt. Ergo licet preces non in∣tellectas usurpare. Ob. Bellar. l. 2. deverbo Dei cap. 16. Prayer in an unknowne tongue; notwithstanding that, in a man's Reading of Scripture, God is said to speake unto man: but in Praying, man is said to speake unto God. So that it may be both lawfull and profitable to the Reader, to find some particular Scrip∣tures, which God would have to excell the Capacitie of the most learned, to humble them, to the admiration of his excellent wis∣dome, as the Fathers teach. Whereas contrarily an unknowne Prayer, wittingly used, is both vnprofitable and vnlawfull, as hath beene copiously confessed by your owne Divines, from the Do∣ctrine of the Apostle.
More Obiections out of the Fathers you have not. We will trie whether we can recompence your Nominalities (that wee may so call your impertinent Obiections) with Realities and soli Proofs. Cast but your eyes vpon the Marginals, consisting partly of the Relation of your owne Iohannes Billet in summa de divinis offlcijs; In primiti∣va Ecclesia (inquit) prohibitum erat, nè quis loqueretur lin∣guis, nisi intellige∣rentur.—At no∣stris temporibus, ubi nullus aut rarus in∣venitur legens vel audiens, qui intelli∣gat, completum est quod à Propheta di∣citur: Erit Sacer∣dos ut populus.

Cor. 14. [Qui supplet locum Idi∣otae, quomodò dicet Amen ad benedictionem tuam, quià nescit quid dicis?] Imperitus n. nesciens quid dici∣tur, nescit finem orationis, & non respondet Amen. Verum, ut confirmetur benedictio: per hos n. qui respon∣dent Amen, impletur confirmatio precis, ut omnia dicti veri testimonio confrmentur in mentibus Audientium.—[Sed alius non aedificaur.] Si igitur ad aedificandam Ecclesiam convenitis, ca debent dici, quae intelli∣gant Audientes: nam quid prodest, ut quis lingua loquatur, quam solus scit? ideò tacere debet in Ecclesia, ut ij loquantur qui prosunt Audientibus. Ambrose denying that He, who is the person ignorant of the Prayer, can give consent vnto it, by saying Amen: and thereupon inferreth, that only Such things should be spoken in the publike Congregation, which the Hearers vnderstand. Chrysost. in 1. Cor. 14. [Barbarus] Et ille mihi, & ego illi, non uti{que} ob naturam vocis, sed ob imperitiam—Et qui non intelligit quid loquatur, sibi est Barbarus. [Qui locum tenetindocti.] Indoctum promiscuam plebm intelligit, monstrat{que} non leue impedimentum esse, si non intel∣ligat. [Omnia ad aedificationem.] Aedificare. n. Architecti est opus, & per omnia proximum juvare—Si n. aedificandi gratiâ non venis, quid necesse est omninò venisse? Chrysostome noting a Man, Ignorant of the Prayer, to be no better then a Barbarian to himselfe, not in respect of the nature of the voyce, but of his owne ignorance; and declaring Prayers, in an vnknowne tongue, to be contrary to the Apostles Doctrine, who requireth that All things be done to edification. Isidor. de Eccles offic. l. 1. cap 10. Opor∣tet, quando oratur, ut ab omnibus oretur. Isiodore peremptorily affir∣ming an [Oportet,] and duety, that All may be able to Pray in pub∣like places of prayer. Theophylact noting that Theophylact. in 1. Cor. 14. [Tugraias bene agis, sed alius non aedificatur.] Proximiutilitate rejecta, inutiles erant huiusmodi gratiae. The giuing of thankes to God is unprofitable, where the edification of the people is neglected. Augustine, in his Comment vpon the Psalmes, often exhorting all sorts of men to sing them: and thereupon the In the Preface of an vn∣knowne Author before the Prologue of S. Aug. vpon the Psalmes: Quo modo debitè potest Deo psallere, qui ignorat quid psallat? Author of the Pre∣face before his Comment (as it were tuning his note to Augustines) doth deny that any can sing Psalmes as he ought to God, who know∣eth not what he singeth. And, lest that this might not suffice, we have added the See above in the begiing of the 6. Sect. letter (d.) Edict of the Emperour Istinian, commanding a lowd voice in the Mini∣ster, that the people may vnderstand his words. Next, a Canon of a Councell, requiring a See a little before at the letter (x.) Concordance both of voice and vnderstan∣ding in the singing of Psalmes, as that which ought to be by that Doctrine of Scripture [I will pray with my spirit, and I will pray with my vnderstanding.] Then, a Decree of one Pope, in his Coun∣cell, that provision be made, where people of diuers Languages dwell in the same Cities, that their Ibid. at the letter (u) Service may be done accor∣ding to their Different tongues. After, the Resolution of another Pope, to grant vnto the Ibid. Sclavonians, at their conversion to the faith, that Divine Service might be vsed in their owne tongue;

And lastly, Ibid. a Prohi∣bition in the Primitive Church, that None should speake in languages vnknowne to the people. When you have disgested all these Premises, concerning the Equity and Necessity of knowne Prayers in the publike and Divine Service, both in consideration of God's worship and Mans manifold profit, so amply confirmed by so many and vncontrollable testi∣monies, then guesse (if you can) of what dye the face of your Do∣ctor Stapleton was, when hee shamed not to call this our Pra∣ctice of knowne prayers Quod aute omnia vernacue fi∣unt in Ecclesis, pla∣nè profanum est.

Iesuites will shew: first, that the Practice of the Apostles and Primitive Church, for aboue 500. yeares, was, according to Christ's Institution, to deliver the Bread into the hands of the Communicants. Secondly, that the same Order was observed at Rome (as appeareth by the Epistle of Pope Cornelius.) Thirdly, that whereas Some had devised, for Reve∣rence-sake, certaine Silver vessels, by the which they received the Sacrament; yet two Councels, the one at Toledo, and the other at Trullo, did forbid that fashion, and required that they should re∣ceive it with their hands. Hitherto from you selves. Vaine, therefore, is your pretence of Reverence, in suffering the Priest onely to receive it with his hands, as being more worthy in him∣selfe than all the rest of the people: when as our High-Priest Christ Iesus disdained not to deliver it into the hands of his Disciples. Or els to denie this libertie vnto the people, as if their Handes were lesse sanctified than their mouthes. But you will say that it is in Reuerence, lest that the body of Christ may (as you teach) light vpon the ground, if any fragments of the Hoast should chance to fall. There can be no doubt, but that in the dispensation of this blessed Sacrament Christians ought to vse due Cautelousnes, that it may be done without miscarriage; yet must you give vs leaue to retort your pretence of Reverence vpon your selves, thus: Seeing that Christ himselfe Instituted, and his A∣postles observed, and that the whole Church of Christ (for so ma∣ny hundred yeares) thus practized the administration of this Sa∣crament from hand to hand, without respect of such Reverence, they therefore were not of your opinion, to thinke every Crumme or piece of the Hoast, that falleth to the ground, to be really the Bo∣dy of Christ. This Aberration wee may call, in respect of others, but a small Transgression, if yet any Transgression may be called small, which is a wilfull violating of this so direct a Charge of Christ, [Doe this.] The seaventh Transgression of the Canon of Christ his Masse, contradicting the Sence of the next wordes, [EATE YEE.] SECT.

VVE doe not dispute against all manner of Reseruation of the Eucharist, for wee acknowledge some to be ancient; but wee inquire into the religious use and end of Reseruation: which, we say, was not for any publike Profession, or Adoration, but only for a Sacramentall Eating thereof. And how vniustly you call this your Procession (only for publike Adoration) Laudable, wee are provided to demonstrate by the Confessions of your owne Ie∣suites and others (out of Cyprian, and other Fathers) who, consul∣ting first about Antiquitie, grant that, after the Celebration of the Eucharist, anciently Prisca consuetu∣do erat dandi Eu∣charistiam infantib', ut ex Cypr. & alijs constat: & si aliquae particulae superes∣sent, mos erat ut pu∣ori impuberes, qui Ecclesiam frequenta∣bant, accerserentur, ut eas consumerent.

Lastly, lest you may obiect (as else where) that a Negative Ar∣gument (as this, because Christ did not institute this Custome, therefore it may not be allowed) is of no effect; we adde, that the Argument negative (if in any thing) then must it prevaile in con∣demning that Practice, which maintaineth any new End, diffe∣ring from that which was ordained by Christ. Which made Ori∣gen and Cyprian argue Negatively in this Case: the one Christus non distulit, hee servari iussit in crastinum. Orig. Hom. 5. in Levit. Panis iste recipitur, non includitur. Cyprian. de coena Dom. col 382. saying, Christ reserved it not till to-morrow: and the other; This bread is received, and not reserved, or put into a Boxe. Which Conclusion we may hold, in condemning of your publike Carrying of the Hoast in the streets and Market-places, to the end only that it may be Adored, aswell as (of latter times) your Pope Pius Quartus (which your Congregation of Sic sanctiss. Sacramentum ad infirmos deferendum est, ut illud sumant, non autem ut adoren tantùm; sicubi fit in aliquibus locis, quod Pius Quartus prohibuit. Declaratio Rom. Cardinal. in Concil. Trid. Sess. 13.

Catechist. pag. 115.] Cardinals report) did forbid a new-upstart Custome of Carrying the Sacrament to sicke people, that they might adore it, when as they were not able to eate it. All these Premises doe inferre, that your Custome of Circumgestation of the Sacrament, in publike Procession, onely for Adoration, cannot justly be called Laudable, except you meane thereby to have it termed a Laudable Noveltie, and a Laudable profanation, and Transgression, against the Institution of Christ; as now from your owne Confes∣sions hath beene plainly evicted: and as will be further manife∣sted, when wee are to speake of your In the seventh Booke.

Trid. sta∣tuente, non solū non necessarium esse, sed nè quidem decere Eucharistiam Infan∣tibus dari. Maldō. Ies. Com. in Ioh. 6. 53. p. 719. Saint Augustine, and Pope Innocent the first, this opinion was of force in your Church, For six hundred yeares together, viz. that the Administration of the Eucharist is ne∣cessary for Infants. Which opinion (saith hee) is now reiected by the Councell of Trent, Determining that the Eucharist is not only not neces∣sarie for Infants, but also that is Indecent to give it unto them. So he. Of this more in the Challenge. CHALLENGE. IS not now this your Churches Reiecting of her former Practice a Confession that she hath a long time erred in Transgressing of the Institution of Christ? How then shall your Trent-Fathers free your fore-father Pope Innocent, and your former Romane Church from this taxation? This they labour to doe, but (alas their mi∣serie!) by collusion and cunning: for the same Synod of Sancta Syno∣dus docet, Parvulos, usu rationis carētes, nullâ obligari neces∣sitate ad Sacramen∣talem Eucharistiae cō∣munionem—Ne∣que ideò tamen dā∣nanda est Antiquitas, si eum morem aliquā∣do in quibusdam lo∣cis servrunt, quià certè eos nullâ salutis necessitate fecisse, si∣ne controversia cre∣dendum est. Conc. Trid. Sess. 21. cap. 4. Trent resolveth the point thus; The holy Synod (say they) teacheth, that Children being void of the use of Reason, are not necessarily bound to the Sacramentall receiving of the Eucharist. This wee call a collu∣sion; for by the same Reason, wherewith they argue that Children are not necessarily bound to receive the Eucharist, because they want reason, they should have concluded, that Therefore the Church is and was necessarily bound not to administer the Eucharist to Infants, even because they wanted Reason. Which the Councell, doubt∣lesse, knew, but was desirous thus to cover her owne shame, touch∣ing her former superstitious practice of Giving this Sacrament vnto Infants. In excuse whereof, your Councell of Trent adioyneth, that the Church of Rome, in those dayes, was not condemnable; but why? Because (saith your See the Testimony below at the letter (r.) Councell) Truly and without Con∣troversie wee ought to beleeve, that they did not give the Eucharist
unto Infants, as thinking it necessary to Salvation. Which Answere your owne Doctors will prove to be a bold, and a notorious vn∣truth, because (as your Iesuite Ecclesia tunc adducta fuit Eucha∣ristiam Infātibus da∣re, argumento sump∣to ex verbis Christi, [Nisi manducaueri∣tis carnem filij ho∣minis, & biberitis sanguinem, nòn ha∣bebitis vitam in vo∣bis] Maldon. Ies. disp. de Sacram. Tract. de Euch. §. Nono, p. 00. Etiam credebant In∣fantes tunc baptiza∣tos, nisi Eucharisti∣am perciperent, sal∣vos esse non posse. Idem Com. in Ioh. 6. 63. p. 717. sheweth) They then beleeved that Infants baptized could not be saved, except they should parti∣cipate of the Eucharist; taking their Argument from that Scrip∣ture of Iohn 6. [Except you eate the flesh of the Sonne, &c.] and ther∣fore held they it necessarie to the salvation of Infants. That this was the beleefe of Pope Innocent, and of the Church of Rome vnder him, your Parisian Doctor Innocent. 1. Rom. Pont. Epist. 93. ad Conc. Milevet. con. Pelag. respondebat, quòd parvulos aeter∣nae vitae praemijs, eti∣am sine baptismatis gratia posse donari, perfatuum est: nisi . manducaverint carnem filij hominis, non habebunt vitam in semeipsis; qui au∣tem hanc els sine re∣generatione defen∣dunt, videntur etiam mihi Baptismū cassa∣re velle, cùm praedi∣cant nos habere, quod in eos creditur non nisi Baptismate conferendum. [Whence Espencaeus thus:] Mirum, ejus temporis Pontifices ex Eucharistiae necessitate Baptismi & ejus praecursoris urgere necessitatem; nisi idem, & ex eodem tùm loco, tùm Innocentij argumento & authoritate, aduersus eosdem hostes urgeret August. Epist. 106. con. Pelag.—Contra Apostolicae sedis authoritatem, ubi de hac ipsâ re cùm ageretur, hoc testimonium exhibitum est Evangelicum, nè Parvuli non baptizati vitam posse habere credantur.

Pont. exorius, qui parvulos (ait) definivit, nisi mandacaverint carnem filij hominis, vitam prorsus habere non posse. Espen. ibid. [And a little after he sheweth the loosnes of Aquinas his Solutions. Albeit, S. Augustine was not constant in this opinion, but (as may be gathered out of Bedes Collectanies in 1. Cor. 10. Nulli aliquatenùs dubi∣tandum, &c.) that although the Childe doe not participate, yet by Baptisme he is made partaker of that which it signifieth.] Espencaeus also proveth at large, out of the expresse writings of Pope Innocent. Yea, and your greatly approved Binius, in his Volumes of the Councels, dedica∣ted to Pope Paul the fift, Binius Tom. 1. Conc. ex Rescriptis Innocentij Papae ad Conc. Milevit. Epist 25. Illud vero, &c. Hinc Binius; Hinc constat Innocentij sententia, quae 600 circiter Annos viguit in Ecclesia (quam{que} Augusti∣nus secutus) Eucharistiam Infantibus necessariam fuisse. Conc. Trid. rectè decrevit, eam non solûm non ne∣cessariam Infantibus, sed nè quidem decere ut eis distribuatur—Quidam viri non vulgariter docti existimâ∣runt Innocentium hunclocum, [Nisi manducaveritis, &c.] in Baptismi sumptione interpretari. Sed decepti sunt, quòd vim argumenti, quo Pontifex utitur, non sunt assecuti. Ille n. ut Pelagium (qui docebat Baptis∣mum infantibus, Parente fideli prognatis, peccatum originale non contrahentibus, necessarium non esse) convinceret, hāc Ratiocinatione est vsus: Quibus necessaria est Eucharistiae sumptio, ijsdem Baptismi sumptio magis est necessaria. At infantibus omnibus esse necessariam Eucharistiae sumptionem, probatur per verba Iohannis [Nisi manducaveritis] &c. Quae expositio Praxi Ecclesiae nunc repugnat. [De Augustini sententia le∣ge ipsum Augustinum, Epist. 106. Col. 148. Edit. Basil 1543.] Haec Binius in Editione sua Colon: Ann. 1618. being omitted in his former-printed Volume, Anno 1606. explaineth the same so exactly (See the Marginall Citation) that it will permit no Euasion. And so much the rather, because that which the Tridentine Fathers alledge, for cause of Alteration, doth confirme this unto us: It is vndocent (say they) to give the Eucharist unto Infants. This may perswade vs that Innocent held it necessary, els would he not haue practized, and pa∣tronized a thing so vtterly vndecent. Wee dispute therefore. If the Church of Rome, in the dayes of Pope Innocent the first, held it a doctrine of faith, in the behalfe of Infants, that they ought to receiue the Sacrament of the Eucharist, the same Church of Rome, in her Councell of Trent (whose Decrees by the Bull of Pope Pius the fourth are all held to be beleeued vpon necessity of Salvation) did decree contrarily that the participation of the Eucharist is not necessary, no nor yet decent for Infants. Say now, did the Church of Rome not erre in the dayes of Pope Innocent? then is she now in an error. Or doth shee not now erre herein?
then did she formerly erre, and consequently may erre hereafter, in determinining a matter to be Necessary to Salvation, which in it selfe is Superfluous and Vndecent. Thus of the contrary custome of the Church of Rome, in elder times. The new contrary Opinion, concerning the Romane Masse, at this day. Euen at this day also your Iesuite will haue vs to vnderstand the meaning of your Church to be, that Non quòd Infan∣tes sunt incapaces huius Sacramenti, sed quià hoc nunc magis expedit, ad decentiam, & reverentiam, quae aliquali vtilitati parvulorum praeferenda est.

The first is 1. Cor. 11. [] Let a man examine himselfe, and so come, &c. The second [] To discerne the Lords body. The third is [] To remember the Lords death vntill his Comming againe. All which Three, being acts of Iudgement, how they may agree vnto Infants, being per∣sons void of iudgement, iudge you. And remember, we pray you, that wee speake of Sacrament all Eating, and not of that vse See above. Sect. 10. before spoken of touching Eating it after the Celebration of the Sacrament; which was for Consuming it, and not for Communi∣cating thereof.
CHAP. III. The Tenth Transgression of the Canon of Christ his Masse by the now Church of Rome, is in contradicting the Sence of the next words following (concerning the second part of this Sacrament of receiuing the Cup) [HE LIKE∣WISE TOOKE THE CVP, AND GAVE IT TO THEM, SAYING, DRINKE YEE ALL OF THIS.] And adding, 1. Cor. 11. [DOE THIS, AS OFTEN AS YOV DOE IT, IN REMEM∣BRANCE OF MEE.] SECT. I. BY which Words [Like manner of Taking, and Gi∣ving, and Saying, Drinke yee All of this] we say that Christ ordained for his Guests as well the Sacra∣mentall Rite of Drinking as of Eating; and hath tied his Church Catholike in an equall obligation for performance of both, in the administring of this Sacrament. This Cause will require a just Treatise, yet so, that our Discourse insist only upon necessary points, to the end that the extreme Inso∣lencie, Noveltie, Folly, and Obstinacie of the Romane Church, in contradicting of this part of Christ his Canon, may be plainly displayed; that every conscience of man, which is not strangely preoccupated with prejudice, or transported with malice, must needs see and detest it. We have heard of the Canon of Christ his Masse. The contrarie Canon of the Romish Church, in her Masse. Shee in her Councell of Constance, decreed that Christus sub u∣traque specie Disci∣pulis administravit—Licet in primiti∣vâ Ecclesiâ subutra∣que specie hoc Sa∣cramentum recipe∣retur,—tamen haec consuetudo, ut à Lai∣cis sub specie panis tantùm reciperetur,—habenda est pro lege, quàm non licet reprobare. Conc. Con∣stant. Sess. 13. Although Christ, indeed, and the Primive Church did administer the Eucharist in both kinds; notwithstanding (say they) this Custome of but one kind is held for a law irreprovable. Which Decree shee afterwards con∣firmed in her Ipsa Synodus, à Spiritu Sancto edocta, & ipsius Ecclesiae iudicium & consuetudinem secura, declarat & docet, nllo divino iure Laicos, & lericos non consecrantes, obligari ad Eucharistiae Sacramentum sub utraque specie su∣mendum: etsi Christas venerabile hoc Sacramentum sub utraque instituit, & Apostolis tradidit. Conc. Trid. Sess. 21. cap. 1. Councell of Trent, requiring that the former Cu∣stome and Law of receiuing it but vnder one kinde be observed both by Laicks, yea, and also by those Priests, who being present at Masse, doe not the office of Consecrating. Contrarily our Church of England in her thirtieth Article thus: Both parts of the Lords Sacrament, by Christ's Ordinance and Commandement, ought to be ministred to all Christian men alike.
CHALLENGE. BVt wee demand; what Conscience should mooue your late Church of Rome to be guided by the authority of that former Councel of Constance, which notwithstanding maketh no scruple to reiect the authority of the same Respondeo, Fuit reprobarum Conc. Cōstantiense à Mar∣tino Pont. quantum ad eam partem, quâ statuit Concilium fu∣isse suprà Papam. Bel∣lar. l 1. de Conc. c. 7. §. Quintum. Councell of Constance in another Decree thereof, wherein it gain-sayeth the Antichristian usurpa∣tion of the Pope, by Denying the authority of the Pope to be above a Councell? and that (as the Dixit Petro Christus [Cum fra∣ter in te peccave∣rit, si e non andia, Dic Ecclesiae.] Ergo Ecclesiam Papae Iudicem constituit. Conc. Basil. apud Aenaeam Sylvium de gest. eiusdem Conc. Councell of Basil doth prooue) from the authority of Christ his direction unto Peter, to whom he said, Tell the Church. We returne to the State of the Question. The full State of the Question. All Protestants whether you call them Calvinists, or Lutherans, hold, that in the publike and set celebration of the Eucharist, the Communion in both kinds ought to be given to all sorts of Communi∣cants, that are capable of both. The question, thus stated, will cut off a number of Impertinences, which your Obiectors busie them∣selves withall, as will appeare in due places. Wee repeate it a∣gaine [In publike Assemblies of all prepared, and capable of the Communion.] The best Method, that I could choose, for the expedite and per∣spicuous handling of this great Controversie, is by way of Com∣parison: as, namely, First, by comparing the Institution of Christ, with the contrarie Ordination and Institution of the Romane Church. Secondly, Christ his Example, with contrarie Examples. Thirdly, the Apostles Practice, with the adverse Practice. Fourthly, the Primitive Custome of the Church Catholike, with the after-con∣trarie Custome; and the Latitude thereof, together with latitude of the other. Fiftly, the Reasons thereof with Reasons. Sixtly, the divers manners of beginning of the one, as also the Dispositions of men therein, with the repugnant manner and Dispositions of men, in continuing the other. The discussing of all which points will present unto your view divers kinds of Oppositions. In the first is the Conflict of Reli∣gion with Sacriledge. In the second, a soveraigne Presidence in Christ, with Contempt. In the third, of Faithfulnesse with Faith∣lesnesse. In the fourth, of Antiquity with Noveltie. In the fift, of Vniversality with Pacity. In the sixt, of Wisdome, with Folly: as also of Charity with Iniustice and Impiety. In the seventh of Knowledge with Ignorance; as likewise of Devotion with Pro∣fanenesse: And all these marching and warring together, without any possibility of Reconciliation at all.
The first Comparison is of the Institution of Christ with the Con∣trarie: proving the Precept of Christ, for the vse of both kinds to all lawfull Com∣municants. SECT. II. THere is one word twice used in the tenour of Christ his Institu∣tion; once concerning the Bread, [Hoc FACITE] DOE THIS:] the second time touching the Cup, 1. Cor. 11. 25.  [Hoc FACI∣TE QVOTIESCVNQVE:] DOE THIS AS OFTEN &c.] Both which whosoever should denie to have the Sound and Sence of a Precept, might be confuted by your owne Iesuites, Do∣ctors, Bishops, and Cardinals, among See all this above Chap. 2. Sect. 1. in the Margent. whom wee find your Barradas interpreting it, Praecipit: your Valentian, Praeceptum: your Iansenius, Mandat: your Alan, Praeceptio: your Bellarmine, Iubet; each one signifying a Command. But of what? this is our next Inquisition. The Acts of Christ were some belonging to Consecration, and some to Distribution, Manducation, and Drinking. Such as con∣cerned Consecration of both kinds, being with common consent acknowledged to be under that Command of [Hoc facite,] are the Taking Bread, and Blessing it, &c. The other touching Administra∣tion of the Cup, whereof it is said, [Hee tooke it, and gave it to his Disciples] whom after he had Commanded, saying [Drinke you all of this:] he added the other Command set downe by Saint Paul, saying unto them, [Doe this as often as yee shall doe it in remem∣brance of Mee.] That by this Obligation he might charge them to communicate in both kinds. A Precept then it must needs be, But we are not ignorant of your Evasions. Your first Evasion. Although (say Bellar. l. 1. de Eu∣charist. c. 25 §. Tertiū. you) it be said to his Disciples [Drinke you all, and, Doe this] yet it is spoken to them as they were Priests. And onely to the Apostles; saith Master M. Brereley Li∣turg. Tract. 4. § 7. after the let. (y) and after (g.) Brereley: And againe, The Apostles did represent the Priests. CHALLENGE. VVE answere that your owne Quorundam o∣pinio, est Apostolos factos sacerdotes per illa vèrba [Hoc faci∣te.] Sed de his verbis non constat facta consecratione immediate ea dixisse, antequàm Eucharistiam sub utra∣que specie dedit, vel pòst—Quodsi verba ista Christus post datam Eucharistiam illam dixit, manifestum est, illum non Sacerdotibus hinc dedisse: quod mihi ex literae decursu magis probatur. Alfon. de Castro con. Haeres. Tit. Eucharist. pag. 158. Castro will not allow your Antecedent, but is perswaded rather (by the manifest
Current of the Text) that The Apostles were not Priests when the Cup was given unto them. And although they were then Priests, yet we answere, that your Consequence (viz.) Ergò only Priests are enioy∣ned to receive the Cup, will appeare to be both fond in it selfe, and to your owne selves pernicious. First, as fond, as if one should argue thus: It was at the first said only to the Apostles, Goe and baptize all Nations: Ergò none but the Apostles have Command to Baptize. Next pernicious, for say (Wee pray you) doe the words, [Drinke yee all of this] command all Priests to drinke? then must this condemne the contrary See above in this Chapter at the let. (b.) Practice of your (now Church of Rome, which alloweth the Cup to no Priest present, but only to him that doth Consecrate: which is directly confuted by the Example of Christ, who administred the Cup unto all his Apostles, by your doctrine, Priests. Againe, Doe these words only command the Priest to receive the Cup? then likewise doe you condemne your former Church of Rome, which hath sometime permitted the Cup unto Laicks. Yea, and your Cardinall Alan [Hoc facite.] Quod cùm pertinc∣at maximè ad pote∣statem sacerdotalem circa consecrandum & sacrificandum, ta∣men Apostol{us} 1.

Alan. l. 2 de Eucha. cap. 37. p. 646. doth not sticke to tell you, out of the ancient Fathers, that the Command [Doe this] declared by Saint Luke, is applyed by Saint Paul to the receiving in both kinds, aswell of People as of Priest. And by virtue of the same Command of Christ, The Greeke Church hath alwayes observed the use of both kinds unto this day. So hee, justifying our contrary Consequence; euen as also your Laici adulti tenentur ex institutione Christi communicare, iure divino: hoc Thomas probat ex Luc. 22.

(say you) said, [And in like manner Christ tooke the Cup] namely, as he tooke Bread: yet the word [Si∣militèr, Likewise] hath Relation to his Taking, not to his Giving. CHALLENGE. THis is flatly repugnant to the Gospell of Christ, where these words of Saint Luke 22. 20. Luke, [Likewise he tooke the Cup] appeare by Saint Matth. 26. 27. Matthew to have relation aswell to Christ's Giuing, as to his Taking of the Cup, thus; [Iesus tooke the Cup and gave thankes, and gave it vnto them, saying, Drinke you all of this] Yea and in Saint
Luke the text obiected is so cleare, that it needeth no Comment: He tooke the Bread, and gave thankes, and gave it unto them, saying, &c. and likewise the Cup. Where the precedent word, expressing Christ his Act, is not Tooke, but Gave the Cup. And if any should seeke a Comment upon these words, hee could find none more di∣rect than that of your learned Arias Montanus, and B. Iansenius, [In like manner.] That (saith Similiter & Ca∣licem.] Id est, Qualia fecit circa panem, ta∣lia circa Calicem, Accepit, gratias egit, dividendum dedit, atque praecepit ut bi∣berent ab co omnes: Quae omnia Lucas complexus est, dicens, [Similitèr & Calicem.] Iansen.

Iesuite Vasquez, for the new, Concluding, that the words, [This doe yee, as often as you drinke it, in remembrance of Mee,] as they command the end of the Celebration of this Sacrament, in the remembrance of the Passion of Christ: so doe they also command the Act and manner thereof, which is, by drinking of the Sacramentall Cup. Which hee holdeth to be so manifest a Truth, that hee thinketh no man to be so blinde, as not to discerne it, saying, Who seeth not this? Accor∣dingly he alleageth Soto for the old Schoole, concluding that the words [Drinke yee all of this, as often, &c.] Doe simply command the
act of Drinking: or else (saith he) the Church hath no ground, for the Priest that consecrateth, to celebrate in both kinds. And this Obliga∣tion Cardinall Credimus eos rectè obligari, dùm militamus in hac vi∣ta, ad Sacramentum Eucharistiae, eo mo∣do, quo perfectiùs significat Passionem: id est, sub utraque specie, &c. Card. Cu∣san. Epist. 2. ad Bohem. pag. 831. Cusanus affirmeth to lie alwayes upon the Church; Whereby your Master [Who in his Booke of the Liturgie of the Masse, stadeth so much upon the no-Command of Christ for the use of both kinds, that he iu∣stifieth an ancient Ro∣mane Custome (as he calleth it) of the Priest himselfe re∣ceiving on Good Fri∣day only under one kind.] Tract.  Sect. 4. pag. 407. And Tract. 4. Sect. 7. pag. 421. [As often:] not signify∣ing the necessitie of Drinking. Brereley may see, and acknow∣ledge his double Errour. And, indeed, the Evidence is so great, that although all Romish Vniversities should withstand it, we might herein appeale to com∣mon Sence: for Christ having first commanded his Disciples, saying, in the Celebration of this Sacrament, [Drinke yee all of this;] this is the Act: and adding further, saying, [As often, or whensoever as yee shall drinke it, doe this in remembrance of mee,] Which is the End so commanded; it doth equally imply command of the Act of Drinking, aswell as of the End. Now the Catholike Church did alwayes hold, that there ought to be an Often Com∣memoration of the Passion of Christ even untill his comming againe (as saith the Apostle) by the Celebration of this Sacrament. And the word [] As often, and when-soever yee receive, &c. (being indefinite, and assigning no certaine dayes or times) giveth liber∣tie to the Church to solemnize this Memoriall at her convenient times; yet so, that Whensoever the Church celebrateth this Sacra∣ment, shee doe it according to the forme of Christ his Institution, by Communicating in both kinds. If the Pope, sitting in the Assembly of his Cardinals, delivering unto each of them a Ring, to put upon their thumbes, should say, Doe this as often as you come before mee, in testimonie of my love: We demand, Are they not, as often as they come into the presence of that Pope, chargeable to put on each one his Ring upon his thumbe, by vertue of the Popes Command, [Doe this?] who seeth not this, that doth not wilfully blind-fold and stupifie his wits? Shall we conclude? As your owne Doctors inferre from these words of Christ [Doe this] that Laicks, who be of yeares, are bound by the Law of God to communicate: By the same Text may wee conclude, that they are likewise obliged to participate of the Cup. THE CHALLENGE, In Generall. DOe this] are (as you haue heard) words Commandatorie, and being spoken of both kinds, aswell for Consecration, as for Distribution, doe oblige the Church of Christ to performe both kinds: so that it must needs follow, that the neglect of the Act is a Transgression of the Precept of Christ. And so much the rather ought you to be perswaded hereof, because your choicest and most subtile Objecters, when, seeking to defend your Alteration, it be∣came them to reason discreetly concerning this Sacrament (which the Fathers call [,] the Cup of Sobrietie) yet
doe argue so intemperately, as though they had beene over-taken with some other Cup: insomuch that they are confuted by their owne learned fellowes, by evident texts of the Evangelists, and by common sence; which giveth us just cause to turne their Won∣derment against themselves, saying, Behold the providence of God! thus plainly to confound the wisdome of the Adversaries of his truth by themselves, in their greatest subtilenesse. Hitherto of the Comparison of the Ordinance of Christ with the Ordinance of the Romish Church. Our second Comparison is of the Example of Christ, with the contrarie Example. SECT. III. VVEre it that we had no Precept of Christ to [Doe this] but only the Example of his Doing it in the first Institution, this should be a Rule for us to observe it punctually, excepting in such Circumstances, which only occasionally and accidentally hap∣ned therein, as See above Sect. 2 hath beene proved; and therefore not to dare to give a Non-obstante, against the Example of Christ, as your See aboue in this Chapter Sect. 1. lit. (a.) Councell of Constance hath done: and which Rectè docent Iu∣riscōsulti, non exem∣plis sed legibus iudi∣candum.—Quae ab exemplis ducuntur argumēta per locum sunt à simili (quae non tàm ad aliquid fir∣mandum, quàm ad id quod firmatur illu∣strandum à Dialecti∣cis esse traduntur.) Salmeron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 34. your Iesuite also teacheth, as if the Example of Christ were no argument of proofe at all. Which Doctrine wee are now to trie by the judgement of Anti∣quity. Cyprian. con. A∣quarios Epist. 63. Ad∣monitos nos scias, ut in Calice offerendo traditio observetur, neque aliquid fiat à nobis, quàm quod pro Nobis Dominus prior fecerit. [And some-what after;] A divino Magisterio non recedamus. Cyprian confuteth the Aquarij (Heretikes that used only Water in the Chalice) by the Example of Christ his Institution, because Nothing is to be done of us, in celebrating of this Mystery, which was not done of Christ. So he. In the dayes of Pope Iulius, Anno 337. there arose many giddie spirits, which violated the holy Institution of Christ in this Sacra∣ment, when as some consecrated Milke instead of Wine: others sopped the bread in the Cup: a third sort squiezed Grapes thereinto. These, and the like, that holy Pope did condemne, but how? by pretence of Custome only? no, but by the obligation of Christ his Example, and institution of this Sacrament, in these words follow∣ing: Julius P. apud Gratian. de Consecrat. Ca. Cum omne. Audivimus quosdam, Schismaticâ ambitione detentos, contra divinos ordines & Apostolicas institutio∣nes, lac provino, in divinis officijs dedicare: alios intinctam Eucharistiam populo pro complemento commu∣nionis porrigere: quosdam etiam expressum vinum in Sacramento Dominici Calicis afferre: Alijs verò pan∣num lineum, musto intinctum, per totum annum reservare, & in tempore Sacrificij partem eius aquâlavare, & sic offerre. Quod cùm sit Evangelicae & Apostolicae doctrinae contrarium, & consuetudini Ecclesiasticae adver∣sum, non difficilè ab ipso fonte veritatis probatur, à quo ordinata ipsa Sacramentorum mysteria processerunt. Cùm onim Magister veritatis verum salutis nostrae Sacrificium suis commendaret Discipulis, nulli lac, sed pa∣nem tantùm & Calicem sub hoc Sacramento noscimus dedisse. Legitur enim in Evangelica veritate, [Accepit Iesus Panem & Calicem, & benedicens dixit Discipulis suis.] Cesset igitur Lac in sacrificando offerri, quià ma∣nifestum & evidens veritatis exemplum illuxit, quià praeter Panem & Vinum aliud offerri non licet. Illud verò quod pro complemento Communionis, intinctam Eucharistiam tradunt populis, nec hoc prolatum ex Evange∣lio testimonium receperunt, ubi corpus suum Apostolis commendaret & sanguinem: scorsim enim panis, & se∣orsim Calicis commendatio memoratur. Because these are contrary (saith he) to Evangelicall and Apo∣stolicall
doctrine, and Ecclesiasticall Custome, as is easily proved from the fountaine of truth, from whence the Sacraments had their first ordinance; for when our Master of Truth commended this to his Dis∣ciples, he gave to none Milke, but Bread only, and the Cup. Nor doth the Gospell mention the sopping of bread, but of giving Bread a-part, and the Cup also a-part, &c. So Pope Iulius. Those also that of∣fered Bread and Cheese together, in this Sacrament, are confuted by the Institution of Christ, who appointed Bread, saith Artotyritae panē & caseum offerunt: qui excluduntur per hoc, quòd Christus hoc Sacramentum in∣stituit in pane. Aqui∣nas part. 3. quaest. 24. Art. 1. your A∣quinas. What can be more direct and absolute? yet dare your men obiect to the contrarie. The Romish Obiection answered. At Emmaus, Luke 24. Christ, meeting with certaine Disciples, ta∣king bread and blessing it, and thereby manifesting himselfe to them, is said immediately after the Breaking of Bread to have va∣nished out of their sights. Ergò, it may be lawfull (saith your Ex Luc. 24. 30. V∣bi Christus apparens duobus Discipulis in Emmaus, & accum∣bens accepit panem, & benedixit, & dedit eis: quo facto, aperti sunt oculi eorum, & evanuit ex oculis, &c. [Hence doth Bellarmine conclude thus:] Ostendi. hoc exemplum, quòd minimè existimandum fit, fuiffe imperatum omnibus illius usum in utraque specie. Bellar. l. 4. de Euch. c. 24. §. Rursus, So also Roffensis, and others. Car∣dinall) to use but one kind. Because (saith Master Brereley Liturg. Tract. 4. §. 3. pag 402. Master Brereley) the Text sheweth, that Christ vanished away, not leaving any time for Be∣nediction, or Consecration of the Cup. CHALLENGE. THis Argument is still inculcated, almost, by every Romanist, in defence of the Romish Custome of but in one kind, not∣withstanding it be twice rotten. First, in the Root and Antecedent: For although Christ here had begun the Celebration of the Eucha∣rist, yet doth it not appeare that he did now perfect it, in distri∣buting either kinde to his Disciples, Nor is this likely, saith your Christum hanc Eucharistiam porre∣xisse, sententia est incerra, & non veri∣similis. Iansen. Con∣cord. cap. 126. pa. 070. Iansenius. And it is dead-rotten also in the branch and Conse∣quence thereof, because that this Act of Christ in Emmaus is not to be urged as an Example, to be imitated in the Church; which is demonstrable by an Acknowledgement of your Iesuite Respondendum est, eam actionem es∣se illis ipsis impera∣tam per illa verba [Hoc facite.] Hoc ip∣so enim quod jussi sunt consecrare sub specie panis, conse∣quenter intelligi de∣bet eos jussos esse consecrare sub specie vini. Nam hoc exigit necessariò natura Sacrificij & Sacramenti: si e∣nim una species absque altera conficiatur, sacrilegium committitur. Quamobrem in Conc. Trident. absolute dicitur, Sacerdotes jussos esse offerre utramque speciem illis verbis [Hoc facire in commemorationem meam.] Quae forma verborum solùm usurpata fuit à Christo circa panem. Valent. Ies. de usu Eucharist. c. 3 §. Responden∣dum. Valentia. As for example. The Councell of Trent hath defined that the Priest, in Consecrating, is commanded by Christ his Institution to conse∣crate in both kinds; Because this (saith your Iesuite) both the nature of the Sacrifice and Sacrament doth exact: but by what words of Command? namely (for so hee saith) by these words, [Doe this.] Accordingly your Objectour Liturg. Tract. 4. §. 2. pag. 401. Master Brereley (as if he had meant
purposely to confute, and confound himselfe) The reason why the Priest receiveth both kinds, is because hee is to represent the Sacrifice of Christ upon the Crosse. But Bread cannot represent Christ dead, without some signe of Bloud. If then, because Christ ministred it not in both kindes in Em∣maus, it shall be lawfull for the Church to imitate him in that manner of Distribution of this Sacrament, it must as equally follow, that because hee is not found there to have Consecra∣ted in both kinds, it may be lawfull for your Church so to doe; not only contrary to your now Romane Custome, but also (in the judgement of the Councell of Trent) contrary to the Com∣mand of Christ, as See above. hath beene confessed. Twice miserable there∣fore is the darknesse of your Disputers, First, not to see the Incon∣sequence of this Obiection: and next not to remember that com∣mon Principle, to wit, Extraordinary Acts are not to be Rules for or∣dinary Duties. A SECOND CHALLENGE. VVEe conclude. You have seene by the testimonies of Cy∣prian, and Pope Iulius, that it was good Divinity, in their dayes, to argue from the Example of Christ his Institution nega∣tively; by rejecting such Acts, and accounting them as contra∣rie to the Institution of Christ, which accord not with his Ex∣ample, and which are not comprized within the Canon of Christ his [Hoc facite.] which kinde of Reasoning, at this day, is issed at in your Romish Schooles. What need many words? O tempora! Our third Comparison is, by conferring Apostolicall Practice with contrary Practice. SECT. IV. SAint Paul having more speciall occasion to handle this point, than any other of the Apostles, may worthily be admitted to resolve us in the name of all the Rest. Hee Catechizing the Co∣rinthians, concerning the true use of the Eucharist, recordeth the first Institution thus: 1. Cor. 11. 23. I have received of the Lord that which I deliver unto you, that the Lord Iesus, &c. And, after his Re∣citall of the Institution of Christ, hee himselfe addeth [Ib. Verse 26. As often as you eate of this Bread, and drinke of this Cup, you shew the Lords death untill he come againe. Ib. Verse 28. Let therefore a man examine himselfe, and so eate of this Bread, and drinke of this Cup.] From this wee seeke a Proofe both of the Apostolicall Practice, in the use of both kindes in this Sacrament; and of our duety in observing the same. But wee may spare our paines of prooving
the use of both kindes in the Church of Corinth, because (as your Antiqua Con∣suetudo temporibus Apostolorum fuit in Ecclesia, sub utra{que} specio communican∣di. In hac assertione nulla est Controver∣sia. Tolet. Ies. in Ioh. 6. pag. 602. So Ecchi∣us Hom. 36. Nullum inficiari posse, Pau∣lum hoc praecepisse Corinthijs. Cardinall Tolet confesseth) There is no controversie thereof. As for the proofe of our necessary Conformity, wee have the same Reasons, wherewith the Apostle perswadeth thereunto, [That (saith he) which I have received of the Lord, I deliver vnto you, that Iesus, &c.] Thereby applying the Example of Christ his Institution for a Rule of their Practice: which this coniunctive Par∣ticle of Eating [AND] Drinking; To Eate [AND] Drinke, five times so coupled in this Epistle, doe plainly declare. But you tell vs, that in this place the Coniunctive [AND] is is put for a disiunctive Or, thereby to teach the Church a liberty to choose whether they shall Eate or Drinke: notwithstanding, you your selves have confessed that Christ spake absolutely, and with∣out Condition, of the Bread, Take, Eate, Doe this. And againe, 1. Cor. 11. 24. [, And in like maner the cup.] It is an AND Coniunctive, questionlesse. But seeing it cannot be denyed, that the Apostles practice was both Eating and Drinking coniunctive∣ly, it is not likely or credible that the sence of his words should be discretiue; because this had bene, in wordes, to have contradicted his owne practice. M. Breerly opposeth, viz. The Apostle in the same Chapter saith v. 26. He that eateth and drinketh vnworthily eateth and drinketh Iudgement; also hee saith v. 27. whosoever ea∣teth this Bread, and drinketh this Cup vnworthily, &c. So hee. It is not to be denyed but that [AND] is often vsed in Scripture for Or: but M. Brearly his notions, as commonly, so here also are too confused, by not distinguishing the divers use of [AND] in Precepts, and Exhortations to an Act, in denunciation of iudge∣ment, in case of Transgression. As for example, The Precept is, Honour thy father and thy mother, (Exod. 20.) here [AND] must needs be copulative, because of the Obligation of precept of ho∣nouring both. But the denunciation against the Transgressour, if it stood (as M. Breerly obiecteth, feigning a false Text contrary both to the Originall, and vulgar Latine Translation) thus, Hee that shall strike his father, and mother shall die: the particle [AND] must needs be taken disiunctively for Or, (as indeed it is expressed in the Text) because the Transgression of either parts of a Com∣mandement inferreth an obligation of guilt and iudgement, as a∣ny man of sense may perceive. Against this, albeit so euident a Truth, your Doctors will have something to obect, or else it will goe hard; even forsooth the contrary practice of the Apostles, Act. 2. 42. where wee read of the faithfull assembled and Continuing together in fellowship, and in breaking of bread, and in prayers; because there is but mention on∣ly of one kinde, which is Bread: whence they inferre a no-neces∣sity of vsing the Cup. So your Act. 2. Ita descri∣bitur communicatio Eucharistiae [Erant enim perseverantes in doctrina Aposto∣lorum, & communi∣catione fractionis panis, & Orationi∣bus.] Quò in loco negari non potest quin agatur de Eu∣charistia. Apostoli igitur in utra{que} spe∣cie consecrabant: sed populis in una specie ministrabant. Bellar. l. 4. de Euch. c. 24. p. 64. Cardinall Bellarmine. And to answere that the ministration of the Cup is vnderstood by a figure Synecdoche, is an answere onely imaginary and groundles, saith Liturg. Tract. 4. §. 3. pag. 403. Mr.
Breerely. But are they yet to learne that which every man know∣eth, and your owne Iesuites have taught? that there is no Trope more familiar in Scripture than this Syechdoche of taking a part for the whole? Or could they not discerne thus much in the same Chap. . 46. where it is said, They brake bread through every house; Wherein (as your Iesuite Existimo de Eu∣charistia non esse Sermonem, quoni∣am de illo superius paulò Sermo habitus est. Lorin. Ies. in eund. loc. And Caietan. Card. Fiebat distributio panis—Ita quod ac∣cipiebant cibus erat. Comment in eund. loc. Lorinus teacheth) there is not meant the Eucharist, but common foode? Whereby you cannot but vnderstad implied in their breaking of bread their mutuall drinking together also. And yet in the like words spoken of the Eucharist, v. 42. [They continued together in breaking of Bread] you exclude the par∣ticipation of the Cup. What shall wee say? was your spirituall appetite weaker than your corporall, in reading these two Texts, wherein is mentioned onely Bread, that you could discerne but halfe refection in the Eucharist, and an whole in their bodily re∣past? Besides, any man may guesse what spirit it savoureth of, that (in paralleling the authoritie of your Church with the authori∣tie of the Apostles) your Iesuites doe resolue, that although the Apostles had constituted the custome of Receiving in both kinds, Si daremus hunc ritum ab Apostolo fuisse traditum, cùm tamen merè positi∣vus sit, potuisset illum mutare, quià Ecclesia habet eundem spiri∣tum, & eandem au∣thoritatem cum Pau∣lo. Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 34. p. 277. Eo∣dm modo Ʋasquez Ies. in 3. Thom. Disp. 215, 216. Nihilo mi∣nus Ecclesia & sum∣mus Pontifex pote∣rit illud iust is de cau∣sis abrogare; licet concederemus prae∣ceptum hoc fuisse A∣postolicum. Nevertheles (say they) the Church of Rome, and Pope thereof, ha∣uing the same authority with S. Paul, may abrogate it upon iust Cause. And yet hardly can you alleage any Cause, for abrogation of that Practice, which S. Paul might not have assumed in his time. CHALLENGE. OFrustrà susceptos Labores nostros! may we say; for to what end is it for vs to prove an Apostolicall Practice, or Precept for both kinds, when your Obiectors are ready with the onely names of Pope and Church of Rome to stoppe the mouthes not onely of vs Heretikes (as you call vs) but even of S. Paul himselfe, and of the other Apostles, yea and of S. Peter too? By which Answere not∣withstanding you may perceive how little S. Paul doth favour your cause, by whose Doctrine the Advocates for your Church are dri∣ven to these straits: but more principally if you call to remem∣brance, that our Argument is taken from the Apostles Doctrine and Practice, as it was grounded by St. Paul himselfe vpon the Doctrine and Precept of Christ. Thus, when we appeale vnto the Apostles Tradition, you, by opposing, Thinke your selves wiser than the Apostles: which Irenaeus will tell you was the very garbe of old Cùm ad eam Traditionem, quae ab Apostolis, provoca∣mus eos, dicent se Apostolis existentes superiores sinceram invenisse veritatem.

The Romish Obiections, concerning Primitive Custome. Divers Obiections are vrged on your side, to abate something of the Vniuersalitie of the Custome of Both kindes, which we defend; but if they shall not seeke to decline the Question, and to rove a∣bout, as it were, at vnset markes, their Arguments are but as so many Bolts shot altogether in vaine. For our defence is onely this, that in the publike solemnization and Celebration of this Sacrament, in an Assembly of Christians freely met to communi∣cate, no one example can be shewen in all Antiquity, throughout the Catholique Church of Christ, for the space of a thousand
yeares, inhibiting either Priest, or Laick, from Communicating in both kindes, who was duly prepared to receive the Sacrament. As for the examples which you vsually obiect, they are of no force at all, being Ob: Consuetu∣dinem Eucharisti∣am domum deferen∣di, &c. Sol. [By rea∣son of Persecution, and the paucitie of Mini∣sters: but afterwards abolished by the Church as was the ministrati∣on thereof to Infants.] Ob: [Communio o∣lim Laicis data in poenam gravis deli∣cti.

Hitherto of the Primitive Custome. Notwithstanding all this, will your Romane Church boast of her contrary Custome of after-times; telling vs in her Councels that her Custome of ad∣ministring the Eucharist but in one kinde is rightly observed, as a Custome which hath beene Diutissimè observata, that is, of most long continuance: Many yeares by passed, saith In Conc. Constant. de usu unius speciei. Cum huiusmodi consuetudo ab Ecclesia & sanctis patribus rationabiliter introducta, & hactenús diutissime observata sit, haben∣da est pro lege. Eodem modo Conc.

Salmeron: It is certaine (saith he) that the Church, for these three or two hundred yeares, hath used to communicate to the Laity vnder one kinde. So they. CHALLENGE. NOw after that wee have proved, out of your owne Confessi∣ons, the length of the Custome of both kinds to have beene in the Continuance above a thousand yeares, after the first In∣stitution of this Sacrament, and for largenes thereof, in an uni∣versall consent thereunto, without any exception by any exam∣ple ordinary, publique, and legitimate; and that you have heard also even the Fathers of your Church opposing against it a contra∣ry custome not above the Compasse of three hundred yeeres, and yet to call it [Diutissima] A Custome of long continuance; What Tergi∣versation could be more shameles? But enough of this point. In the next place, because the same your Councell hath told us, that your Contrary Custome was brought in [Rationabili∣tèr,] with good Reason, wee are forth-with to discusse the Rea∣sons thereof.
Our sixt Comparison is of Reasons, for the Vse of both kindes, collated with Reasons obiected to the contrary. SECT. VI. A Sacrament (according to the common definition) is a Visi∣ble signe of an invisible Grace; and so farre is a Signe true and perfect, as it doth fully represent the things that are ordained to be signified thereby: Signification being the very proper nature and end of a signe, as well in sacred, as in prophane Rites. Come now and let vs industriously and calmly debate this matter, which wee have in hand, both in respect of the thing signified (which is the Sacrament, or spirituall Obiect) as of the party Communicating, who is the Subiect thereof. Our first Reason is taken from the due Perfection of this Sacra∣ment, which must necessarily be in both kindes. The things Spirituall (as all Christians professe) are the Body and Blood of Christ, which are signified in the Sacrament of Bread and wine; These two then are not two Sacraments, but one Sacrament, (as you know) which therfore ought to be performed in both, or els the Act will be a Sacrilegious dismembring of the Sacrament of Christ. This shall we easily prove from the Principles and Confes∣sions of your owne Schooles. Your Church professeth to celebrate the Eucharist, both as it is a Sacrifice, and as it is a Sacrament. As you hold it to be a Sacrifice, you generaly teach that both kinds are neces∣sarily to be received of the Priest, because they both belong to the Essence thereof. So your Sed nos nullam scimus Sacramenti multilationem, ne{que} partem dimidiam Laicis esse substra∣ctam, siquidem duae species requiruntur necessariò ad Sacri∣ficium, sed ad essenti∣am Sacramenti quae. libet ex duobus suf∣ficit.—Proinde Sa∣cramentum sub spe∣cie panis est verum & integrum Sa∣cramentum, quandò sumitur per modum unius refectionis.

Aquinas, your Iesuites Valentia, and Vasques, and they will say as much in behalfe of the Eucharist, as it is a Sacrament; their reason is, Because both kindes, making but one Sacrament, ought to be celebrated perfectly, and therefore is the Priest bound to consecrate this Sacrament in both kindes by that command of Christ, saying, [Do this:] nor can this be omitted without Sacrilege. So they. If such be the necessity of consecrating in both kindes vnder the hand of the Priest, then lieth the same obligation vpon the Church likewise, for distributing it in both kindes vnto the people, to whom it is to be administred, in token of Christ his Passion for them applicatorily, both in his Body and Blood: but the Bread only can no
more represent the Blood of Christ in the mouthes of people, in the eating thereof, then it can by Consecrating it in the hands of the Priest: and consequently the dismembring thereof, as you do, must necessarily condemne both Priest and People. A Consequence, which your figment of See heereafter, Sect. 8. Concomitancie cannot possibly auoid. A Corroboration of the same Reason, against the Sacrilegious dis∣membring of this Sacrament, by the Testimony of Pope Gelasius; and a Vindication of Dr. Morton, from the Traduce∣ment of other your Priests and Iesuites. SECT. VII. THe Haereticall Manichees forbare the vse of the Cup in this Sa∣crament, in an opinion, that wine was not created by God, but by some evill spirit; whom Pope Gelasius did therfore condemne by his publique Decree: which hereticall opinion (as once I Appeal. lib. 2. Chap. 1. pag. 140. said) can∣not iustly be imputed unto the Church of Rome, in her manner of abstaining from the Cup in the Eucharist. This saying In his Answere to his Maiestie. M. Fisher the Iesuite, of late, thought good to pervert to his owne use, thus. The Crime wherewith some Protestants charge us, that our receiving under the sole forme of Bread is to iump in the opinion of the Manichees, we may (as D. Morton confesseth) reiect as iniurious, saying with him, that it was not the Manichees abstinence from wine, but the reason of their forbearance that was iudged hereticall. So hee. But this mans march is but slow. M. Breerly, a Romish Priest, one well esteemed among you, for his (p) In his Booke of the Liturgie of the Masse, Tract. 4. §. 4. pag. 407. exceeding labour and pains in defending the Romish Cause, to his power; by his many Books, almost in every particular, commeth on more roundly, as followeth: D. Morton himselfe (saith he) shall plead in our behalfe, who saith that the Manichees did heretically celebrate the Eucharist only in one kind, in an opinion that wine was not created by God, but by some evill spirit, and were therfore anciently condemned for Heretiques: but the Romanists are not to be accused of this Heresie of the Manichees, in their not distributing of both elements of bread & wine. And to obiect this against that Church were an accusation iniurious, for it was not the Manichees abstinence from wine, but their reason thereof which made them hereticall, said he. So your Priest; yet what of all this? So clearly doth D. Morton (saith he) cleere vs from the foule and false imputation urged against us by D. Whitaker, who noted the Ad∣ministration but in one kind, now used by the Romish Church, to have had it's originall from the Manichees: and so clearly doth he contradict both M. Whitaker & himselfe, in one place accusing us, in another excu∣sing us, in one and the same Respect: of which foule fault of Contradicti∣on in so great a Rabbin when hee cleereth himselfe, in stead of being Bi∣shop of Litch field, he shall be unto me euer Magnus Apollo. Thus far M. Breerly. Alas! what wil become of the Doctor, being, as you see, thus fiercely assaulted by two at once, one a Iesuite, the other a Romish Priest, both conspiring together to make the Doctor ridiculous?
CHALLENGE. IT is now about twenty yeares since the said Doctor (in Confu∣tation of a Booke of Master Brereleys, intituled an Apologie) pub∣lished a Treatise, called the Protestants Appeale, wherein were discovered many hundred of Master Brereleyes Ignorances, Falsi∣ties, and Absurdities: who ever since hath had Master Parson's itch, (as hee himselfe called his owne humour) which received a Salve that might have cured him of that itch, to be medling with the same Doctor. Yet the onely Exception, which hath since come to this Doctor's eares from your side, is this now objected point, concerning the Manichees: whereupon you have heard them both so urgently, and boastingly insist, and not so onely, but they have also divulged this pretended Contradiction in many Counties of this Kingdome, to his reproach. Will you be so kinde, as but to heare an Answer, and then either wonder at, or hisse, or applaude, or him, or them, as you shall finde iust Cause. Two things there were condemnable in the Manichees, one was their Act and Practice, in dismembring the Sacrament, by not communicating in both kindes: the other was their Opinion, which they held, for so doing; which was, as you have heard, an hereticall Conceit that Wine was the Creature of the Devill. Concer∣ning this hereticall opinion, no Protestant (said Protestants Ap∣peale, lib. 2. Chapter 4. Sect. 3. Doctor Morton) doth charge the Church of Rome: but as for the Act of not-Com∣municating in both kinds, In the same Ap∣peale, lib. 4. Chapter 22. Sect. 10. he called it Sacrilegious, and concluded the Church of Rome, in this respect, to be as guilty of dismembring the Sacrament, as were the Manichees. And both these hee hath done by the Authority of Pope Cōperim{us} quòd quidam, sumptâ tan∣ummodò corporis sacri portione, à Ca∣lice sacri cruoris ab∣stineant: qui procul∣dubiò (quoniam nes∣cio qua superstitione docētur astringi) aut Sacramenta integra percipiāt, aut ab in∣tegris arceantur, quià divisio uni{us} ejusdem∣que mysterii sinè grā∣di sacrilegio non po∣test provenire. Ge∣las. apud Gratia. de Consecrat. cap. Compe∣rimu. D. 2. Gelasius, who decreed, in con∣demning the Manichees, First against their Opinion, saying, Illines∣cio quâ superstitione docentur astringi, &c. (That is) They are intang∣led in a kind of Superstition. Then, for the Act of refusing the Cup, Because (saith he) the dividing of the same Mystery cannot be done without grievous sacrilege, therefore let these Manichees either receive the whole Sacrament, or else let them be wholly excluded from receiving. So Gelasius. Seeing then Doctor Morton, and all Protestants, cleare the Church of Rome from the imputation of the Heresie of the Manichees, in respect of their opinion, and yet condemne them of the Mani∣chean Sacrilege, in respect of the Act of dismembring the Sa∣crament; with what spectacles (thinke you) did your Priest and Iesuite reade that Answere of Doctor Morton, to collect from thence, either your Churches Iustification from a foule fault of Sa∣crilege, or else the Doctors foule Contradiction to himselfe, and that cleerely forsooth, in the same respect? who themselves are now found to have beene so subtilly witlesse, as not to discerne Heresie from Sacrilege; an opinion from a fact; or a no-imputation of
that, whereof neither Doctor Whitaker, nor any other Protestant ever accused them, from a practice condemned by a Romane Pope himselfe. Take unto you a Similitude. A man being apprehended in the company of Traytors, upon suspition of Felonie, is fully and effectually prosecuted for Felonie onely; if one should say of him, that he was not conuicted or condemned of Treason, but of Felo∣nie, were this either a Contradiction in the party speaking, or a full Iustification of the party spoken of? You are by this time (we thinke) ashamed of your Proctors, and of their scornefull insultation upon the Doctor, in the ridiculous tearmes of Rabbin, and magnus Apollo: who willingly forbeareth, upon this Advantage, to recompence them with like scurrility, be∣ing desirous to be only Great in that, which is called Magna est Veritas, & praevalet. By which Truth also is fully discovered the vanity of the An∣swere both of Master Fisher, and of your Cardinall, saying, that Gelasius condemned only the Opinion of the Manichees; which is so transparant a falshood, as any one that hath but a glympse of Reason may see through it, by the sentence it elfe, as hath beene proved. Our second Reason is in respect of the perfect Spirituall Refection, represented by this Sacrament. SECT. VIII. ANother Object, represented in this Sacrament, is the food of man's soule, in his faithfull receiving of the Bodie and Blood of Christ, which because it is a perfect spirituall Refection, Christ would have it to be expressed both in Eating and Drinking, wherein consisteth the perfection of man's bodily sustenance: and therefore are both necessarily to be used, by law of Analogie betweene the outward signe and the thing signified thereby. Two of your Nam in alterutra specie sive panis sive vini significatur suffi∣cienter refectio ani∣mae. Bellar. l. 4. de Eu∣charist. c. 22. §. Vtra∣que p. 639.

Valent. quo sup. de le∣git. usu Euch. p. 491. Ie∣suites (from whome Master Fisher hath learned his Answere) seeke to perswade their Readers, that the soules refection spirituall is sufficiently signified in either kind, whether in Bread, or Wine. But be it knowne unto you, that either all these have forgotten their Catechisme, authorized by the Fathers of the Councell of Trent, and confirmed by Pius Quartus then Pope, or else Those their Cate∣chists forgot themselves in teaching, that Optimo iure in∣stitutum est ut separatim duae consecrationes fierent: primò enim ut Passio Domini, in qua sanguis à corpore divius est, magis referatur—Deindè, maximè consentaneum suit, ut quoniam Sacramento, ad alendam animam, utendum nobis erat, tanquam cibus & potus instituetetur, ex quius perfectum corporis alimentum constare, perspicuum est. Catechis. Rom. part. 2. de uch. num 29. This Sacrament was in∣stituted so; that two severall Consecrations should be used, one of Bread, and the other of the Cup; to the end both that the Passion of Christ might be represented, wherein his Bloud was separated from
his Body, and because this Sacrament is ordained to nourish man's soule, it was therefore to be done by Eating and Drinking; in both which the perfect nourishment of man's naturall life doth consist. Aquinas, and your Iesuite Valentia with others are as expresse in this point, as they were in the former; who although they (as we also) hold that whole Christ is received in either kinde, (for Christ is not divided) yet doe they Hoc Sacramen∣tum ordiratur ad spirtualem refectio∣nem, quae conforma∣tur corporali. Ad corporalem autem refectionem Duo re∣quiruntur, scilicet ci∣bus, qui est almentū sicum, & potus, qui est alimentum humi∣dum. Et etiam ad in∣tegritatem huus Sa∣cramenti duo con∣currunt, scilicet, spiri∣cualis cibus, & spiri∣tualis potus, scundū illud, Ioh. 6.

Etsi negandum non est quin eius refectionis spiritualis vis & com∣moditas clarius utra∣que resimul, scilicet cibo & potu, atque adeo utraque specie significetur: ideo e∣nim hoc Sacramen∣tum, quod attinet quidem ad relationē individualem, per∣fectius est in utraque simu specie, quàm in altera.

Aquinas quo sup. quaest. 76. Art. 2. mayntaine that This Sacra∣ment, as it is conformable both to Eating and Drinking, so doth it by both kindes, more perfectly expresse our spirituall nourishment by Christ: and therefore it is more convenient that both be exhibited to the faithfull severally, as for Meate, and for Drinke. So they. For although, in the Spirituall Receiving, Eating and Drinking are both one, even as the appetite of the Soule in hungring and thirsting is the same; as where it is written, Matth. 5. Blessed are they that hun∣ger and thirst after righteousnesse, &c. yet in this Sacramentall com∣municating with bodily instruments it is otherwise, as you know. Sub specie panis sanguis sumatur cùm corpore, & sub specie vini sumatur corpus cum sanguine, nec sanguis sub specie panis bibitur, nec corpus sub specie vini editur: quià icut nec corpus bibitur, ità nec sanguis comeditur. Durand. Ra∣tional. lib. 4. cap. 41. pag. 326 The blood of Christ is not dranke in the forme of Bread, nor is his Bo∣die eaten as meate in the forme of Wine, because the Bodie cannot be said to be dranke, nor the bloud to be eaten. So your Durand, and so afterwards your See hereafter Sect. 10. Iansenius. Wherefore you, in with-holding the Cup from the People, doe violate the Testament of Christ, who requireth in this a perfect re∣presentation visible of a compleate and a full Refection spirituall, which is sufficient to condemne your Abuse, whereby you also defraud God's people of their Dimensum, ordained by Christ for their vse. Concerning this second, Answere to his Maiestie. Master Fisher (one of the society of Iesuites) was taught to Answere, that the Full causality (as he said) and working of spirituall Effects of the soule cannot be a wanting to the Sacrament under one kind; because of Christ his assi∣stance. So he. We should aske whether a greater Devotion and  more plentifull Grace are not to be esteemed spirituall Effects, for the good of the Soule, which are Se∣cundum Alexandum de Hales—Maior fructus ex perceptione utriusque specii habetur. Salmeron. Ies. Tom 9. Tract. 37. §. Neque benè. pag. 303. Per accidens autem non est dubium quin usus utriusque specici possit esse fructuosior, eò quod potest majorem devotionem commoverein percipiente. Vndè fiat, ut propter ma∣jorem dispositionem consequatur ille verlorem gratiam ex Sacramento. Valent. Ies. ibid. pag. 493. §. Per ac∣cidens. confessed to be enjoyed by Com∣municating in both kinds; and why not rather than by one? For consider (we pray you) that the Assistance of Christ doth espe∣cially concurre with his owne Ordinance, and therefore much ra∣ther where the forme of a Sacrament ordained, and instituted by himselfe, is observed, then where it is (as of you) so notoriously perverted, and contemned. Yet because you may thinke we rest upon either our owne, or yet of other your Doctors Iudgement in this Defence, we shall produce to this purpose, the consonant Doctrine of ancient Fathers.
Our third proofe is taken from the manifold Reasons of ancient Fathers, for Confirmation of the Necessity of the Communicating in both kinds. SECT. IX. FOr the proofe of the necessary vse of both kindes, in the so∣lemne and publique dispensation of this Sacrament, the parti∣cular Testimonies of many ancient Fathers might be produced, but your owne Authours will ease us of that labour, by relating and Satis comper∣tum est, universalem Christi Ecclsiam in hunc usque diem, Oc∣cidētalem autem seti Romanam mille am∣plius à Christo an∣nis, in solenni prae∣se tim & ordinaria huius Sacramenti di∣spensatione, utram∣que panis & vini spe∣ciem omnibus Chri∣sti membris exhibuis∣se—atque utià fa∣cerent, inductos fuis∣se primo Instituto ex∣emploque Christi, qui hoc Sacramentū corporis & sanguinis sui duobus hisce pa∣nis & vini symbolis Discipulis suis, fide∣lium Communican∣tium personam re∣praesentantibus, prae∣buit: tum quià in Sa∣cramento sanguinis peculiarem quādam virtutm & gratiam hoc vinisymbolo significatam esse credebant: tūm ob rationes mystias huius Instituti, quae à veteribus variè ad∣ducuntur, viz. ad repraesentandam memoriam Passionis Christi in oblatione corporis, & sanguinis effusione, iuxta illud Pauli, [Quotiescunque comederitis panem hunc, & Calicem Domini biberitis, morrem Domini annunciatis donec venerit.] Item ad significandm integram refectionem sive nutritionem, quae ibo & potu constat, quomodò Christus inquit, [Caro mea verus est cibus, & sanguis meus verus est pous.] Item ad designndam redemptionem & tuitionem corporis & animae, ut corpus pro salute corporis, & sanguis pro salute animae, quae in sanguine est, dari intelligatur.

That the ancient Fathers were induced to the Continuance of the Custome in both kinds, First, by the Example and Institution of Christ. Secondly, by some particular Grace, which they held to be signi∣fied by the Cup. Thirdly, for the Representation, that it had to the Passion of Christ; distinctly and respectively to his Bodie and Blood. Fourthly, to resemble the Redemption, which man hath in his Body by Christ's Body, and by his Blood in the soule. Fifly, To expresse by these Symbols the perfect spirituall Nourishments wee have by his Body and Blood. Sixtly, To understand that this Sacrament doth equally belong to People, as well as to Priests. Seventhly, that the Cup of the Eucharist doth animate soules to receive the Cup of bloody Martyrdome, when the time should be. Whereunto may be added the Constant profession of the raeci dicunt esse necessario sub utraque specie panisscilicet, & vini communicandum, adeo quidem, ut qui sub una specie tantùm communicat etiamsi laicus sit, peccare dicatur, quod (ut aiut) contra Christi prae∣ceptum agat▪ qu sub utraque specie communicare praecepit. Pratol Elench. Haeret lib. 7. tit. Graeci. Greeke Church, in obeying the Canon of Christ, and holding it necessarily to be observed of the people also, by receiving in both kindes; and that otherwise wee transgresse against the Institution of Christ. All these Testimonies of primitive Fathers, under the Confession, of your owne Doctors, are so many Arguments of the Consonant Doctrine of Antiquity, for proofe of an obligation of precept upon
the Churches of Christ whatsoever, for the preservation of the perfect forme of Christ's Ordinance in the administring of the Sa∣crament in both kindes. Vpon this Evidence may you justly call your fellow-Priest Master Brereley to account for his bold Assump∣tion, saying that Liturg. Tract 4 § 9. p. 425. at Eightly. No Doctor (speaking of ancient Fathers) can be produced either expressely, or else by necessary Consequence, affirming the necessity of the Laicks receiving under both kinds: Your selves perceiving now not only One, but many ancient Doctors to have expressed not only One, but many Necessities inferring the same. And then you may furthermore question him for his next as lavish As∣sertion, affirming in his fift Answere, that The Authorities obiected, for the necessity of both kinds, speake not of a Sacramentall, but only of a spirituall Receiving with the mouth of their hearts. When shall we find conscionable dealing at this man's hands? Having thus finished our Assumption, we shall more expedite∣ly satisfie such your Reasons, or rather Pretences, which you bring to disguize your sacrilegious Abuse. The Romish Pretences for their Innovation and Alteration of Christ his Institution, by the publique vse of but One kind. SECT. X. VVE heare the Councell of Trent pretending (as they say) Iust reasons of altering the primitive Custome and vse of both kinds, but naming none, which we may well thinke was be∣cause they deserved not the mention: surely, such they were, that your Iesuite had rather that you should belieue them, then try and examine them; It being your part (as Porrò causas, quae Ecclesiam mo∣verunt, ut consuetu∣dinem communican∣di sub altera proba∣ret, atque etiam pro lege observandā esse decerneret, non tàm nostrum est discutere aut inquirere, quàm ipsi Decreto simpli∣citèr obtemperare, existimaréque omni∣nò eas fuisse just as, ut rectissimè ex Conc. Trid. definitum est. Greg. Valent. Ies. de le∣git. usu Sacra. Euch. c. 10. §. Porrò, p. 499. hee saith) Rather to thinke them inst, than to discusse them. But wee are not bound to your Rules of blinde Obedience. God will have us to use the sight, which he hath given us, least, If the blinde leading the blinde, both fall into the Ditch. And whether the Reasons, which are given by your Doctors, be not blinde Seducements, wee are now to try. Some of your Reasons are taken from extraordinary Cases, some Instances are common to all other Churches Christian, and some are made as being peculiar to the Church of Rome. The first kind of Romish Pretences, from extraordinary Cases. The first Pretence is thus alleaged; Ob inopiam vi∣ni, cujus in plerisque Christianitatis par∣tibus magna penu∣ria. Valent. ibid. & Salmeron Jes. Tom. 9. Tract. 34. §. Ad quintum, pag. 279. And Roffens. in like manner. Bellar. also addeth another Reason to this: Movit Ecclesiam uniformitas, ut concordia populi Christiani in Sacramento hoc percipiendo, quod est Sacramentum pacis & unitatis, propter eos, apud quos vinum inveniri non potest: ut sunt aliquae provinciae boreales, ubi vinum non invenitur, qui existimarent se Christo curae non fuisse, aut non ità ut alias provincias, quandò Sacramentum instituit. Lib. 4. de Euch. cap. 28. Many Northerne Countries are destitute of Wine, and therefore one kinde is to be used for Con∣cord
and Vniformity-sake. Will you be answered from your selves? Aquinas, making the same Obiection of want of Wine, and Wheate in forreine Countries, Licet non in om∣nibus terris nascitur vinum aut triticum, tamen ad omnes ter∣ras facilè deferri po∣test, quantum sufficit ad usum huius Sacra∣menti. Aquin. part. 3. qu. 74. Art. 1. Sufficit quòd Balsamum po∣test ad omnia loca transferri. Idem ibid. qu. 72. Art. 2. Resolveth, that Notwithstanding Wheate and Wine may be transported easily to all parts. Accordingly doth he resolve of the want of Balsame, used in your Consecrati∣on, and yet it is farre more scarce then Wine or Wheate. Yet what Northerne Countrie almost can you name, that hath not abundance of Wine for many persons, even unto rot, and can they not as well have it in moderate measure, for a sacred Rite? But what talke you of Vniformity and Concord, in this Case of Alteration, (which are your two next Pretences) wherein not∣withstanding the Church of Rome is dissenting from the Greeke, and all other Christian Churches in the World? Or if this were a necessary Cause, why did not your Church allow the use of both kinds to the Church of Bohemia, but twice raised a fierce warre a∣gainst them? for which your Iesuite Bis Principes Germaniae ad Bohe∣mos (quòd Commu∣nionem sub utrque specie communica∣rent) debellandos ar∣ma sumpsere, horta∣tore Cardinale lulia∣no S. Angeli, Apo. stolicae sedis Legato doctissimo paritèr & rerum gerendarum prudentiâ ornatissi∣mo viro: quanquàm bellum non satis feli∣citer successit. Salme∣ron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 35. pag. 284. Salmeron seemeth to be full sorrie; marrie it was, because that warre had not his wished suc∣cesse. Is their Concord in Hostilitie? Againe, because you thirdly pretend Vniformity also, why then doe your consecrating Priests only receive both kinds sacramentally, and all the other Priests in Communicating participate but in one? or how is it that you allow a priuiledge to See a little after at (p.) Popes, Cardinals, Monkes, and noble Personages, to receive in both kinds, and deny this liberty to others? Is there likewise Vniformity in Disparity? Your fourth Pretence is because divers are Multi sunt Ab∣stemij, qui vinum non ferunt. Bellar. l. 4. de Euch. cap. 28. Abstemious, and have an Antipathy against Wine, and some sickly persons also can hardly receive without Irreverent casting it up againe. If the par∣ticular reason, which Dicēdum, quod vinum modicè sump∣tum non potest mul∣tum aegrotanti noce∣re. Aquin. par. 3 quest. 74. Art. 1. Aquinas giveth, saying, That Wine mode∣rately taken of such can doe no hurt, may not satisfie, yet this be∣ing also a Cause accidentall, and extraordinary, you ought to be re∣gulated by this generall Rule, That extraordinary Cases ought not to iustle out ordinary Lawes and Customes. For, that Command of Christ to his Apostles, Goe preach to every Creature of man, stood good in the generall, albeit many men happened to be deafe. Saint Peter requireth of every Christian of fit yeares that he be prepared to give an answere of his faith to everyone that asketh; which pre∣cept was not therefore alterable, because of multitudes of many that were dumbe. Finally, to close vp with you, hee that by the rule of Hospitality is to cheere up his Guests, doth not prescribe, that, because some mens stomackes are queasie, and not able to endure Wine, or else some meates; therefore all others should be kept from fasting from all meates and Drinkes: and the Eucharist (you know) is called by Saint Paul, The supper of the Lord, and by ancient Fathers, an holy See above Chap. 2. Sect. 9. in the Chall. Banquet.
The second kind of Romish Pretences is of such, which might have beene common to other Churches. The other Causes above-mentioned were common to the pri∣mitive Church of Christ, wherein the use of both kinds was (not∣withstanding) preserved and continued; except that you will say, no Northerne Nations were Christians in those times: and that no stomacks of Christians were disaffected to wine, in loathing it, &c. But two other Pretences you have, which you thinke to be of more speciall force, to forbid the use of this Sacrament in both kinds; One is Because (saith your Primò movet Ecclesiam consuetu∣do recepta & appro∣bata consensu Gen∣tium & Populorum. Bellar. quosup. Cardinall) Such is the now-received and approved custome of Nations and People. So hee. But first to ar∣gue, that your Church did therefore forbid the use of both kinds, because shee had approued the contrary Custome, is a meere Nu∣gacitie and Tautologie; and as much as to say, Shee would forbid it, because shee would forbid it. Secondly, saying, that the Vse of but One kinde had indefinitely the Consent of Nations and People, is a flat falsity, because (as hath beene confessed) The Greeke Church (not to mention Aethiopians, Aegyptians, Armenians, and Others) have alwayes held the Contrarie Custome. Lastly, to justifie your Churches Innouation, in consenting to the humour of People of later times, what can you censure it lesse than a grosse and absurd Indulgence? The other Motive, which the Movet Ecclesiā, & quidem vehemen∣tèr Irreverentia & profanationes tanti Sacramenti, quae vix evitari possent in tā∣ta fidelium multitu∣dine, si omnibus da∣retur sub utra{que} spe∣cie. Bellar. ibid. Cardinall calleth a Vehement presumption, and which all your Obiectors most earnestly urge, is the Cause of Irreverence, lest the blood might be split, especially in such a multitude of faithfull Communicants: and also least any par∣ticle of the Hoast fall to the ground, saith Master Liturg. tract. 4. §. 6. Brereley. We have but foure Answeres to this mightie Obiection. First, that this was not held a Reason to Christ, or his Apostles, or to the Church of Christ for many ages, when notwithstanding the multi∣tudes of Communicants were innumerable. Secondly, that The Casuall spilling of the Cup, saith your Vtriusque spe∣cici vsum illicitum esse at{que} sacrilegium ait.—falsum est, quòd usui Calicis an∣nexum sit peccatum vel sacrilegiu, prop∣ter periculum effusio∣nis: nam si hab eret adiūctum peccatum, neque Christus Do∣minus, neque Aposto∣li in primitiva Eccle∣sia, nee Orientales modo, nec Occidentales ante Conc.

Pipes of silver, which are used by Popes, Cardinals Monks, and some other Illustrious lay-Personages. Surely, there being no respect of per∣sons with God (as said S. Peter) we thinke that he, who will be S. Peter's Successor should have taken out with S. Peter that lesson of Christ, of loving the whole flocke of Christ, aswell Lambes as Sheepe; not to provide Pipes or Tunnels for himselfe alone & his Grandes, for receiuing this part of the Sacrament, and to neglect all other Christians, albeit never so true members of Christ. For this wee all know, that 1. Cor. 11. Ita{que} fratres mei, cum con∣venritis, invicem expectate.] Domi∣nus ex aequo Tibi & pauperimensam pro∣prij corporis, & po∣culum sanguinis ta∣didit.

Our Lord Christ prepared his table aswell for the poore as the Rich, according to the Apostles Doctrine, by your owne construction, answerable to the Doctrine of ancient Fathers. And that the pretence of Reverence cannot be a sufficient Reason of alte∣ring the ordinance of Christ, wee may learne from ancient Hi∣stories, which euidently declare that the opinion of Reverence hath often beene the Damme and Nource of manifold Super∣stitions. As for example. The Heretikes called Discalceati, in pretence (*) See §. 9. of more humilitie, thought that they ought to goe bare-foote. The (*) See above. Secto 8. (g) Encratitae, in pretence of more sanctitity, abhorred marriage. The Aquarij solam a∣quam apponendam asserebant, sobrieta∣tis conservandae cau∣sâ vinum vitantes. Alfons. à Castro cont. Haeres. Tit. Euchari∣stia, Haer. 6. Aquarij, in pretence of more sobriety, used water in this Sacra∣ment. The Manichees wanted not their pretence of not drinking wine in the Eucharist, because they thought it was created by an evill Spirit. And yet were these iudged by Pope Gelasius to be Sacrilegious. Yea and what greater defence had the Pharisees, for all their Superstitions, than that of Reverence? whom notwith∣standing Christ did pierce thorow with so many Vae's, for annul∣ling of the Precepts of God, by their Traditions, vnder the pretence of religious Reverence and sanctity. In briefe. It was the opinion of Reverence that made S. Peter to contradict our Lords command, when he said, Thou shalt never wash my feete: yet how dangerous it had beene for Peter to have persisted in opposition, the Replie of our Saviour doth declare. If I wash not thy feete (saith Christ) thou hast no part with me, &c. Vpon which Text S. Discamus Chri∣stum, prout vult, vene∣rari, honorato nam{que} iucundissius est ho∣nor, non quem nos putamus; nam & eum Petrus honorare pu∣tabar, cùm sibi pe∣des eum lavare pro∣hibuit: sed non erat honor, quem age∣bat, sed contrarium. Chrysost. Hom. 60. ad pop. Antioch. Tom. 5. Chrysost. readeth vnto you this Lecture. Let us therefore learne (saith he) to honour and reverence Christ, as he would, and not as we thinke meete. And sure wee are, that he would that same which he commanded, saying, [Doe this.] Therefore our next Difference, betweene our defence and yours, is no other than obedient Reverence, and reverent, or rather irreligious Dis∣obedience. As for your Pretence of manifesting hereby a Si sic tanta esset dignitas Laicorum circà sūptionem cor∣poris Christi, quanta Clericorum? Gerson. Tract. de utra{que} specie. Greater dignity of Priests than of Laicks; it is too phantasticall for the singularity; too harsh for the noveltie; and too gracelesse for the impietie thereof: seeing that Christ, who gave his Bodie and Blood an e∣quall price of Redemption for all sorts, would have the Sacrament of his Body and Blood equally administred to People, as Priests; as you have heard the Fathers themselves professe.
The three Romish Pretences, which are more peculiar to their owne Church, in two points. First, because Movit Ecclesi∣am, ad hunc usum stabiliendum & lege firmandum, quòd vi∣deret ab Haereticis, & ex errore oppug∣nari. Sacramentarij autem non credunt Cōcomitantiam san∣guinis Domini cùm corpore in specie pa∣nis: undè etiam ij Lutheranorum max∣imè urgent utram{que} speciem, qui cum Sa∣cramentarijs rident Concomitantiā. Bel∣lar. l. 4 de Euch. c. 28. § Secundò. Heretikes (saith Bellarmine, and meaning Pro∣testants) doe not believe Concomitancie, that is to say, that the blood of Christ is received under the forme of bread: but for this Concomitan∣cie the Church was moved to prescribe the vse of the Eucharist in one kinde. So he. And this point of Concomitancie is that which In his Booke dedi∣cated to K. Iames. M. Fisher, and In his Liturg. of the Masse pag. 396. M. Breerly most laboured for, or rather laboured vpon. And albeit your Romane Maximè omni∣um ad convellendam eorum haeresin, qui negabant sub utra{que} specie corpus Chri∣sti contineri. Catech. Rom. par 2. c. 4. nu 50. Catechisme iudgeth this the principall Cause of inducing your Church to preferre one kinde: yet wee (whom you call Heretikes) beleeve that the deuout Communi∣cant, receiving Christ spiritually by faith, is thereby possessed of whole Christ crucified, in the inward act of the Soule: and onely deny, that the whole is received Sacramentally, in this outward act, vnder one onely part of this Sacrament, which is the present question. And in this wee say no more than your Bishop Iansenius iudged reasonable, who hath rightly argued, saying, Verùm non faci∣lè apparet quomodò apertè exterior illa sumptio dici possit bibitio: manducatio rectè dicitur, quià su∣mitur aliquid ibi per modum cibi: sed quomodò bibitio, cùm nihil sumatur per modum potus? non n. diceremus e∣um & manducare & bibere, qui panem tinctum vino sume∣et, quamvis sumat quod famem tollat & sitim. Proindè, se∣cundùm horum sen∣tentiam vidertu omninò dicendum—cum dicitur manducare, & bibere, non ratione actus exterioris, qui manducationis tantum spe∣ciem habet: sed ratione actus interioris, nempe, ratione fidei. Jansen. Concord. in Evang. pag. 457. It doth not easily ap∣peare how the outward receiving of Christ, under the forme of Bread, should be called Drinking, but onely Eating, being received after the manner of meates, as that is called Drinking onely, which is received after the manner of Drinke. Drinking therefore and Eating are distin∣guished by Christ, in the outward Act. So hee, even as your owne See more expressly in the testimony of Durand above, Sect. 8. Durand before him had truely concluded, with whom M. See Booke 2. Cap. 2. §. 4. Breerly will beare a part. Therefore your Concomitancie (if wee respect the Sacramen∣tall manner of Receiving) is but a Chimaera, and as great a Sole∣cisme as to say, that the Body and Bones of Christ are dranke, and his Blood eaten: contrary to the Sacramentall representati∣on, in Receiving Bread and Wine, as hath beene prooved. Next, when wee aske you why onely your Church will not reforme and regulate her Custome, according to the Institution of Christ, and the long practice of the primitive Church? you answere plainly, and without Circumlocution, that the Reason is, Lest that your Church might seeme to have erred in her alteration of the anci∣ent Custome. And this your Secunda ratio, quià qui Concomitantiam negant, ex alio pernitioso errore petunt utram{que} speciem: quià nimi∣rum existimant iure divino esse praeceptum; & proptereà totam Ecclesiam longo tempore in hac re turpi∣ter errâsse.

Gaspar Cardillo Villalpand: Orat. apud▪ Act. Conc. Trid. pag. 219, 221, 222. Least that the Church (saith he) may seeme to have erred. What can more sauour of an Hereticall and Antichristian spirit, than this pretence doth? For an Heretike will not seeme to have erred, and Antichrist will professe himselfe one that cannot erre: which Character of not personall erring was never assu∣med of any particular Church, excepting onely the latter Church of Rome. Our Assumption. But the Church of Rome (which will seeme that she cannot possibly erre in her not administring the Cup unto Laicks) is knowne to have erred 600. yeares together in the abuse of the same Sacrament, by administring it (in an opinion of necessity) vnto Infants, as hath beene plentifully See above, Chap. 2. Sect. 11. witnessed by eminent Doctors in your owne Church. Hence therefore ariseth another difference, betweene the profession of our Custome and yours, which is, betweene Christ and Antichrist. All this while you doe not perceiue but that your opinion of Concomitancie will ruinate the foundation of your Doctrine of Transubstantiation, whereof In the third Booke. hereafter. The seaventh Comparison is betweene the manner of Institution, and manner of Alteration thereof. SECT. XI. THe beginning of the Institution in both kindes is knowne and acknowledged to haue beene authorized by him, who is the  of the new Testament, even Christ our Lord, by whom it was established and published among all his Disciples, at his last Supper: But your Custome of onely one kinde, How (we be∣seech you) came it into your Church? tell vs. Nullâ praecep∣torum vi, sed con∣sensu quodam taci∣to tàm populi quam Cleri sensim irrep∣sit dicta consueudo.

It came not in by any precept, but crept in by little and little, by the Tacite and silent con∣sent of the Bishops. So your Bishop Roffensis, and your Iesuite Coste∣rus, and Frier Castro. This confessed vnknowne maner of Altera∣tion of this your Custome, as it doth vtterly refute your common Obiection, viz. That every Doctrine and Custome must bee iudged ancient and Catholike, the beginning whereof is not knowne; so doth
it more specially put your M. Breerly to his blush, who durst make the same obiection in this very Case, in defence of the vse of but One kinde, to prove it to haue beene from the beginning, because No first knowne beginning of our Catholike practice (Liturg Tract 4 § 9. at the end thereof. saith he) can be instanced. And yet behold here no certaine beginning of this Ro∣mish Custome; yet notwithstanding confessed to be an Alteration different from the Custome, which formerly for a thousand yeares was held a Catholike Custome. Was not the Church of Rome then a wise and a worthy Mistris of Churches, trow you, to suffer her Priests to be guided by the People in a matter of this nature? what other difference can this make between our Custome and yours, but that which is between divine Ordinance & popular negligence; or as between a publique Professor, & a Theeish Creeper? Heresie is certainly a disease, but wote you what? the 2. Tim 2. 15. Apostle noteth it to be a Cancer, or Gangrene, which is a disease Creeping by little and little, from ioynt to ioynt, untill it have eaten vp the vitall parts; such a Cancer was this your Custome, if you shall stand to your owne former Confessions. Our last Comparison is betweene the Contrary dispositions of Pro∣fessors, one in continuing, and distinguishing; a second in mixing; the third in reiecting both kindes. SECT. XII. THe Comparison, betweene the divers dispositions of Pro∣fessors, none will be more willing to shew than your Iesuite Quod verò atti∣net ad tempora, tri∣plicem in coetu Chri∣stiano statum, Nic. de Cusano Card. expen∣dit; ferventis nimi∣rùm, calidae & fri∣gentis.

Salmeron, who will have you out of Cardinall Cusanus to observe three States of the Church. The first is in her Fervencie; The se∣cond in her Warmnes; The third in her Coldnes. In the first state of her Fervencie, when the Christians affected Martyrdome for the Gospell of Christ, then did the People (saith hee) communicate in both kindes. In the second state, which was in her Warmnes (though not so hot boyling as before) They then used to dip the Hoast into the Chalice, and so were made ioyntly partakers of both, in one. But in the third state of Coldnes, the people were allowed the Sacrament onely vnder one kinde. So hee. CHALLENGE. IF now Truth may be iudged by the different dispositions of Pro∣fessors, then may this former Confession witnes for us that there is as much difference betweene the Primitive and the now Romish Custome, as there is betweene lively Fervencie, and sencelesse Num∣nes and Coldnes, that is to say, Godly zeale, and Godlesse indevoti∣on and negligence: yet a negligence not only approved (which is impious) but (that which is the height of impiety) even applau∣ded also by your Priests, among whom the Vt nobis locu∣pletissimi testes, at{que} omni exeptione ma∣iores retulerunt, in Germania qui eò lo∣ci per omnia obedi∣unt Rom.

Accedit. above-said Gaspar Cardillo in the Councell of Trent, with exultation told their Father-hoods (as being a matter of great ioy) that they who are under the
Iurisdiction of the Church of Rome, in Germany, doe not so much as de∣sire the Cup of life. So hee. A GENERALL CHALLENGE, Concerning this last Transgression of Christ his Masse. SECT. XIII. IN this we are to make an open discovery of the odious Vncha∣ritablenesse, the intolerable Arrogancie, the vile Perjury, the extreame Madnesse, and Folly, together with a note of plaine Blas∣phemie of your Romish Disputers in Defence of this one Romane Custome of forbidding the Cup to faithfull Communicants. For what Vncharitablenesse can be more odious, than when they can∣not but confesse, that there is more spirituall grace in the receiving of the Communion in both kinds, doe notwithstanding boast, e∣ven in the open Councell of Trent, of some of their Professors, who in obedience to the Church of Rome, doe not only (See the next testi∣mony above. their owne words) not desire the Cup of life, but also dare not so much as desire it. Which Vaunt, we thinke, besides the Impiety thereof, inferreth a note of prophane Tyranny. Secondly, when wee compare these Fathers of Trent with the Fathers of most primitive Antiquity, they answere, Tertio loco ob∣ijciunt Ecclesiae sapi∣entiam, antiquita∣tem, atque potesta∣tem; aiunt enim, Ec∣clesiam primitivam, quae antiquior & sci∣entiâ atquè vitae san∣ctitate praestantior erat, utráque specie usam fusse: nostra i∣gitur illam imitari debet, praesertim cū eandem atque illa habet potestatem in eiusmodi legibus po∣sitivis siuè abrogan∣dis siuè dispensandis. Respondemus, non esse dubium quin Ec∣clesia primitiva no∣strae maiore charita∣te, ac proindè uberi∣ori sapientia praecel∣luerit, nihilominus, tamen interdum cō∣tingit minus sapien∣tem in aliquo meliùs sapere, quàm alm absolutè sapientio∣rem. Saepe etiam accidit, minùs p∣fectum hominem vi∣tare aliquem errorē, quem melior non vi∣tat. Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 38. §. Tertio loco, p. 320. Although the primitive Church (say they) did exceed ours in Zeale, Wisdome, and Charity, neverthelesse it falleth out sometimes, that the wiser may in some things be lesse wise then another. Which answere, if we consider the many Reasons, which you have heard the Fathers give, for the use of both kinds, and their consonant practice there∣of, what is it but a vilifying of the authority of all ancient Fa∣thers? and indeed (as the saying is) To put upon them the Foole. The like answere two of their Iesuites made to the Practice of the Apostles, saying that your Church, having the same spirit, hath the same power to alter the Custome, whereas wee have proved that the ground which the Apostles lay for their Custome was the Institution of Christ. But that which the Romane Church allea∣geth is meerely a pretence of Plenitude of her owne Authoritie; It is impossible therefore that in so great a Contradiction there should be the same Spirit. And can there be a more intollerable Arrogancie than is this, which this Romane spirit bewrayeth in both these? Thirdly, vpon the Consideration of this their Contempt of A∣postolicall and primitive Antiquity, in this Cause, wee finde that your Romish Priests are to be condemned of manifest perjurie also; For in the Forme of Oath, for the profession of the Romish Faith, every Priest and Ecclesiasticke is sworne Forma Iuramen∣ti, per Bullam Pij quarti. Apostolicas & Ecclesiasticas Tradi∣tiones admitto,—Ego spond eo, & juro, &c. To admit of all Apo∣stolicall & Ecclesiasticall Traditions; as also to hold what the Coetera omnia à Concilio Trdent. declarata & confir∣mata firmissimè e∣neo. Ibid. Romanam Ecclesiam Magistram esse Ecclefiar u∣do, &c. Coun∣cell of Trent hath decreed: But this Custome of administration of
both kindes, as hath beene acknowledged, was an Apostolicall Cu∣stome, and from them also remayned in an Ecclesiasticall profession and practice thorow-out a thousand yeares space; which your Church of Rome, notwithstanding, in her Councell of Trent, (whereunto likewise you are sworne) hath altered and perverted: which doth evidently involve your Priests, and Iesuites in a no∣torious, and unavoydable Perjury. Fourthly, As for the note of Foolishnesse, what more mad folly can there be seene in any, than to take upon them a serious De∣fence of a Custome, for satisfaction of all others, and yet to be so unsatisfied among themselves? so that both the Obiections urged by Protestants against that Abuse are fortified, and also all your Reasons for it are refuted either by the direct Testimonies of your owne Doctors, or by the Common Principles and Tenents of your Church, or else by the absurdities of your Consequences is∣suing from your Reasons and Answeres; divers of them being no lesse grosse, then was your objecting the Antiquity and Generality of the particular Romane Church, for lesse then three hundred yeares, and to preferre it before the confessed Vniversall primitive Custome of above the Compasse of a Thousand yeares continu∣ance before the other. Fiftly, the last is the note of Blasphemy; for this name the con∣tempt of Christ his last Will and Testament must needs deserve; and what greater contempt can there be, than contrary to Christ his [Doe this] (concerning both kinds) to professe that Sacrilegious dismembring of the holy Sacrament, which Gelasius the Pope himselfe had anciently condemned? or if this be not Blasphemous enough, then, supposing that Christ indeed had commanded Con∣secration in both kindes, upon divine right, yet notwithstanding to hold it very probable (as saith your Iesuite Licet Gabriel, & quidam alij senti∣ant divini juris esse, ut Sacerdos in utra∣que specie sacrificet, nihilominùs' tamen opinantur authorita∣te Rom. Pontificis fi∣eri posse, ut in una tantùm specie sacri∣ficet, viz. in consecra∣tione panis fine vi∣no, quià putant mul∣ta esse juris divini, quae remittere & re∣laxare Pótifex queat ob publicam aliquam & gravem necessita∣tem: ut videmus vo∣tum, iusiurandū, ma∣trimonium ratum, nō consummatū, autho∣ritate Pontificis re∣laxari & dissolvi. Et ità in hac quaestione prima puto proba∣bilius & verius esse (ut dixi) iuris esse di∣vini, ut Sacerdos in duplici specie sacrificet. Et nihilominùs existimo valdè probabile, authoritate Pontifi∣ciâ, ob publicam & urgentem necessitatem, praedictum jus divinum relaxari posse. Sed▪ quià nunquàm est rela∣xatum, ego confilium darem ut nunquam relaxaretur. Azorius Ies. Tom. 1. Instit, Moral. lib. 10. cap. 19. §. Tertium pag. 857. Azorius) that the authority of the Pope may dispense therewith. But because Divine right was never yet dispensed with, 1 (saith hee) would give my Counsell that it never may be. O Iesuite! thus to deale with Christ his Command. If he or any other Iesuite had made as bold with the Pope, as this doth with Christ himselfe, saying unto him; Any of your De∣crees (holy Father) may be dispensed with by any Iesuite of our Societie: yet because no Iesuite hath taken upon him hitherto so much, my counsell is that none of your Decrees be euer dispen∣sed withall. The Pope, wee suppose, albeit he would thanke this man for his counsell, for not Doing so; yet doubtlesse, would hee reward him with a welcome into the office of his holy Inquisition, for his judgement, to thinke it lawfull so to doe: namely, to leave it to the discretion of every Iesuite, to dispense with his Papall Decrees. And notwithstanding the Iesuites [Suppose] wee may
depose, that your Romish licence, for but one kinde, is a dispen∣sing, or rather a despising of the Ordinance of Christ. Wee are already wearied with citing of the manifold, vilde, odious, and irreligious Positions of your Disputers and Proctors, for this your Cause; yet one Pretence more may not be pretermit∣ted, least we might seeme to contemne the wit and zeale of your Iesuite Salmeron, against the use of this Sacrament in both kindes. The use of both kinds (saith Dispensandus non est utriusque, speciei usus Haereti∣cis, quia non sunt dā∣da sancta Canibus: nec Catholicis, quià debent distingui ab Haereticis, qui com∣municant sub duab. Salmeron Jes. Tom. 9. Tract. 37. §. His pofi∣tis, p. 411. he) is not to be allowed to Catholiques; because they must be distinguished from Heretikes: nor to Heretikes, because bread is not to be given unto Dogges. Now blessed be God! that we are esteemed as Heretikes and Dogges, to be distinguished from them, in this and other so many commanded Acts; wherein they have distinguished themselves from all Primitive Fathers, from the Apostles of Christ, and from Christ himselfe. An Appeale unto the ancient Popes and Church of Rome, against the late Romish Popes and Church; in Confutation of their former Transgressions of Christ his Institution. SECT. XIV. THe ancient Popes and Church of Rome were (as all the world will say) in authority of Command, in synceritie of judge∣ment equall, and in integrity of life Superiour unto the latter Popes of Rome and Church thereof; yet the ancient held it as a matter of Conscience for the Church, in all such Cases belonging to the Eucharist, to be conformable to the Precept and Example of Christ, and of the Apostles. So, you have heard, P. Calixtus. See above Chap. 2. Sect. 9. Pope Calixtus (An. Christi, 218.) requireth all persons present at the Masse to Com∣municate. For which reason it was (we thinke) that Pope P. Greg. Ibid. at (b.) Gregory (Anno 600.) commanded every one present at the Masse; and not purposing to Communicate, to Depart. There is an History rela∣ted by Aeneas Sylvius (after, Pope Pius the Second) which shew∣eth the reason why another See above, Chap. 2. Sect. 7. Chall. 5. (a.) Pope of Rome, with his Consistory, yeilded a liberty to the Sclavonians, to have Divine Service in their Nationall Language; and reporteth that it was thorow the sound of that voice (which is written in the Psalmes) Let every tongue prayse the Lord. P. Iulius. See a∣bove Chap. 3. Sect. 3. Pope Iulius (Anno 336.) was much busied in repressing the sopping of bread in the Chalice, and other like abu∣ses of the Sacrament in his time: and the reason, which hee gaue was this; Because (quoth hee) these Customes are not agreeable to E∣vangelicall and Apostolicall Doctrine: and our Church of Rome doth the same. Where he addeth, concerning the manner of Communi∣cating, Ibid. We reade (saith hee) that both the Bread and Cup, were distinctly and severally delivered. As if hee had meant, with the same breath, to have confuted your other Romish Transgression in
distributing to the people the Sacrament, but in one of Both: And who can say but that Gregory and Leo, both Popes, See above Chap. 3. Sect 4. observing the same use of Christ, had the same Resolution? Sure wee are that Pope P. Gelasius. See above Chap. 3. Sect. 4. Gelasius (Anno 494.) called the Abuse, in dismembring of this Sacrament, by receiving but in one kinde, A Grand Sacrilege. Wee reade of a Councell held at Toledo in Spaine, under Pope Sergius, stiled Synod. Tolet. 16—Conc. Generale, sub Sergio Papa.

All those ancient Popes, who held the Example of Christ, in his Institution and A∣postolicall Customes, to be necessary Directions of Christ his Church in such points, concerning the ministration of this Sa∣crament, being so utterly repugnant to your now Romish opini∣ons and Practices; it must follow, that those former Popes being admitted for Iudges, whom all Christians acknowledged to have beene Apostolicall in their Resolutions, the now Romish Church and her degenerate Profession must needs be judged Apostaticall. Now, from the former Actuall, wee proceed to the Doctrinall points.

Consequences deduced from such your Expositions: such as are Transubstantiation, Cor∣porall Presence, and the rest. CHAP. I. Of the Exposition of the words of Christ, [THIS IS MY BODY.] The State of the Question in Generall. BEcause (as In scripturâ expli∣candâ haeresis est ma∣nifesta, sicut figurata propriè accipere, ità quae sunt propriè dicta ad Tropicā locutionē detorquere: nam in verbis [Eunuchi sunt qui se castrant prop∣ter regnum coelorum &c.] August. and to the same purpose also, lib. 3. de Doctr. Christ. Saint Augustine saith of points of faith) It is as manifest an Heresie, in the interpertation of Scriptures, to take figurative spee∣chees properly, as to take proper speeches figuratively (And such is the CAVEAT, which —Hoc caven∣dum, nisi in manife∣stum Haereseos sco∣pulum impingere ve∣limus. Salmeron. Jes. Tom. 1. Proleg. 12. pag. 227. Salmeron the Iesuite giveth you) it will con∣cerne both You and Vs (as wee will avoide the brand of Heresie) to search exactly into the true sence of these words of Christ; especially seeing wee are herein to deale with the Inscription of the Seale of our Lord IESVS, even the Sacrament of his Body and Blood. In the which Disquisition, besides
the Authority of Ancient Fathers, wee shall insist much upon the Ingenuity of your owne Romish Authours. And what Necessitie there is to enquire into the true sence of these words, will best appeare in the after-Examination of the di∣vers See before Booke, 3, 4, 5, 6. Consequences of your owne Sence, to wit, your Doctrine of Transubstantiation, Corporall, and Gratian. Sacra∣menta Christi susci∣piendo, carnem eius & sanguinem materi∣aliter significamus. De Consecrat. dist. 2. C. Quià morte. Materiall Presence, Pro∣pitiatory Sacrifice, and proper Adoration: All which are Depen∣dants upon your Romish Exposition of the former wordes of Christ. The issue then will be this, that if the words be certainly true, in a Proper and litterall sence, then we are to yeild to you the whole Cause: But if it be necessarily Figurative, then the ground of all these your Doctrines being but sandy, the whole Structure and Fabricke, which you erect thereupon, must needs ruine and vanish. But yet know withall, that we doe not so maintaine a figu∣rative Sence of Christ his Speech, concerning his Body, as to ex∣clude the Truth of his Body, or yet the truly-Receiving thereof; as the Third and Fourth Bookes following will declare. That a Figurative sence of Christ his Speech [THIS IS MY BODY, &c.] is evinced out of the words themselves; from the Principles of the Romish Schooles. SECT. I. THere are two words, which may be unto us as two keyes, to un∣lock the questioned sence of Christ's words, viz. the Pronoune, [THIS] and the Verbe [IS.] We begin with the former. The State of the Question, about the word [THIS.] When wee shall fully vnderstand by your Church (which Conc. Trid. Sess. 13. cap. 1. Verba illa à Christo commemo∣rata, & à Divo Pau∣lo repetita propriam significationem prae se ferunt. holdeth a Proper and litterall Signification) what the Pronoune [THIS] doth demonstrate, then shall We truly inferre an in∣fallible proofe of our figurative sence. All Opinions concerning the Thing, which the word [THIS] in the divers opinions of Authours, pointeth at, may be reduced to Three heads; namely, to signifie either This Bread, or This Bodie of Christ, or else some Third Thing different from them both. Tell you vs, first, what you hold to be the opinion of Pro∣testants? Lutherans and all Calvinists (saith your Lutherani & om∣nes Calvinistae pro∣nomen [Hoc] pro pa∣ne positum esse di∣cunt, quià panem Christus in manu ac∣ceperat, & dixit [Hoc est Corpus meum.] Maldon. Ies. in Matth. 26. §. Hoc omnes—Lutherus in verba E∣vangelistae. Habent hunc sensum; Hic pa∣nis est corpus meum. Iesuite) thinke that the Pronoune [THIS] pointeth out Bread. But your Roman Doctors are at oddes among themselves, and divided into two principall Opinions. Some of them referre the word [THIS] to Christ's Body, Some to a Third thing, which you call Individuum vagum. In the first place we are to confute both these your Expo∣sitions; and after to confirme our owne.
That the first Exposition of Romish Doctors, of great learning, (re∣ferring the word [THIS] properly to Christ his Body) per∣verteth the sence of Christ his Speech, by the Conses∣sions of Romish Doctors. SECT. II. DIvers of your Romish Divines of speciall note, as well Ie∣suites as others, interpret the word [This] to note the Body of Christ, as it is present in this Sacrament, at the pronuntiation of the last syllable of this speech [Hoc est corpus meum:] Because they are words See below, let. (k. n. o.) &c. Practicall, (say they) that is, working that which they signifie (namely) The Body of Christ. And this sence they call Most cleare: and, in their Iudgements, there can be no better then this. So your [Hoc] designat corpus, ut est inter∣mino prolationis: & hic est sensus lucu∣lentissimus.

ARe not these Opinators in number many; in name for the most part, of great esteeme; their Assertion, in their own opinion, full of assurance; and delivered to their Hearers, as the onely Catho∣lique Resolution? And yet behold one, whose name alone hath obtained an Authority equivalent to almost all theirs, your Car∣dinall Argumentum eorum, qui volunt Pronomen [Hoc] de∣monstrare Corpus, est absurdum, quod in huius modi propositi∣onibus, quae signifi∣cant id quod tunc fit cum dicitur, Prono∣mina demonstrativa non demonstrate quod est, sed quod erit. Et ponunt Exempla, ut si quis dum pingit lineam, aut circulum dicat, Haec est linea, hic est Circulus. Quomodo etiam exponi debet Pronomen in illis verbis Do∣mini, Ioh. 15. Hoc est praeceptum meum.—Haec explicatio non videtur satisfacere, propter duas causas. Primò quià etsi Pronomen demonstrativum demonstrer rem futuram, quandò nihil est praesens, quod demonstretur (ut in exemplis allatis) tamen si quis digito aliquid ostendat, dum pronomen effert, valdè absurdum videtur dicere, pronomine illo non demonstrari rem praesentem. Atqui Dominus accepit panem, & illum porrigens, ait, [Ac∣cipite, Edite, H. E. C. M.] Videtur igitur demonstrasse panem. Neque Obstat quod propositio non significat, nisi in sine totius prolationis: Nam etsi ità est de propositione, quae est ratio quaedam, tamen Demonstratiua Pronomina mox indicant certum aliquid, etiam antequam sequantur coeterae voces; Et sane in illis verbis [Bibite ex hoc omnes] valdè durum est, non demonstrari id quod erat, sed id tantùm quod futurum erat: Secundò si Pronomen [Hoc] demonstrat solùm Corpus, verba speculativa erunt, non practica. Bellar. lib. 1. de Euch. cap. 11. §. Nota secundò. Bellarmine, who, speaking of the same opinion of referring
the word [This] to the Body of Christ, doth in flat tearmes call it ABSVRD: but not without good and solid reason, and that ac∣cording to the Principles of Romish Schooles; to wit, because before the last syllable of the last word [Me-um] be pronounced the Body of Christ is not yet present: and the word [This] cannot demonstrate a thing Absent, and therefore can it not be said, This body is my body. A Reason pregnant enough in it selfe, and ra∣tified by your publique Romane Huius vocis [Hoc] ea visest, ut rei prae∣sentis substantiā de∣mōstret. Catech. Conc. Trid. Decret. & inssu Pij Quinti Pontificis Edit. ut in frontispitio libri cr. Catechisme, authorised by the then Pope, and Councell of Trent; yet notwithstanding your fore-named Irish Iesuite, hearing this Argument obiected by Prote∣stants, rayleth downe right, calling it Accursed, as iudged by the Church Hereticall, and indeed Abhominable. So hee, who with O∣thers, if they were of fit yeares, might be thought to deserve the rod, for forgetting their Generall Catechisme, and for defending an Exposition, which even in common sense may be pronoun∣ced, in your Cardinal's owne phrase, very Absurde; else shew vs, if you can, but the least semblance of Truth for that Opinion. Similitudes obiected, for defence of their former Exposition, and confuted by their owne fellowes. The Similitudes which are urged, to illustrate your former Pra∣cticall and operative sense, are of these kinds, to wit; Even as if one (say Bellar. See a∣bove at let. (k.) They) in drawing a Line, or a Circle, should say in the making thereof, This is a Line, or, This is a Circle: or as if the Smith (say Haec locutio, [Hoc est corpus me∣um] habet virtutem factivam conversio∣nis panis in Corpus Christi, ut an Tho∣mas.—Pro simi∣li, quod rudi intelle∣ctui satisfacere va∣leat, dari potest, ut si Faber accepto ferro clavum subito motu formans, dicat, Hic est Clavus—Clavus non est cum profertur oratio, sed fieri inter proferendū, & esse per prolationem verb orū. Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 13. pag. 81. Col. 1. [ex aliorum opinione,] & Iansenius Concerd. cap. 130.—vt faber cla∣vum, &c. Others) in making of a Nayle, should say, This is a Nayle; So by Christ his saying [This is my Body] it was made presently the Body of Christ, at the very pronuntiation of the last word of this Sentence, [This is my Body.] But most conceitedly your Iesuite Malloune, and that not without scurrility, Master Malloune in his late Reply, p. 105. This is a Kirtle for my wife, &c. As a Taylor making a Kirtle, and saying (we shall change onely his last word) This is a Kirtle for my Mistris CONVBINA. So they. CHALLENGE. THese kind of Subtilties are frequent in the mouthes of most Romish Priests, as often as they are compelled to shew what is demonstrated by the Pronoune, This. But that these your Simi∣litudes of making Circles, Lines, and Nayles, are no better than Iugling, and Gypsie-trickes of fast or loose, and fond devises forged in the braines of idle Sophisters, and uttered by your Cir∣culary Priests, your owne Authours are ready to manifest for these Examples of the Painter's touching a Line, or a Circle (as your Bellar. See above at let. (k.) Bellarmine sheweth) making and saying, This is a Circle; Is no true Proposition, untill the Circle be made. And then it is a figura∣tive
speech and not a proper, using the present Tence, Is, for the future, Shall be. So he. In like manner your Iesuite Profectò proposi∣tio non est vera, nisi postquàm factus est Circulus: Sed oratio accipitur pro verà, quia d quod futu∣rum est, accipitur pro iam facto, per Tropū, non iuxtà Proprieta∣tem sermonis: in quē sensum Christus ple∣runque praesens pro futuro vsurpavit: ut Math. 26. Apud te fa∣cio Pascha cum di∣cipulis mes, id est, confestian facio Pas∣cha Salmerō. Ies. om. 9. Tran. 13. §. Secun∣da.—Si [est] pro∣ptie accipiatur, pro existere, durum est ut vniat subiectum cum praedicato pro futuro tempore, quià falsa esser propositio, non solùm in orationibus speculativis, & signi∣ficativis, sed etiam in practicis & factivis: ut si quis volens face∣re Circulum, rogatus quid est Hoc, respon∣deatque, Hic est Cir∣culus; Profectò pro∣positio non est statim vera, &c. Salm. Ib. p. 83 Salmeron af∣firmeth with a PROFECTÒ and full asseveration, that the speech of him, who in drawing a Circle doth say, This is a Circle, cannot without a Trope or Figure, be iudged true. So he. And furthermore, who knoweth not that every Operative speech doth signifie not the Being of a thing; but the Making thereof, and bringing of it unto being? For although the Painter be so nimble, in drawing a Circle, that his hand may goe before his tongue; yet when the Operative virtue consisteth not in wor∣king, by the agility of the hand, but in the orderly pronoun∣cing of the words of a speech with the tongue, so that the Truth thereof dependeth upon the utterance of the last syllable; It is impossible but the Priest, in uttering distinctly these words, [Hoc est corpus meum,] must say, This is, before he come to the last syl∣lable of me-um: and consequently in his sence notifie This to be Christ's Body, before (according to his owne iudgement) the Bo∣dy of Christ can have there any being at all. By this is discovered the notable vertigo and dizzinesse of your Iesuite Maldonate; Hee, to prove that the Pronoune, This, doth relate to Christ's Body, standeth upon the like Operative speculati∣on; God (saith Quum Deus ex limo terrae hominem sinxit rectè ver é{que} di∣cere potuisset, sump∣to in manus limo, Hic est Homo. Et cum ex costa mulierē fabri∣cauit, sumptâ costâ dicere potuit; Haec est mulier, quamuis cum pronunciasset Pronomen [Haec] nondùm fuisset mulier, ac significasset cùm ità locutus fuisset, limūnon esse hominem, & costam mulierem; sed limum in hominem, costam in mulierem converti. Sic cum Christus dicit, [Hoc est corpus me∣um,] significat panem mutari in corpus suum. Quemadmodum si in Cana Galileae, cum aquam in vinum, &c. Maldon. Ies in Matth. 26. Ità cum Christus dicit, accepto pane [Hoc est corpus meum] quamvis illud corpus non∣dum ille esset, sed futurum erat, illud eo pronomine demonstrat, nec significat panem, quem acceperat, esse corpus suum, sed mutari in corpus suum. Idemin Matth. 26. pag. 635. he) in creating man of the slime of the earth, might have truly said thereof, This is man: Or in framing Woman of the Rib of man, might have rightly said; This is Woman: or Christ in working his miracle in Cana of Galilee, might have said, (shewing the water) This is wine. So he. When, notwithstanding, he is infor∣ced in every one to alter the Verbe, Is, thus; Slime is changed into Man: Rib is converted into Woman: Water is made Wine, as he himselfe confesseth; expounding the words [This is my Body] thus, Not that it was then his Body (saith he) which as yet it was not, but was about to be: nor that he signified the Bread to be his Body, but to be changed into his Body. So he. As if any thing could be said proper∣ly, to be that, which as yet it Is not. Hitherto of your first In∣terpretation. That the second Romish Exposition, referring the Pronoune [THIS] to demonstrate a Third thing, called Individuum vagum, or Inde∣terminate substance, perverteth the sence of Christ his speech [THIS IS MY BODY:] proved by the Confession of Romish Doctors. SECT. III. A Third thing, differing both from Bread and the Body of Christ, which Romish Sophisters have lately invented, is that which
they call Individuum vagum; by which is meant, a substance con∣fusedly taken; as when one (to use your own e example) having an Hearb in his hand shall say, This hearb groweth in my garden: in which speech the word; Hearb, which is demonstrated by the pronoune, This, is not taken determinately, for that singular Herb in his hand, (for that doth not now grow in his garden) but is ta∣ken vagè and confusedly, for the common Species, nature, or kind of that hearb. And this opinion is defended by Sententia haec est, Ponomine illo designari aliquid cō∣mune Substantiae pa∣nis & corporis Chri∣sti; Commune (in∣quam) non secun∣dum Rem, (illud e∣nim nullum esse po∣test) sed secundum rationē seu denomi∣nationem viz. sub ra∣tione contenti sub his accidētibus con∣tinetur corpus me∣um. Ità Guitmundus (where hee reckons vp 15. other Schoole men:) vbi Pronomen [Hoc] substantivè sumitur, & demonstrat in confuso Ens, sivè substan∣tiam contentam sub illis speciebus—vt cum quis dicat, Haec herba nascitur in horto meo: illud Pronomen [Haec] non significat hanc numero herbam, sed herbam huic similem. Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. in Thom. disp 58. §. 7. p 75▪ Secundùm rationem Substantiae tùm communem tùm Indiuiduam vagam. Greg. de Ʋalent. l. 1. de Pre∣sent. corp. Chr (). §. Respondemus. p. 377.

Bellarmine, with o∣ther Iesuites, and Doctors of your Church, (b Sixteene in num∣ber) as the only sufficient and conclusive Resolution of this point, touching the proper Exposition of the words of Christ, concer∣ning the Pronoune, THIS. CHALLENGE. VVHich Subtilty is notwithstanding discussed, disclosed, and exploded by your learned Archiepisc. Caesar. sivè Christopherus de Capite fontium. var. Trac. Demonstrando corpus in genere, ne∣scio quid—dictum velis, cū non Indivi∣dua in Generibus su∣is, sed Genera in individuis demon∣strentur, & Prono∣minis natura est sola singularia demonstrare—Ideò si generi addas Pronomen [Hoc] demonstras non in genere sed in Individuo rem ipsam,—Conceptus communis non latet sub speciebus, nec in ma∣nibus portari potest.—Propositio vera dicitur ex eo, quod res est vera, velnon est vera: ergò non ver∣borum dispositio consideranda venit—Rapiunt isti à rerum consideratione lectorem, ut non res ipsas, sed intelligibiles formas loquendi contempletur.—Quibus dixerim, revertiminiad iudicium, ô viri, & duas has tantum res Corpus sc. & panem considerate, quarum alterum tantùm demonstrari necesse est. Quià Prono∣men vice nominis Proprij positum prosolo singulari sumi potest, cum Scriptura duarum tantùm substantia∣rum, quae demonstrari hîc queant, meminerit, viz. Panis, & Corporis, nescio cur fingunt Tertiam aliquam, quae nec panis sit, nec corpus. In quo magnam vim Scripturae faciunt, infarcientesilli ex suo cerebro tertiam illam rem, cujus nullam habent mentionem, & quâ positâ, propositio esset fala, Archiep. Caesar. quo supra p. 12. Si enim Christus ità loqueretur de pane, ante illius Transubstantiationem, mentiretur—Non enim haec dici possunt de Pan consecrando, quod sit corpus Christi. Ibid. p. 17. Solam illam substantiam singularem demon∣strabat, quae erat in Christi manibus, quae erat aut panis, aut corpus ejus: Tertiam igitur quaerere vanissi∣mus labor est, & absurditate plenus. Thus farre that Archbishop. Arch-bishop of Cesarea, and your Iesuite Vulgata opinio est, illud pronomen [Hoc] ne{que} demonstrare corpus Christi; ne{que} panem, sed accipi vagè, pro eo quod continetur sub acciden∣tibus, quod priùs est panis, deinde corpus Christi. Quae sententia non videtur mihi probabilis esse, quià etsi vocabula solent aliquandò habere vagam & indefinitam significationem, tamen aliud est loqui de significatione verbi, aliud de acceptione, quam Dialectici vocant suppositionem. Illa quae dicuntur Individua vaga significa∣tionem habent vagam, & indeterminatam, sed suppositionem habent semper certam, & determinatam: nam etsi hoc Pronomen [Hic, haec, hoc,] quantum in se est, non magis significat hunc hominem, quam illum, tamen cum ponitur in propositione (ut hic homo disputat) non potest accipi nisi determinatè pro hoc homine. Ergo necesse est ut illud Pronomen [Hoc] accipiatur determinatè, autpro pane, aut pro corpore Christi—Nul∣la res potest esse nisi determinate aut haec aut illa; Ergò non possunt haec Pronomina, si substantiuè accipi∣antur, nisi pro hac vel illâ re determinata accipi. Maldon. Ies. de Sacram. Euch. Tom. 1. §. Tertius er∣ror, pag. 216. 217. Maldonate, as an Opinion both false and full of Absur∣dities. 1. Because whensoever the Pronowne [This] is used in Speech, as, This man disputeth, it is alwayes in proper sence, as de∣terminately taken. 2. Christ spoke of that which was in his hand, but that was no vagrant, but a singular determinate Substance. And it is grosse, to say a man holdeth a confused substance in his
hand. Which seemed to your Mr. Harding in his answere to the 24. Article, saying; Learn you what they mean, and if their meaning be naught, handle you them as you list; you shall not offend us any whit. Mr. Harding so vncouth and fond an opinion, that hee utterly refuseth to defend the Au∣thors thereof. This, and much more have they written to the discovering and discarding of this idle figment, wishing furthermore that the Defendants of this opinion, of Individuum vagum, may re∣turne to their wits againe, and cease to offer such violence to this holy Scripture [This is my Body.] So They. And worthily, for these two words, Individuum, and Vagum, spoken of Hoc, be termes as Contradictory, as to call the same thing, singular∣common, or determinate-confused. As for example, Quidam ho∣mo, A certaine man is in Logique Individuum vagum; as when Christ said, A certaine man went from Hierusalem to Hieri∣cho, &c. None of the Disciples hearing this could thereupon point him out, saying; This man: or know thereby who, or what hee was. Wee, for further manifestation of your Absurdity in this point, will instance in your owne Example, for your Individuum vagum. The Hearbe, which a man holdeth in his hand, saying, This hearb groweth in my Garden, how can you say it is true in the proper sence? for if you take it determinately, the same Hearb numero is not in the man's garden, because it is in his hand, and so it is yet Hoc Individuum determinatum. And if you speake of it in a confu∣sed Notion, no Abstract Notion can be held in a man's hand, it being the function of the braine, and not of the hand, to apprehend mentall Notions, or Generalls; and so it is not Individuum at all. But the Text saith of Christ his hand, [He tooke bread, &c.] THIS, which Christ, in so saying, pointed out with his finger, saith your [Hoc est corpus meum.] Hoc quod Christus digito de∣monstrabat, cumilla verba protulit. Sand. de visib. Monarch. l. 7. ad Annum. 1547. Sanders; but a man will have much adoe to point out an Individuum vagum (such as is an invisible, or a confused Notion) with a visible finger. Wee would now conclude in the words of a Parisian Doctor, Perus Picherel∣lus de Missâ. cap. 3. Individui vagi commentum Authori Scoo  relinquo; but that somthing els is to be added. Another may be your Cardinall his owne Assertion, which he once made as a snare to catch himselfe in; for in your Cum antè Con∣secrationem dicimus in Litutgiâ [suscipe sancte Pater hanc immaculatam hosti∣am] certè Pronomen [Hanc] demonstrat ad sensus id quod tunc manibus tene∣mus, id autem est pa∣nis. Bel. l. 1 de Missâ, c. 27. §. Prima propo∣sitio. Romish Masse, the Priest hauing the Hoast in his hand, prayeth thus; Receive, holy father, This immaculate Hoast. If you shall aske him what, in this prayer, the Pronowne This doth demonstrate, hee telleth you readily and asseverantly saying; Certainly it demonstra∣teth unto sence that which the Priest hath in his hand, which is Bread. So hee. Now why there should not be the like certainty of Rela∣tion of the Pronounc [This] to Bread in the speech of Christ, as it hath in the prayer of the Priest, none of you (we thinke) shall e∣ver be able to shew. Lastly, we challenge you to shew within the space of a Thou∣sand three hundreth yeares after Christ, out of all the Ancient Fa∣thers, any one Testimony that ever affirmed the Pronoune [Hoc,
This] to betoken any Individuum vagum, or Common Substance; or els to confesse that this your doctrine is new, extravagant, and Adulterate. Nor yet can the Defenders thereof say that this is all one, as to say, This, that is, that which is contained vnder the forme of Bread, because this is like as when one shewing his purse, shall say, This is money, meaning that which is in his purse; which is a knowne figure Metonymia. Yet were it granted that [Hoc] betoke∣ned an Indiuiduum vagum, as (to use your owne Similitude) when one saith of an herb in his hand, This hearb groweth in my garden; so Christ should have said of bread in his hand; This, (that is the like kind of bread) is my Body: yet would not this make the Speech of Christ proper, or not figurative, because Christ's Body could no more be properly predicated of the kind of wheat-Bread; then it could be of that bread of wheate then in his hand, as Christ him∣selfe hath taught vs, and as we are to prove vnto you. For speaking of his Body, he calleth it , the grane of wheate, Ioh. 12. 24. not This grane; yet Christ's flesh is equally called improperly The grane, as This grane of wheate: whereof the ancient Father Theodoret will read you all a Lesson in the sixt Section following. And now this so open and extreame civill war among your selues, in confuting your owne Expositions, will further and confirme peace among us in that one Exposition, which we are in the next place to de∣fend, as followeth. The Third Proposition, which is (according to the iudgement of Protestants) that there is a Tropicall and vnproper sence, in the Pronoune [THIS.] VVEe reason first Hypothetically; If the Pronoune This demonstrate Bread, then the words of Christ are neces∣sarily to be taken improperly and figuratively. But the Pro∣noune This doth demonstrate Bread. Our Conclusion will be; Therefore the words of Christ, necessarily, are to be taken figura∣tively. All this will be proved, confirmed, and avouched by Rea∣sons Authorities, and Confessions, which will admit no Con∣tradiction. Wee begin at our proofe of the Consequence of the Proposition. That it is impossible for Bread to be called the Body of Christ; or Wine his Blood, without a Figure. SECT. IV. THe common Dictate of naturall Reason, imprinted by God in man's heart, is a Maxime, and hath in it an uni∣versall Veritie, which neither man nor Divell can gain-say, and is Confessed by yourselves, viz. Disparatum de disparato non pro∣priè
praedicatur; That is, nothing can be properly and literally affirmed ioyntly of another thing, which is of a different nature, viz. It is impossible to say properly that an Egge is a Stone, or (to take your owne Dispatatum de disparato non prae∣dicatur, valet gitur argumentum: Si hoc est lac, non est fer∣rum: ita etiam va∣lebit, si hoc est est corpusnon est pa∣nis; cum repugnet, unam naturam de al∣terâ diversâ dici, ut hominem esse equum citra tropum, vel Me∣taphoram. Salm. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 16. §. Primum igitur. p. 109. example) we cannot call A man an horse, without a Trope or Figure, because their natures are repugnant. So Salmeron. And this hee holdeth necessary. Or thus: Nè ipse quidem Deus, qui est summa veritas, vn quam effi∣ciet, vt hae proposi∣tiones, vxor Lot est Sal, aqua est vinum, asinus est homo, in sensu composito sint verae. Archiep. Caesar. dens. . de Real. Praes. cap. 58. God, who is perfect Truth, will never make those Propositions to be true at the same time, viz. that the Wife of Lot is Salt, or Water is Wine, or an Asse a man. So your Archbishop. Yea, to come nearer to the point: Obseruandum, cum dicitur vinum es sanguis, docetur esse sanguinem per simi∣litudinem, reipsa au∣tem & propriè est vinum. Et cum dici∣tur sanguis est vinū, intelligitur vinum esse per similitudi∣nem: nec enim re∣ipsâ aut propriè esse potest aut vinū sanguis, aut sanguis vinum, cum res sunt ipsae diversae inter se, & ter∣mini ut vocant disparati. Bel. l. 2. de Euch. c. 9. §. Observand. We cannot say that this wine is blood, or that this blood is wine, but by a Similitude or Representation, because they differ in nature. So Bellarmine; Ad∣ding furthermore that it is Non potest fieri ut vera sit Propositio, in qua subiectum supponitur propane, praedicatum pro corpore Christi: Panis enim & corpus res diversissimae sunt. Bellar▪ l. . de. Euch. c. 19. § Primum. Impossible the Proposition should be true, wherein the Subiect is Bread and the Predicate is taken for the Body of Christ. And, Bread and Christ's body (saith your Eodem tempore panis triticeus, & corpus Christi esse non possunt, quia disparata sunt. Sand. de visi. Monarch. ad Annum. 1549. [To obict De Christo , Deus est homo, were vaine, because that is spoken by reason of he Hypostaticall Vnion whereby Accidit Deo ut sit homo, per hypostaticam vnionem, non per mutationem, which Vnity maketh God and man in Christ reciprocall. And we also meane, Disparata absoluta, not Relata, for thus the same man is father and sonne.] Sanders) cannot be properly affirmed one of another. And indeed it is as Impossible Bread should be properly a body of flesh, as a body of flesh to be bread; which is grounded upon our first Maxime, which your Iesuite Salmeron expresseth thus. Quoties verbum [Est] res diversarum naturarum, quae à Latinis dicuntur disparata, unit, & copulat, ibi necessariò ad figuram & Tro∣pum recurramus. Salm. Ies. Tom 9. Tract. 10. p. 138. As of∣ten as the Verbe [EST, IS,] ioyneth things of divers natures toge∣ther, we are necessarily to have recourse to a Trope and Figure. Will you be content that your Glosse, as the tongue of your Church, may have the last word? Then hearken to it: Sipanis est corpus Christi, ergo aliquid quod non es natum ex virgine est corpus Christ: & ità animatum est inanimatum. Gloss. Decret. de Consecrat. dist. . can. Quia. If bread be Christ's body, then something is Christ's body, which is not borne of the Virgin Ma∣ry; and then also the same body must be said to be liuing, and not li∣uing both at once. So your Glosse, confessing hereby an Impossibi∣litie of this Predication, Bread is Christs Body, in a proper and literall sence. Our Proposition then standeth firme and infallible; our As∣sumption will be found as true. That the Pronoune [THIS] doth as verily notifie Bread in the words of Christ, as if hee had expressly said, This Bread is my Body; proved first by Scripture. SECT. V. THe Text of the Evangelist, Luc. 22. is light sufficient in it selfe; [Iesus tooke bread, blessed it, brake it, and gave it to them, saying, Take, Eate, THIS, (namely, which they Tooke; and they tooke THIS, which he Gave; and he gave THIS, which he Brake;
and hee Brake THIS, which hee Blessed; and blessed THIS, which hee himselfe Tooke; and THIS, which hee tooke, was Bread, [Iesus tooke Bread. Wee appeale to your owne Consciences, who never hitherto could say, that in all these sayings of Christ there was made any Change or alteration of THIS which he tooke, till the last word pronounced by the Priest, which is Meum; nor yet can you deny, but that he tooke that, which was properly, and sub∣stantially Bread. At the writing of this Sorites, we light vpon an An∣swere from one Mr. M. Malloune in his late Reply. p. 200. His Sorites; That which the Gover∣nour of the feast in Cana of Galile ta∣sted, was the same which the Ministers brought him: that which they brought him was the same that others drew out: that which others drew out, was the same which others before them powred into the Pots; but that which others powred into the Pots was water: Therfore that which the Governour of the feast tasted was water. So he. [None is so witlesse but will easily, from the light of the Text, tell him, that the water was changed into wine, before the Governour of the feast tasted thereof: whereas, in the tenure f Christ his speech, you your selves could never point out any former change at all, before the last syllable, Meum] Maloune, encountring it with another, but a false Sorites invented by himselfe, to the discountenancing of this true one; onely wee intreat you, that at the reading thereof, you will not laugh at his foolery. See the Margin. Your Grammaticall Obiection is Childish. Cardinall Si [Hoc] ac∣cipitur substantivè, tùm sens{us} erit, [Hoc] i. e. Haec res, quod si de Pane dieatur, ab∣surdissima propositio erit, non enim potest dici Hoc de Re quae cernitur, & apertè cognoscitur, nisi sit generis neutrius illa—Nemo enim de∣monstrans de Patre suo, diceret, Hoc est Pater meus. Bellar. lib 1. de Euch. c. 10. §. Porrò. Bellarmine your chiefe Master, and also your Schoole∣fellow Although the word Bread had not beene expressed, yet being present in Christs hand, and pointed unto, Hoc could not be takē sub∣stantively no more then one should say of his Father, Hoc est Pater meus. M. Breerlye's Liturgie. p. 137. M. Breerly, as if they would put Protestants to Schoole, tell them that [Hoc] taken for a Substantive neuter cannot agree with Panis, it being a Thing then seene and knowne, and not being of the neuter gender: no more than for a man to say, De Patre, Hoc est Pater meus. A strange thing, that great Clerkes, when they take upon them to teach others their Grammer, should be so far over-taken as to need to be put in mind of their Accidence, (if ever they learned it) which telleth them that The neuter gender will agree with any thing that hath no life, whether seene or not seene. In which re∣spect there might be a difference betweene, Hoc de Patre, and Hoc de Pane: for although Priscian would cry out, if hee heard one saying, Hoc lana, or Hoc lapis, wherein [Hoc] is taken adiective∣ly: yet if a Question being raised concerning the lightnes and heavines of Wool, and of Stone, one shewing the Wool in his hand should say, Hoc est leve; the other pointing at the Stone should say, Hoc est grave, will any thinke that Priscian would be offended, for [Hoc] in Latine, more then others would be for  in .

Many, that taught that [Hoc] in the words of Christ, put sub∣stantively, may without any Inconvenience agree with Panis, in [This] meaning [This] which I give you. Are you not yet ashamed of your Rashnesse? then must we now put you unto it. In your owne vulgar Latin Translation, it is said of Evah the the wife of Adam, Salmer. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 16. §. Nec rursus.—Adam de Evâ ex costâ eius desumptâ, Hoc nun os ex ossibus meis. Gen. 2. 13. Hoc est os, Gen. 2. what Insobriety then is this in your Disputers, so eagerly to reach that blow unto the Pro∣testants, wherewith they must as necessarily buffe their owne Mother-Church, by which the same Translation is made Au∣thentique; and wound their owne Consciences, being themselves bound by Oath to defend it in all their disputations? Away then with these Puerilities, especially now being busied in a matter of so great importance, wherein consisteth the foundation of all the maine Controversies concerning the Roman Masse. For, if the Pronoune [This] have Relation to Bread, there needs no further dispute about the figurative sence of Christ's speech. Wee returne to the Schoole of Christ, the holy Scripture, to consult (about Christ's meaning) with his Disciple Saint Paul, where he professeth to deliver nothing, concerning Christ his In∣stitution of this Sacrament, but that which hee had 1. Cor. 11. 23. Received of the Lord. Him we desire to expound vnto vs the words of Christ, delivered by Three Evangelists, and to tell what hee gave unto them, and what he called his Body: and he telleth vs plainly, say∣ing; 1. Cor. 10. 16. The bread, which we breake, is it not the Communion of the Body of Christ? alluding to those words of the Evangelists, He brake it, and that was Bread. And that you may know that this was Catholique Doctrine in the dayes of Antiquity, wee adioyne the next Proposition. That it was Bread and Wine, which Christ called his Body and Blood; in the Iudgement of An∣cient Fathers. SECT. VI. FOr proofe hereof, behold a Torrent of Ancient 1.

Fathers pressing upon you; Iraeneus, Tertullian, Origen, Hierome,
Ambrose, Augustine, Cyrill of Hiernsalem, Cyrill of Alexan∣dria, Theodoret, Gaudentius, Cyprian, Clemens of Alexandria, and Isidore; Thirteene to the dozen, whose sayings we may best know by their owne Idiome, and Tenure of speech. The first noting Christ to haue confessed bread to have beene his Body. The second, Christ to have called bread his Body. The third, that Christ's speech was spoken of bread. The fourth, that That which hee broke, was bread. The fift, that It was bread which he brake. The sixt, that It was bread of the Lord, and not bread the Lord. The seventh, that the words [My Body] were spoken of the bread. The eight, that Christ saith, of the bread [This is my Body.] And the same Father, as if he had studied to take away all Scales of doubtfulnesse from the eyes of your mindes, illustrateth the matter thus: So (saith hee) did Christ call his Body Bread, as else-where hee calleth his flesh a Graine of Wheate; [Except the Graine of Wheate die, it bringeth forth no fruit.] The ninth, that Christ gave to the bread the name of his Body. The tenth, that Christ said of the Consecrated bread [This is my Body.] The eleuenth, that It was Wine which hee called his blood. The twelfth, that He blessed Wine, when he said drinke. And the last; The bread strengthening man's body was therefore called the body of Christ. All these so Learned and Ancient Fathers (sufficient Grammarians we trow) teaching the Pronoune [This] to demonstrate Bread, doe as absolutely confute your Romish Exposition, to prove the speech Figurative, as any Protestant in the world could doe, if hee were permitted to plead his owne Cause. CHALLENGE. VVE will try what a Syllogisme will doe, that, after your Po∣sall in Grammar, we may encounter you with Logique. The Maior. No Bread can possibly be called a Body of flesh, with∣out a figure. (This Proposition hath had the Vniversall consent of all Schooles, by virtue of that Maxime of Maximes, See above §. 4. Disparatum de Disparato, &c.) The Minor. But in these words, [This is my Body,] the Pronoune [This] doth demonstrate Bread. (This hath beene the generall Ex∣position of Fathers.) The Conclusion. Therefore the words of Christ, [This is my Bo∣dy] are to be taken figuratively. (Except you will contradict, both the Generall confession of your owne Schooles, and Vniversall con∣sent of Ancient Fathers.)
That it was Bread, which Christ called his Body, is proved manifestly from your owne Romish Positions and Principles. SECT. VII. YOur first Position is this; The word [This] must either point out Bread, or the Body of Christ, or that Third common Sub∣stance, which you call Individuum vagum. But to referre the word [This] unto the Body of Christ, is (as hath beene See above §. 2. confessed) Ab∣surde. And that the word [This] should signifie your Individuum vagum, is an Exposition fall of Absurdities, as hath beene also See above §. 3. ac∣knowledged. It remaineth therefore that the Pronoune [This] pointeth out precisely, Bread. A second Principle you have, to wit; That these words [This is my Body] are wordes of Consecration, and Operative, so that by [This] is meant that which is Consecrated, and (as your Councell Concil. Trident. Sess. 13. c. 4. Fit Con∣versio totius substan∣tiae Panis in Corpus Christi. of Trent speaketh) changed into the Body of Christ. But, by the Decree of the same Councell, not the Body of Christ, nor any Third thing, but Bread onely was then consecrated and changed into the Body of Christ. Ergo the Pronoune [THIS] hath onely Rela∣tion to the Bread. CHALLENGE. A New Syllogisme would be had, to put the matter out of que∣stion. Maior. No Sence, which is Impossible, can be given properly to the wordes of Christ. [This is my Body.] (This needeth no proofe.) Minor. But to call Bread Christ's Body, properly, is a Sence Im∣possible. (This hath beene your owne constant See above §. 4. profession.) Conclusion. Therefore cannot this Sence be given properly to the Body of Christ. How can you auoid the necessity of this Con∣sequence? All arising from the nature of Predication, in this Pro∣position, wherein the Subiect is Bread, the Copula, Is; and Predi∣cate, Body of Christ. Which because it cannot be properly predi∣cated either of Bread determinate, as to say, This bread in my hand is Christ's Body; or of Bread undeterminate (which you call vagum) as to say, This kind of bread is the Body of Christ, it demonstrately sheweth that your Doctors can have no greater Aduersaries, in this case, than their owne Consciences, which will appeare as fully in that which followeth.
CHAP. II. The Second key in Christ's Words [Hoc est Corpus meum: This is my Body,] opening the Figu∣rative Sence thereof, is the Ʋerbe [EST, IS.] FOr that [Est] in these words hath the same sence, as, Signifieth; as if Christ had said expresly of the Bread, This signifieth my Body: and accordingly of the Wine, This signifieth my Blood, may be proued by three Propositions infringible. Our first Proposition. The Verbe [EST] being ioyned with a thing that is a Signe, is alwayes figurative, and the very same with this word, SIG∣NIFIETH. SECT. I. FOr although the Verbe (Est) be indeed so absolutely simple, in it's owne nature, that it cannot be resolved into any other word (as all other Verbes may be in like Case) yet doth it (albe∣it accidentally) necessarily inferre a figurative Sence, and is as much as Signifieth, or Representeth, whensoever it ioyneth the Signe and the Thing signified together. As for Example, A man pointing at a signe hanging before an Inne, and saying, This is S. George on horse-backe, the Verbe Is can inferre no other Sence than Signifieth. Why? even because the thing, whereof it speaketh, is a Signe signifying Saint George. And Bread in this Sacrament is in all Catholique Divinity a Signe of Christ's Body. Therefore the Verbe [Is] can have no other sence than [Signifieth.] The former Proposition confirmed by all like Speeches, whether Artificiall, Politique, or Mysticall. SECT. II. YOur owne Iesuits, and common Experience it selfe will verifie this Truth. First, in things Artificiall, as Meronymia, tro∣pus est in Scripturis frequentissimus, quâ continens pro contento, & contrà signatum pro signo usurpari solet; ut ostensâ imagine Herculis, dicimus, Hic est Hercules. Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. proleg. 12. Can. 15. To say of the Picture of Hercules, This is Hercules, is a figure. Secondly, In things Poli∣tique,
as when a Testamentum saepè sumitur pro Le∣gato, seu Re testatâ. Barrad. Ies. Iust. l. 3. de Euch. cap. 5. Legacie, given by Will and Testament, is called the man's Will. So they. And indeed what is more Common, than for a man to say of his Testament, This is my Will? Of his name subscribed, This is my hand? And of the waxe sealed, This is my Seale? When as his Will (properly taken) is in his heart, his hand is affixed to his Arme, And his seale may be in his pocket. Thirdly, In Mysticall and Divine Rites; as in Sacrifice, even among the Heathen, according to that Example out of Homer, which is notable. The Greekes and Troians, when they entred in∣to a league, which was to be ratified by a Sacrifice of Lambs, upon which both sides were to take their Oathes, this their Act is thus expressed Salm. Jes. Tom. 9. Tract. 15. § Malè etiā. [Idem prius habuit no∣ster Beza in Luc. 22. 20.]—; that is, They brought with them two Lambes, their faithfull Oathes. Where Lambes, the ri∣tuall signes of their faithfull Swearing, are called Oathes. An Ex∣ample (I say) even among the Heathen, which is as appo e to our purpose, and opposite against your defence, as can be. Our Second Proposition, answerable to the first. All the like Sacramentall Speeches, in Scripture, are figuratively understood. SECT. III. IN all such like Sacramentall Speeches, both in the old and new Testament, wherein the Signe is coupled with the Thing signified, the Speech is ever unproper and Figurative, and the Verbe [Est] hath no other force than Signifieth. This Truth is confirmed a∣boundantly by the Testimonies of your owne Iesuites, and others, who come fraught with Examples. First, concerning the old Te∣stament, Noting that the Sacrifice of the Pascha significat transitum, quià An∣gelus transivit domos Israëlitarum: haec ra∣tio nominis reddi∣tur, cū dicitur, [Tran∣sibit enim Dominus cum viderit sanguinē in utroque poste.] Iansen. Epis. Concord. in Matth. 26. [It was therefore more then boldnes in Bellarmine, l. 1. de uch. cap. 11. §. Quaedam to say; Agn{us} erat propriè Transitus, Agnus being in the Predicament of Substance: and Transitus in the Predicament of A∣ction. Paschall Lambe, being but a signe, was called the Passeover, or passing over. Secondly, that Petra hoc in loco dicitur spiritualis, ex qua Deus eduxit per miraculum a quam, qui à signum fuit è latere Christi profluentis sanguinis & aquae. Salmeron Ies. in 1. Cor. 10. [Petra autem erat Christus.] Id est, Petra significabat Christum: ubi signum appellat nomine rei significatae. Perer. Ies. Com. in Dan. 2. p. 85. [Pe∣traerat Christus.] Erat autem Christus Petra, certissima scilicet significatione. Arias Mont. in 1. Cor. 10 & Pinta Ies. in s. 51. The Rocke, being but a signe of Christ, was called Christ. Third∣ly, that Circumcisio foedus dicitur, & signum foederis, Bellar. lib. . de Euch, c. 11. §. Secundò. Circumcision, being but a signe of the Covenant, was called the Covenant. So likewise in the new Testament, both concerning Christus cum Nicodemo spiritualiter intelligendus. Maldon. Ies. in eum locum Ioh 3. Baptisme, which in Christ his Speech to Nicodemus (being but a signe of Regeneration) is called Regeneration: And Sepuli lumus, Rom. 6. 4. id est, Christum sepultum repraesentamus. Tolet. Jes. in eum locum. Baptizing, which (being a Signe of the Buriall of Christ) in the speech of Saint Paul, is called Buriall. Finally, that the most proper Interpretation of the Verbe [Est,
Is,] in such like speeches, importeth no more, than [Significat,] your Iesuite Quòd verò in il∣lis Orationibus [Pe∣tra erat Christus; se∣menerat verbū Dei, Ego sum Ostium] ver∣bum substantivum sit interpretandum pro significat, aut figurat; non ei id accidit ex naturâ suâ, aut per se, sed quoniam Petra illa aliter cum Christo coniungi non potest, quam per signum—Inde sit, ut parvirefe∣rat siuè dicas, Petra erat signum Christi, vel significabat Christum. Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 16. §. Primum igi∣tur, p. 118. Salmeron will testifie for us: In these speeches (saith he) The seed is the Word, I am the Doore, The Rocke was Christ; the Verbe [Is, and WAS] must be interpreted for SIGNIFIETH, or figureth; not of it's owne nature, but because the word Rocke can∣not be otherwise ioyned with Christ, than by a figure or signe. So he. E∣ven as Master [Petra erat Christus.] Soletità exponi, Petra significabat Christum, id non ita ac∣cidit quòd verbum [Est] pro significat, ex se collocetur, sed quoniam [Petra] illa aliter cum Christo cohaerere, quam per similitudinem, & signum non potest. Sand. de Visib. Monar. ad Annum 1550. p. 141. Sanders also is compelled to confesse in a like Case. CHALLENGE. THus have we argued from Induction and Enumeration of Texts of Scripture, in all like Sacramentall Speeches: which Expo∣sition, by Analogy of Scriptures, was ever held of all Divines the most absolute and infallible manner of expounding the Scripture that can be. The Truth whereof arieseth essentially out of the Defi∣nition of a Sacrament, which as well the whole Catholique Church, as your Romish, hath defined to be a visible Signe. But no visible Signe can be ioyned to any thing signified thereby, in like Predication, without a Figure, as hath beene both copiously pro∣ved and confessed. Our third Proposition, viz. Many Figurative Speeches are used by Christ, even in his Words of Institution of this Sacrament; by your owne Confessions. SECT. IV. FIrst, your Iesuites (who otherwise shame not to call Prote∣stants, in scorne, Tropists, because they defend a Tropicall and Figurative sence in the speech of Christ) are notwithstanding con∣strained to acknowledge many figures in other words of Christ his Institution of this Sacrament, Lest that otherwise (as Maldonate and Suarez Si propriè loqui velim{us}, falsae sunt istae Propositiones, Cor∣pus Christi mandu∣catur à nobis, corpus Christi teritur, cor∣pus Christi devoratur, corpus Christi frangitur, quia ipsi modi, qui significantur his verbis, non conveniunt corpori Christi; Sacramentalis locuti esset, si corpus Christi dicertur frangi, aut dentibus teri: haec enim non possint, nisi Sacramento tenus intelligi, quia non propriè corpus Christi frangitur, sed Sacramentum. Mald. Ies. de Sacram. in gener. Tom. 1. §. Quapropter p. 144. & Com. in Matth. 26. Frangi cum dicitur, est Metaphorica locutio, quià fractiò propriè significat divisionem, & discontinuationem partium, quam constat non fieri in partibus corporis Christi. Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. dis. 47. Sect. 4. §. Exempla tertiae. pag. 577. confesse) the Speeches of Christ should be false: (as for example) When the body of Christ is said to be broken, or eaten, if they should be taken properly and without a figure called Metaphora.
So they. And so in the words following, [Body given for you] that is, which shall be offered for you on the Crosse. So your Iesuite Corpus quod pro vobis datur,] id est, quod offeretur pro vobis in Cruce mactatum. Valent. Ies. l. 1. de Missa. c. 3. §. I∣gitur. [Of the word Eate litterally false, so your Jesuites. See Booke 5. C. 4. §. 2.] Va∣lentia. Next, [The blood is shed for you] Matth. 26. It is not denied (saith your Iesuite Graecus Textus [Effunditur:] Non est negandum morem esse Scripturae, eam dicere jam esse, quae futurasit, ut hîc [Ef∣funditur] quià paulò post in Crace effun∣dendus. Salmer. Ies. in 1. Cor. 11. p. 154. Salmeron) but that it is the manner of Scripture, to speake of a thing, as now done, which is after to be done: as in this place, [Is shed] because very shortly after it was to be shed upon the Crosse. Which is the figure Enallage. Againe, [This Cup is the new Testament in my bloud.] Hearken to your Hic Calix est Novum Testamentū] Non potest accipi in proprio sensu, sed in eo quem clariora verba Matthaei & Marci indicant, & exigunt. Sivê enim Calix fumatur pro poculo potorio, fivè Synecdochicè pro sanguine in poculo contento, non potest consistere ut in ijs verbis sit propria lo∣cutio,—Nemo enim dixerit propriâ locutione vasculum illud potorium fuisse Testamentū Novum, cum incertum sit, an adhuc extet illud po∣culum; at Novum Testamentum est ae∣ternum: sed necsan∣guis in Calice con∣tentus potest esse no∣vum Testamentum, quià lex Evangelica in Epist. ad Hebr. di∣citur Novum Testa∣mētum, & apud Mat∣thaeum & Marcum, sanguis dicitur Novi Testamenti. At vnicum est Novum Testamentum: Ergo non est Novum Testamentum. Iansen. Conc. in cum locum, pag. 910. Bishop; These words cannot be taken properly, whether the Cup be taken for the vessell used for drinking, which was a temporall thing, and therefore could not be the Testament of Christ, which is eternall: or else whether you take it for the matter within the Cup (which is the figure Synecdoche) for, it being the blood of the new Testament, could not properly be the Te∣stament it selfe. Yea, your Iesuite Salmeron pointeth out in the same words a double Figure; Subest in his duplex Meronymia: 1. quia continens ponitur pro contento, id est, poculum siue Calix provino, eò quòd vinum in ipso continetur. 2. est, eò quòd contentum in poculo foedus vel Testam entum dicitur Novum, cum sit eius symbolum propter species—Testamentum hoc in loco potest sumi prolege Evangelicâ, quae veteri legi opponitur, vel vtrem Te∣stamento legatam testatamuè significet. Quemadmodum Haeres dicere solet, Hic fundus est testamen∣tum patris mei, id est, porto haereditatis à patre meo legata; in quem sensum loquitur A postolus ad Hebr. Ie∣fus est sponsor melioris testamenti, id est, haereditatis. Salm. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract 15. §. Tertio p. 98. A double figure (saith hee) the Cup being put for the thing contained in the Cup: and Testament being ta∣ken for the Legacy that is granted, and given by the Testament. With whom your Iesuite Testa∣mentum sumitur prolegato Metonymicè. continens testamentum sumitur pro contento legato, seu haereditate, quae testamento continetur. Barrad. l. 3. de Euch. c. 5. p. 79. Tom. 4. Barradius doth consent. Hereunto may be added that in the sixt of Iohn, where Christ calling that which he giveth to be eaten, his flesh, in the same Chap∣ter he calleth his flesh, which is to be eaten of the Faithfull, bread: which none of your side durst hitherto interpret without a Figure. And yet againe, the Apostle speaking of the Mysticall body of Christ, which is his Church, assembled at the holy Communion, to par∣ticipate of this Sacrament, saith of them, 1. Cor. 10. 17. Wee being many are one bread, and one body: for we are all partakers of that one bread. But why? Even as one bread consisteth of many cornes, so doth one Church of Christ of many faithfull persons, saith your Sicut vnus panis ex multis granis, &c. Aquinas in eum locum. Aquinas. Wee may not forget what your Iansenius said of See above Booke . cap. 3. §. 8. Drinking; To whome Master Master Brereley Liturg. Tract. 4. §. 8. Brereley is ready to yeild his assent, saying; If we should attend to the Propriety of speech, neither is his blood proper∣ly drunke out of the Chalice, but onely the forme of Wine, seeing the blood hath the same manner of Existing, as under the forme of bread, to wit, not divided, nor seperated from the body, but included in the veines, and then in the body. Doe you not heare? Christ's Blood is not properly drunke; if not properly, then figuratively; as figurative∣ly as if one, swallowing the body of Christ, should be said to drinke his Body. Wee aske Master Brereley, what then is that which is
properly drunke out of the Chalice? and he saith, onely the forme of Wine, that is to say, a meere Accident. Hardly can it be said that a man properly drinketh the Aire, which he breatheth, although it be a Substance; And are you brought to believe meere Formalities, to be truly Potable? But to the point.

REpeat now the Premises; One figure in the word [Bread:] an∣other in [Eat:] a third in [Given:] a fourth in [Shed:] a fift in [Cup:] a sixt in [Testament:] so many words confessed to be so many Figures in the very words of Christ his Institution; beside other-more of the same equivalencie touching the Body of Christ, both naturall, Ioh. 6. and also mysticall, which is his Church, 1. Cor. 10. It can be no lesse then a matter of great astonishment to us, to see our Romish Adversaries with such pertinacie to condemne Protestants for holding the Sacramentall speeches of Christ to be fi∣gurative, calling them Tropists; when as they themselves are con∣strained to acknowledge no fewer then Six Tropes in Christ his words, as you have heard. Of your Cardinall his Objection, from the word See heereafter. Booke 6. Chap. 1. §. 2. Shed hereafter. That the figurative sence of Christ's words is agreeable to the Iudgement of the more Ancient Church of Rome. SECT. V. YOur old and publique Romish Glosse saith plainly; Coeleste Sacra∣mentum, quod verè representat Christi carnem, dicitur Cor∣pus Christi, sed im∣propriè, unde dicitur suo more, sed non rei veritate, sed significā∣te mysterio: ut sit sensus, vocatur Cor∣pus Christi, id est, sig∣nificatur. Gloss. De∣cret. de Consecrat. dist. . Can. Hoc est. This hea∣venly Sacrament, because it doth truly represent the flesh of Christ, is called the body of Christ, but improperly, not in the truth of the thing, but in the mysticall Sence, to wit, it is called the body of Christ, that is, it signifieth his Body. So your Glosse, which you may not deny to be the glosse or Tongue of your whole Church, because it hath beene confirmed by the same Authority of Pope Gregorius XIII. Papa. In the priviledge before the body of the Canon Law. Gregory the thirteenth, wherewith your Extravagants and former Decrees of Popes have beene Authorised. CHALLENGE. IF all Protestants should meeteat once in one Synod, and should conspire together, as labouring to prove a figurative Sence in these words of Christ [This is my body,] I suppose that a more ex∣act, perspicuous, copious, and ponderous Proofe could not be de∣fined, then hitherto hath beene evinced from your owne Confes∣sions; grounded as well upon sound and impregnable Reasons, as upon direct Testimonies of holy Scriptures.
That the former Figurative Sence of the words of Christ is a∣greeable to the Iudgement of Antient Fathers, of the Greeke Church. SECT. VI. YOu wil needs defend your litterall Exposition by the verdict of Ancient Fathers, and we appeale to the Venerable Senate both of Greeke and Latine Fathers.

And one as expressly as any Protestant can speake (even Theodoret by name) that Christ here gave to the Signe the name of his Body, as elswhere he gave to his Body the name of the Signe. You cannot deny but these Phrases of Signes and Sym∣bols are most frequent in the writings of all the Greeke Fathers, which we take to be a convincing Argument, vntill you can give us some reasonable Solution hereunto. To this purpose you, leaving the principall Obiections, fasten onely upon certaine Crotchets, and thereupon you bestirre your selves. THE FIRST CHALLENGE, Against the first Romish Answere, touching the word Type and Antitype, vsed by the Greeke Fathers. THree kinds of Answeres have beene applyed, as Three wedges to dissolve this difficulty; but a knot of wood cannot be loosed with a wedge of waxe, such as every of your Answeres will ap∣peare to be. The first interpreting Types and Antitypes not to be taken for Signes, but for Examples, is at the first hearing reiected by your Prima solutio; Vocem Antitypon non accipi pro signo, sed pro Exemplari, &c. sed haec opinio facilè reijci potest, quià vox ea nunquam sumitur pro exem∣plar. Bel. l. 2. de Euch. cap. 15. Cardinall, and others. The Second, alleadged out of Damascen, and much insisted upon by some favourers of your Romish Sence; namely, that the Fathers should call Bread and Wine Antitypes; but not after Conse∣cration. So they. And if so, then indeed we should have no cause to oppose. But this Answere is proved to be apparantly false by

This our Obiection how strong it is, may be seene by your much, but vaine strugling. Your quaintest device is yet behind. A SECOND CHALLENGE, Against the last, and most peremptory Romish Pretence, ma∣king Christ in this Sacrament to figure, and to represent himselfe, as a King in a Stage-play. THe Solution, which seemeth to your Disputers most perswa∣sive, is thus set downe by your Cardinall, and your Iesuite Suarez, viz. Solutio, Eucha∣ristiam etiam post Consecrationem di∣ci posse Antitypum corporis & sanguinis Domini, non solùm quia species panis & vini sunt figurae cor∣poris & sanguinis Domini ibi rever a existentium, sed eti∣am quià corpus & sanguis Domini, ut sunt sub illis specie∣bus, signa sunt ejus∣dem corporis & san∣guinis, ut fuerunt in-Cruce, repraesentant enim passioné Chri∣sti: & ideò fortassis Basilius & alij Patres non vocant Eucharistiam figuram aut typum, sed Antitypum &c.—It à si Rex aliquis, gravissimo bello confecto, idem ipsum bellum ad oblectamentum populo in scen â praesens seipsum bellantem representare vellet.

Billar. lib. 1. de Sacram. in genere cap. 9. The Greeke Fathers called Bread and Wine Antitypes and Signes of the Body and Blood of Christ, because the same Body and Blood of Christ, as they are in this Sacrament vnder the forme of Bread and Wine, are signes of the same his Body and Blood, as they were on the Crosse. Like as a King, who having gotten a victory in battell, should represent himselfe in a Stage-Play, as in a fight. So They. But with∣out any Sentence of any Father, for countenancing so egregious a figment; so farre were those Greeke Fathers from urging that counterfeit Testimony, which passeth vnder the name of S. Au∣gustine, as if hee had said; The flesh of Christ is a Sacrament of his flesh: and inferring from hence, that The Body of Christ, as it is in this Sacrament, is a Signe of it selfe as it was upon the Crosse. And they are no small Babes, who vent out this proofe; by name Billius com. in Nazianz. orat. 11. Audiamus quid Augustinus dicit in Prosperi sententijs; Caro inquit, ius est, quam formâ panis opertam in Sacramento accipimus; sanguis, quem sub specie vini potamus; Caro, viz. carnis, & sanguis Sacramentum est sanguinis; carne & sanguine utro{que} invisibili, & intelligibili, & spiri∣tuali significatur corpus Christi visibile, plenum gratiae, & divinae Maiestatis.

Whither next? for∣sooth it is so cited by Peter Lombard, and there it appeareth that Peter Lombard had it out of his supposed Brother Grati∣an; wee say, Gratian, whose bookes have beene lately repro∣ved, and condemned by one of your Antonius Augu∣stinus Archiepiscopus Tarracon.

Gratian, who are the Relators, may be admitted to be the Interpreters of that coyned Sentence, they will say that the word Flesh, there specified, is taken for the Shape of flesh; and the word Blood, for the outward forme of Blood; which spoyleth your Play quite: wherein you will have the Flesh of Christ under the outward formes and shape in this Sacrament, and not the outward formes and shape themselves, to be the Signe of the same Body on the Crosse. So easie it is for Hunters to pursue their Game with loud cries upon a false sent. Wee returne to your Cardinall, and to Suarez, who invented the Similitvde of the Stage-Play for their Answere, which is indeed rather a Childish Playing, then Theologicall reasoning; yet it is but a mad sport to argue against Conscience; as this your Cardi∣nall must needs have done, who See above at (c.) confessing that the Greeke Fathers did therefore call Sacraments, Antitypes, because of the great Simili∣tude they have with the things they represent; yet now adventureth to say, that the Body of Christ, as it is in the Eucharist, is a Signe of the same Body of Christ, as it was upon the Crosse; notwithstan∣ding the Body of Christ, as it is in the Sacrament, (according to your owne faith) is so Christi corpus, ut est in hoc Sacra∣mento, nullo oculo humano, vel intellectu Angelico videri potest.

That the onely Obiection out of the Greeke Fathers, concerning the Pronoune [HOC] in the Testimony of Epiphanius, advantageth not the Romish Cause. SECT. VII.

Hic sanc locus omninò convincit, nam quod dicit, oportet credere ipsum esse verum, excludit Tropos, praesertim cum addat, excider à Salute qui non credit: quod etiam ad dit credendum esse, licet sensus repugnent, apertissime testatur, non eum loqui de significatione, sed de reipsa. [words to be observed in the Greeke are these. . [The last words shew that Insensible is taken according to power, that is actively] Obiection, and our Answere, and then make your owne de∣termination, as you shall thinke good. Man is said to be made after the Image of God. Epiphanius, not able to define what this Image consisted in, whether it be man's soule, or minde, or virtue; not∣withstanding resolveth that c All men haue the image of God in them, but yet not according to nature, (namely, that substantiall nature which is in God) because God is Incomprehensible and infinite, &c. This is the maine point which Epiphanius will now illustrate; but how? By something (saith your Cardinall) which seemeth to be that which it is not: And Epiphanius instanceth in the Eucharist, where∣in Christ taking into his hands those things which the Evangelists doe mention, he said of the one [HOC] This is mine, viz. Body; and of the other, This is mine, viz. Blood: hereby understanding (saith your Obiector) The Eucharist, which is truely the Body of Christ, although it seeme not to be so, outwardly, being of a round figure, and Insensible, and therfore farre vnlike to be the Body of Christ. So he. who, think∣ing he hath overcome, doth raise up his Iō, and Triumph, saying; This argument is throughly convincent, because Epiphanius addeth, He who believeth not the words of Christ, doth fall from Saluation: adding further, that they are to be believed, although our senses gain-say it. You have heard the Obiection, which seeming to so great a Champion so greatly Convincent, you will give us licence to make a full Answere. First, by HOC ET HOC, THIS AND THIS (by the Interpretation of Epiphanius) are meant, The things which the Evangelist did mention; and the Evangelist men∣tioned (as you know) Bread [He tooke Bread, Hee tooke the Cup:] meaning Wine in the Cup, namely, according to the See above, Chap. 1 § 6. former ge∣nerall Consent of the Fathers, HOC signified Bread, in one part of the Eucharist, and Wine in the other; But Bread neither in the Substance, nor in the Accidents can be called Christ's Bodie without a Trope, as hath beene See above, Chap. 1. §. 4. Confessed: which is our first con∣futation
of your Cardinall, who concludeth that Epiphanius ex∣cludeth all Tropes out of Christ's speech of [HOC.] Secondly, THIS, in the words of Christ, hath neither equality of Proportion, nor yet similitude of forme or figure. (being round) with the body of Christ, as Epiphanius willeth us to observe. Which confuteth the Assump∣tion of your Cardinall, affirming that Epiphanius sought in the Eu∣charist a similitude of a Thing, which seemed to be that which it is not; Albeit Epiphanius expresly sheweth, that there is no outward similitude betweene This and This spoken of, that is to say Bread and Wine, and that which is called, Mine, and Mine, namely, The Body and Blood of Christ. Thirdly, This spoken of by Christ (in the Iudgement of Epiphanius) as it is Round in figure, so is it , Insensible; but not passively, as not perceiveable by sence, (for then it could not be said to be Round, which with other outward Accidents are sensible to your selves,) but actively In∣sensible, as not having power sensibly to perceive: which betoke∣ning Bread or the Accidents of bread (as you see it doth) confir∣meth unto us the Tropicall speech of Christ, in calling Bread his Body; and consequently overthroweth your whole Cause. Fourth∣ly, the Similitude of Epiphanius must stand thus; That which is said to be after the Image of God, is such, which hath a substantiall being, yet so that it be like, but not the same in nature: And so is Bread, having a Sacramentall Analogie to Christ's Body, the first as the substantiall meate of man's Body, and the other as the super∣substantiall food of Man's Soule. Which Conclusion, namely, that Bread, as the signe of Christ's Body, is not the same in nature with Christ's Body, doth dash out the braines of the Monster Transubstantiation; by the which, Bread (as your Tridentine Faith teacheth) is wholly changed into the substantiall nature of Christ's Body. As if you would have Epipha∣nius to have said, The Image of God in man, is God in nature. Thus doe you find the Testimony of Epiphanius to be Convincent in∣deed, but against your Romish Doctrine, of Errour; and against your Cardinall, of a foule falsity, who saith that Epiphanius will have us to believe something herein, although it be repugnant to our Sences: which word no man of Sence can find in Epiphanius. He saith, indeed, that every man is bound upon his Salvation to believe the Truth of Christ his Speech; which say wee none but an Infidell can deny, because Christ being Truth it selfe, therefore all the words of Christ, whether spoken Literally or Tropically, they are still the Truth of Christ. That the same Greeke Fathers have expresly vnfolded their meanings, touching a Figurative Sence. SECT. VIII. THe Iudgement of a whole Councell of Greeke Fathers may well suffice for the manifestation of the Iudgement of that
Church; They in Constantinople at Trullo, alluding to these words of Christ, [This is my Body] saying, Let nothing be offered, but the Body and Blood of Christ, that is (say In sanctis nihil plus quàm corpus & sanguis Christi of∣feratur, ut ipse Do∣minus tradidit, hoc est panis & vinum, a∣quâ mixtum. Concil. Constant. apud Binium [which Canon was made against the A∣quarij (those who would use no wine) Can. 32.] They) Bread and Wine, &c. If we had not told you that this had been the speech of Greeke Fathers in a Councell, you would have conceived they had beene ut∣tered by some Heretique, as your Charity useth to cal us Protestants. Neither may the Authority of this Councell be rejected by you, as unlawfull in the point of the Sacrament, both because it is obje∣cted by your selves, to prove it an vnbloody Sacrifice (whereunto you are See hereafter in the Sixt Booke, C. 5. §. 9 answered) as also for that your Binius, in opposing against some things in this Councell, yet neuer tooke any Exception a∣gainst this Canon. We may not let passe another Testimony used by the Antient Fa∣ther See above, §. 6. (x.) Theodoret, namely, That Christ called the Bread his Body, as he called his Body Bread, Matth. 12. saying thereof, Except the grane of wheat die, &c. insomuch that Interchangeably in the one place He gave to the Signe the name of his Body, and in the other, He gave to his Body the name of the Signe. So hee. As Protestantly as either Calvin or Beza could speake. And you cannot deny, but that when Christ called his Body Bread, it was an improper and figurative speech. And therefore, if you will believe Theodoret, you are com∣pellable to confesse, that Christ, in calling Bread his Body, meant it not in a proper and literall sence. Hitherto of the Greeke Fathers. That the same Figurative sence of Christ's words is avouched by the Latine Fathers. SECT. IX. SOme of the Latine Fathers (we confesse) seeme in some places to deny all Figurative sence, but this they doe even by a figure called As is afterwards many wheres discove∣red. Hyperbole, that is, onely in the excesse of Speech, thereby to abstract the minds of sensuall men from fixing their thoughts upon externall Rites, and to rayse them up to a Sacramentall and Spirituall Contemplation of the Body and Blood of Christ. But as for the direct and perspicuous Sentences of these Fathers, they cleerely and exactly teach a figurative sence in the words of Christ, to wit, Tertull. contra Marcion. l. 4. Id est, fi∣gura corporis. p. 291. Tertullian, [This is my Body:] That is a figure thereof. Cyprian. Srm de Vnct. Et significantia, & significata ijsdem vocabulis censeren∣tur.

Sacramenta propter similitudinem earum rerum, quas repraesentant, plerunque etiam ipsarum rerum nomina accipiunt; Sicut ergo secundum quendam modum Sacramentum Corporis Christi, Corpus Christi, & Sacra∣mentum sanguinis Christi, Sanguis Christi, it à Sacramentum fidei fides est.—Sicut de ipso baptismo ait, Con∣sepulti sumus per baptismum in mortem Christi, non dicit, sepulturam significamus, sed prorsus ait consepulti sumus. Sacramentum igitur tantae rei non nisi eiusdem rei vocabulo nuncupavit. [And Interpreting that which he called Fidei Sacramentum, He saith, Respondetur, Parvulum baptizatum credere propter fidei Sacramentum.] Saint Augustine in many places may be unto
Vs instar multorum: To eate the flesh of Christ (saith he) is a figura∣tive speech. Againe. In the banquet, Christ gave to his Disciples the signe of his Body. And yet againe, Christ doubted not to say, This is my Body, when he gave a signe of his Body. Lastly (unanswerably) proving other Sacraments to agree with this, in this point, and that herein the Eucharist hath no Prerogative above the rest; Sa∣craments (saith he) for the very Similitude and likenesse, which they have with the things whereof they are Sacraments, doe often take the names of those things, which they doe signifie; as when the Sacrament of Christ's Body (saith he) is after a certaine manner called the Body of Christ. But how? Hee addeth (as if hee had meant to stop the mouthes of all Opposites,) As it is said by the Apostle of Baptisme [we are buried by Baptisme into the death of Christ] He saith not, wee signifie his buriall, but absolutely saith, [Wee are buried:] there∣fore hath he called the Sacrament or Signe of so great a Thing by the name of the Thing signified thereby. So he, even the same He who will be found like himselfe in the following passages of this Booke, especially when we shall handle the manner of Eating of Christ's bo∣dy, which Augustine will Afterwards Chap. 3. §. 6. Challenge to be figuratively meant. We shall take our farewell of the Latine Fathers, in the Testi∣mony of Bishop Isid. Hispalen: Panis, quem fran∣gimus corpus Chri∣sti est, qui dicit, Ego sum panis vivus, &c. Vinum autem san∣guis eius est, & hoc est quod scriptum est, Ego sum vitis vera: Sed panis, quia con∣firmat corpus ideò corpus Christi nun∣cupatur, vinum au∣tem quià sanguinem operatur in carne, i∣deò ad sanguinem Christi refertur.—Haec autem sunt vi∣sibilia, sanctificata tamen per Spiritum Sanctum, in Sacra∣mentum divini cor∣poris transeunt. l. 1. de offic. c. 18. Isidore, who will give you his owne Reason, why Christ called Bread his Body: Bread (saith he) because it streng∣theneth the body, is therefore called the body of Christ, and Wine be∣cause it maketh Blood is therefore referred to Christ's Blood: but these two, being sanctified by the Holy Ghost, are changed into a Sacrament of the body and blood of Christ. So he: and so say we. Accordingly Tertullian; but (least any may Cavill, as some doe, at his sentence above-cited) wee adde his other sentence, wherein he Tert. advers. Mar∣cion. l. 3. p. 180 er. 11. [Venite, mittamus lignum in panem e∣ius.] Vti{que} in corpus, sic enim Deus in E∣vangelio, panem cor∣pus suum appellans: ut & hinc iam intelli∣gas corporis sui figu∣ram panem dedisse, cuius retò corpus in panem Propheta fi∣guravit. sheweth that Christ called Bread his Body in saying, [This is my body] as the Prophet Ieremy called his Body Bread, in saying, Let us put wood upon his Bread, meaning his Body. So Tertullian, shewing them both to be spoken equally in a figurative Sence. CHALLENGE. THese Sentences of these holy Fathers are so fully Consonant to the Doctrine of Protestans, as that, if the names of these Fathers had beene concealed, our Reader might thinke that hee heard, Bucer, Calvin, or Beza speake. Goe you now and pro∣claime, that all Ancient Fathers teach your Litterall sence of Christ his words, and perswade your selves, if you can, that any man of Conscience and Iudgement can be seduced to believe you. They say, indeed, that Bread is the Body of Christ: and why might they not use the same Tenure of Speech, which our Lord Christ used before them? But they say also that Bread is therefore called his Body, as being an outward Sacrament, Signe, and Figure of his Body; seeing that every Sacrament, being a Signe or Figure, the
Sacramentall Speech must necessarily be Figurative; as hath beene proved by Scripture, as in all other Sacraments, so likewise in the severall confessed Figurative words of Christ concerning this Sa∣crament, in six severall Instances. This one Argument of it selfe hath beene tearmed by Master Calvin [Murus ahaeneus,] that is, a brazen Wall; and so will it be found more evidently to be, when you shall perceive the same Fathers Lib. 3. through∣out. judging that, which they call Change into Christ's flesh, to be but a Change into the Sacrament of his flesh, Bread still remayning the same: and teaching that Melchise∣dech offered in his Sacrifice the Body and Blood of Christ, when he offered onely the Types of both; in the Lib. 6. Chap. 3. §. 2. Sixt Booke. And now we are to with-stand your Paper-bullets, wherewith you vainely at∣tempt, in your Objections following, to batter our Defence withal. CHAP. III. The Romish Obiections, against the Figurative Sence, Answered. The first Obiection. SECT. I. NOthing useth to be more properly and simply spoken, (say Primum Argu∣mentum sumitur à materiâ, est enim materia, de quâ hic agitur, Pactum, Sa∣cramentum, Testa∣mentum Novum: fuisse à Domino institutum patet ex illis verbis [Hic est calix Novi Testamenti in sanguine meo]—I am verò nihil solet magis propriè, simplicitèr, aut exquisitè explicari quàm Testamentum, nè viz. detur occasio litigandi. Pacta seu foedera sunt etiam ex codemgenero, quae exquisitissimè & proprijs verbis ex∣plicantur, nèlocus ullus relinquatur cavillis. Sacramentum hoc effe, de quo agitur, nemo negat,—Sacramen∣tum autem solere à Deo institui proprijs verbis, ut in corum usu non erretur. Bellar. l. 1. de Euch. c. 9. §. Primùm & §. Deindè. & §. Porrò Sacramentum. you) than words of Testaments and Covenants. Ergò this being a Testamentary Phrase must be taken in the literall Sence. CHALLENGE. WHat is this? are Figurative speeches never used in Cove∣nants, and Testamentary Language? or is there not there∣fore sufficient perspicuity in Figures? This is your rash and lavish Assertion, for you your selves doe teach that In ipsâ Scrip∣turâ dicitur Testa∣mentum & Instru∣mentum—Quia pa∣cta Dei & foedera ini∣ta nobiscum conti∣nent, ut patet in pa∣cto Circumcisionis cum Abrahamo.—Ante omnia praefamur S. Scripturam uti Metaphoris, non solum ob utilitatem nostram, sed etiam propter necessitatem, à pluribus Patribus traditur. Sacram Scripturam de Deo, de Trinitate, de Patre, Filio, & Spiritu Sancto, proprie loqui non posse,—Quandò sermo est de vitâ aeternâ, & praemio filiorum Dei, claris rebus comparatur, per Tropos est explicandus.—ut August. ait, Nullogenere locutionis, quod in consutudine humanâ reperitur, Scripturae non utuntur, quià utique hominibus loquuntur. Salmer. Ies. Proleg. l. 1. p. 3. & 4. & lib. 21. p. 371, & 227, 229, 231, 234. The Old and New Testament are both full fraught with multitude of Tropes and Figures,
and yet are called Testaments. Secondly, That the Scripture, speaking of the Trinity and some divine things, cannot but speake improperly and figuratively. Thirdly, That Sacramentall speeches, as, [The Rocke was Christ,] and the like words are See above, Chap. 2 Sect. 3. (e,) Tropicall and Figurative. Fourthly, That even in the Testamentary Speech of Christ, at his Institution of this Sacrament, saying, [This Cup is the New Testa∣ment in my Blood:] there is a Figure in the very word See above, Chap. 2 Sect. 4. (p. q.) Testament. So have you confessed, and so have you consequently confuted your owne Obiection. Hereto might be added the Testament of Iacob, prophesying of his sonnes, and saying, Gen 49. Reuben is my strength: Iudah a Lions Whelpe: Issachar a strong Asse: Danan Adder in the way. All fi∣gurative Allusions. Nay, no man in making his Testament can call it his Will, or say that he hath set his hand and Seale unto it, with∣out Figures: Namely, that he hath given by writing a Significati∣on of his Will; that the Subscription was made by his Hand; and that he added unto it the Print of his Seale. These Three, Will, Hand, Seale, every word Figuratiue, even in a Testament. The Second Romish Obiection, against the Fi∣gurative Sence. SECT. II. LAwes and Precepts (say Verba Legum & praeceptorum debēt esse propria. Bellar. l. 1 de Euch. c. 9. §. Sequi∣tur. you) should be in plaine and proper words. But in the Speech of Christ, [Take, eate you, &c.] are words of Command. Ergò, They may not be held Figurative. CHALLENGE. CAn you be Ignorant of these Figurative Precepts, viz. of Pul∣ling out a man's owne eye, of cutting off his hand? Matth. 5. Or yet of a Penitents Renting of his heart? Ioel 2. Or of not harde∣ning his heart? Psal. 95. and the like. Christ commanded his Dis∣ciples to prepare for his keeping the Passeover with his Disciples, and the Disciples prepared the Passeover as Iesus commanded them, saith the Luc. 22. 8. Evangelist. In this Command is the word [Passeover.] We demand, The word, Passeover, (which is taken for the Sacra∣ment and Signe of the Passeover) is it taken figuratively? You cannot deny it. And can you deny that a Commandement may be delivered under a Figurative Phrase? You can both, that is, say and gaine-say any thing, like false Merchants, onely so farre as things may, or may not make for your owne Advantage. But (to catch you in your owne snare) your Doctrine of Conco∣mitancy is this, viz. Bread, being turned into Christ's Body, is ioynt∣ly turned into whole Christ; and Wine, being changed into his blood, is likewise turned into whole Christ, both flesh and blood. If
then when Christ commanded his Disciples, saying, [Matth. 26. 27. Drinke you All of this,] that which was Drunke was the whole substantiall Body of Christ, either must his Disciples be said to have Drunke Christ's Body properly, or else was the Command of Christ figura∣tively spoken. To say the first, contradicteth the universall expres∣sion of man's speech in all Languages; for no man is said to drinke Bread or any solid thing. And to grant the Second, that the speech is Figurative, contradicteth your owne Objection. Againe, Christ commanded to Eate his Body; yet notwithstanding have Three See above, Chap. 2 §. 4. (l.) Iesuites already confessed that Christ's Body cannot be said to have beene properly Eaten, but figuratively onely. What fascination then hath perverted your Iudgements, that you cannot but still con∣found your selves, by your contrary and thwarting languages? Your Third Romish Obiection. SECT. III. DOctrinall and Dogmaticall speeches (say Praecipua dog∣mata &c. Bellar. quo sup. §. Denota. you) ought to be di∣rect and literall: But these words, [This is my Body] are Do∣ctrinall. CHALLENGE. A Man would maruaile to heare such silly and petty Reasons to be propounded by those, who are accounted great Clerkes, and those who know full well that the speech of Christ, concer∣ning Castrating or gelding of a man's selfe, is Abulē in cum loc. Christus non laudat eos qui castrârunt se, sed qui se cast ant, concupiscentiam ab∣scindedo—ut Chrys. Non membrorum ab∣scisione sed malarum cogitationum incre∣patione: maledictio∣ni nempè obnoxius, qui membrum sibi abscindit. Idem ha∣bet Hier. Addit Chry∣sost. super Matth. Ab∣scissis viilbus non tollitur cōcupiscen∣tia; Concupiscentia inde fit molestior. Doctrinall, and teacheth Mortification; and yet is not literally to be understood, as you all know by the literall errour of Idem. Origines seipsum castravit, ut posset liberius prae∣dicae tempore Per∣secutionis, & suri{us} esse inter foeminas. Abul. super Matth. 5. qu. 250. p. 326. Origen, who did really Castrate himselfe. And the same Origen, who thus wounded him∣selfe by that literall Exposition, in his youth, Hee in his Age, ex∣pounding the words of Christ, concerning the Eating of his flesh, said of the literall sence thereof, that, Origen. Littera hae occidit. in Levit. Hom. 7. It killeth. Secondly, these words [This is the New Testament in my blood,] they are wordes as Doctrinall as the other [This is my body:] and yet figurative, by your owne See above Chap. 2. §. 4. Confession. Thirdly, the words of Christ, Ioh. 6. of Eating his flesh are Doctrinall; and yet by your owne Verus & literalis Sensus horū verborū non est quòd caro Christi nihil prodest, sed quod carnalis intelligen∣tia nihil prodest, ut exponunt Chrys. Theophyl. Euthem. Origen. Cyprian, & alij: vocatur enim eo in loco, no∣mine carnis, humana & carnalis cogitatio, ut distinguitur a spirituali cogitatione. Bellar. l. 1. de Euch. c. 14. §. Sed praeterea. Con∣struction, are not to be properly vnderstood, but as Christ after∣wards expounds himselfe Spiritually. Fourthly, where Christ thus said, The bread, which I shall give, is my flesh, Ioh. 6. 51. he saith also of his Body, that it is True bread, Verse 32. and bread of life, Verse 48. and living bread, whereof whosoever eateth liveth eter∣nally, Verse 51. All, Divine and Doctrinall Assertions, yet was his
body figuratively called bread. Fiftly, that in those words of Christ to Peter, Matth. 16. Vpon this Rocke will I build my Church; And, To thee will I give the keyes of the Kingdome of Heaven; And Ioh. 21. Feed my Sheepe; (In which texts of Scripture you place, although most falsly, your Doctrinall foundation of Popedome it selfe:) yet know you all these to be Tropicall Speeches. Yea and what say you to the first Doctrinall Article, and foundation of Christian Do∣ctrine, delivered by God unto man, in the beginning, Gen. 3. 15. The seed of the woman shall breake the Serpents head? Is not the latter part of the Article altogether Figurative, yet signifying this Doctrinall point, even the vanquishing of the power of Satan? Your Fourth Romish Obiection. SECT. IV. THe Apostles (saith your Bell. Apostoli ru∣des & simplices erarie &c. Lib. 1 de Euch. 6. 9. §. Argumentum se∣cundum. Cardinall) were rude and simple, Therefore needed to be Instructed by Christ in plaine tearmes, without Figures. So he. CHALLENGE. ANd yet Christ, you know, did often speake Figuratively unto them, talking of Bread, Leaven, Seed, &c. And stiling them the Salt of the earth; yea even in this Sacrament (as hath beene confessed) in the words, Eate, Shed, Testament. Another Iesuite witnesseth, that Apostoli à Chri∣sto edocti fuerunt, & illuminati, ut cum summâ reerētiâ Sa∣cramentum hoc sus∣ciperent. Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. Disp. 46▪ §. 3. The Apostles were illuminated and instructed by Christ; that they might receive this Sacrament with all Reverence. So he. Therefore are they but rudely by you tearmed Rude; and the rather because They (who being commanded to prepare the Passe∣over, perceived that by Passeover was figuratively vnderstood the Paschall Lambe, and thereupon prepared the Passeover, according to the Lord's Command) could not be ignorant, that in this like Sacramentall speech [This is my body] the Pronoune [THIS] did literally point out bread, and figuratively signifie Christ's bodie. Doubtlesse, if the manner of Christ's speech in the Eucharist had not beene like the other in the Passeover, they would have desired Christ to explaine his meaning, as they did sollicitously in other doubts. Their last Romish Obiection. SECT. V. VVE are never to let passe the Literall Sence (saith your Nunquàm dimit∣camus proprium ver∣borum sensum, nisi cogamur ab aliquâ a∣liâ Scripturâ, &c. Bell. l. 1. de Euch, Cap. 9. §. Vltimò. Car∣dinall) except we be compelled thereunto by some Scripture, or by some Article of Faith, or by some common Interpretation of the whole Church. So he.
CHALLENGE. SVrely nor we, without some one of these; but that you may know the grounds of our perswasion to be more than one, or yet all These; And how bountifully we shall deale with you, we shall shew in the Proposition following. Ten Reasons, for proofe of the Necessity of interpreting the word of Christ Figuratively. SECT. VI. FIrst, We have beene compellable to allow a Figurative Sence by the consessed Analogie of Scripture, in all such Sacramentall Speeches of both Testaments, concerning Circumcision, Rocke, Baptisme; as also that speech of Christ, Ioh. 6. Except you eate the flesh of the Sonne of man, as you have See above C. 2. §. 3. heard. Secondly, We are Challengable hereunto by our See hereafter, B. 6. Chap. 3. §. 10. Article of Faith, which teacheth but one naturall Body of Christ, and the same to Remayne now in Heaven. Thirdly, We are inforced, for feare of such See hereafter, B. 8. Chap. 4. Heresies as have followed in other Cases, upon the literall sence; for it was not the Figurative but the literall and proper sence of being borne againe, by Baptisme, (lob. 3.) that begat the errour of Nicodemus; and the like literall sence of God's Eyes, Hands, Feet, &c. brought forth the Anthropomorphites; And so was it the literall sence of those words in the Canticles [Tell me where thou lyest at noone] which deluded the Donatists; and of Origen you have heard, that hee by the literall sense of these wordes, [Some there be that castrate them∣selves, &c.] did fondly wrong himselfe. Fourthly, Wee are necessarily mooved, to reject your literall sence, by a confessed Impossibility, taught by that Vniversall Ma∣xime, See above Chap. 1. §. 4. Disparatum de disparato, &c. shewing that Bread, being of a different nature from flesh, can no more possibly be called the flesh or Body of Christ, literally, than Lead can be called Wood. Fiftly, We are perswaded hereunto by the former alleadged In∣terpretation of the Ancient Fathers, both of the Greeke and Latine Church, calling the Sacrament a Figure; and expounding [This is] by [This signifieth.] Sixtly, Wee are urged by the Rule set downe by Saint Augustine, for the direction of the whole Catholique Church; that, Si praeceptiva lo∣cutio flagitium aut facinus videtur iube∣re, figurata est, ut [ni∣si māducaveritis car∣nem meam] facinus videtur iubere, ergo figura est, praecipiens passioni Domini esse communicandum, & suaviter, ac utiliter recolendum in me∣moria, quià pro nobis caro ius crucifixa, & vulnerata it, August. de Doctrina Christ. l. 3. c. 16. Whensoever the precept (saith he) seemeth to com∣mand that which is hainous (as to eate the flesh of Christ) it is figura∣tive. And of this Sacrament doth not Christ say, Take, Eate, This is my body? Seventhly, A Motive it must needs be to any reasona∣ble man, to defend the figurative sence, by observing the misery of your Disputers, in contending for a literall Exposition thereof; because their Objections have beene confuted by your owne Do∣ctors,
and by Truth it selfe, even the holy Scriptures. Eightly, your owne Vnreasonablenesse may perswade somewhat, who have not beene able, hitherto, to confirme any one of your five former Ob∣iections to the contrary, by any one Father of the Church. Ninth∣ly, For that the literall Interpretation of Christ's wordes was the foundation of the Heresie of the Capernaites, and hath affinitie with divers other See the last Booke Chap. 2. §. the last. Ancient Heresies condemned by Antiquitie. Tenthly, Our last perswasion is the consent of Antiquity against the literall conversion of Bread into Christ's body (which you call Transubstantiation) against the Literall Corporall Presence, against Literall Corporall Eating, and Vnion, and against a proper Sacrifice of Christ's body Subiectively. All which are fully perswasive Induce∣ments to inforce a figurative sence, as the sundry Bookes follow∣ing will cleerely demonstrate from point to point. CHALLENGE. YOu may not passe over the consideration of these points, by calling them Schoole-subtilties, and Logicall Differences, as Master Fisher lately hath done; thinking by this his slie Sophi∣strie, craftily to draw the mindes of Romish Professors from the due discovery of your Romish false literall Exposition of Christ's words, [THIS IS MY BODY:] the very foundation of your manifold monstrously-erroneous, Superstitious, Hereticall, and Idolatrous Consequences issuing from thence, whereunto we now orderly pro∣ceed.
THE THIRD BOOKE, Treating of the First Romish Doctrinall Consequence, pretended to arise from your former depraved Exposi∣tion of Christ's wordes, [This is my Body] called TRANSVBSTAN∣TIATION. Your Doctrinal Romish Con∣sequences are Five, viz. the Corporall 1. Conversion of the Bread into the Body of Christ, called Transubstantiation; in this Third Booke. 2. Existence of the same Body of Christ in the Sacrament, called Reall Presence; in the Fourth Booke. 3. Receiving of the Body of Christ into the Bo∣dies of the Communicants, called Reall, or Ma∣teriall Coniunction; in the Fifth Booke. 4. Sacrificing of Christ's Body, by the hands of the Priest, called a Propitiatory Sacrifice; in the Sixth Booke. 5. Worshipping with Divine Worship, called Latria, or Divine Adoration of the same Sacra∣ment; in the Seventh Booke. 6. The Additionals in a Summary Discovery of of the Abhominations of the Romish Masse, and Iniquities of the Defenders thereof; in the Eight Booke. THese are the Doctrinall Consequences, which you teach, and professe, and which we shall by (God's assistance) pursue, according to our former Me∣thod of Brevity, and Perspicuity; and that by as good, and undenyable E∣vidences, and Confessions of your owne Authours, in most points, as ei∣ther you can expect, or the Cause it selfe require. And because a Thing must have a Begetting, before it have a manner of Being, therefore before we treate of the Corporall Pre∣sence,
we must in the first place handle your Transubstantiation, which is the manner (as wee may so say) of the Procreation thereof. CHAP. I. The State of the Controuersie, concerning the Change and Conversion, professed by Protestants, which is Sacramentall; And by the Papists de∣fined to be Trans-substantiall. SECT. I. First of the Sacramentall. THere lieth a Charge upon every Soule, that shall communicate and participate of this Sacrament, that herein he Discerne the Lord's Body: which Of∣fice of Discerning (according to the iudgement of Protestants) is not onely in the use, but also in the Nature to distinguish the Obiect of Faith from the Obiect of Sense: The First Obiect of Christian Faith is the Divine Alteration, and Change of naturall Bread, into a Sacrament of Christ's body; This we call a Divine Change, because none but the same See hereafter, Cap. 4. §. 1. Omnipotent power, that made the Creature and Element of Bread, can Change it into a Sacrament. The Second Obiect of Faith, is the Body of Christ it selfe, Sacra∣mentally represented, and verily exhibited to the Faithfull Com∣municants. There are then three Obiects, in all, to be distingui∣shed. The First is before Consecration, the Bread meerely Naturall. Secondly, After Consecration, Bread Sacramentall. Thirdly, Christ's owne Body, which is the Spirituall, and Super-substantiall Bread, truly exhibited by this Sacramentall, to the nourishment of the soules of the Faithfull. Secondly of the Romish Change, which you call Transubstantiation. SECT. II. BVt your Change in the Councell of Est conversio to∣tius substantiae Panis in Corpus Christi, & totius substantiae vini in sanguinem, man∣tibus duntaxat speciebus Panis, & Vini, quam quidem Conversionem Catholica Ecclesia aptissimè Transub∣stantiationem appellat. Conc. Trid. Sess. 13. Can. . Trent is thus defined: Transubstantiation is a Change of the whole Substance of Bread in∣to the whole Substance of the Body of Christ, and of Wine into his
Blood. Which by the Bull of Ego N. N▪ juro hanc Conversionem fieri, quam Catholi∣ca Ecclesia appellat ranstantiationē—Extrà quam fidē nemo salvus esse po∣test. Bulla Pij 4 super forma Iuramenti Pro∣sessionis Fidei. Pius the Fourth, then Pope, is made an Article of Faith, without which a man cannot be saved. Which Article of your Faith Protestans beleeve to be a new and impious Figment, and Transubstantia∣tionem Protestantes esse sceleratam Hae∣resin dicunt. Bellar. l. 3. de Euch. cap. 11. Heresie. The Case thus standing, it will concerne every Christian to build his Resolution upon a sound Foundation. As for the Church of England, she professeth in her 28. Article, say∣ing of this Transubstantiation, that It cannot be proved by holy Writ, but is repugnant to the plaine words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacrament, and hath given occasion unto MANY SV∣PERSTIONS. CHAP. II. The Question is to be examined by these ground; viz.I. Scripture. II. Antiquity. III. Divine Reason. IN all which wee shall make bold to borrow your owne Assertions, and Confessions, for the Confirmation of Truth. The Romish Depravation of the Sence of Christ his words, [This is my Body:] for proofe of Tran∣substantiation. SECT. I. YOu pretend (and that with no small Confidence) as a Truth avouched by the Councell of Vt definitur in Conc. Trid. Sess. 13. Can. 4. Ex sola veri∣tate verborum [Hoc est Corpus meum] vera, ac propria Transubstantiatio colligitur. Vasquez. Ies. Disp. 176. c. 6. Verba tàm perse clara cogere possint hominem non protervum Transubstantiationem admittere, Bel. lib. 3. de Euch. c. 23. § Secundò. Trent, that Transubstantiation is collected from the sole, true, and proper Signification of these words [This is my Body.] So you. CHALLENGE. VVHerein you shew your selves to be men of great Faith, or rather Credulity, but of little Conscience; teaching that to be undoubtedly True, whereof notwithstanding you your-selves render many Causes of Doubting. For first you Scotus, quem Cameracensis sequi∣tur,—Dicunt non extare locū in Scrip∣turis tàm expressum, ut sin declaratiore Ecclesiae evidentèr cogat Transubstantiationem admittere. Atque hoc non est omninò improbabile, quià an it à sit dubitari potest, cum homines acutissimi, & doctissimi, qualis inprimis Scotus fuit, contrarium sentiant. Bellar. quo supra. Cajetanus, & aliqui vetustiores audiendi non sunt, qui dicunt, panem desinere esse, non tàm ex Evangelio, quàm ex Ecclesiae authoritate constare. Alan. lib. 1. de Euch. c. 34. pag. 419. grant that (be∣sides Cardinall Cajetane, and some other Ancient Schoolemen) Scotus,
and Cameracensis, men most Learned and Acute, held that There is no one place of Scripture so expresse, which (without the Declaration of the Church) can evidently compell any man to admit of Transub∣stantiation. So they. Which your Cardinall, and our greatest Adversary, saith See in the former Allegation at (b.) Is not altogether improbable; and whereunto your Bishop Corpus Christi fieri per consecratio∣nem, non probatur nudis Evangelij ver∣bis, sin pia inter∣pretatione Ecclesiae. Roffens. Episc. con. Capt. Bab. cap. 9. pag. 99. Roffensis giveth his consent. Secondly, (which is also confessed) some other Doctors of your Church, because they could not find so full Evidence, for proofe of your Transubstantia∣tion, out of the words of Christ, were driven to so hard shifts, as to [Hoc est] pro Transit, Bonaventu∣ra docet. Idem ferè habet Occam, & Hol∣cott, infinuat etiam Waldensis.—Volunt Propositionem illam non esse substantivè, sed Transitive inter∣pretandam, sc. ut sit sensus [Hoc est Cor∣pus] id est, Transit in Corpus.—Sed hoc corrumpit significa∣tionem verbi [Est] quod si permittitur, nulla est vis in huius∣modi verbis ad pro∣bandam realem prae∣sentiam nec substan∣tiam Panis hîc non manere. Et ità potuit Haereticus exponere [Hoc est] id est, Re∣praesentat Corpus. Suarez. Jes. Tom. 3. qu. 78. Disp. 58. Sect. 7. At. 1. pag. 754. Change the Verbe Substantive [Est] into a Verbe Passive, or Transitive, Fit, or Transit; that is, in stead of [Is] to say, It's Made, or, It passeth into the Body of Christ. A Sence, which your Iesuite Suarez cannot allow, because (as hee truly saith) It is a Corrupting of the Text. Albeit indeed this word Transubstantiation importeth no more than the Fieri, seu Transire, of Making, or Passing of one Substance into another. So that still you see Transubstantiation cannot be extracted out of the Text, without violence to the words of Christ. Wee might, in the third place, adde hereunto that the true Sence of the words of Christ is Figurative, as by Scriptures, Fa∣thers, and by your owne confessed Grounds hath beene already plentifully * proved, as an Infallible Truth. So groundlesse is this chiefe Article of your Romish Faith, whereof more will be said in the sixt Section following. But yet, by the way, wee take leave to prevent your Obiection. You have told us that See the former Booke throughout. the words of Christ are Operative, and worke that which they signifie; so that upon the pronuntiation of the words [This is my Body,] it must infallibly follow, that Bread is changed into Christs Body; which wee shall be∣lieve, assoone as you shall be able to prove, that upon the pronun∣tiation of the other words of Christ [This Cup is the new Testament in my Blood,] Luc. 22. 20. the Cup is changed into the Testament of Christ's Blood, or else into his Blood it selfe. The Novelty of Transubstantiation examined, as well for the Name, as for the Nature thereof. SECT. II. The Title, and Name of Transubstantiation proved to be of a latter date. YOu have imposed the very Title of Transubstantiation upon the Faith of Christians; albeit the word Transubstantiation (as you grant) Fateor, neque Antiquos Patres u∣sos esse hoc nòmine Transubstantiationis. Christoph. de Capite fontium, Archip. Caesar. lib. de reali Praesent. cap. 59. art. 4. was not used of any Ancient Fathers; and that
your Romish Change had not it's Christendome, or name a∣mong Christians to be called Transubstantiation (as your Car∣dinall Conc. Latera∣n ense sub▪ Innocen∣tio Tertio coactum, ut Haereticis os ob∣thuraret, Conver∣sionem hanc novo & valdè significante verbo dixit Tran∣substantiationem. A∣lan. lib. 1. de Euch. c. 34. p 422. As for that obiected place out of Cyrill of Alexandria Epist. ad Coelosyrium [Convertens ea in yeritatem Carnis:] It is answered by Vas∣quez the Iesuite; non habetur illa Episto∣la inter opera Cy∣rilli. Vasquez. in 3. Tom. Tom. 3. num. 24. Alan witnesseth) before the Councell of Laterane, which was 1215. yeares after Christ; nor can you produce One Father Greeke or Latine, for a Thousand yeares, attributing any word equivalent, in strict Sence; unto the same word Transubstantia∣tion, untill the yeare 1100. (which is beyond the Compasse of due Antiquitie) At what time you finde, note, and rge Theo∣phylact; who saith of the Bread, that It is Trans-elementated into the Body of Christ. Which Phrase, in what Sence hee vsed it, you might best have learned from himselfe, who in the very same place saith that Christ in a manner is Theoph. in Ioh. 6. De Christo perfidem manducato, [] Trans-elementated into the Communicant: which how unchristian a Paradoxe it were, being taken in strict and proper Sence, we permit to your owne iudge∣ments to determine. Neither yet may you, for the countenancing of the Noveltie of this word, obiect the like use of this word [] as though it had beene in use before the Arian Controversie began, because the Fathers of the Councell of Nice iudged the Obiection of the Novelty of that word Calumnious; for that the use of it had beene Antient before their times, as your Cardinall Calumniam hanc Patres Antiqui ap∣tissimè confuâtunt, at{que} ostendrunt non inventum fuisse hoc nomen [] in Concilio Nicaeno, sed fuisse antè in usu Patrum; at illud iam vocabulum vsur pari, quo sui Maiores usi fuissent. Bellarm. quo supra. c. 3. Bellarmine himselfe witnesseth. You furthermore to prevent our Obiection (demanding why the Antient Fathers never called your fancied Romish Change, Transubstantiation, if they had beene of your Romish Faith, con∣cerning the Substantiall Change of Bread into the Body of Christ) haue shaped us this Answere, namely, that Etsi veteres Ec∣clesiae Doctores non sint usi vo Trāsub∣stantiationis, tamen usi sunt vocibus idem significantibus, ut Conversioni, Trans∣mutationis, Transiti∣onis, Transformati∣onis, Transelemen∣tationis, & similibus. Lorich. Fortalit. fidei Tract. de Eucharist. §. Nota pro solutione Argumentorum. fol. 117. Although they used not the very word, Transubstantiation, yet have they words of the same signification, to wit, Conversion, Transmutation, Transition, Trans∣formation, Trans-elementation, and the like. So your Lorichius, Reader of Divinitie among you; who by his vast and rash bold∣nes might as iustly have inferred from the like Phrases of the A∣postle, viz. [2.

Will you have the world imagine that so many, so excellent, and so Ancient Fathers, with all that Divine and Humane Lear∣ning wherewith they were so admirably accomplished, could not in a Thousand yeares space, finde out either the Greeke word, , or the Latine Transubstantiatio, and apply them to this
Change, if they had once dreamed of this your Article of Faith? Will you permit us to learne a point of wisedome in your Cardi∣nal?

Therefore may wee iustly place this your new word among those , which St. 1. Tim. 6. 20.

But surely at that time this could be but a private opinion of some few, for Peter Lombard (living 67. yeares after this Pope, and esteemed the Master of the Romish Schoole) when he had laboured to give Re∣solution to all doubts, especially in this very Question (whe∣ther the Conversion were substantiall, or not) confesseth plainely saying: Si quaeratur, qua∣lis sit Conversio (viz.

But ei∣ther were your Iesuite Coster, and Cardinall Perron as ignorant of Antient Learning, as Scotus, or els they gave small Credit to that Councell cited by Bellarmine under Gregory the VIIth. For your Iesuite saith, in direct tearmes, that Ante trecentos Annos in Conc.

Coster. Ies. Enchir c. 8. §. De Transubstantiatione. The name of Transubstantiati∣on was used in the Councell of Laterane, for clearer declaration, that
Christians might understand the Change of Bread into the Body of Christ. Can you say then that it was universally so vnderstood before? But your Cardinall Perrn more peremptorily con∣cludeth that Si nihil planè ad Doctrinam Eccle∣siasticam spectans in Cone.

A plaine acknow∣ledgement, that it was no Doctrine of Faith before that Coun∣cell, even as Scotus affirmed before, But we pursue this Chase yet further, to shew, That the Article of Transubstantiation was not defined in the Councell of Laternae, vnder Pope In∣nocentius the III. SECT. IV. YOur owne learned Romish Venêre multa in Consultationem, nec decerni quicquamta∣men a ptè potuir, cò quòd Pontifex (quo profectus est tollen∣dae Discordiae gratiâ) mortuus est Perusij.

Thus farre out of Widdrington alias Preston, in his Booke above cited. Priest, a long time Prisoner, did under the name of Widdrington produce many Historians viz. Platina, Nauclerus, Godfridus Monumetensis, Matth. Paris, and others to testifie as followeth. That many things fell under Consul∣tation in that Councell, but nothing was openly defined, the Pope dying at Persium. Insomuch that some of these Authors sticke not to say that This Generall Councell, which seemed to promise bigg and mighty matters, did end in scorne and mockery, performing nothing at all. Wee might adde that the supposed Acts of this Councell were not published vntill more than two hundred yeares after. No marvell then if some Scholastici quidam haue Doctrinam de Transubstantiatione non valde An∣tiquam esse dixerunt: inter quos Scotus, & Gabriel Biel. Suarez Ies. Tom. 3. Disp. 50 §. 1. Schoole-men, among whom were Sco∣tus and Biel, held Transubstantiation not to have beene very antient. And another, that In Synaxi serò definivit Ecclesia Transubstantiationem, diù satis erat Credere sivè sub pane, sive sub quo∣cun{que} modo adesse verum Corpus Christi. Eras. in 1. Cor. 7. pag. 373. It was but lately determined in the Church. Nay, M. Breerly (if his opinion be of any Credit among you) stick∣eth not to say that Mr. Breerly in his Liturgie Tract. 2. §. 11. pag. 158. Transubstantiation compleat (that is, both for forme, and matter) was not determined vntill the last Councell of Trent; that is to say, not untill the yeare of our Lord 1560. Doe you not see how much licking this ougly Beare and Beast had, before it came to be formed? and yet it will appeare to be but a Monstrum horrendum, take it at the best; as it is now to to be proved, by the full discouering of the palpable Falshood thereof.
CHAP. III. The Definition of Transubstantiation, in the Church of Rome; and of the Falshood thereof. SECT. I. THe Councell of Trent (saith your Conc. Trid. di∣cit, fieri Conversio∣nem totius substan∣tiae Panis, id est, tàm formae, quàm mate∣riae in Substantiam Corporis Christi. Bell. lib. 3. de Eucharist. Chap. 18. §. Si Objicias. Concil. Trid. Sess. 13. Cap. 4. Cardinall) hath defined that this Conversion is of the whole Substance of Bread, that is, as well forme, as matter, into the Substance of Christ his Body. Our First proofe of the Falshood of the Doctrine of Tran∣substantiation, by the Contradictions of the Defen∣ders thereof; whereby they bewray their No-Beleefe of the Article. THe Opinions of the Doctours of your Church, concerning the nature of this Conversion, are by you reduced into these two manners, (namely) that it is either by Production out of the substance of Bread; or els by Adduction of the Body of Christ unto the forme of Bread. CHALLENGE. VVHatsoever it is, which you will seeme to professe, never shall you perswade us that you doe indeed believe either of the pretended Formes of Transubstantiation. First, not by Pro∣duction, because (as the same Productio est, quandò Terminu ad quem non existir, & ideò vi Conversionis necessariò produci∣tur, ut aqua in vi∣num: Adductiva au∣term, &c. Bell. ibid. §. Secundò notandum.—Productiva non est, quià Corpus Do∣mini praeexistit. Idem ibid. §. Exhis. Cardinall truely argueth) Conversi∣on by Production, is, when the thing that is produced is not yet extant; as when Christ converted water into wine, wine was not Extant before it was Produced out of the substance of water: But the Body of Christ is alwaies Extant; therefore can it not be said to be Produced out of the substance of Bread. So he. Which Productive manner of Tran∣substantiation could not be beleeved by your Iesuites De rarione Tran∣substantiationis non est, ut Substantia, in quam dicitur fie∣ri Transubstantiatio, producatur aut con∣servetur perillam: imò qui hoc modo defendunt Transubstantiationem in Sacramento, ad quod dam genus Phi∣losophiae excogitatum, potius quam ad verum & necessarium, rem reducere videntur. Vasq Ies. To. 2. disp. 214. c. 4. Vasquez, and Praeter Adductiuam Conversionem evidentèr refutavimus omnes modos Conversionis, qui vel dici, vel fingi possunt. Suarez Ies. Tom. 3. qu. 7. disp. 50 §. 5 §. Tertio Principaliter. [M. Fisher in his Reioynder talketh fond∣ly of a Reproduction, as of Careases converted into men, in which Change any One may see that as much as is Produced is not Extant, for Dust is not Flesh. But since he cannot apply this Reproduction to Transubstantiation of Bread into the Body of Christ, his Answer is impertinent, and he may be produced for an idle Disputer.] Suarez, by both whom it hath beene confuted. And if the Change be not by Production, then it must follow that it is not by Transubstantiation; which is demonstrable in it selfe, because the next manner, which they insist vpon, cannot possibly serue your turne.
This Second manner they name to be by Adduction, which your Si Terminus ad quem Corpus Chri∣sti existat, sed non in co loco ubi Ter∣minus à quo (i. e. Pa∣nis) tum ui Conver∣sionis adducetur ad eum locum. Indè vo∣catur Conversio ad∣ductiva: nam cor∣pus Christi praeexi∣stit antè Conversio∣nem, sed non sub spe∣ciebus Panis. Con∣versio igitur non fa∣cit ut corpus Chri∣sti simplicitèr esse in∣cipiat, sed ut incipi∣at esse sub speciebus: non quod per motum localem è Coelo Ad∣ducatur, sed solùm quià per hanc cōver∣sionē fit, ut quod ante erat solùm in Coe∣lo, iam fit sub specie∣bus Panis. Nec haec Accidentalis Con∣versio, sed substanti∣alis dicta est, quià substantia Panis de∣finit esse, & substan∣tia corporis Christi succedit Pani. Pro∣indè Substantia in Substantiam transit. Talis est Conversio Cibi in hominem, per nutritionē; nam anima non produci∣tur sed tantùm per nutritionem fit, ut in∣cipiat esse in ea ma∣teria, ubi anteà erat forma Cibi. Bel. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 18. Cardinall defineth to be a Bringing of the Substance of that Body of Christ, continuing still in heaven, to be notwithstanding at the same time under the shapes of Bread on the Altar, & therfore called Sub∣stantiall, but the Substance of Bread, ceaseth to haue any Being, when the Body of Christ succeedeth to be under the outward shapes of Bread. So he. And this is of late crept into the opinion of some few, whereby you have created a new faith, flat contrary to the faith of the Councell of Trent, which defined a Change of the whole substance of Bread into the Substance of the Body of Christ. So that Councell, as you have heard. Now by the Change of Substance into Substance, as when Common Bread eaten is turned into the Substance of Man's flesh, the matter of Bread is made the matter of Flesh. But this your adduction is so far frō bringing in the Substance of Bread into the Substance of Christ's Bo∣dy, that it professeth to bring the Body of Christ not so much as un∣to the Bread, but to be under only the Outward Accidents, & formes of Bread. Yet had this Figment some Favourers in your Fuerunt huius sententiae Alens. Bo∣navent. Marsil—dicunt per hanc Cō∣versionem Corpus non accipere esse, sed accipere esse hîc; necmultum discordat Thomas. Deni{que} moderni subscribentes contra Haeretios libentèr hanc sententiam amplectuntur, quià facilitatem quandam prae se fert, ut videre licet apud Ioh. Hessels, Claud. Guil. Paris, & Bellar. As witnesseth Suarez. qu sup. disp. 50. §. 44. p. 635. Cùm Panis substantialiter muetur, it à ut desinat esse, haec Conversio est Substantialis, non Accidentalis. 2. Corpus Christi est substantia, quae succedit Pa∣ni, proindè substantia transit in substantiam.—& dicunt conversionem Adductivam esse quandò quod adducitur acquirit esse sub speciebus Panis—Bellar. qusupr. § Respondeo 1.—Cedere Corpori, in ratione existendi est propriè Converti in ipsum, & per Consequens fit vera in Carnem Transmutatio. Alan. lib. 1. de. Euch. cap. 34. Schooles. No Marvell therefore if there arose some out of your owne Church, who did impugne this delusion, calling it (as your Dixi Conversionem Panis in Corpus Christi esse Adductivam, quod dictum video à nonnullis esse per∣peràm acceptum, qui indè non Transubstantiationem, sed Translocationem colligunt. Sed dixi corpus Christi non deseruisse locum suum in Coelo, ne{que} incipere esse sub speciebus, ut in loco, sed ut substantia sub Acciden∣tibus, remotâ tamen inhaerentia. Bellar. Recog. in lib. 2. de Euch. p. 81. Cardinall himselfe witnesseth of them) a Translocation onely, and not a Transubstantiation; and that truely, if they should not have called it a Trans-accession, or Trans-succession rather. For who will say, if he put on his hand a Glove, made of a Lamb-skin, which Lambe was long since dead (and consequently ceasing to be) that therefore his hand is Transubstantiated into the Body of the Lambe? yet is there in this example a more substantial Change by much, than can be imagined to be by your Adduction of a Body under onely the Formes and Accidents of the matter of Bread, because there is in that a Materiall Touch betweene the Substance of the hand, and the Lamb-skin: but in this other there is onely a Coniunction of the Substance of one Body with the Accidents of another. Which kind of meere Succession of a Substance your Iesuite Suarez will allow to be no more than a Per solam Adductivam actionem reverà non explicatur vera Conversio Substantialis & Transubstātiatio, sed anm Trāslocatio quaedam: quan∣dò una Substantiasuccedit loco alterius, non potest propriè dici unam converti in aliam. Suarez. loco citat. p. 639. Translocation. Wee Conclude that seeing Conversion, whether by Producti∣on, or by Adduction, are so plainly proved by your selves to be con∣trary to Truth: therefore it is not possible for you to beleeve a Doctrine so absolutely repugnant to your owne knowledge.
Observe by the way that they, who gain-say the Productive, and teach the Adductive, yet doe all deny Locall mutation à Termi∣no ad Terminum: a Paradox which wee leave to your wisdomes to contemplate vpon. Our Second Proofe of the Falshood of the Article of Transubstantia∣tion is from the Article of our Christian Creed, [BORNE OF THE VIRGIN MARY.] SECT. II. TRansubstantiation (as hath beene defined by your Councell of Trent) is a Conversion of the substance of Bread into the Substance of Christ's Body. Now, in every such Substantiall Change, there are Two Tearmes, one is the Substance from which; the other is the Substance whereinto the Substantiall Change is made: as it was in Christ his miraculous Change of Water into Wine. But this was by producing the Substance of Wine out of the Substance of Water, as the matter, from which the Conversion was made. Therefore must it it be by Production of the Substance of Christ's Body, out of the Substance of Bread. Your Cardinall hath no Evasion, but by deny∣ing the Conversion to be by Production, which notwithstanding was formerly the Generall Tenet of the Romish Schoole, ever since the Doctrine of Transubstantiation was hatched; and which is con∣trary to his owne device of Conversion by Adduction: wherein first he Dico Corpus Christi ex pane fieri, non tanquàm ex ma∣teria, sed tanquàm à Termino à quo, ut mundus ex nihilo, [then confuting him∣selfe] eiam ut ex a∣qua vinum (that was not ex nihilo.) In pr∣senti negotio, Con∣versio non est Produ∣ctiva. Panis enim cō∣vertitur in Corpus Christi praeexistens: ergò Corpus Christi factum ex Pane, & ex Carne est idem. Bell. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 24. §. Ad Tertium. confoundeth himselfe, and secondly, his opinion hath beene scornfully reiected by your owne learned Doctors, as being nothing lesse than Transubstantiation, as you have heard. Therefore may you make much of your breaden Christ. As for vs, We, according to our Apostolicall Creed, beleeve no Body of Christ, but that which was Produced out of the Sanctified flesh of the blessed Virgin Mary, for feare of Alphonsus de Ca∣stro lib. 4. Ti. Christ{us}. haeres. 2. Manichaei dierūt Christū non ex utero Virginis prodijsse; Et Apolli∣naris dixit Christū nō assumpsisse carnē ex Virgine. Item.

This same Obiection being made of late to a Iesuite of prime note, received from him this Answer: viz. God that was ableto raise Children to Abraham out of stones, can of bread transubstantiate the same into that Body of Christ, which was of the Virgin. And he againe received this Reply; That the Children, which should be so rai∣sed out of Stones, howsoever they might be Abraham's Children, according to Faith, yet could they not be Children of Abraham according to the Flesh. Therefore is there as great a Difference be∣tweene that Body from Bread, and the other from the Blessed Virgin, as there must have beene betweene Children out of Stones, and Children out of Flesh. And this out Reason accordeth right well to the Ancient Faith, professed within this Land, in the dayes of Edgar a Saxon King, as it is set out in an Homily on Easter day, pag. 35. Homily of that time, which being published stan∣deth thus. Much is betweene the body that Christ sufferedin, and be∣tweene
the body of the hallowed Howsell: The body truly that Christ suffered in was borne of the flesh of the Virgin Mary with blood, and with bone, with skin, and with sinewes in humane limbes; and his Ghost∣ly body, which we call his Howsell, is gathered of many Cornes, without blood, and bone, without limbe, and therefore nothing is to be under∣stood herein bodily, but all is Ghostly to be understood. This was our then Saxon's Faith; wherein is plainely distinguished the Body of Christ borne of the blessed Virgin from the Sacramentall (which is called Ghostly) as is the Body of flesh from the Consecrated Substance of Bread. A Doctrine directly confirmed by See Booke 4. C. 4. §. . in the Challenge. Saint Augustine. Wherefore we may as truly say, concerning this your Conversion, that if it be by Transubstantiation from bread, then it is not the Bo∣dy, which was borne of the blessed Virgin; as your owne Romish Glosse could say of the Predication: See above, Booke 2. Chap. 1. § 4. If Bread be Christ's Body, then something was Christ's body, which was not borne of the Virgin Mary. Our Third Reason is taken from the Existence of Bread in this Sacrament, after Consecration. But first of the State of this Question. SECT. III. VVE wonder not why your Fathers of the Councell of Trent were so fierce in casting their great Thunderbolt of Si quis dixerit remanere Substantiā Panis, Anathema sit. Conc. Trident. Sess. 13. Can. 2. A∣nathema, and Curse upon every man that should affirme, Bread and Wine to remayne in this Sacrament after Consecration: which they did, to terrifie men from the Doctrine of Protestants, who doe all affirme the Continuance of the Substance of Bread in the Eucharist. For right well did these Tridentines know, that if the Substance of Bread, or Wine doe remayne, then is all Faith, yea, and Conceit of Transubstantiation but a feigned Chimaera, and meere Fancy, as your Cardinall doth confesse, in granting that Panis etsi non annihiletur, tamen manet nihil in se; ut Aqua post Conversi∣onem in vinum. Ne{que} obstat, quod fortè materia manserit, nā materia non est A∣qua. Prima Conditio in vera Conversione est, utid, quod con∣vertitur, desinat esse. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. c. 18. §. Igitur. & cap. 24 §. Ad Alterum. It is a necessarie Condition, in every Transubstantiation, that the thing, which is Con∣verted, cease any more to be; as it was in the Conversion of Water into Wine; Water ceased to be Water. And so must Bread cease to be Bread. This being the State of the Question, we undertake to give Good Proofes of the Existence, and Continuance of Bread in the Eucharist, the same in Substance, after Consecration. Our First Proofe is from Scripture, 1. Cor. 10. Saint Paul calling it [Bread.] SECT. IV. IN the Apostle his Comment (that I may so call his two 1. Cor. 11. 26, 27. & 10. 16. Chap∣ters to the Corinthians) upon the Institution of Christ, we reade
of Eating the Bread, and Drinking the Cup, thrice; all which, by the consent of all sides, are spoken of Eating & Drinking after Con∣secration: and yet hath he called the outward Element Bread. You will say (with some) It was so called onely because it was made of Bread; as Aarons Rod, turned into a Serpent, was notwithstanding called a Rod. But this Answere is not answerable unto the Simili∣tude. For first, of the Bread, the Apostle saith demonstratively, This Bread; and of the other, This Cup: But of Aaron's Rod, tur∣ned into Serpent, none could say, This Rod. And secondly, it is contrary to Christian Faith, which will abhorre to say, in a pro∣per sence, that Christ's Body was ever Bread. Or else you will an∣swere, with others, It is yet called Bread, because it hath the Simi∣litude of Bread, as the Brazen Serpent was called a Serpent. But neither this nor any other of your Imaginations can satis∣fie; for we shall prove, that the Apostle would never have called it Bread after Consecration, but because it was Substantially, still, Bread. Our Reason is; He had now to deale against the Propha∣ners of this Sacrament, in reproving such as used it as Common Bread, 1. Cor. 11. 21. Not discerning therein (Sacramentally exhibited) the Lord's Body. It had therefore concerned him to have honoured the Sacrament with Divine Titles, agreeable to the Body of Christ, hypostatically united to his God-head, and to have denied it ab∣solutely to have beene Bread, considering that by the name of Bread the glory of the same Body might seeme to be abased, and Ec∣clipsed; if in Truth, and Veritie hee had not beleeved it to have beene (then) Bread. This Reason we guesse you are bound to approve off, who, in your opinion of the Corporall Presence of Christ his Body, and Ab∣sence of Bread, would never suffer any of your Professors to call it, after Consecration, by the name of Bread. Whereupon it was that the Greeke Archiep. Cabasila. Latini nostros re∣hendunt, quòd post illa verba [Hoc est Corpus meum] Pa∣nem & Vinum nomi∣nant, &c. Exposit. Li∣turg. c. 29. Archbishop Cabasila complained of the Romish Professors, for reprehending the Greeke Liturgies: why? Because (saith he) after the words of Christ, [This is my Body] wee call the Symbols and Signes Bread, and Wine. So hee. Which bewrayeth that the very naming of the Sacrament Bread, and Wine is, in the iudgement of the Church of Rome, preiudiciall to their Transub∣stantiation; and that if Saint Paul himselfe should deliuer the same words he did, at this day, hee should by your Romish Inquisitors be taught to use his Termes in another stile. What need many words? except in the words of Christ the word [Body] be properly predicated, and affirmed of Bread, farewell Transubstantiation of Bread into Christ's Body! But that it is Impossible the Body of Christ should be properly predicated upon Bread, hath beene the Gene∣rall Confession of your owne Doctours, and the Conclusion of our second Booke.
Our Second Proofe of the Continuance of the Substance of Bread is from the speech of Christ, touching the Continuance of Wine, after Consecration, Matth. 26. 29. by the Interpretation of Antiquity. SECT. V. THe same is as fully verified by our Lord and Master Christ himselfe, in thesecond Element of Wine, calling it Matth. 26. 29. This fruit of the Vine, that is, Wine, after Consecration: where the Pronoune [This] hath relation to the Wine in the Cup. For the proof of this our Exposition of the words of Christ, we have the Consent of these and thus many holy Fathers; Origen, Cyprian, Chrysostome, Au∣gustine, Hierome, Epiphanius, Euthymius, Theophylact, and Bede, as witnesseth your Iesuite Origenes, Cy∣prianus, Chrysost. August. Hieron. Epi∣phan. Beda, Euthym. Theoph. [Genimen vitis] ad sanguinem Christi referunt—Maldon. Ies. Com. in eum locum; where hee addeth: Persuadere mihi non possum haec verba ad Sanguinem esse referenda.—Hoc Patres, sed alio sensu à Calvinistis, qui dicunt Christum vinū appellâsse, quià vinum erat; sed Pa∣tres vocaruntsangui∣nem Vinum, sicut Christus Carnem 10. 6. vocabat Panem.

Marke this (you great Boasters of Accor∣dance with Antiquity!) and yet this manner of answering the Fathers is most familiar with this Iesuite. But he proceedeth, tel∣ling you that The Fathers notwithstanding did not call it Wine, as thinking it to be Wine, but even as Christ did when hee called his flesh Bread, Iohn 6. Then he addeth; They that will follow the Ex∣position of These Fathers are thus to interpret them. And gives his Reason of this his Aduertisement, Lest the other Exposition (saith he) may seeme to agree with the opinion of the Calvinists. So he. For which his Answere Calvinists▪ are as much beholding to him, as are the Ancient Fathers, with whom he hath made bold not only to reiect their Authority; but also to pervert the plaine and evident meaning of their Testimonies; who declare that they un∣derstood Naturall and Substantiall Wine (as the Novum promi∣sit, id est, Novum quendam modum sumptionis in regno, id est, post resurrecti∣onem, quando Cibum sumpsit corporalem.

that these words of Christ had reference to the Cup in the Eucharist; and not (as some say) to the Cup of the Passeover. Marke you furthermore the Errour of the Aquarij, and the Confutation thereof: they used only Water in the Eucharist, in pretence of See above, Booke 1. Chap. 3. §. 10. Sobriety, which Cyprian confuted only upon this ground, viz. that this Practice was not warranted by the See above, Booke 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 3. And here above in the Mar∣gent. Insti∣tution of Christ, wherein Christ ordained Wine, and not Onely Water: and now tell us, if that your Doctrine of Transubstantiation had beene an Article of Faith, in those dayes, whether it had not con∣cerned Cyprian to have stood exactly upon it, for the more just con∣demnation of those Aquarij, to let them know, that if they would needs use only Water, than (according to your Doctrine) their Consecration should be void; and consequently their Adoration (if it had beene then in use) should have beene like wise Idolatrous. The former Proofe confirmed by Analogie, betweene Bread and Christ's Body, both Naturall, and Mysticall. SECT. VI. IN 1. Cor. 10. 16, 17. [The Bread which we breake (saith the Apo∣stle) is it not the Communion of the Body of Christ? for we being many are one Bread and one Body, in as much as wee all partake of one Bread.] In this Sentence the word [Bread] hath a double Relati∣on, the First to Christ his Body Naturall. Thus the joynt Partici∣pation of the Bread is called the Communion of the Body of Christ. The Analogie, in this respect, is excellently expressed by Panis quià con∣firmat Corpus, ideò Corpus Christi no∣minatur: Vinum au∣tem, quià sanguinem operatur, ideò ad sanguinem refertur. Haecautem duo sunt visibilia, sanctificata autem per Spiritum sanctum, in Sacra∣mentum divini Cor∣poris transeunt. Isi∣dor. Hisp. de Offic. Lib. 1. cap. 18. See above, Booke 2. Chap. 1. §. 9. (at x.) Isi∣dore: Bread (saith hee) because it strengtheneth the Body, is there∣fore called Christ's Body; and Wine, because it turneth into Blood, is therefore called Christ's Blood: These two are visibles, but being san∣ctified by the holy Spirit, are turned into a Sacrament of Christ's Body. So hee. This is indeed a true Analogie, not to be performed by Accidents. Could any of them, whom you call Calvinists, have spoken more significantly either in contradicting your Exposition of Christ's words (for he saith that Christ called Bread his Body;) or in declaring the true proper Sence of the Sacramentall Conversion? (for he saith, Bread is Changed into a Sacrament of Christ's Bodie;) or else in giving the Reason why Bread, and Wine were chosen to be Sacraments and Signes of Christ's Body, and Blood, by which we are spiritually fed? (for hee sheweth that it is because of their Na∣turall Effects, Bread substantially, and therefore not Accidentally, strengtheneth Man's Body: Wine turneth in Blood.) Which over∣throweth your third Figment of onely Substantia Panis non pertinet ullo modo ad rationem Sacramenti, sed so∣lùm Accidentia. Bei∣lar. Lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 23. §. Respondeo sub∣stantiam. Accidents; as if the Sub∣stance of Bread and Wine, were not necessary in this Sacrament. Say then, doth the Accident of Roundnesse and Figure of Bread strengthen mans Body? or doth the Accident, Colour of Wine, turne into Blood? As
well might you affirme the only Accident of Water in Baptisme to be sufficient to purge and cleanse the Body, by the colour, and coldnesse, without the substantiall matter thereof. The Second part of the Analogie is discerned in the Mysticall Bo∣dy of Christ, which is the Congregation of the Faithfull Commu∣nicants; [1. Cor. 10 17. We are all one Body, in as much as we are partakers of one Bread.] It standeth thus; As many Granes of Corne make one Loafe of Bread, and many Grapes make one measure of Wine in the Cup: So, many Christians, partaking faithfully of this Sacra∣ment, become One mysticall Body of Christ by the Vnion of Faith, and Love. This Exposition, as it is yeilded unto by your Car∣dinall Vnus Panis, unū Corpus multi sumus, nam omnes in uno Pane participamus.] Significatur vnitas fi∣dei in vnitate Panis, ac unitate Corporis Metaphoricè, ad si∣militudinem multorū granorum, ex quibus conicitur Corpus v∣num.

Cajetan, and authorized by your Romane and Triden∣tine Vnum Ecclesiae corpus ex multis mē∣bris compositum est: nullâ re elucet ea Coniunctio magis, quàm Panis Vinique elementis.

Catechisme, so is it also confessed to be used of Augustinus. Dominus noster Christus, inquit, Corpus suum in ijs rebus commendavit, quae ad unum aliquod rediguntur: ex multis enim granis Panis efficitur, ex multis racemis unum Corpus con∣fluit; utntur hac similitudine Sancti propè omnes Doctores. Teste Bozio de Signis Ecclesiae Tom. 2. lib. 14. cap. 6. Al∣most all holy Doctours. Hee was held a most expert and artificiall Painter, in Plinie, that could paint Grapes so to life, as to deceive Birds; which came to feed on them: But they are the only So∣phisticall Doctors, that offer in the Eucharist only Accidents, as painted Colours in stead of naturall, because where there is not a Reall Analogie, there is no Sacrament. You may not say, that the Analogie consisteth in the matter before Consecration; because every Sacramentall Analogie is betweene the Sacrament, and the Thing Signified, but it is no Sacrament, before it be Con∣secrated. CHALLENGE. SAy now, what Better Authour is there than Christ? What bet∣ter Disciple and Scholler, than the Apostle of Christ? or what better Commentary upon the words of Christ, and his Apostle, than the Sentences of Ancient Fathers? calling the one part Wine, the other Bread, after Consecration, as you have heard. Our Third Proofe, that the Substance of Bread remayneth after Consecration in the Sacrament, is taken from the Iudgement of Sense necessarily. First, by the Authority of Scripture. SECT. VII. ALthough man's Sense may be deceived, thorow the inconve∣nient Diposition of the Medium, thorow which he seeth, as it
hapneth in judging a straight Staffe to be Crooked, which stan∣deth in the Water; and in thinking a White Obiect to be Greene in it selfe, which is seene through a Greene glasse: or Secondly by the unequall Distance of place, as by conceiving the Sunne to be but two feet in breadth; or the Rainbow to be a Colour, and not Light; or Thirdly by some defect in the Organ, or Instrument of seeing (which is the Eye) whereby it commeth to passe that wee take One to be Two, or mistake a Shadow for a Substance: yet notwithstanding when our Eyes that see are of good Constitution, and Temper; the Medium, whereby we see, is perfectly disposed; the Distance of the Obiect, which we see, is indifferent; then (say we) the iudgement of Sense, being free, is True, and the Concur∣rence and ioynt Consent of divers Senses, in one arbitrement, is infallible. This Reason, taken from Sence, you peradventure will judge to be but Naturall and Carnall, as those Termes are opposed to a true and Christian manner of Reasoning: Wee defend the Con∣trary being warranted by the Argument which Christ himselfe used to his Disciples, Luc. 24. 39. [Handle mee, and see.] Your Car∣dinall although he grant that this Reason of Christ was available, to prove that his owne Body was no Spirit, or Fancy, but a true body, even by the onely Argument from the Sence of Touching; Consequentie Christ, affirmativè sumpta, Hoc pa pa∣tur, hoc videtur, Er∣go est Corpus, opti∣ma fuit, quià sensus non fallitur Circa proprium Obiectum: ita{que} necessariò quod videtur, & tangitur Corporale est. At ne∣gativè; hoc non pal∣patur, nec videtur, Ergò non est Corpus; Dominus non fecit, & mala est. Non fal∣luntur Sensus nostri, cum nos album quid, rotundum, solidum sentire arbitramur, quae sunt propria ob∣jecta. Sed cum Panis Substantiam sub illis Accidentibus latere denuntiant, fallun∣tur. Dominus solùm probare voluit se nō esse inane spectrum, seu Phantasma, sed verum Corpus; id quod ex Testimonio sensus Tangendi optimè probavit. Illud autem Corpus esse humanum, idem quod anteà fuerat, non probavit Dominus hoc solo Argumento, ex Tangendi sensu desumpto (quod sine dubo non erat sufficiens) sed multis alijs modis, loquendo, mandueando, testimonio Angelorum, miraculo Piscium, allegatione Scripturarum. Bellar. . . de Euch. c. 14. §. Respondeo. Yet (saith he) was it not sufficient in it selfe, without other Ar∣guments to confirme it, and to prove it to have beene a humane body, and the very same which it was. So he. Which Answere of your Cardinall we wish were but only false, and not also greatly irreligious: for Christ demonstrated hereby not onely that he had a body (as your Cardinall speaketh) but also that it was his owne same humane body, now risen, which before had beene Crucified, and wounded to Death, and buried, according to that of Luke [That it is even I.] Luc. 24. 39. Now because 1. Cor 15. It is not a Resurrection of a Body, except it be the Same body: Therefore would Christ have Thomas to Ioh. 20. 27. thrust his hands into his sides, and feele the print of his wounds, to manifest the same body; as Two of your Iesuites doe also observe, the One with an Optimè Origines, O∣stendit se Christus in vero Corpore suo resuscitatum. Tolet. Ies. in Ioh. c. 20. p. 534. Optimè, the O∣ther with a Probatum est, Christum idem Corpus numero demonstrâsse. Suarez es. Tom. 2. qu. 54. § 1. Probatum est. Accordingly the Apostle Saint Paul laid this Argument, taken from Sence, as the foundation of a Fundamentall Article of Faith, even the Resurrection of the same Body of Christ from the dead; for how often doth he repeate, and inculcate this? 1. Cor. 15. 5. He was seene, &c. And againe thrice more, Hee was seene, &c. And Saint Iohn argueth, to the same purpose, from the Concurrence of three Sences: 1. Ioh. 1. 1. That which wee have heard,
which we have seene, and our hands have handled, declare wee unto you. The validity of this Reason was proved by the Effect, as Christ averreth, Iohn 20. 29. Thomas because thou hast seene (that is, perceiued both by Eye, and hand) thou hast beleeved. The Validity of the Iudgement of Sense, in THOMAS, and the other Disciples, confirmed in the second place by your owne Doctors. SECT. VIII. PErerius a Iesuite confidently pleadeth for the Sense of Touch: Illud sine dubi∣tatione dicere non verebor, non posse ab vllo Daemone for∣mari corpus adeò si∣mile humano, ut si∣quis cum curâ ani∣mi & attentione id tangeret, non faci∣lè dignosceret ipsum non esse corpus hu∣manum. Itaque non poterit Daemon si∣militudine corporis humani oculos falle∣re: Tactus autem sen∣sum fallere omninò, non potest, quod quaor Argumentis confirmabo—Hoc veissimum esse pa∣tet ex eo, quod Chri∣stus dixit discipulis sis [Palpate & vide∣te:] & Thomae [Af∣fer digitum, &c.] Pe∣rer. es. in Gen. 6. num. 78. p. 2. I feare not (saith hee) to say, that the Evidence of Sense is so strong an Argument, to prove without all doubt an humane Bodie, that the Devill himselfe cannot herein delude the touch of man, that is of vnderstanding and consideration. As for the unbeleeving Disci∣ples, [Christ his Handle me, &c.] (saith your Iesuite Si Discipuli Chri∣sti non potuissent Christi vera ossa & carnes discernere, mollitiem, & duritiē eorum, non dixisset ijs [Palpate, & Vi∣dere] ac si diceret, Palpate, & Percipite veras carnes & ossa. Vasquez. Ies. Tom. 2. qu. 51. Art. 2. disp. 184. cap 2. p. 487. Thomas dicit fingula Argumen∣ta non fuisse per se sufficientia, benè tamen coniuncta probari cum testimonijs Prophetarum.—Ego tamen cùm Cajetano Argumentum illud Tactus efficacissimum fuisse ad comprobandam veitatem Corporis humani in Christo. Idem ibid. Vasquez) was as much as if he had said to them, Perceive you my true flesh? as being a most efficacious Argument to prove the truth of an humane Body. So he, yea, and Illud Thomae [non credam, &c.] pertinaciae & obdurationis vitium erat, & pec∣catum Infidelitatis. Optimè Orig: lib. 2. con. Celsum, vbi docet Discipulos affirmâsse illum, quem viderunt, esse Christum in Corpore vero suo, & resuscitato: nam Thomas sciebat animas interdùm apparere Corporibus, & proprias formare voces, & tamen non esse Corpora vera. Quapropter non dixit solùm [Nisi videro, non credam] sed adiunxit, [Nisi infero manum in vestigia Clavorum.] Tolet. Ies. Com. in Ioh. 20. Tolet another Iesuite did well discerne the case of Thomas to have beene an extreme Infidelity, when hee said, [Except I put my finger into the print of the nailes, and thrust my hand into his side, I will not beleeve.] Which proveth the Ef∣ficaciousnesse of the Iudgement of Sence, in reducing so extreme an Vnbeleever to beleeve. Wherein your Authours are authorized by Saint Augustine, Aug. de tem∣pore. Si forte, inquit, Diceremus Thomae oculos fuisse deceptos, at non possemus dicere manus frustratas▪ de Tactu non potest dubitai. Et Greg. Pont. Plus nobis Thomae infidelitas ad fidem, quàm fides credentium Dis∣scipulorum profuit, quià dubius ille Carnem palpando ad fidem reducitur, mens nostra omni dubitatione post∣positâ. Teste Maldon. Ies. Com. in Jo. 20. saying, that Although Thomas his Eyes had beene deceived, yet his touch was not frustrate. And accordingly by Gregory Pope of Rome, who sticketh not to say that The Infidelity of Thomas made more for confirmation of Christian beliefe, than did the faith of the other Apo∣stles, because his Doubtfulnesse being convinced by the Sense of Tou∣ching, we are thereby freed from all doubtfulnesse in the faith. And if this were not sufficient to confute your Cardinall, hee may be shackled with his owne answere, who, to disable the Infallibilitie of the Sense of feeling, said; See above at (b.) That other Arguments were requi∣site for the certifying the iudgement of Sense: and among these O∣ther he reckoneth Christ his speaking, eating, and working Mira∣cles. All which, what are they else (wee pray you) but equally
Obiects of Sense? What Vertigo then may this be called in him, to seeke to invalidate the verity of Sense by an Argument, which iustifieth the certainty of Sense? A third Confirmation of the Truth of Senses, as sufficient in Divine Causes, for discerning Obiects of Sense, and particularly in perceiving Bread and Wine to continue the same in this Sacrament; by the judgement of Ancient Fathers. SECT. IX. HOw many Heretiques of old were there (such as the Valenti∣nians, Montanists, Marcionites) who denied that Christ had a True, and Essentiall Bodie? and how absolutely were they confu∣ted of Ancient Fathers, by the Evidence of men's Senses that heard, saw, and felt the Body of Christ? Which sheweth plainly that a Demonstration by Sense standeth good and strong euen in Chri∣stian Philosophie. And to come to the point in Question, to con∣clude from the Premises in the former Section; who can deny this Consequence, viz. By the same Evidence may a Christian man prove Bread to be truly Bread, after Consecration, whereby Christ proved his Body to be a body of flesh, after his Resurrection? But this he did from the Infallibility of Sence. Therefore this may be equal∣ly concluded by the same Argument of Sence. And that there is the same Reason of both these, the Ancient Father Theodoret sheweth in the Argument, wherewith he confu∣ted an Heretique by Sense, thus; Eranistes apud Theod. Quià sicut Pa∣nis desinit esse Panis post Consecrationē, sed mutatur in sub∣stantiam Corporis Christi. Ità Corpus Christi post resurre∣ctionem desinit esse propriè Corpus, sed in Naturam divinam mutatur. Orthodox. Imò verò, ut te ca∣piam in laqueis his: signa mystica non re∣cedunt à naturâ suâ, manent enim in pri∣ori suâ formâ, figurâ, & substantiâ. Theod. Dial. 2. Cap. 24. As after Consecration (saith he) Bread remayneth the same in substance: So Christ his Body after the Resurrection remayned in substance the same. Thus much of the A∣nalogie. (As for the word [Substance] more is to be spoken there∣of See hereafter, Sect. 12. hereafter.) Yea, and Saint Augustine will not suffer the Com∣municant to blind-fold himselfe, whose Testimony (digested by Beda ex Augusti no, Serm. ad Infantes, in cap. 10. ad Cor. fol. 19. apud Bedam. Quod vidistis Panis est, quod oculi vestri re∣nunciant, quod autem fides vestra, &c. Sicut ex multis granis triici vnus Panis: Ità ex multitudine fidelium, vna asurgit Ecclesia. Bede) is this: That which you have seene is Bread, as your eyes doe manifest unto you. And he speaketh of Bread, as this Sacrament was a Symbol, and Signe of the mysticall body of Christ, which is his Church, consisting of a multitude of Faithfull Communicants, as one Loafe doth of many graines of wheate. So Saint Augustine. Ergò, It is Bread after Consecration. Tertullian hath a large Plea against the Academici, who denied the iudgement of Sense; wherein hee maintayneth the Truth of the Senses, and in proofe thereof hee manifesteth the Perfection of Christ his Senses in Seeing, Feeling, Tasting, Smelling; and at length
he falleth upon the point now in Question, saying that Tertul. de Ani∣mâ. cap. 7. ad finem. Quid agis, Academi∣ce procacissime? totū vitae statum evertis, ipsius Dei providen∣tiam excoecas—non licet in dubium Sensus istos revoca∣re, nè & in Christo de fide eorum deli∣beretur, nè forte di∣catur, quod falsò Pa∣tris vocem audierit de ipso testificatam, aut deceptus sit, cum Petri socrum teti∣git: aut alium posteà vnguenti senserit spiritum, quod in se∣pulturam suam ac∣ceptavit: alium po∣steà Vini saporem, quod in sanguinis sui memoriam consecravit. Sic enim & Marcion Phantasma um maluit credere, totius corporis in eo dedignatus veritatem: Atqui nè in Apostolis quidem ludificata natura est, fidelis fuit & visus, & auditus in Monte, fidelis & gustus Vini in nuptijs, fidelis tactus Thomae: Recita testationem Iohannis; Quod audivimus, inquit, quod o∣culis vidimus, & manus nostae contrectarunt de sermonevitae. Falsa vtique testatio, si culorum & aurium, & manuum sensus natura mentitur. If wee yeild not to the suffrages of Senses, some may doubt whether Christ perceiued afterwards another Sent of oyntment, which hee received (meaning another than the naturall Sent thereof) before his Buriall. And immediatly he addeth, (marke we pray you) One might doubt also whether Christ tasted afterwards another taste of Wine, than was that, which he consecrated for the memoriall of his blood. That then, which Christ Tasted, was first Consecrated. Next, he invadeth the Heretique Marcion, for denying the Truth of Christ's Bodie on earth, and confuteth him by the fidelity of the Senses of the Apo∣stles. Faithfull (saith hee) was their sight of Christ in the Mount, Faithfull was their Tast of Wine at the Marriage, Faithfull was the Touch of Thomas, &c. (then concluding:) which Testifications (saith he) had not beene True, if their senses had beene Liars. So he in his confutation not onely of the naturall Academici, but also of the Hereticall Marcionites, who (contrary to the demonstration of the Apostles Senses) denied the truth of the humane Body of Christ. CHALLENGE. THis Apologie of Tertullian, in behalfe of the verity of the Senses, doth minister to all Christians fower Conclusions. First, not to conceit of Accidents without Subiects: but to discerne of Subiects, and Substances, by their Accidents. Secondly, that our Outward Senses rightly constituted (more especially the Sense of Feeling) are Demonstrations of Truth in Sensible Obiects. Thirdly, that this verification of Subiects, by their Accidents, is common with Christ, his Apostles, all Christians, and with every reasonable man. And lastly, that Wine is to be discerned to be truly and natu∣rally Wine, after Consecration, by the iudgement of the Senses, be∣cause he instanceth in this very point: teaching that Christ had the same taste of Wine afterwards, which hee had before in that, which he consecrated; even as hee had also the same Sent of Oynt∣ment after, which hee had before his Buriall. And all this even now, when he convinced Marcion of Heresie, an Enemy to the Ca∣tholique Faith, in denying the Truth of Christ's humane naturall Body, notwithstanding the Evidence of Man's Senses. Here had beene a full and flat Evasion for that Heretique to say, what tell you us of the validitie of the Evidence of two Senses, con∣cerning the Truth of Christ's Body, seeing you your-selves gain-say the iudgement of foure Senses at once, in denying the Existence
of Bread in this Sacrament? This, we say, they must needs have re∣plyed, if that the Catholiques then had beene of your now Romane Beliefe, to thinke that all the Sences are deceived, in iudging the matter of this Sacrament to continue Bread or Wine; and so might they have blowne away all this Catholique Confutation of He∣retiques and Infidels with one and the same breath. Come now hither all yee that say we must renounce all Verdict of Senses in this Case; and tell us whether any Protestant could have beene more opposite to your Doctrine than was Tertul∣lian, in his Defence of this Truth? whereby hee also defendeth the Catholique Doctrine of the Resurrection of Christ, and was never heereof questioned by any Catholique, in, or since his daies. Let none of you obiect that of the Disciples, in their way to Em∣maus with Christ, of whom it is said that [Luc. 24. 16. They could not know him:] for the same Text giveth this Cause, that their eyes were hol∣den, lest they should see him: and after, Ib. vers. 31. Their eyes were opened, and they saw him. So the Evangelist, which is so farre from infrin∣ging any thing that hath beene said, for the Infallibility of Sence, rightly constituted and disposed, that this thereby is notably con∣firmed. Wee call vpon Hierome to witnesse, saying; Hieron. ad Pam∣mach: contra Err∣res Iohan. Ierusal. E∣pisc. Scias errorem fuisse non Corporis Domini, sed oculo∣rum fuise clausorum: nam aperti sunt o∣culi eorum, & vide∣bant. The Error of not discerning Christ, when he was in the midst betweene them, was not in Christ's Body, but in their eyes, because they were closed that they could not see. Apply wee this unto the Eucharist. Dare any Pa∣pist say, that the Cause, why any of you cannot see Christ in this Sacrament, is not in his Bodie (which you beleeve to be in it selfe invisible) but in your Eyes, as being shut vp; when notwithstan∣ding you will be knowne, that these are open enough for discer∣ning Colours, and formes of Bread and Wine? Our Fourth Proofe, that the Substance of Bread remaineth, after Consecration, is taken from the Con∣fessed Sensible Effects. SECT. X.

Suarez. ibid. your selves have discerned to be sometimes in this Sacrament, are these. First, That the Cup doth inebriate, or make drunke. Secondly, The Hoast taken in great Quantity doth nourish. Thirdly, That, it being poysoned, it poyso∣neth. Fourthly, That having beene long reserved, It engendreth wormes, which are bred out of it; and are also fed of the same. Fiftly, That their matter of Generation and nourishment is Substantiall; and that the Contrary Opinion is false, and Incredible. Sixtly, That this matter, whereof wormes are bred and fed, is the same Bread, which was taken before Consecration. So your owne prime Schoole-men, Historians, and Iesuites respectively.
If then the Bread, now ingendring wormes, be the Same that was taken to be Consecrated; How say you that being Consecrated it is not still the same, our Senses giving Testimony thereunto? THE FIRST CHALLENGE. HEre you have nothing to answer, but that the Bread, where∣of new wormes are Bred, whether it be the same that was, or not; yet being Bread, it is wrought either by a Quomodò fiat haec materia.—Thomistae aliquot di∣cunt per Conversi∣onem aliquam in ip∣sum Panem: Alij ite∣rùm Creari; & hoc verius. Suarez. quo supra. Miracu∣lous Conversion, or by a New Creation. What? you, who every where teach that none are to conceipt of any Miracle in this Sa∣crament, without necessary Cause, can you possibly be perswaded that there is, or can be any necessary Cause, why God should worke a Miracle, either of Conversion into, or of New Creation of Bread, for Breeding, or Feeding of wormes? or of Wine, for making such men Drunke, as should tast too largely of the Cup? yea, or els to poyson our Enemy, were hee See above at (n) num. 3. Emperour, or Platina in vita Victoris. Henrici Re∣gis fraude (ut Marti∣nus scribit) veneno in Calicem iniecto, dum sacrificat, neca∣tur. See also above at (n) num. 3. Pope? Nay can it be lesse than Blasphemy to say that God worketh Miracles, for the accomplishment of vaine, wicked, and mischievous ef∣fects? But farre be it from vs to imagine that the Blessed Bo∣dy of our Lord Christ, who by his Touch cured so many disea∣ses, in the time of his mortality, should now, being glorified, mi∣raculously poyson his Guests whosoeuer they be. Beleeve (if you can) that if God wrought (as you say) a Miracle to convert Accidents into Bread, to engender, or nourish vile wormes, that hee would not much rather worke a miracle, (if any such miracle were herein to be expected) to hinder the poysoning of his faithfull Communicants. In all this wee appeale againe to true Antiquity, and require of you to shew, we say not some expresse Testimony of Primitive Fathers, but so much as any intimation or insinuation, were it but by way of a Dreame, of a Miraculous Con∣version of the Consecrated Host (when it beginneth to putrifie) by
being changed againe into Bread; or of Mice eating the Body of Christ, or that being putrified it should breed wormes; (seeing it were rather a miracle they should not be so bred) or any such kinde of Romish Fancies, and delusions; or otherwise to confesse your Obiectours to be miserable Proctours of a vile, and despe∣rate Cause. Yet lest any of your may thinke, that One comming into a Cellar full of new Wine, and made drunke with the smell there∣of, therefore meere Accidents doe Inebriate: your Iesuite will de∣ny this, and tell you that it is the In Cella Vica∣ria, novis vinis im∣pletâ, solus Ar odo∣re infectus inebriat. Coster. Ies. Christian. Institut. lib. 1. c. 8. Ayre infected with the o∣dour which maketh man Drunke. A SECOND CHALLENGE, with a Caution. YOur Common, and most plausible Obiection, to dementate vulgar people, is to perswade them that you cannot attribute Credit to your Senses in this case without much derogation from Faith. Therfore, for Caution-sake, be it knowne vnto you, that we have not pleaded for the Truth of Senses, as holding nothing Cre∣dible, but that, which may be proved by the Testimony of Senses. This we vtterly abhorre, as the Gulfe of Infidelity, proper to the Athean Sect: for wee accord to that saying of an holy Father, Fides non habet meritum, vbi Ratio aut Sensus habet experimentum; and also to that other of . Iustin. E∣posit. Fidei. Iustine. In which respect we condemne the Incredulity of Thomas, in that he would not beleeve, except he should See: yet notwithstanding we, with our Saviour, approve in Thomas, that by Seeing he did beleeve. For this is a true Tenet in Di∣vinity; Faith may be (Supra) above right reason, or sence; but ne∣ver (Contra) against either. It was never read that God required of any man a beleefe of any Sensible thing, which was Contrary to the exact iudgement of his Senses. And therefore your opposition, in this Case, as it is Sensles, so it is indeed Faithlesse; as we have already learned from Scripture and Fathers; by whom the Iudge∣ment of Sense hath beene acknowledged to be, in Sensible Obiects, a notable Ground of Faith. Our Fift Proofe, that Bread remaineth Bread in Substance, after Consecration, in this Sacrament, is by the Iudgement of Ancient Fathers. First from due Inferences. SECT. II. TEstimonies of Ancient Fathers inferre a necessary Conse∣quence, for proofe of the Existence of Bread and Wine in this Sacrament, as might be proved partly by the repetition of many Arguments premised, and partly by intimation of other Argu∣ments
afterwards expressed. But wee shall be content with those few which doe more properly appertaine to this present Dispute, concerning the nature of a Body. First Irenaeus, speaking of the Eucharist after Consecration, as being not now common Bread, said that Irenaeus lib. 4. cap. 34. Sicut Panis, qui est à terrâ, iam non Communis Panis est, sed Eucharistia, ex duabus rebus con∣stans terrenâ, & cae∣lesti: Sic Corpora nostra participan∣tia Eucharistiam iam non sunt Corrupti∣bilia, sed spem Resur∣rectionis habentia. It consisteth of an earthly part, and an heavenly: how? even as the Bodies of the Communicants (saith hee) are no more corrupti∣ble, having an hope of the Resurrection to come. Scan these words by the Law of Similitude, and it must infallibly follow, that as our Bodies, albeit substantially Earthly, are notwithstanding called In∣corruptible, in respect of the Glory and Immortality, in which (through hope) it hath an Interest; Even so the Earthly Substance of this Sacrament, being Bread, is neverthelesse indued with a sacred and Divine property of a Sacramentall Representation of Christ's Body. Which Sacrament Origen calling Sanctified meate, saith that the Origen. in Math. 15. Ille Cibus, qui sanctificatur per ver∣bum Dei & Oratio∣nem, iuxtà id quod habet materiale in secessum emittitur. And after hee calleth this [Materiale] Ma∣teria Panis, super quem dictus est Ser∣mo. Ibid. Materiall part thereof goeth into the Draught, or seege: which no sanctified heart can conceive of Christ's Body, whereof the Fathers often pronounce, that It goeth not into the Draught. But what is meant by, Materiall, in this place, thinke you M. Liturg. Tract. 2. §. 11. Subd. 3. Breerly? namely, Magnitude, and other Sensible Accidents, which in regard of their Significations, are materialls. So hee. Very learnedly answered forsooth! If Magnitudo, that is Greatnes, be a Materiall thing, be you so good as tell us what is the matter there∣of? for whatsoever is Materiall, hath that appellation from it's Subiect matter. Is it the Body of Christ? then must you grant (which wee, with holy Fathers abhorre to thinke) that the Body of Christ passeth into the Draught: or is it Bread? Then farewell Transubstantiation. Nay, will you say, but they were Accidents; And we Answer, that it was never heard, no not in your owne Schooles, that meere Accidents were called (which are Origen's words in this place) either Meates, or Materialls. Yea, and O∣rigen (that hee might bee knowne to understand Materiall Bread) furthermore calleth it now, after Consecration, Matter of Bread. S. Ambrose his Comparison is of like Consequence; Ambros. l. 4. de Sa∣cram. cap. 4. Quanto magis est operatori∣us sermo Christi, ut sint quae erant, & in aliud convertantur?—Tu eras vetus Creatura, posquam Consecratus, nova Creatura esse coe∣pisti. As one Baptized had beene an old Creature, and was made a new one, euen so (speaking of the Bread and Wine after Consecration) they being changed into another thing, remaine that which they were before. But hee (you know) that was baptized remaineth after Baptisme in Substance the same man, although, in respect of Spirituall Gra∣ces, hee suffereth a Change. Of which Testimone more See below, Chap. 4. Sect. 2. at the let (c.) here∣after. Cyprian is a Father much alleadged and urged by you, in de∣fence of Transubstantiation; but is now at hand to controll you. Cyprian. lib. de Vn∣ctione. Dedit Domi∣nus noster in mensâ, in qua ultimum Con∣vivium cùm Aposto∣lis participavir, pro∣prijs manibus Pa∣nem & Vinum: in Cruce verò manibus militum corpus tra∣didit vulnerandum, ut in Apostolis secre∣tiùs impressa sincera veritas & vera sin∣ceritas exponeret Gentibus, quomodò Panis & Vinum Ca∣ro eius essent & san∣guis, & quibus rationibus Causae effectis convenirent, & diversa nomina, vel species ad unam reducerentur essentiam, ut significantia & significata eisdem vocabulis conserentur. Our Lord gave in this Banquet (saith he) Bread and Wine with his
owne hands, when hee pertaked thereof with his Apostles: but on the Crosse hee delivered vp his Body to the Souldiers to be pierced with wounds, to the end that sincere verity, and true sincerity having an in∣ward impression in the Apostles, hee by them might manifest to the Gentiles, how that Bread and wine is his Body and Blood, and by what meanes there may be agreement betweene Causes, and Effects; and how different names and formes might be reduced to one Essence; that things signifying, and things signified might be called by the same names. So hee. A Catholique Father, as all know; whom if you aske, what Consecrated thing it was, which Christ had in his hands, and gave to his Disciples, hee answereth it was Bread, and Wine; and not absolutely that, which hee gave up to be Crucified on the Crosse by Soldiers, (namely) his Body, and Blood. If againe you demand of Cyprian, why Christ called the Bread, which hee had in his hand, his Body, he readily answereth saying: The things signifying (or Signes) are called by the same names, whereby the things signifyed are termed.

Protestant of admirable learning unfolded unto you the Iudgement of Antiquity, from the Testimonies of divers Fathers, in saying of this Sacrament, after Consecration, that The bread, by being divided, is diminished: that, It is delivered by fragments: that these are so little, that they are to be called rather Bitts then Parts. Thus they spake expressly of Bread Consecrated; but to say that you eate bitts and Fragments of whitenes, of Roundnes, and other Accidents, who is so absurd among your selves? And to affirme the same of Christs body, who is so impious? Somewhat more of this, when we shall appeale to the Canon of that famous Councell of Belowe in the fourth Booke. Ch. 9. Nice. Another Inference we may take from Antiquity, in her calling this Sacrament [Pignus] a Pledge (so Hieron. in 1. Cor. 11. Dominus passio∣nis suae ultimam no∣bis Commemoratio∣nem, & memoriam reliquit, quemad modùm siquis peregrè proficiscens aliquod pignus ei, quem diligit, derelin∣quat, ut possit eius amicitias, & benficia commemorate. Hierome, and Gaudent Tract. 20. Christus crucifigendus istud haereditarium munus Testamenti eius Novi, tanquàm Pignus suae Praesentiae, dereliquit. Gauden∣tius) of the Presence of Christ now departed from us. A Perfect Ar∣gument of the Bodily Absence of Christ, by virtue of the Relation betweene the Person and his Pledge. The third and last Classis of Fathers may be viewed in the Section following. A Confirmation of the same Iudgement of the Fathers, acknow∣ledging in expresse tearmes Bread to remaine after Con∣secration, in Substance, the same. The First Father is THEODORET. SECT. XII. THeodoret maketh a Dialogue, or Conference betweene two Parties, being in Controversie about the humane and bodily
nature of Christ; the one is named Eramstes, upon whom is impo∣sed the person of an Heretike, for Defence of the Sect of the Eu∣tychians, who (falsly) held, That the Body of Christ, after his As∣cension, being glorified, was swallowed up of his Deity, and continued no more the same humane and Bodily Essence, as before his Resurrecti∣it had beene. The other Party and Disputer is named Or∣thodoxus, signifying the Defender of the Truth of the Catholique Doctrine; which Person Theodoret himselfe did sustaine, in behalfe of the Catholique Church. In this Dispute the Heretike is brought in, for Defence of his Heresie, arguing thus; Even as Signes in the Eucharist after the words of Invocation (or Consecration) are not the same, but are changed into the Body of Christ: Even so, after his As∣cension, was his Body changed into a Divine [,] meaning, Substance of a Divine Essence. Which both your Romanists and Protestants confesse to have beene the Doctrine of these Heretikes. This was that Heretike his Obiection. The Orthodoxe, or Catholique (which was Theodoret himselfe) commeth to answer, promising to catch the Heretique, as he saith, in his owne Snare, by retorting his Argument of Similitude against him, thus: Thd. Dial. 2. c. 24. Non post sanctifi∣cationē mystica signa . Paulo post. Sic illud Corpus Christi priorē habet Formam, Figuram, Circumscriptionem, & (ut summatim di∣cam) ] etiamsi post re∣surrectionem immor∣tale, & immune ab omni corruptione. Nay, But as the mysticall Signes in the Eucharist, after Sanctification, depart not from their former na∣ture, but continue in their former Figure, Forme and [] that is, Substance. So the Body of Christ, after the Resurrection, remaineth in its former Figure, Forme, Circumscription, and [, or Substance] which it had before. You may perceive that the Assertion, set downe in the name of a grand Heretike, is absolutely your Romish Profes∣sion for Transubstantiation at this day (to wit) Bread is changed af∣ter Consecration into the Substance of Christ's Body; and that also the Assertion of Theodoret, in the person of the Catholique Professor, being flat contradictory, is as absolutely the Doctrine of Prote∣stants, defending that Bread after Consecration remaineth in Substance the same. Wherefore, if ever, it now concerneth your Disputers to free your Romish Article from Heresie:) which divers have under∣taken to doe by their Answeres, but alas! so absurdly, that any reasonable man must needs laugh at; and so false, as which any man of conscience must as necessarily detest them. The Principall Answere is that, which your Non loquitur de substantiâ quae distin∣guitur contra Acci∣dentia, & quam in Categoricâ posuit A∣ristoteles; sed de Es∣sentiâ, & naturâ Ac∣cidentium. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch c. 27. §. Sed me. Cardinall giveth, that Theodoret, in saying that Bread remayneth the same in Figure, Forme, and [; By ] meant not Substance properly understood, but the essence of Accidents. So hee. An Answere (by your leave) notoriously, ridiculously, and heretically False. First, Notoriously false, because the Argument of Theodoret, being taken from a Similitude, and every Similitude consisting of two Propositions, the first called Protasis, and the other Apodosis, it is necessary by the Rule of Logique (as you know) that the words and termes, betokening the same Similitude, be used in the same signification in both Propositions. But in the Apodosis of Theodo∣ret, which is this: So the Body of Christ, after the Resurrection, re∣maineth
the same in Figure, Forme, and ; by the word [] was meant properly Substance, because this was , the maine point in Question betweene Theodoret and the Heretique; viz. whether the Substance of Christ's Body continued the same, which it had beene in time before his Resurrection (the Heretique denying it, and Theodoret proving it to be absolutely still the same in Substance:) and not whether the same only in Quantities, and Accidents; for these the Apostle teacheth to be alterable, 1. Cor. 15. . Cor∣ruption putting on Incorruption, Mortality Immortality, and shame Glory. Therefore in the Protasis and first Proposition of that com∣parison of Theodoret (which was this, As the Bread remaineth the same in Figure, Forme and ) the word [] can have no other signification than Substance, properly taken. Secondly, Ridiculously false, because in reckoning Figure and Forme, which are knowne to be Accidents, and adding [] this necessarily is opposed to the former Two, as Substance to Acci∣dents. Nor was there (we suppose) ever any so vnlearned, who did adde the word [,] to Formes, and Figures, but hee thereby meant to distinguish it as a Substance from its Accidents. Thirdly, Heretically false; for what was the Heresie of the E∣tychians? tell us; They (say Alphonsus à Ca∣stro de haeres. Eutych. Negabant Christum habuisse naturam hu∣manam; tantùm i eo ponentes naturā divinam. you) held that Christ (namely after his Resurrection) had not an humane nature, but only Divine. Which word Humane Nature doth principally imply the Substantiall na∣ture of Man; and therefore in his comparison, made for the illu∣stration of that Heresie concerning Bread, after Consecration, in Fi∣gure, Forme, and [] the same word [] had the same signi∣fication of Substance, as your Master Brereley afterwards is com∣pelled to confesse: who, to the end hee may disgrace Theodoret, rudely and wildly taketh upon him to iustifie the Heretiques speech to be Catholique, for proofe of Transubstantiation. Wherefore Theodoret, in his Answere Retorting (as he himselfe saith) the Heretiques Comparison against him, did by  likewise understand Substance, else had he not disputed ad Idem; but by a shamefull Tergiversation had betraid his Catholique Cause unto that pernitious Heretique. Much like as if one should use this comparison following. As the Moone-shine in the water (in the o∣pinion of the Vulgar) is truly of the same bignesse with the Moone in the Firmament; so a feigned friend is equally as loving as is a Faithfull. And another retorting the same should confute him, saying; Nay, but as the Moon-shine in the water is not of the same bignesse with the Moone in the Firmament; even so a feigned friend is not equally loving as is a Faithfull. Here the word [Love] being taken for Loyall Affection by the Objectour, if the sense thereof should be perverted by the Answerer and Retorter, to signifie lust, the Disputers might be held to be little better than those Two in Alter hircū mul∣ge: alter cribram supponit. Agellius, where such an Obiectour is compared to a man mil∣king
an Hee-Goat, (or if you will, a Bull) and the Answerer to ano∣ther holding under a Sive. Here had wee fixed a Period, but that wee againe espied one Master Brerely (a Romish Priest) comming against us with a full ca∣reere, who after that he had beene Ʋid. Protestants Appeale, Booke 2. Ch. 2. § 0. confuted, for urging the for∣mer Obiection, notwithstanding, concealing the Answere, he blu∣sheth not to regest the same; albeit, as one conscious to himselfe of the futility thereof, he leaveth it presently, falling foule upon Theodoret, as though that Father had beene in some distemper, when he so writ: In his Liturgie of the Masse. Tract. 2. §. 2 subd. 3 p. 254. saying, first, that Theodoret used that his Retor∣tion in his Not so, for he was now not in a personall dispute, but deliberate∣ly writing against the Heresie of the Euty∣chians. heate of Dispute. Then hee taketh part with the Here∣tique, saying, It is not likely that an Heretique should have urged a∣gainst a Catholique sentence for Transubstantiation, as for a point of Faith well knowne, if the same doctrine had beene then either un∣knowne, or else condemned as False. So hee, who might as well have reasoned in the behalfe of the Sadduces, condemned by Christ, saying: It is not likely that they would so expressely have denied that there are any Spirits, in their Dispute against Christ, if that Doctrine had beene then either unknowne, or condemned as False by the Church of God among the Iewes. And yet it is certaine that the Heresie of the Sadduces was iudged execrable in that Church. Now if the Euty∣chian Heretique finde such Patronage at the hands of your Priest, alas! what will become of the Father Theodoret? Hearken, Theodoret being an Orthodoxe Bishop (saith hee) could not have pro∣pounded the Heretikes Argument, as grounded upon the Churches re∣ceived Doctrine of Transubstantiation, had the same beene then un∣knowne, and reputed False. So hee, who, if he had not lost his Lo∣gique, would certainly have argued contrarily, saying; Theodoret, being an Orthodoxe and Catholique Bishop, would never have set downe an Objection for Transubstantiation in the name of a ranke Heretique, and after himselfe impugned and confuted the same, except he had knowne it to be flatly repugnant to the Catholique Church in his time. Wherefore if you be men of Faith, and not rather of Faction, let the miserable perplexities of your Disputers, discovered both here, and throughout this whole Treatise, move you to renounce them, as men of prostituted Consciences; and their Cause, as for∣lorne of all Truth. For a further Evidence, take unto you an Answere of your Ie∣suite Valenia to this and the like Testimonies of Antiquity: It is not to be held any marvell (saith Valent. Ies. lib. 2. de Transub. c. 7. Dabi∣mus aliud breve, & simplex, & sine ullo incommodo respon∣sum. Enimverò ante∣quam quaestio ista de Transubstantiatione palàm in Ecclesia a∣gitaretur, minime mirùm est si unus, aut alter, aut etiam aliqui minùs considerate, & rectè hac de resense∣rint, & scripserint; maximè cum non tractarent ex institu∣to ipsam quaestionē. he) why some Ancients have writ, and thought lesse considerately and truly, before that Transubstantia∣tion was handled publikely in the Church, especially they not handling the same Question of purpose. So he; and this hee calleth a briefe and plaine Answere. And so it is, whereby, in granting that Tran∣substantiation had not beene so Anciently handled in the Church, hee plainly confuteth your now Romane Church, which iudgeth
it to have beene alwayes an Article of Faith: And affirming that the same Fathers Handled not the point of purpose, it is as plainly confuted by Theodoret, who in this Dispute did not argue against the Heretique in an extemporall speech personally, but deliberately and punctually by writing, and therefore of Purpose. The Second Father, expresly defending the Existence of Bread in this Sacrament, after Consecration, is Pope GELASIVS. SECT. XIII. THis Authour haue Protestants called Pope Gelasius, and ur∣ged his Testimony. Your Disputers cavill; First at the name of the Authour, calling Protestants Non fuit hic Papa Gelasius, ut Ad∣versarij impudentèr iactant; sed Gelasius Caesariensis Episco∣pus. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. c. 27. Impudent, for stiling him Pope Gelasius. But if he were not that Pope Gelasius, what Gelasius might hee be then? Gelasius Bishop of Caesarea, saith your Cardi∣nall Bellarmine. Contrarily your Cardinall Baronius himselfe contendeth that it was not that Pope Gelasius Anno 496. num. 123. &c. yet comming to answer to the Sentence of Gelasius, doth ex∣pound the doubtfull wordes thereof by the Phrases of Pope Ge∣lasius ex Epist. ad Pi∣cenos, & Dardan. E∣pisc. num. 13, 14. which Epistles he before cited, as the true Epistles of Pope Gelasius. Anno 493. num. 23. and An∣no 494. num. 2. And after Anno 496. num. 17. telleth his Reader, saying: Vides, Lector, ex vsu verborū Phra∣siqúè dicendi Gelasij Papae, & alia eius sententia perspicuè demonstratum esse, &c. Et Anno 496. num. 13. Gelas. in Epist. ad Picen. ait, Peccato Originali substantiam ho∣minis esse depravatam, cum tamen eadem substantia mansit, & Accidentia; utpote iustitia originalis, & alia dona erant corrupta. Baronius contendeth that he is a more ancient Gelasius, Anno 476. (namely) Gelasius Ci∣tizenus; yet so, as confounding himselfe, insomuch that hee is for∣ced to expound the speeches of this Gelasius by the propriety of the speech (as he confesseth) of Gelasius Pope of Rome. But what shall we answere for the Impudent Protestants, as your Cardinall hath called them? Surely nothing, but wee require more modesty in him, who hath so called them; considering that Protestants had no fewer Guides, nor meaner to follow than these Gelasius Papa scripsit contra Eutychetem. Genad. de scriptoribus Eccles. c. 14. Anastas. de vita Gelasij. Margarinus de la Bigne lib. 5. Biblioth. Patrum p. 467. Masson. de Episc. Rom. in vita Gelasij. Alphons. lib. de haeres. Tit Christus. haeres. 3. in fine. Onuphrius de Creat. Pontif. & Cardin. Gelasius (inquit) scripsit volumen adversus Eutychetem, & Nestorium. Fusse Caesariensem Episcopum, non posse jure affirmari, videtur. And pro∣veth, why not. Historians, viz. Genadius, yea your Bibliothecarie Anastasius, Alphonsus de Castro, Onuphrius, Massonius, Margarinus la Bigne: all which have in∣tituled this Gelasius Pope of Rome. Howsoever, it is confessed on all sides, that he was an Orthodoxe Father, and very Ancient. Now then, Gelasius said that Gelasius lib. de duab. natur. cont. Eutych. Sacramenta certa, quae sumimus corporis & sanguinis Christi divina res est, propter quod per eadem divinae efficimur participes naturae, & tamen non desinit esse substantia vel natura panis, & vini; & certè imago & similitudo corporis & sanguinis Christi in Actione mysticâ celebratur. And againe. Permanentin proprietate naturae. The Sacraments of the Body, and Blood of Christ, being Divine things, yet cease not to be the nature and substance of Bread, and Wine. In Answere whereunto, both your foresaid Bellar. & Baron. quo suprà. At dicit Gelasius, In Divinam tanseunt Spiritu sancto perficiente substantiam, permanent tamen suâ proprietate naturae. [By this it may be seene, indeed, that this Gelasius was a Latine Authour, (but what is this to the Greeke Theodoret?) when the Latine Language was not so perfect, and that he did use the word equivocally, but yet so, that the matter it selfe doth challenge a proper use thereof, when he speaketh of the Substance of Bread.] Cardinals here, (as before) by Substance interpret Accidents: one of them labouring to prove that Gelasius some∣where else called Accidents, Substances. Were this granted, yet
the Argument, which Gelasius hath in hand, will compell the un∣derstanding Reader to acknowledge in this his Sentence a proper signification of Substance. For whereas the Heretique Eutyches taught that Christ his Body was changed into the Substance of his Divinity, after the Resurrection, and that the substance of his Body remained no more the same; Gelasius confuteth him by a Simili∣tude, and Comparison, viz. That as the Substance of Bread remai∣neth after Consecration: So Christ his Bodily Substance remained af∣ter the Resurrection. Wherein if the word, Substance, be not in both places taken properly, Gelasius should have made but a mad Rea∣son, as any reasonable man will confesse. For albeit Similitudes doe not amble alwayes on foure feet, yet if they halt upon the right foot (which is the matter in Question) they are to be accoun∣ted perfit Dissimilitudes. Master Master Brereley Liturg. Tract. 2. §. 2. Subd. 3. p. 259. Brereley would have you to know, that this Gelasius (whosoever hee were) writeth against the same Eutychian Heresie, that Theodoret did; and thereupon useth accordingly, to his like ad∣uantage, the words Substance, and Nature in the same sence, as did Theodoret. So he. And he saith true; and therefore must wee assure our selves of the consent of this Gelasius with us, untill you shall be able to free your selves from our former Interpretation of Theodoret. But Mr. Brerely opposeth against us another sentence of Gelasius, from whence he concludeth that Gelasius held Transubstantiation: so that Gelasius must rather contradict himself, then that he shal not consent to the Romish Tenet. Whereas, indeed, hee saith no more than, in a mysticall sence, any Protestant must, and will allow, viz. that The Sacrament is a Divine thing, and that whosoever eate spiritually the Body of Christ, are by it made partakers of the blessing of his Di∣vine Nature, which dwelleth in Christ bodily, saith the Apostle. So Gelasius. To which saying of Gelasius, touching the Eucharist, is answe∣rable a like saying of Gregory Nyssen, concerning Baptisme, calling it a Greg. Nyssen. A∣quam per benedicti∣onem sic mutari, ut divinum Lavacrū sit, à quò mirabiles exi∣stunt effectus. Orat. de Baptismo. Divine Laver, working miraculous effects. Yea, and Diony∣sius the Dionys. Hierarch. Eccles. cap. 3. . §. . Areopagite bestowed the same Attribute, viz. Divine, upon the Altar, the Symbols, the Priest, the People, and the Bread it selfe in the Eucharist. If therefore the Epithet [Divine] must argue a Corporall Change, what a number of Transubstantiati∣ons must you be inforced to allow? Fie upon blind boldnesse! This mans falsity, in alledging Chemnitius, I let passe. It is further worthy your Reflection, to observe your Disputers how earnest they have bin to prove that this Author was not Pope Gelasius; contrary to the acknowledgement of your owne Histo∣rians. May wee not therefore suspect that the Testimony obiected was distastfull unto them, when they so greatly feared, lest this Witnesse should be thought to have beene a Pope and Supreame Pa∣ster of your Church?
Two other Testimonies from Antiquity, for the expresse acknow∣ledgement of the Existence of Bread after Consecra∣tion, in the Sacrament; Chryso∣stome, and Bertram. SECT. XIIII. CHrysostome his words are these, that Chrysost. Ante Consecrationem Pa∣nem vocamus, Divi∣na verò gratiâ Sa∣cerdotis ministerio sanctificatur, & dig∣na appellatione Do∣minici Corporis ha∣betur, etsi natura Pa∣nis in ipso perman∣sit. Epist. ad Caesar. Bread after Consecrati∣on is freed from the name of Bread, being accounted worthy of the name of the Body of Christ, albeit the nature of it remaineth therein still. Your Exception is, that this Epistle is not extant among the workes of Chrysostome. This Answer might satisfie us, were it not that it was extant sometime in the Libraries of So our Peter Martyr. Florence, and So your Stephen Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester, lib 2. de Euch. as he is cited. Canterbury. To whom may be adioyned the Authour of that Vn∣perfect worke, still standing under the name of Chrysostome, and by you upon any occasion obiected against vs; wherein it is expressly said, that Author operis imperfecti, in Math. hom. 11. Si ergò haec vasa sanctificata ad priuatos usus trans∣ferre sit periculosum, in quibus non est Corpus Christi, sed mysterium Corpo∣ris eius continetur; quantò magis vasa Corporis nostri, quae sibi Deus ad habitan∣dum praeparavit? The True Body of Christ is not contained within these sanctified Vessels. It seemeth that your later Parisian Divines were offended with others, who would have these words utterly dashed out of their last Editions, which were published in the former; as you have beene admonished by one Dr. Iames in his Specimen corrupte∣larum, &c. Haec ver∣ba habentur in edi∣tione Antwerpianâ. Anno 1537. apud Ioh. Steelsium, & in Parisiensi An. 1543. apud Ioh. Roydwey, ut in Parisiensi aliâ apud Andraeam Par∣vum, Anno 1557. most worthy and able to ad∣vertise in this kind. Bertram is our next witnesse from Antiquity, being about 800. yeares agoe, and never noted of Errour antiently, untill these later times of Booke-butchery (that wee may so call your Bertramus Gal∣lus circa Annum Domini. 810. de Corpore & Sang.

Answeres to the Obiections of Romish Doctours, taken from the Testimonies of Antient Fathers, for Transubstantiation. Or, an Antidote to expell all their poysonsome Preten∣ces in that behalfe. SECT. I. THis our Antidote is compounded of five Ingredients, vsed for the Discovery of the Vnconscionablenes of your Dispu∣ters, in their Obiecting the Testimonies of Fathers under False pretences. First, upon their terming the mysticall Act A Worke of Omnipotencie. Secondly, their denying of the Eucharist to be Na∣ked, and Bare Bread. Thirdly, in forbidding the Communicants to rely vpon the Iudgement of their Senses. Fourthly, in their men∣tioning the Change of Bread and Wine, in this Sacrament, and cal∣ling it Transmutation, Transition, and the like. Fiftly and last∣ly in forcing of the speeches of Fathers, which may seeme to make for Transubstantiation, as absolutely spoken of the Sacra∣ment of the Eucharist, which the same Fathers doe apply as well to the Sacrament of Baptisme, and also to other sacred Rites, wherein you beleeve there is not any Substantiall Change at all. The First Vnconscionablenes of your Romish Disputers, in obie∣cting the Fathers speeches ofan Omnipotent Worke in this Sacrament, for proofe of Transubstantiation. SECT. II. A Worke of Omnipotencie is attributed by divers Fathers to the Change, which is made in this Sacrament, which wee like∣wise▪

[whereas Naturâ mutatus signifieth not the Substance, but the Condition: Et factus Caro, is no more than a Sacramentall and mysticall Being of the Body of Christ, as all other places of Cyprian shew.] Cyprian speaketh of a Change in nature, by divine Omnipotencie. Aug. de Trinitate, lib. 3. Non sanctificat ut sit magnum Sacramentum, nisi operante spiritu Dei, quae per illos cum haec omnia Corporales motus sint, Deus operatur. Ob. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 24. §. Sed Paulo. Augustine reckoning it among God's miracles, saith that This Sacrament is wrought by the Spirit of God. Accordingly we heare Chrysost. hom. 83. Non sunt humanae virtutis haec opera, quae tune in illâ Coenâ confecit, ipse nunc quo{que} operatur, ipse perficit, ministrorum nos ordinem tenemus: qui vera haec sanctificat at{que} transmutat ipse est. This is obiected by Mr. Breerly, Tract. 2. §. 2. Subd. 2. pag. 111 Liturg. Chrysostome proclaiming, that These are not workes of humane power: He that changeth, and transmuteth now is the same that he was in his last Supper. Each one of these Te∣stimonies are principally alleaged by your Disputers, as the stron∣gest fortresses for defence of your Article of Transubstantiation; and being taken altogether they are esteemed as a Bulwarke impreg∣nable; but why? See above in his obiecting of Ambrose. Because (saith your Cardinall) Omnipotencie is not required to make a thing to be a Signe Significant. Se he. We an∣swer first from your owne Confessions, and then from the Fa∣thers themselues. There are two workes observable in every Sacrament: one is to be not onely a Signe of an Invisible grace, promised by God: but also both a Seale and Pledge thereof, as all Protestants hold; and (as your most opposed Calvin. Semper memoriâ repetendum est Sacramenta nihil quàm Instrumentales esse conferendae nobis gratiae Causas. Antid. in Conc. Trid. Sess. 7. Can. 5. Calvin teacheth) an Instrumentall cause of conferring grace to the partakers of the Sacraments. In both which Respects there is required an Omnipotencie of a Divine work, with∣out which the Element cannot be changed into a Sacrament, either to signifie, or yet to seale, much lesse to convey any Grace of God unto man. And (that wee may take you along with vs)▪ It is the Doctrine of your Church, with common consent (saith your Romane Solus Deus (communi Consensu) instituere Sacra∣menta ex authoritate potest, quae gratiam efficiunt, aut etiam infallibiliter significant. Bellar. lib 1. de Sa∣cram in gen. cap. 23. Cardinall) that God only can by his Authority institute a Sacrament, because he onely can give them power of conferring grace, and of infal∣lible signification thereof. So hee. Well then, as well infallible Sig∣nification of Grace, as the efficacious conveyance of Grace is the worke of the same Omnipotencie. To this purpose more plainly your English Cardinall Alan, speaking (as he saith) from the iudgement of Divines, Card. Alan. de Sacram. in Gen. c. 17.  18. Sacramenti Institutionem ne{que} ad Pon∣tificem, ne{que} ad ullam Creaturā pertinere: nec hoc solum sed etiam, &c.—propter solam significationem Gratiae, quain Sacramentis omnibus Communem diximus, debebant eriam vetera Sacramenta determinari per appplicationem nortis Christi: quià licet quidem in Creaturis, ad signationem effectuum spiritualium, apti∣tudo quaedam sit, tmen ista aptitudo non nisi à divinainstitutione determinatur ad peculiarem effectum. Ha∣bet enim Aqua ex natura sua ut munditiem significet, at ut determinatè purgationem animae à peccato origi∣nali significet, & hominis sanctificationem repraesentet; divinaetantùm institutionis est, per quam elevatur Creatura haec supra naturae consutudinem, non solùm quoad vim operandi, sed etiam significandi. Non potest Sacramentum nisi à solo Deo Ordinari, quià habent Sacramenta Supernaturalem Effectum, ut in veterilege, quae dabant munditiem legalem. These (hee saith) that hee speaketh, Ex Theologorum Sententia. telleth you that Although there be an apt nes in every Creature to beare a signification of some spiritall effect, yet
cannot the aptnes be determinately applyed vnto any peculiar effect, n not so much as to signifie the outward Cleannes of man's Body (Sacra∣mentally) without a Divine Institution: much lesse to represent man's sanctification, but being so determinated and ordained of God, the Creature (saith hee) is elevated above the Custome of nature, not onely in respect of the worke of sanctification, but even of signification also. So hee; And that as well as we could wish: for this Omni∣potent Change of a Creature into a Sacrament, and this Instrumentall Cause of conferring Sanctifying Grace, to the Faithfull Communi∣cant, is the Generall Doctrine of all Protestants. But what Change shall wee thinke? Of the Substance of Bread into the Substance of Christ's Body, as you teach? No; but as Booke 2. Chap. 2 §. 7. before Isidore said, The Change of visible things, by the spirit of God, into a Sacrament of Christ's Body. Seeing then that both Divine power, and authority is required in every Sacrament, to make it either infallibly significant, or els efficaciously profitable to man; and that it is by the same Divine power that the Element is Changed, by being Elevated from a com∣mon, vnto a spirituall and divine property of a Sacramentall Signi∣fication, as one of your Cardinals hath said: What an uncon∣scionablenes is it then in your Disputers, from the termes of Om∣nipotencie and Divine working, which is necessary in all Sacraments, to conclude a Change of the Element of Bread, by Transubstantia∣tion, as you have heard. But much more transparent will their Vnconscionablenesse be, if we consult with the Obiected Fathers themselves. For first Am∣brose, who observeth an Omnipotency in the Change of this Sacra∣ment, explaineth himselfe what kind of Efficacy he meant, viz. such that Ambros. lib. 4. de Sacram c. 4. Si tanta vis est in sermone Domini, ut incipiant esse quae non erant, quantò magis Ope∣ratorius est, ut sint quae erant, & in aliud conuertantur —Tu ipse eras vetushomo, postquàm consecra∣tus eras, novus homo esse coepisti. The things changed into a divine Sacrament are still the same which they were before (namely) according to their naturall proper∣ty. Which one Clause doth so strangle all conceit of Transubstan∣tiation, that it may seeme you have some reason to wipe this Te∣stimony of Saint Ambrose out of your new These wordes are wanting in the Roman and Paris Editions Anno 1603. As Bishop Vsher witnesseth in his Answer to the Iesuite. Editions: notwith∣standing, by Gods providence, so much of Ambrose his tongue is preserved even in the same place, as will convince your Obiectors of wilfull Falshood, telling you by a Similitude that the Change of Bread in this Sacrament is like to the Change whereby a Christian Regenerate See above at (i.) of an old Creature is made a new Creature: which is (as euery Christian knoweth) not a change in the substantiall na∣ture of man, but in the Accidentall properties. So this Bread of of a common bodily Food is made Sacramentall. And the same Fa∣ther who said of a man, that by Baptisme hee is made a new Crea∣ture, saith also of this Sacrament, that Per Benedicti∣onē natura ipsa mu∣tatur. Ambros. De ijs qui mysterijs initian∣tur. where C. 9. e ad∣deth, for Explication; Corpus significatur. By Benediction Bread is made another nature, (namely) of an Elementall become Sacramen∣tall, as you have heard; and as his owne words import, After Consecration the Body of Christ is signified: and that, which was Wine, Is called Blood.
In the Testimony of Cyprian you applaude your selves, for to your Lindan Lindan. Aurea prors sunt Divi Cy∣priani verba—hc mihi advigilate, E∣vangelici, & Divum Cyprianum orbis to∣tius Doctorem, imò miraculum, iudicem incorruptibilem au∣dite. lib. 4 cap. 6. The wordes of Cyprian appeare Golden: and hee must needs provoke, forsooth, all Gospellers to hearken unto them: which also seemeth to your Hoc Testimo∣nium nullam admit∣tit Solutionem. Bel∣lar. lib. 2. de Euch. c. 9. §. Secundum. Cardinall To admit no solution. Our Answere first unto the Authour is to deny it to be the Testimony of Cyprian: may we not? This Sermon of the Supper of the Lord is by us (saith your Master Master Brerely Liturg. Praef. § 14 pag. 51. Brerely) attributed to Cyprian. Whom of your Side he meant by [Vs] you may be pleased to aske him; sure we are your Cardinall doth tell us that Author illius de Coena Domini non est Cyprianus, sed a∣liquis post eum. Bel∣lar. lib. 2. de Euch. c. 9. §. Extet. The Authour of this Booke is not Cyprian, but some other after him. But, not to disclaime your Authour; all that he saith is that Cyprian. de Coenae Dom. Panis iste natu∣râ mutatus omnipo∣tentiâ verbi factus est Caro, &c. Bread is chan∣ged by God's Omnipotency not in Figure, but in Nature. This is all; And all this hath beene, but even now, quitted by your owne Confessions, granting a power of Omnipotency in every Sacramen∣tall Change, where the naturall Element is altered from it's common habitude into the nature of a Spirituall Instrument and use, both signifying and exhibiting Divine Grace: and so the word Nature doth import. The Schooles, distinguishing the Nature of Acci∣dents from the Nature of Subiects, shew that there is an Accidentall Nature as well as a Substantiall. Theology teaching that Ephes. 2. 3. Au∣gust. Ipsam naturam aliter dicens: cum proptièloquimur na∣turam hominis incul∣pabilis factus est. By na∣ture we are the children of wrath; wherein Nature signifieth onely a vitious Quality. This saying, viz. Indifferent things in fact Change their nature, when they are commanded, Master Liturg. Tract. 4. §. 6. Brerely alloweth of, as for example: a Surplesse being commanded by lawfull Au∣thority, the use thereof becommeth necessary, so that the nature thereof is Changed, yet not in the Substance of the thing, but in the legall necessitie of the use. But to come nearer, Answer us but this one Question. Where∣as all learning alloweth this saying, that in Baptisme the nature of the Element, and the nature of the Sacrament are different, where∣upon it is said; The word comming to the Element maketh it a Sa∣crament: when we shall say of the water in Baptisme, that the Na∣ture of it, as of a Sacrament, is more excellent than is the nature of it, as it is a meere Element, whether doth not the word, Nature, attributed to the Sacrament, iustly accord unto the Phrase of Cy∣prian, in the case of the Eucharist? and so much the rather, because that Cyprian, in the words of immediatly following the Testimo∣ny obiected, doth fully confute Transubstantiation by a Similitude, comparing the Humanity, and Deity of Christ with the Naturall and Spirituall parts of this Sacrament, to wit; Et sicut in person Christi humanitas vi∣debatur, & latebat Divinitas; ità Sacra∣mento visibili ineffa∣bilitèr divina se ef∣fundit essentia. Au∣thor Cn. Ibid. §. Quarto. As in Christ himselfe true humanity appeared in his flesh, and his Deity was hid: (This was the , and first part of this Similitude; the , and next part followeth) Even so in this visible Sacrament the Divine Essence infuseth it selfe. So hee, which, by the law of a Similitude, must stand thus: Even so Bread in this Sacrament is seene, and the Spirituall operation of God's power therein to the Faithfull is Invisible. Like as we may say of the preaching of the Word of God to the Faithfull; The words are audible, and sen∣sible,
but because of the inward working of God's Spirit, for the Conversion of Man's soule, it is called Rom. 1. 16. The Power of God unto salvation: as likewise Baptisme is made the Lavacre of Regenera∣tion; whereof Greg. Nyssen affirmeth that Greg. Nyssen. O∣rat. de Baptismo. Divi∣num Lavacrum mag∣num quid operatur per Benedictionem, & mirabiles producit Effectus. It worketh marvellously by benediction, and produceth marvellous Effects. As for Augustine, and Chrysostome (not to be superfluous) every Protestant doth both beleeve and professe, namely, a Divine Operation of God, both by changing the Element into a Sacrament, and working by that Sacra∣ment Spirituall Effects, to the good of Man's soule. The second Vnconscionablenesse of Romish Disputers, in abuse of the Testimonies of Ancient Fathers, is seene in objecting their de∣niall of Common and Bare Bread in this Sacra∣ment, for an Argument of Tran∣substantiation. SECT. III. TO this purpose Irenaeus, saying that Irenaeus lib. 4. con∣tra Her. c. 34. Non est Panis Cōmunis. Bel∣lar. Obijcit l. 2. de Euch. per totum. It is not Common Bread: Ergo (say you) not to be properly iudged by Sense. Vncon∣scionably, knowing that Sol. Chrysost. in Ps. 22. hom. 16. De aqua Baptismi. Non est a∣qua Communis. Chrysostome (and also all other Fathers whom you moreover obiect) saith likewise of the Sacrament of Baptisme, See in this Sect. lit. (. h) Wee are to behold it not as common water. The second i Iustine Martyr, saying; Bellar. Ob. Iustin. Mart. l. 2. Apol. , &c. Sol. Ratio. quià , id est, Eucharisticatus, sivè sanctificatus Cibus. We receive these not as Common Bread, or Common Drinke. Therefore (say you) we may not iudge them by Sence. Vnconscionably; knowing that Iustine Martyr in the same place sheweth his Reason, why it is not to be called Common, euen because (saith he) it is [] that is, Sanctified meate. And so Water in Baptisme is Sanctified, as you know. The third is Cyril of Ierusalem, saying, Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. c. 1. Ob. Cyril. Hieros. Catech. 18. . Sol. Idem Catech. 18. . Consider these, not as Common Bread and Wine: Ergò (say you) not to be iudged by Sense. Vnconsciona∣bly, knowing that the same Cyril, in the same place, saith the same of the water of Baptisme: It is not simple Water. Yea, but he further saith (say Ob Cyri. mystag. 3. . you) Thinke not of it, as of bare Bread (adding) but the bo∣dy of Christ. Ergò (say you) not to be iudged otherwise by Sense. Vn∣conscionably; knowing that the same Father in the same place, for explanation sake, saith likewise of Sol. Sequitur: . Idem Cat. Mystag. 3. Sacred Oyle, viz. Even so that ho∣ly Oyle is not bare and simple Oyle (Adding) but the gift of Grace. And that your Authours Vnconscionablenesse may be the more notorious, in their wresting of the Catholique meaning of the Fa∣thers, in this kind, wee must tell you that there is no speech more familiar unto ancient Fathers than to esteeme, as they ought, all Sa∣cramentall Signes Sacred; and therefore no more Common, or bare Elements. Insomuch that Gregory Nyssen, speaking of a Ceremony inferiour to this Sacrament, which is the Altar, or Table of the Lord, he saith that Greg. Nyssen. Al∣tare hoc sanctum, cui adfistimus, lapis est naturâ Communis, nihil differēs ab alijs crustis lapideis, ex quibus pavimeta nostra exornantur: Sed quoniam Dei cultui consecratur, & dedicatur, & benedictionem accepit, mensa facta, & Altare immaculaum est. Orat. de Sancto Baptisme. Et nè contemnas divi∣num Lavacrum, neque id Commune putes, &c. Although by nature it be but as other stone,
wherewith the Pavements are garnished, and adorned; yet being Con∣secrated to God's Service, by Benediction, it is an holy Table and Altar. Yea, and what lesse doth your Church say of your hallowed Bal∣some, Beads, and Bels, and the like, all which you distinguish from Common, and bare Oyles, and Metalls, because of their different use; and service, without Opinion of any Change of Substance at all? The third Vnconscionablenesse of your Disputers in urging, for proofe of Transubstantiation, the Testimonies of Ancient Fathers, forbidding men to [Discerne of this Sacra∣ment by their Senses.] And first of their abusing the Testimony of Cyril, by two egregious Falsifications. SECT. IV. VVE may not easily passe over your Obiection taken out of Cyril, being in the opinion of your Cardinall so impreg∣nable; Let us first heare your Obiector. Cyrilli Testimo∣nium vel solum suffi∣cere deberet, est n. huius Sancti, & anti∣quissimi, & ex opere eius indubitato, & clarissimum & aper∣tissimum, ut nullo mo∣do perverti possit; & est in Catechesi, in quâ solēt omnia pro∣priè & simplicitèr ex∣plicari, & deniqué nemo unquā repre∣hendit Cyrillum er∣roris alicuius circa Eucharistiam. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 13. This Testimony of Cyril alone ought to suffice, being the Sentence of an holy man, and most an∣cient, out of a worke which (unquestionably) was his, yea and most cleare, and plaine, as that it cannot be perverted: Besides it is in his Catechisme, wherein the use of all things is delivered simply, properly, and plainly: Nor was this Father Cyril ever reproved of Errour in his doctrine of the Eucharist. Thus farre your Cardinall, you see, with as accurate an oratory of Amplification, as could be invented. What Protestant would not now, if ever, expect a deadly blow from this Father to our Catholique Cause? but attend to the Issue. First, Cyril. Pro cer∣tissimo habeas Panē hunc, qui videtur à nobis, Panem non esse, etiamsi gustus Panem esse sense∣rit, sed esse Corpus Christi—Rursus. Christus cui creda∣mus, Panem in Cor∣pus Transmutavi—Nam sub specie Pa∣nis datur tibi corpus: sub specie Vini da∣tur tibi sanguis. Ca∣tech. Mystag. 4. Cyril will not allow a man to credit his Taste, but although Tast saith it is Bread, yet undoubtedly to believe it to be the Body of Christ, whereinto the Bread is changed. And hee is brought in by your Cyrillus apertè ponit Transmutatio∣nem Panis in corpus Christi, & solas spe∣cies Panis remanere post Transmutationem, quià dicit Corpus Domini sub spece Panis sumi, distinguens Corpusd Pane. Bellar l de Euch. cap. 13. adding; Hoc est Apertissimum Argumentum. Cardinall to averre furthermore that The Body of Christ is given under the forme of Bread. And so the Sentence seemeth to be most manifest, saith he. But for what wee pray you? That first (forsooth) the Change is the same with Transubstantiation: and secondly that there is no more Substance of Bread, but Accidents under the forme of Bread. So hee, and Master Liturg. Tract. 2. §. 2. Sub'd. 4. pag. 116. Brerely from him, as followeth; Cyril saith, under the forme of Bread his Body is given, &c. and then dancing in the same triumph, addeth; Can any Catho∣lique of this Age write more plainly? So he. And we answere, could any Iugglers deale more falsly? For upon due examination it will appeare to be a manifest Delusion, by a false Translation of Cyril's words. The Body of Christ is given (as your Cardinall doth render
it) sub specie Panis, under the forme of Bread; whereas it is in the Greeke, Cyril. . Catech. Mystag. 4. Rursus. Mystag. 5. Non existimetis vos gustare Panem, & Vi∣num, . Vnder the Type of Bread: even as hee saith afterwards; Thinke not that you taste Bread, but the Antitype of Christ's Body. In both, [, or ] not, [:] Type, and Antitype, not Forme, or Figure of Bread. Now there is a maine and manifest difference betweene Forme, and Type. For Accidentall Formes are things Reall, and the de∣terminate Obiects of Sense; but Types, or Antitypes are only Rela∣tives, and (as such) no Obiects of Sense, but of Reason, and under∣standing onely. As for Example, when a Iudge is set in his Scar∣let upon the Bench, the Eye seeth nothing but red Scarlet, and the fashion of the Gowne, and outward figurature of his Face, and so may every Childe see him; for these are Outward and Visible Accidents. But to see that man, as hee hath upon him the person of a Iudge, ordained to try Causes betweene parties, is a sight of the minde, which looketh upon his Office, to discerne him by his Ha∣bit from common Subiects. Even so is it in this Sacrament; As the Bread and Wine are Round, and White, and Sweet in Taste, our Bo∣dily Senses perceive them; but as they are Types, and Antitypes, that is, Signes of the Body and Blood of Christ, so are they spiritual∣ly discerned with our understanding only. As therefore it followeth not, that the Scarlet Gowne of the Iudge, because it is an Ensigne of his Office, should be only Colour and Fashion, without the matter and Substance of the Cloth; no more can any conclude from Cyrill, that because the Sacrament is a Type, therefore this Type was only Forme, and outward Acci∣dents, without all Substance of Bread. And thus your Cardinall his first [Apertissimum Argumentum] for proofe of Accidents, with∣out the Substance of Bread in this Sacrament, is proved to be A∣pertissimum Figmentum, void of all substance, or almost shadow of Truth. His next observation is the Change by Transubstantiation, and the errour of Sense, in iudging it to be Bread. Wee call vpon Cyrill to decide this Controversie, who is best able to interprete him∣selfe. Hee therefore that said of the Eucharist, after Consecration, It is not Bare Bread, but the Body of Christ, affirmed as much of Con∣secrated Oyle, saying, It is  Bare Oyle. But we are answered, that Bellar. Hoc con∣firmat sententiam nostram. Nam Cy∣rillus non eodem modo loquitur de Chrismate, & de Eu∣charistia. De hac e∣nim ait, Non esse Panem Communem, sed Corpus Christi: de Chrismate vero dicitur quidem, non esse Commune Vn∣guentum, sed non addit Spiritum san∣ctum, vel Corpus Christi: sed esse Chrisma Christi san∣ctificatum oleum. Lib. 2. de Euch. C. 13. Cyrill, in denying the Eucharist to be Common Bread, called it after Consecration Christ's Body: but in denying Oyle to be Bare Oyle, hee called it yet still Chrisme (that is) Sanctified Oyle, after Consecration. So your Cardinall. And so are wee posed for e∣ver. But behold another Iesuiticall Fraud! For Cyrill as he cal∣led the Consecrated Bread Christ's Body, after Consecration, so doth he call the Consecrated Oyle [Charisma] that is, the Gift of the Grace of Christ; and not [Chrisma] that is, Chrisme, or Oyntment, as your Cardinall rendreth it. Wee say againe he calleth that Charisma, which notwithstan∣ding
hee saith was, after Consecration, still Oyle, wherewith their Foreheads were anointed. This must we iudge to have beene a nota∣ble Falsification of Bellarmine, except you would rather we should thinke, that when hee was now to prove that our Senses are de∣ceived, in iudging of Bread to be Bread, he meant to prove it by see∣ming to be deceived himselfe, in thus mistaking the word Chrisma, for . Cyril. Catc. Mystag. 3. Charisma, and so utterly perverting the Iudgement of Cyrill; by whom we are contrarily taught, that the Sight is no more de∣ceived in iudging Bread to be Bread, than in discerning Oyle to be Oyle. For neither was the other Bare Oyle, being a Type of a spiritu∣all Gift; nor yet was it therefore changed into the Spirituall Grace it selfe, because it is so called; but onely is a Type and Symbol thereof. Which One Parallel of Oyle with Bread doth discover the Vnconscionable pertinacie and Perversnes of your Disputers, in urging the Testimony of Cyrill. The like Romish Obiection out of Chrysostome, and as Vnconscionable. SECT. V. SAint Chrysostome his Testimony may in no wise be omitted, which seemeth to your Disputers to be so Convincent, that your Bellar. lib. 2. de Buch. c. 22. Cardinall placed it in the front of his host of the Fathers, whom he produceth, as able to breake through an army of Aduersaries a∣lone; and Mr. Master Brereley, Liturg. Tract. 2. §. 4. Subd. 2. pag. 167. Breerely reserved it to the last of the Testimonies, which hee alleaged, as that which might serve for an Vpshot. I will conclude (saith hee) admonishing the Christian Reader with Saint Chrysostome his Saying (you long to heare it, wee thinke:) Although Christ his speech (saith Chrysost. in Matth. Hom. 83. Etiamsi sen∣sui, & cogitationi no∣strae absurdum esse videatur quod dicit, superatque sensum nostrum & rationem sermo ipsius, quaeso, quod in omnibus re∣bus, sed praecipuè in mysterijs faciamus? non illa quae ante nos iacent aspicientes, sed verba tenentes? nam verbis eius de∣fraudari non possu∣mus, sed sensus saepi fallitur. Quoniam i∣gitur ille dixit [Hoc est Corpus meum] nulla dubitatione te∣neamus, sed creda∣mus, nihil enim in∣sensibile traditur à Christo nobis, sed in rebus sensibilibus. Omnia verò, quae tradidit, sunt insensibilia; sicut in Baptismo per Aquam donum illud con∣ceditur—Regeperatio intelligitur, quià est: nam si incorporeus esses, incorporea tibi tradisset dona; quo∣niam verò anima conjuncta est Corpori, in sensibilibus intelligibilia tibi tradidit. Chrysostome) may seeme absurd vnto Sense and Reason, Iexhort you notwithstanding that espe∣cially in mysteries we looke not unto that which is before us, but ob∣serve Christ's words: for we cannot be disappointed of that, which he saith, but Sences may be deceived. Wherefore, because he said [This is my Body] we are altogether to beleeve it, for hee deliuereth no sensible things unto us; but all which he delivereth in things sensible are in∣sensible: even as in Baptisme the gift of Regeneration granted us is Intelligible. For if thou wert without a Body, then things only unbo∣dily should be given unto thee, but now because thy Soule is ioyned with a Body, therefore in things sensible hath Christ delivered unto thee things intelligible. So Chrysostome. Now what of all this? Chrysostome (saith your Bellar. Non pouisset sanè Chrysostomus loqui clariù's, si Calvinistā aliquem habuisset, quem horari ad fidem voluisset. Ibid. quo supra. Cardinall) could not speake more plainly, if he had had some Calvinist before him, whom he meant to exhort to the Faith. So he, meaning the Faith of Transub∣stantiation,
which (as hath beene confessed) was no doctrine of Faith untill more than a Thousand yeares after Christ. But to returne to Chrysostome, whose Sentence we may compare to a Nut, consisting of a Shell, and a Kernell: The Shell wee may call his Figurative Phrases: the Kernel we may terme his Orthodox meaning. Of both in the Section following. Of the Rhetoricall, and Hyperbolicall Phrases of Chrysostome. SECT. VI. TO begin with the Shell. First, we are to know that Hyperbole is a Rhetoricall Trope, or Figure, which may be defined to be an Excessive speech, signifying a Truth in an Vntruth. As to say, Something is more darke than darknesse it selfe; which being strictly taken were an Impossibility, and Vntrue: but it doth im∣ply this Truth, (namely) that the thing is wonderfully, and ex∣tremely darke. Secondly, that Chrysostome was most frequent in this Figure Hy∣perbole, your owne Non sunt Con∣cionatorum verba in rigore accipinda, quùm primùm ad au∣res perveniant, mul∣ta enim per Hyper∣bolen Declamatores enunciant: c in∣terdum Chrysosto∣mo contingit. Senen∣sis Biblioth. Annot. 152 Senensis doth instruct you; where giving a generall Caution, that Fathers in their Sermons doe use to declame Hyperbolically, he doth instance most specially, by name, in Chry∣sostome. Thirdly, that the Excessive Phrases of Chrysostome, upon this Sa∣crament, doe verifie as much, viz. to tell his people, that Dentes Carni suae infigere Chrysost. hom. 45. in Ioh. Lingua cruentatur hoc ad∣miabili Sanguine. Hom. 83. in Matth. Turbam circūfusam rubifieri. Lib. 3. de Sacerdotio. Their Teeth are fixed in the flesh of Christ: that Their tongues are bloodied with his Blood: and that The Assembly of the People are made red therewith. Fourthly, that he is as Hyperbolicall in denying (in the Cele∣bration of this Sacrament) the iudgement of Senses, saying, Num vides Pa∣nem? num vinum? nè putetis Corpus acc∣pereab homine, sed ex ipso Serahinfor∣cipe ignem. Idem. Tō. 3. de Euch. in Encae∣nijs. Doe we see Bread, or Wine? which is spoken in as great an exuberancie of speech as are the next wordes immediatly following, saying: Thinke not that you receive the Body from a man, but fire from a Sera∣phin, or Angell, with a paire of Tongs. You will thinke (notwithstan∣ding those kind of Phrases) that Chrysostome thought he saw as well Bread, and Wine in this Sacrament, as he could discerne either Man from a Seraphin, or Spirit; or his own Fingers from a paire of Tongs. Fiftly, that the Sentence obiected against us is adorned with the same figure Hyperbole, when he saith that No sensible thing is deli∣vered unto us in this Sacrament, and that our Senses herein may be deceived. Words sore pressed by you, yet twice unconscionably; both because every Sacrament by your owne Church is defined to be Sacramentū est invisibilis gratiae sig∣num visibile. Magist. Senten. lib 4. dist. 1. Sa∣cramentum est res sensibus obiecta. Ca. tech. Trid. Teste Bellar. lib. 1. de Sacram. c. 11. A Sensible Signe; and also for that you your selves confesse that Sensus non fal∣litur circà proprium obiectum. Sententia vera. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 24. Our senses cannot be deceived in their proper sensible Obiects. Sixtly, that Chrysostome himselfe well knew he did Hyperbolize herein, who after that he had said, No sensible thing is delivered un∣to
us in this Sacrament; notwithstanding he addeth immediately, saying of this Sacrament, that In things Sensible, things Intelli∣gible are given unto us. Thus farre of the Rhetorique of Chry∣sostome. Now are we to shew his Theologie, and Catholique meaning, as it were the Kernell of his speech. Hee in the same Sentence will have us understand Man to consist of Body and Soule, and accor∣dingly in this Sacrament Sensible things are ministred to the Bo∣dy, as Symbols of Spirituall things, which are for the Soule to feed upon. So that a Christian, in receiving this Sacrament, is not wholly to exercise his mind upon the bodily Obiect, as if that were onely, or principally the thing offered unto us; No, for then in∣deed our Senses would deceive our Soules of their spirituall Bene∣fit. As for Transubstantiation, and Absence of Bread, Chrysostome, in true Sence, maketh wholly against it, by explaining himselfe, and paralleling this Sacrament with Baptisme: As in Baptisme (saith Sicut in Baptis∣mo &c. Chrysost. See above §. 5. at (r.) hee) Regeneration, the thing intelligible, is given by water the thing sensible, the Substance of water remaining. Which proportion, be∣tweene the Eucharist and Baptisme, is held commonly by ancient See hereafter at large, in the 8. Booke. Fathers, to the utter overthrow of Transubstantiation. And that Chrysostome beleeved the Existence of Bread after Consecration, See above Chap. 3. §. 13. hath beene already expressly shewne, and is here now further proved. For he saith of Bread after Consecration, that Nos per hunc Panem vnione con∣iungimur. Chrysost. in 1. Cor. hom. 24. Wee are ioyned together one with another, by this Bread. And now that you see the Nut cracked, you may observe how your Disputers have swallowed the shell of Hyperbolicall Phrases, and left the kernell of Theologicall Sence for us to content our selves withall. Furthermore (for this is not to be omitted) the other Testimony of Chrysostome is spun and woven with the same Art, which saith of Consecrating this Sacrament, that Chrysost. Homil. 50. in Matth. iux∣ta Edit. Graec. Nè ex∣istimes Sacerdotem esse, qui hoc facit, sed [.] then followeth of Baptisme, Ibid. Ille non te Baptizat, .] Man is not to thinke it is the hand of the Priest, but of Christ himselfe, that reacheth it unto him; seeing immediately after (as it were with the same breath) it is added: It is not the Minister, but God that Baptizeth thee, and holdeth thy head. Thus farre concerning the Iudgement of Sences, which hath beene formerly proved (at large) both by See above. c. 3. §. 7. Scriptures, and Ibid. in the Chap∣ters following. Fathers; wee draw nearer our marke, which is your Transubstantiation. Fourthly the Vnconscionablenes of your Disputers, in urging other Figurative Sayings, and Phrases of the Fathers, of Bread Changed, Transmuted, &c. into the Body of Christ, for proofe of a Transubstantiation thereof in a Proper Sence. SECT. VII. SVch words as these, Bread is the Body of Christ; It is made the Body of Christ; It is Changed, Translated, Trans-muted, Trans∣elementated
into the Body of Christ, are Phrases of the highest Em∣phasis that you can find in the Volumes of Antiquity; which if they were literally meant, according to your Romish Sence, there ought to be no further Dispute. But if it may evidently appeare, by the Idiome of speech of the same Fathers, that such their say∣ings are Tropicall, and sometimes Hyperbolicall, then shall we have iust Cause to taxe your Disputers of as great Vnconscionablenes (if not of more) in this, as in any other. For whensoever they find in any Father (as in Eusebius Emiss. Ad est Substantia Pa∣nis, sed post verba Christi est Corpus Christi. Hom. 5. Ob∣iected by Mr. Breerly. Liturg. Tract. 2. §. 2. Subd. 2. Eusebius) these words; The Bread is the Body of Christ, they obiect it for Transub∣stantiation; but Vnconscionably. First, seeing that the Fathers doe but herein imitate our Lord and Master Christ, who said of the Bread [This is my Body:] which hath beene See above, Booke 2. throughout. proved by Scriptures, and Fathers to be a Figurative and unproper speech. Secondly, see∣ing that they use the same Dialect in other things, as Cyrill of Sa∣cred Oyle, saying, this is Charisma, the Gift of Grace; as hee called also the Holy Kisse a  Cyrill. sup. Reconciliation, and others the like, as you have heard. Thirdly, seeing that you your selves have renounced all proper Sence of all such Speeches, because things of different na∣tures cannot possibly be affirmed one of another; for no more can it be properly said Bread is man's Body, than we can say, An Egg is a Stone, as you have See above, Booke 2 c. 1. §. 4. confessed. Againe, Some Fathers say, Bread is made Flesh, as Ambros. De Pa∣e; Fit Corpus caro Christi. O. by Bel∣lar. lib. 2 de Euchar. c. 14. and by others. S. Ambrose. obiected; but Vnconscionably, knowing First, that you your selues are brought now at length to deny the Body of Christ to be Produced out of Bread. Secondly, knowing the like Idiome of Fathers in their other speeches; Chrysost. saying that Chrysost. Nos se∣cum Christus in u∣nam, ut ità dicam, massam reducit, ne{que} id fide tantùm, sed re∣ipsâ nos Corpus su∣um effecit. In Math. 26. hom. 83. Ob. by Mr. Breerly. Liturg. Tract. 2. §. 2. Subd▪ 2. Christ hath made us his owne Body, not only in Faith, but in deed also: And Augustine saying that Aug. Ipsi Chri∣stiani cum Capite uo, quod ascendit in coelum, vnus est Christus. Enarrat. in Psal. 127. Etin Psal. 26. Titulus Psalm Omnes in illo, & Christi, & Christus sumus. Christians themselves with their Head, which ascended into heaven, are one Christ: yea, and Pope Leo, De homine Regenerato per Bap∣tismum. Vt susceptus à Christo, & susci∣piens Christum, non idem sit post Lava∣crū, quod ante Bap∣tismum fuit, sed ut corpus Regenerati fiat aro Crucifixi. Serm. de Passione. 14. Leo, saying of the party Baptized, that Hee is not the same that he was be∣fore Baptisme, by which (saith he) the Body of the party Regenerate is made the Flesh of Christ crucified. Finally, Venerable Bede saith; Beda in 1. Cor. 10. Nam & nosipsius Corpus facti sumus, & quod accipimus, nos sumus. Wee are made that Body which we receive. In all which the word [Made] you know, is farre from that high straine of Transubstanti∣ation. Wee draw yet nearer to the Scope. Wee may not deny, but that the Fathers sometimes extend their voyces higher, unto the Praeposition Trans; as See above C. 4. §. 7. Transit, Transmutatur, signifying a Change, and Trans-mutation into the Body of Christ. Every such Instance is, in the opinion of your Do∣ctours, a full demonstration of Transubstantiation it selfe; and all the wits of men cannot (saith one) Assoyle such Obiections. Wherein they shew themselves altogether Vnconscionable, as hath beene partly declared in Answering your Obiected Sayings of See above C. 4. §. 2. Ambrose In aliud Convertuntur; of Ibid. at the Letter (r.) Cyprian his Panis naturâ mutatus; of
Cyrils Trans-mutavit; and as now in this Section is to be mani∣fested, in answering your other Obiections to the full. The Father Gregor. Nyssen. Quicquid assumenti conveniens est, & ex∣petitum sit, ut Apo∣stolus vult, qui hanc mensam nobis prae∣paravit, in id com∣mutatur; infirmiori∣bus olus, Infanti∣bus Lac, &c. Lib. de vita Mosis. p. 509. Greg. Nyssen comparing the Body of Christ with Manna, which satisfied every man's tast that received it, saith that The Body of Christ in this Sacrament is changed into whatsoever see∣meth to the Receivers appetite convenient and desired. This is obie∣cted by your Cardinall, to prove Transubstantiation; but First Vnconscionably; because it is in it selfe (being literally under∣stood) euen in your owne iudgements, incredible: For what Christian will say that the Body of Christ is Transubstantiated into any other thing? much lesse into whatsoever thing the appetite of the Receiver shall desire? No. But as Manna did satisfie the bodi∣ly Appetite: so Christ's Body to the Faithfull is food satisfying the Soule in the Spirituall and heavenly desire thereof. Secondly, Vn∣conscionably obiected, because the same Father expresseth his Hyperbolicall mannet of speech likewise, saying that Greg. Nyss. Cor∣pus illud Christi in Corpus nostum in∣grediens totum in se transfert. Ob. by Bel∣lar. lib. 2. cap. 10. §. I∣dem Greg. Christ's Bo∣dy doth change our Bodies into it selfe, which in the Literall Sence, according to your arguing, would prove a Transubstantiation of Mens Bodies into Christ. Chrysostome is found admiring these mysteries, and is obiected by Mr. Mr. Breerly. Tract. 2. §. 4 Subd 2 p. 164. Breerly, for proofe of the wonderfull Effects of this Sacra∣ment. Why? what saith he? Chrysost. Admi∣randa Mysteria—ut non solùm per di∣lctione, sed reipsa in illam Carnem cō∣vertamur. Hom. 45. in Ioh. Wee our selves (saith hee) are con∣verted and changed into the Flesh of Christ. Which was the former saying of Greg. Nyssen. Will your Disputers never learne the Hy∣perbolicall language of ancient Fathers, especially when they speake of Sacramentall, and mysticall things? (more especially Chryso∣stome, who, when he falleth upon this Subiect, doth almost alto∣gether Rhetoricate:) but chiefly when they cannot be ignorant that such words of the Fathers, in the Literall straine, are utterly absurd. For what greater Absurdity than (as is now obiected) for our Bodies to be Transubstantiated into the Body of Christ? Now are wee past the limits of due Antiquity, you descend lower. Theophylact will say hard to vs, who, speaking of this Sacra∣ment, saith indeed that Theoph. in Mar. 14. Vocat hanc Con∣versionem Transele∣mentationem, quae quidem vox nihil mi∣nùs significat, quàm transubstantiatio: nā Transelemētatio sig∣nificat mutationem totius rei—ad ipsam materiam, quae ab A∣ristotele Elementum dicitur. Si muatio solius Formae, rectè dicitur  Transformatio, & mutatio, externae fi∣gurae transfiguratio, cur mutatio substan∣tiae non poterit rectè dici Transubstantia∣tio? Bella. l. 3. de Euch. c. 23. §. Secundo. The Bread is Trans-elementated into the Bo∣dy of Christ: which your Cardinall will have to be, in the same Fathers sence, Equivalent with your Transubstantiation. Vncon∣scionably, for doth not the same Father say likewise that Theoph. in Ioh. 6. Qui me manducat, quodammodò . A Christian is in a manner Trans-elementated into Christ? Like as Isidore Pelusiota spake of Isidor. Pelusiot. l. 3. Epist. 107. De reci∣piente semen, ut ter∣ra bona: Qui verbu recipit [.] Trans-elementing, in a sort, of the word of God into the good hearer. Againe, Theophylact is obiected, as saying, Theoph in Mat. 26. Panis ineffabili mo∣do transformatur—Panis quidem apparet, sed ca st. Obiected by Mr. Breerly Liturg. Tract. 2. Sect. 2. Subd. 2. As for [est caro] this Phrase hath beene already answered. See above at (s) The Bread is after an ineffable manner Transformed. It is true; Hee saith so: and so doth Hirome say that Hier. in Marc. 14. Accepit Ie∣sus Panem, & benedixit, fregit, Transsigurans corpus suum in Panem: quod est Ecclesia praesens, quae frangi∣tur in passionibus. Christ in
breaking Bread, did Transfigure, or Transforme his Body into his Church broken with afflictions: and Pope Leo sticketh not to say that Leo. Non alia igitur participatio Corporis, quàm ut in id, quod suimus, transeamus. De passi∣e Serm. 24. Wee Christians, in communicating [Transimus] turne, or are Chan∣ged into Christ his Body. So these ancient Fathers. Are you not yet out of breath with obiecting Testimonies of Fathers Vnconscionably, and Impertinently? No, for Mr. Breer∣ly, for a Close, desireth to be heard, and to try us with an Obie∣ction out of the Greeke Church of these latter times, as followeth. Mr. Breerly in his Apologic (of the first Edition) concer∣ning the faith of the an∣cient Greeke Church. It appeareth by a Treatise published by the Protestant Divines at Wittenberge, Anno Domini 1584. intituled [Acta Theologorum Wittembergensium, & Hieremiae Patriarchae Constantinop. &c.] that the Greeke Church at this day (although divided from the La∣tine) professeth to beleeve Transubstantiation. So hee of the Pa∣triarch Hieremias; which Patriarch, if wee were alive, would very hardly conteyne himselfe from answering this your Brother with some indignation, calling him both rash and praecipitant; seeing that the same Patriarch expressly said that Hier. Patriarch. Non enim hîc nomi∣nis tantùm commu∣nicatio est, sed rei identitas: etenim ve∣rè corpus & sanguis Christi mysteria sunt; non quòd haec in corpus humanum transmutentur, sed nos in illa, meliori∣bus praevalentibus. Which is his Answer in this point, to the Do∣ctors of Wittemberge. These Mysteries are not changed into humane Flesh. Mr. Breerly would thinke it an iniury done unto himselfe, if wee should praetermit his obiected Authority of Pope Grego∣ry: for Doctor Humphrey (saith hee) doth charge Gregory the Great with Transubstantiation. So Mr. Breerly, who obiected this in his Apologie many yeares agoe, and had a full Answer in an Appeal. lib. 1. Ch. 2. §. 7. [The testimony it selfe, cited out of Greg. by Mr. Breer∣ly, is answered in the first Booke, concerning EATING. Appeale made purposely in confutation of his whole A∣pologie. The Summe of that Answer is this: Doctor Humphrey did not speake that, as grounded upon any Sentence of Grego∣ry, but onely upon the report of a Romish Legend (supposing it to be true) which in the iudgement of Romish Doctors them∣selves (whose Testimonies are there cited) Is unworthy to report the memory of the fact, being in it selfe fond, filthy and frivolos; the Author whereof may seeme to have a face of Irn, and a heart of Leade; and the Obiectour, namely Mr. Breer∣ly (for grounding his Obiection on a Legendary Historie) A Falsifier of his owne promise. This Answer was home, one would thinke, and might iustly have provoked him to satisfie for him∣selfe; if he could have found any errour therein: yet notwith∣standing, for want of better service, bringeth he in these Cole∣worts twise sod. CHALLENGE. VVHat greater Vnconscionablenesse could your Disputers bewray, than by so torturing the Hyperbolicall Figurative, and Sacramentall Sayings of Ancient Fathers for proofe of the Transubstantiation of Bread into the Body of Christ? insomuch that they must be consequently constrained, by the force of some Phra∣ses, contrary both to the meaning of the same Fathers, and to the
Doctrine of your owne Romish Church, to admit of three other Transubstantiations: viz. First, of Christ his Body into what soever the Appetite of the Communicant shall desire. Secondly of Christ his Body into the Body of every Christian. And Thirdly of the Body of every Christian into the Body of Christ; as the Te∣stimonies obiected plainly pronounce. In all which Obiections they doe but verifie the Proverbe: Qui nimis emngit, elicit san∣guinem. Fiftly, the like Vnconscionablenesse of your Romish Disputers is unmas∣ked, by laying open the Emphaticall Speeches of the Fathers, concerning Baptisme, answerable to their Sayings obiected, for proofe of Transubstantiation in the Eucharist. SECT. VIII. COncerning Baptisme we have See above in this Chap. §. 3. &c. heard already, out of the Wri∣tings of Antiquity, as efficacious Termes, as you could obiect for the Eucharist. First of the Party Baptized, Changed into a new Creature. Secondly, that no Sensible thing is delivered in Baptisme. Thirdly, that The Baptized is not the same, but changed into Christ his flsh. Fourthly, to thinke that It is not the Priest, but God that Baptizeth, who holdeth thy head. Lastly, Baptisme (saith the Coun∣cell of Booke 8. Ch. 2. §. 1. Conc. Nicen. Bap∣tisma non Corporis, sed mentis oculis considerandum. A∣pud Binim. lib. 3. Decret. Conc Nic. de Baptismate. Nice) is to be considered not with the Eyes of the Body. Of these already, and hereafter much more in a Generall Synopsis re∣served for the Eight Booke. CHALLENGE. ONly give us leane to spurre you a Question before we end this third Booke. Seeing that Transubstantiation cannot properly be, by your owne Doctrine, except the Substance of Bread ceasing to be there remaine onely the Accidents thereof (this Position of the con∣tinuance of Onely Accidents, without a Subiect, being your Positive Foundation of Transubstantiation) Why is it that none of all your Romish Disputers was hitherto ever able to produce any one Te∣stimony out of all the Volumes of Antiquity, for proofe of this one point, excepting only that of Cyril, which See above, Ch. 4. §. 4. hath beene (as you haue heard) egregiously abused and falsified? Learne you to An∣swere this Question, or else shame to obiect Antiquity any more; but rather confesse your Article of Transubstantiation to be but a Bastardly Impe. Wee might enlarge our selves in this point of your Vnconscio∣nablenesse in obiecting Testimonies of Fathers, for proofe aswell of Transubstantiation, as of the other Articles above-mentioned;
but that they are to be presented in their proper places, to wit in the following Treatises, concerning Corporall Presence, Corporall Vnion, Corporall Sacrifice of Christ's Body in the Sacrament, and the Divine Adoration thereof; so plainly that any man may be perswaded, our Opposites meane no good Faith, in arguing from the Iudgement of Ancient Fathers. Hitherto of the First Romish Consequence.
THE FOVRTH BOOKE, Treating of the second Romish Consequence, arising from the false Exposition of these words of Christ, [THIS IS MY BODY] called Corporall Presence in the Sacrament of the Eucharist. THe Sacramentall Presence hath a double Relati∣on, one is in respect of the thing sensibly recei∣ved, which is the Sacrament it selfe; the other in respect of the Receiver and Communicant: Both which are to be distinctly considered, as well for our right discerning of the matter in hand, as also for Method's sake. The first is hand∣led in this Booke: the second in that which followeth. CHAP. I. Of the state of this point of Controversie: That notwithstanding the difference of opinion of Christ's Presence be only De modo, that is, of the manner of Being; yet may the Romish Doctrine be Hereticall: and to hold the contrary is a pernitious Paradoxe. SECT. I. IT would be a wonder to us, to heare Any of our owne profession to be so extremely Indifferent, con∣cerning the different opinions of the Manner of the Presence of Christ's Body in the Sacrament, as to thinke the Romish Sect therefore either Tollerable, or Reconciliable, upon Pretence that the Question is only De modo,
(that is) of the manner of Being, and that consequently all Con∣troversie about this is but vaine Iangling. Such an one ought to enter into his second thoughts, to consider the necessity that lieth upon every Christian to abandon divers Heresies, albeit their diffe∣rence from the Orthodoxe profession were only De modo. As for example, First, The Gnostick taught man's soule to have it's begin∣ning by manner of Production, from the substance of God. The Catholikes said nay, but by manner of Creation, of nothing. The Pelagians maintained a free will in spirituall Acts, from the grace of Nature. The Catholikes nay; but by speciall grace of Christ, freeing the will through the efficacious operation of his holy Spirit. The Catharists held themselves pure, in a purity of an absolute per∣fection: The Catholikes nay, but by an Inchoative, comparative, and imperfect perfection of purity. Furthermore against our Chri∣stian Faith, of beleeving God to be absolutely a Spirit; the Anthre∣pomorphites conceived of God, as of one (after the manner of men) consisting of Armes and Legges, &c. Not to be tedious. We come to the Sacraments. The Cataphry∣gae did not baptize in the name of the blessed Trinity, after the man∣ner of the Catholikes. The Artotyritae celebrated the Eucharist in Bread and Cheese. To omit many others, take one poniard, which we are sure will pierce into the entrailes of the Cause (to wit) the heresie of the Capernaits, in the dayes of our Saviour Christ: who hearing his Sermon, teaching men to Eate his flesh; and conceiving thereby a carnall manner of Eating, irreconciliably contrary to the spirituall manner, which was beleeved by the true Disciples of Christ, departed from Christ, and Apostated from the Faith. And that the Romish manner of Eating Christ his Body is Capernaiti∣call; her manner of Sacrifice sacrilegious; her manner of Divine Adoration thereof Idolatrous; and all these manners Irreconci∣liable to the manner of our Church, is copiously declared in the Bookes following. For this present we are to exhibit the different, and contradictory manners, concerning the Presence of Christ herein. The manner of Presence of Christ his Body 1. According to the Iudgement of Protestants. 2. In the profession of the Church of Rome. That Protestants, albeit they deny the Corporall Presence of Christ in this Sacrament; yet hold they a true Presence thereof in divers respects; according to the Iudge∣ment of Antiquitie. SECT. II. THere may be observed foure kindes of Truths of Christ his Presence in this Sacrament: one is veritas Signi, that is Truth
of Representation of Christ his Body; the next is Veritas Revelatio∣nis, Truth of Revelation; the third is Veritas Obsignationis, that is, a Truth of Seale, for better assurance; the last is, Veritas Exhibi∣tionis, the truth of Exhibiting, and deliverance of the Reall Body of Christ to the faithfull Communicants. The Truth of the Signe, in respect of the thing signified, is to be acknowledged so farre, as in the Signes of Bread and Wine is represented the true and Reall Body and Blood of Christ. which Truth and Reality is celebrated by us, and taught by ancient Fathers, in contradiction to Ma∣nichees, Marcionites, and other old Heretikes; who held that Christ had in himselfe no true Body, but meerely Phantasticall, as you Marcionitae, Ma∣nichaei, & alij Haere∣tici putabant corpus Christi verum non esse, sed phantasticū esse. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 24 §. Resp. Argumentum. your selves well know. In confutation of which Heretikes the Father Ignatius (as your Ignatius (citante Theodoret. Dlal. 3.) Eucharistia est caro Christi. Bellar. l. 2. de Euch. c. 2. Hoc scripsit Ignatius contra Hae∣reticos, qui negabant Christū habuisse car∣nem veram, sed tan∣tùm visibilem & ap∣parentem.—Obser∣vandum est Haereti∣cos illos non tàm Sa∣cramentū Euch. quā mysterium incarna∣tionis oppugnâsse. [True, and the Argu∣ment of Ignatius was the same which Tert▪ vsed also against the same kinde of Here∣tikes. Lib. 4. in Mar∣cion. [Hoc est corpus meum] Id est, figura corporis mei: Figu∣ra autem non fuisset, nisi veritas esset cor∣pus. See this in the place of Tertullian at large. Cardinall witnesseth) called the Eu∣charist it selfe, the flesh of Christ. Which saying of Ignatius, in the sence of Theodoret, (by whom he is cited, against the Heresie of his time) doth call it Flesh and Blood of Christ, because (as the same Theodoret expounded himselfe) it is a true signe of the true and Reall Body of Christ: and, as Tertullian long before him had explained the words of Christ himselfe [This is my Body] that is (saith hee) This Bread is a Signe, or Figure of my Body. Now because it is not a Signe, which is not of some Truth, (See above Booke 2. Chap. 2. at (a.) for as much as there is not a figure of a figure) therefore Bread being a signe of Christs Bodie, it must follow, that Christ had a true Body. This indeed is Theo∣logicall arguing, by a true Signe of the Body of Christ to confute the Heretikes, that denied the Truth of Christ's Body. Which control∣leth the wisdome of your Concilium dicit verò contineri corp{us} in Sacramento con∣tra Sacramentarios, qui volunt Christum adesse in Signo, & Fi∣gurâ: signa enim ve∣ritati opponuntur. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap 2. Councell of Trent, in condemning Protestants, as denying Christ to be Truly present in the Sacrament, because, they say, he is there present in a Signe. As though there were no Truth of being in a Signe, or Figure; which were to abolish all true Sacraments, which are true Figures, and Signes of the things which they represent. A second Truth and Reality in this Sacrament is called Veri∣tas Revelationis, as it is a signe, in respect of the Typicall Signes of the same Body, and Blood of Christ in the Rites of the old Testa∣ment; yet not absolutely in respect of the matter it selfe, but of the manner, because the faithfull under the Law had the same faith in Christ, and therefore their Sacraments had Relation to the same Body, and Blood of Christ, but in a difference of manner. For as two Cherubins looked on the same Mercy Seate, but with different faces oppositely: so did both Testaments point out the same Passion of Christ in his Body, but with divers aspects. For the Rites of the old Testament were, as Augustin. contra Faustum lib. 19. pag. 349. Tom. 6. Delirat, qui dicit muta∣tis Sacramentis res ipsas diversas esse, quas ritus Propheticus pronunciavit implendas, & quas ritus Euangeli∣cus annunciavit imtas.—aliter res annunciatur facienda, aliter facta. Saint Augustine teacheth, Propheticall pre∣nunciating, and fore-telling the thing to come: but the rites of the new Testament are Historicall, annunciating and revealing the thing done,
the former shewed, concerning Christ his Passion, rem faciendam, what should be; the latter rem factam, the thing done, and fulfilled. As therefore the Truth of History is held to be more reall than the Truth of Prophesie, because it is a declaration of a reall performance of that, which was promised: So the Evangelicall Sacrament may be said to containe in it a more reall verity, then the Leviti∣call. Therefore are the Rites of the old Law called Heb. 10. Shadowes, in respect of the Sacraments of the Gospell; according to the which difference Saint Iohn the Baptist was called by Christ a Prophet, in that hee Ioh. 1. 15. foretold Christ, as now to come: but he was called more then a Prophet, as demonstrating and Ibid. 29. pointing him out to be now come. Which Contemplation occasioned divers Fathers to speake so Hyperbolically of the Sacrament of the Eu∣charist, in comparison of the Sacraments of the old Testament, as if the Truth were in these, and not in them, as Origen. Hom. 7. in Numer. p. 195. Illa in aenigmate designari, quae nunc in nova lege in specie & ve∣ritate complentur. [Calling ours Truth, yet not simply, but com∣paratively: for a lit∣tle after hee confesseth that they received E∣andem Escam; i. e. Christum] Obiected by Mr. Breerley Liturg. Tract. 4. Sect. 2. Subd. 4 Origen did. Besides the former two, there is Veritas Obsignationis, a Truth sea∣led, which maketh this Sacrament more than a Signe, even a Seale of Gods promises in Christ; for so the Apostle called Circumcision (albeit a Sacrament of the old Law) the Rom. 4. 11. Seale of Faith. But yet the print of that Seale was but dimme, in comparison of the Evangelicall Sacraments; which because they confirme unto the faithfull the Truth, which they present, are called by o∣ther ancient Fathers (as well as by Aug. tom. 4. de Ca∣techizand. rudib. c. 26. Signacula esse visibi∣lia rerum divinarum. Saint Augustine) visible Seales of divine things. So that now we have in this Sacrament the Body of Christ not only under a Signe or signification, but under a Seale of Confirmation also: which inferreth a greater degree of reall Truth, thereby represented unto us. This might have beene the reason, why Saint Augustine taught Christ to be Aug. tract. 50. in Ioh. Habemus Chri∣stum in praesenti ad Baptismatis Sacra∣mentum: habemus in praesenti ad Altaris cibū & potum. Tom. 9 Present both in Baptisme, and at receiving the Lord's Supper. A fourth Reason to be observed herein, as more speciall, is Veri∣tas Exhibitionis, a Truth Exhibiting and delivering to the faith∣full Communicants the thing signified, and sealed, which Christ expressed, when he delivered it to his Disciples, saying; [Take, eate, this is my Body given for you: and, this is my Blood shed for you.] Thus Christ, by himselfe; and so doth he to other faithfull Com∣municants wheresoever, to the ends of the World, by his Mini∣sters, as by his hands, through virtue of that Royall Command, [DOE THIS.] Vaine therefore is the Obiection made by your Athanas. apud Theodoret. Dial. 2. pag. 330. Corpus est, cui dicit, sede à dexteris meis—per quod corpus Pontifex fuit, & dictus est, per id quod tradidit myste∣rium, dicens; Hoc est corpus meum. This was obiected by Bellar∣mine l. 2. de Euch. c. 11. Cardinall, in urging us with the testimony of Athanasius, to prove that Christ his Body is exhibited to the Receivers; As though there were not a Truth in a mysticall, and sacramentall deli∣verance of Christ his Body, except it were by a corporall, and materiall presence thereof: which is a transparent falsity, as any may perceive by any Deed of Gift, which by writing, seale, and delive∣ry conveyeth any Land or Possession from man to man; yet this farre more effectually, as afterwards will appeare. But first we are to manifest.
That the Romish Disputers doe odiously, slanderously, and unconscionably vilifie the Sacrament of the Eucharist, as it is ce∣lebrated by PROTESTANTS. SECT. III. BEllarmine, with others Christus nihil est illis, nisi frustum pa∣nis, & vini portiun∣cula. Salmeron. Ies. in Epist. Pauli disput. 11. §. Septimo.

Espenc. de Adorat. lib. 5. c. 9. p. 188. obiect against Protestants, saying, that Their Sacrament is nothing else but a crust of Bread, and pit∣tance of Wine. And againe; A morsell of Bread ill baked, by which the Protestants represent unto their memories the death of Christ, and the benefits thereof. A goodly matter! so doth a Crucifix: and to make the Sacrament only a Signe is an ancient Heresie. So they. But have you not heard the Doctrine of the Protestants tea∣ching the Eucharisticall Bread to be (more than bare Bread) a Sacra∣mentall signe; more, an Evangelicall signe; more, a sacred Seale; yet more, an exhibiting Instrument of the Body of Christ therein to the devout Receiver? And have not these outragious Spirits read your owne Cardinall? witnessing that the Protestants teach that Doect Calvinus Symbola, & corpus Christi, licet loco inter se pluri∣mùm distent; tamen coniuncta esse, non solū ratione signi; quia unum est signum alterius; sed quia per signum Deus verè nobis exhibet ipsum corpus verū, & sanguinē, quo animae nostrae verè alantur. Bellar. lib. 1. de Euch. c. 1. Et Calvin{us} affirmat saepiùs, Christi corpus esse praesens in Sacramento, quaten{us} ibi animis nostris verè vnitur, & cōmunicatur substantialiter: sic enim loquitur, secundū substantiam, non modò secundū effectum. Et Fortunatus Calvinista dicit in Sacramēto corpus Christi versari realissime que percipi. Valent. Ies. Tom. 4. disp. 6. quaest. 3. punct. 1. §. 7. pag. 9. Idem Sadäel & Beza sentiunt. Idem ibid. Haec est eorum sententia; licèt Christi corpus corporaliter & essentialiter sit in coelo, nihilominus duplici modo in hoc Sacramento verè percipi, spiritualiter, & sacra∣mentaliter; spiritualiter quidem ore mentis, non dentis, id est, per fidem & coniunctionem, virtute Spiritus Sancti in animo communicantis: sacramentaliter etiam, ore quidem corporis sumendo, non ipsum quidem cor∣pus eius, sed signum corporis eius, panem, & vinum, quae dicit esse sigilla certa, quibus promissio redemp∣tionis in corpore & sanguine Christi fidelibus obsignatur. Valent. quo supra. Although the Body of Christ be still in Heaven, yet is it received in this Sacrament; first Sacramentally by Bodily mouthes, in receiuing the Bread, the signe of Christ his Body, and by which God doth truly, albeit Sacramentally, deliver unto the faithfull the reall body of Christ: and secondly spiritually to the mouth of the soule by faith, and so they truly and really participate of the substance of the Body and Blood of Christ. So Bellarmine, concerning Protestants, which is so plainly professed by Calvin. in his Booke intituled, Defensio Calvini de Sacramento. Augustana Confessio; [In sacrâ Coenâ verè dari cum pane & vino ip∣sum corpus Christi, & sanguinem,] Huic consensum nostrum praebemus.

Ibid. pag. 83. Calvin himselfe, as would make any Ro∣mish
Adversary blush at your former Calumnies, who hath not abandoned shamefastnesse it selfe. CHALLENGE. THus may you see that we have not hitherto so pleaded for the Existence of the Substance of Bread in this Sacrament, after Consecration, as thereby to exclude all Presence of Christ his bo∣dy; nor so maintained the proprietie of a Signe, or Figure, as not to beleeve the thing signified to be exhibited unto us, as you have heard. With what blacke spot of malignity and falshood then were the Consciences of those your Doctors defiled, thinke you, who have imputed to Protestants a Profession of using onely bare Bread, which they notwithstanding teach and beleeve to be a Sa∣cred Signe of the true Body of Christ, in opposition to Heretikes; an Evangelicall Signe of the Body of the Messias crucified, against all Iewish conceit; yea a Seale of Ratification; yea and also a Sa∣cramentall Instrument of conveying of the same precious Body of Christ to the soules of the faithfull, by an happy and ineffable Con∣iunction; whereof more hereafter in the In the fist Booke throughout. Booke following, where the consonant Doctrine of the Church of England will likewise appeare. And as your Disputers are convinced of a malitious Detracti∣on, by the confessed positions of Protestants, so are they much more by your owne instance of a Crucifix: for which of you would not hold it a great derogation from Christ, that any one seeing a Crucifix of wood (now waxen old) should in disdaine thereof call it a wooden, or rotten Blocke: and not account them irreligious in so calling it? but why? onely because it is a signe of Christ cruci∣fied. Notwithstanding, were the Crucifix as glorious as either Art could fashion, or Devotion affect, or Superstition adore, yet is it but a signe invented by man; And therefore how infinitely more honourable in all Christian estimation must a Sacramentall Signe be, which onely the God of Heaven and Earth could institute, and Christ hath ordained to his Church, farre exceeding the pro∣perty of a bare signe, as you have heard? A Father deliuering by politique assurances under hand and seale a portion of Land, al∣though an hundred miles distant, and convaying it to his sonne by Deed, if the sonne in scorne should terme the same Deed or writing blacke Inke; the Seale greasie Waxe; and the whole Act but a bare signe, were he not worthy not onely to loose this fatherly benefit, but also to be deprived of all other the temporall Blessings of a Fa∣ther, which hee might otherwise hope to enioy? yet such like have beene your Calumnies, and opprobrious Reproaches against our celebration of the Sacrament of Christ. The Lord lay not them to your Charge. Now you, who so oppose against the Truth of the mysticall Pre∣sence,
will not conceale from us that Presence of the Body and Blood of Christ, which your Church doth so extremely dote on. CHAP. II. The Romish professed manner of Presence of Christ's Body in this Sacrament. SECT. I. OVr Methode requireth to consult, in the first place, in all questions, with the wordes of Christ his In∣stitution; but seeing that you can alleage nothing for proofe of a Corporall Presence of Christ in this Sacrament, but onely a literall Exposition of Christ's words [This is my Body;] which by Scriptures, Fathers, your owne Principles, and by unanswerable Reasons hath beene Booke 2. proved to be most grosly false, wee shall not need to insist further upon that; only we shall but put you in minde of Saint Paul's words, in teaching the use and end of Christ his Institution of this Sacrament, to wit, The shewing of Christ's death untill his com∣ming againe: meaning corporally, at the last day. Which word [VNTILL] being spoken of a last day doth exclude your com∣ming againe of Christ in his Corporall Presence every day; for the Apostles word is absolutely spoken of his Bodily Comming, and not of the manner thereof; albeit other Scripture teacheth, that his Comming must be in all glorious Visibility. We goe on. In the Eucharist (saith your Si quis nega∣verit in sanctissima Eucharistia continei verè, realitèr, sub∣stantialitèr corpus, & sanguinem Christi Anathema sit. Con∣cil. Trid. Sess. 13. Can. 1. Nos dicimus Domi∣num Christum cor∣poralitèr sub specie panis cōtineri. Greg. Valent. Tom. 4. disp. 6. q. 3. p. 1. Councell of Trent) is contained truly, really, and substantially the Body, and blood of Christ: and they account him Accursed, whosoever shall not beleeve this. By all which is signified a Corporall manner of presence (excepting one∣ly Relation to place) which we say is, in many respects, impos∣sible, as we shall prove; but first we are to remove a Mil-stone, for so you esteeme an Obiection, which you cast in our way of De∣monstration of a Corporall Presence, de facto, from (as you say) Mi∣racles manifesting the same. The pretended principall Romish Demonstration of a Corporall Presence of Christ's Body and Blood in this Sacrament, ta∣ken from pretended Supremuslocus detur miraculis; velu∣ti testimonijs ipsius Dei. ozius de signis Eccles. l. 14. c. 7. p. 170. Miraculous Apparitions of visible Flesh, and Blood, revealed to the World. SECT. II. TRue Miracles we shall hold as God's Seales of Divine Truth: if therefore you shall alleage any such, for proofe of a Corpo∣rall
Presence, see they be true, else shall wee iudge them, not to be God's Seales, but the Deuils Counterfaits. Your Bozius, one of the number of the Congregation of the Oratory in Rome (professedly studied in historicall learning, and appointed to extract out of all Authors, whatsoever may make for defence of all Romish Causes) after his diligent search into all ancient Records, as it were into the Ware-houses of all orts of stuffes, having collected a packet of Ap∣parances, useth his best Eloquence to set forth his merchandize to sale; telling us by the way of Preface, Hi ea tantum∣modò referemus, qui∣bus est palam factum divinitus in Eucha∣ristia verum corpus esse, & oculi humani viderunt, & quod est omnium mirabilissi∣mum videre adhuc possint panem con∣versum in ipsum car∣nem Christi. Bozius de Sig. Eccles. l. 14. c. 7. that he will report onely such Stories, whereby it is made Evident by God himselfe, that the Body of Christ is in the Eucharist, even by the Testimony of mens eyes, that have seene it. A thing (saith hee) most miraculous, which every one that hath eyes may yet see. So he, even as Coccius Thesaur. Cathol. lib. 6. de Eucha∣ristia. Coccius before him in every particular: and after both Master In the place be∣low-cited. Brereley thus prefacing; Miracles sent by God confirme the same, wherin at the breaking of the Hoast, sundry times great copie of blood issued out, as is testified by many Writers. We are now attentive to the Relation of your Oratour and Others, and afterwards (as you shall perceive) to give that credit unto them, which the cause it selfe shall require. We will take their Relations according to the order of Times. 1. Anno CCCC. Simon Metaphrastes Simon Meta∣phrastes narrat, &c. Bozius ibid. (saith Bozius) telleth in the dayes of Honorius the Emperour (for the confirmation of the faith of an Eremite) that the Sacrament being propounded, presently [Infans visus est] a living Infant was seene by three old men on the Altar: and whilst the Priest divided the Bread, an Angell was seene, and seemed to divide, and cut in peeces the flesh of the Child, and so [Senex carnis cruentae apertè particeps factus est, & resipiscit.] The old Heremite being made partaker evidently of the Bloody flesh, re∣pented. 2. Anno 600. A woman (as Iohannes, & Pau∣lus Diaconus in vita Gregorij narrat, &c. Bozius ibid. and Coccius Thesaur. lib. 6. de Euch. art. 8. Anno 590. And Master Brerely Tract. 4. Sect. 3. Subd. 1. out of Paulus Diaconus de vita Greg. lib. 2. c. 41. Bozius reporteth, and with him Coccius) had laughed to heare the Bread called the Body of Christ, which she her selfe had made with her owne hands, and was observed to laugh by Pope Gregory: who thereupon fell to prayer with the people, and by and by looking aside upon the Hoast, behold the formes of Bread were vanished, and he saw [Veram carnem] true flesh: Then the people wondred, the woman repented, and the Hoast, at the prayer of the Priest [in pristinam formam reversa est] Returned into its owne shape againe. 3. Anno 800. Ante Annos pro∣pè octingentos, ut narrat Pasasius, qui∣dem Presbyter, &c. Bozius ibid. & Coccius. A certaine Priest called Phlegis, being desirous to see Christ in the Eucharist, not that hee doubted thereof, but that hee might receive some heavenly comfort [Divinitùs] from God, after prayers for this purpose, he saw (after Consecration, Puerum Iesum, The Child Iesus) in the Hoast, [& amplexatus est eum, & post mul∣tam deosculationem, &c.] he embraced him, and after much kissing of him, he desired to receive the Sacrament, and the Vision vanished, and he received it. So he. These two last, are also alleaged by your Cardinall Bellar. lib. 3. de Each. c. 8. Deus non est teis mndacij, &c. Bellarmine.
4. Not many yeares after a fourth in Italy, Ex Guitmundo, & Lanfranco, Bozius & Coccius ibid. A Priest saying Masse, and finding [Veram carnem super Altare, verumque sanguinem in Calice,] True flesh upon the Altar, and true Blood in the Cp, fearing to receive it, forthwith reported it to the Bishop, demanding what he should doe; The Bishop consulteth with the other Bishops his Brethren, by whose common consent the Priest taking the Cup and the flesh, shut them up in the middest of the Altar, [Haec pro divinissimis miraculis summa cum reverentia servanda decrevit:] The Bishop decreed, that these should be perpetually reserved, and kept as most divine Reliques. 5. Anno 1050. Tempore quo, vrgēte nefando Be∣rengario, haec in con∣troversiam sunt ad∣ducta, ut Deus adsti∣pulatus intelligatur veritati, & refragatus errori, &c. Baron 1059. num. 20. ex Pe∣tro Damiano. Cardinall Baronius will needs have you know, that Berengarius was confirmed by a like miracle from God, as the Bishop of Amalphi (saith he) witnesseth to Pope Stephen upon his oath; That when hee was doubting of the truth of the Body of Christ, in the Sacrament, at the breaking of the Hoast [Rubra & per∣fecta caro inter eius manus apparuit, it a ut digitos eius rentaret] Red and perfect flesh appeared betwixt his hands, insomuch that his hands were bloodied therewith. 6. Anno 1192. Behold an History (saith your Quae admiranda hoc seculo in Slavo∣rum Historiâ, authore Helmoldo Abbate, huius seculi narran∣tur fide dignissima, accpe. His ferme di∣ebus, &c. Baron. anno 1192, num. 20, and 21. Haec de Transubstan∣tiatione: confutavi item idem miraculū Haeresin nuper obor∣tam egantium aquā vino mixtam mutari in sanguinem. Baron. ibid. num. 24. Cardinall Baro∣nius) most worthy of beliefe (you must beleeve it.) At Thuring af∣ter that the Priest had given the Sacrament to a yong Girle then sicke, and had washed his fingers in a pot of water, she observing it very dili∣gently, willed them that were by to vncover the water, for I saw (said shee) a piece of the Eucharist fall out of the hands of the Priest into it: which being brought unto her to drinke, all the water was turned into Blood, and the piece of the Hoast, albeit no bigger than a mans finger, was turned [In sanguineam carnem] into a bloody flesh. All that see it are in horrour, the Priest himselfe, suspecting his owne negligence, feareth, and wisheth that it may be burned. After was this made knowne, and divulged to the Bishop of Mentz. This Archbishop com∣mandeth his Clergy to attend upon this, whilst it should be carried in publike procession untill they came into the Church of the blessed Virgin Mary where prayers are made by the Archbishop, that God would be pleased to retransforme this [in primam substantiam panis, & vini] into the former substance of Bread and Wine: and so at length it came to passe. Thus farre the Story. This (saith the same Cardinall) maketh for Transubstantiation, and confuteth the Heresie of those that deny that water mixed with the Eucharist is turned into Blood. So he. 7. Anno 1230. Bozius quo supra ex Viliano. A Priest in Florence looking into the Chalice saw drops of Blood divided into parts, and ioyning together againe, an Ab∣batisse lendeth the Priest a Violl to put the Blood in, which the third day after appeared to be flesh. This Flesh is still reserved in a Cristall glasse in the Church of Saint Ambrose in Florence: and although the outward formes thereof be somewhat darke, yet are they to be seene of all Traullers. So hee. 8. Anno 1239. Bezis quosupra. In the Kingdome of Valentia [Verè memorabile] a thing truly memorable; In the time of the warres betweene the Chri∣stians and Mahmetans there was seene of the Priest in the Altar pieces
of the Hoast inclosed in linnen, and sprinkled with drops of blood, which Hoast afterwards by aduise was laid, with all reverence, on the backe of a Mule to be carried to that place, wheresoever the Mule should make a stand. The Mule (although inticed often by Provande to stand else-where) never made stay untill he came to an Hospitall of Dorchara, where falling downe upon his knees (least he might afterwards carry any thing lesse noble, and worthy then that Hoast) protenùs expi∣ravit] he suddenly died. 9. Bozius ibid. ex Viliano, &c. Anno 1258. When the Priest celebrated the Masse in the Kings Chappell at Paris, and was now in elevating the Hoast, to shew it unto the people, many of them presently saw [formosissimum puerum] a most beautifull Child; And out of the Eucharist [sanguis copiosuse∣manavit] much blood issued out; so that this cannot be imputed to the Art of the Devill. 10. Anno 1261. Bozius ibid. and Onuphrius in vita Ʋr∣bani Quarti. Viv{us} san∣guis ex hostia mana∣vit, & totam mappā, quam Corporale vo∣cant, tinxit. [Illustrissimum illud] The most famous, upon occasion whereof the Feast of Corpus Christi day was first instituted, which Panvinus mentioneth in the life of Pope Vrban the Fourth, when there issued out of the Eucharist [sanguis copiosus] Abundance of Blood. So that it cannot be attributed to the cunning of the Deuill. 11. Anno 1273. Bozius ibid. A Miracle was seene at Picenum, where a wo∣man reserved the Eucharist, which she should have eaten, and kept it with purpose to abuse it for recouering the love of her Husband by Magicke; The Hoast she laid on Coales, and it presently turned into flesh: She was astonished, but concealed it by the space of seven yeares, at length she discovereth it to a Priest, he found this flesh being hid so long in a Dung-hill [intactam, & illaesam] perfect, and entire: hee published this Miracle, which moued infinite numbers to come and see it. And even now, after, it doth yet incite men to come and visit it, for the flesh is seene after so many yeares uncorrupt, to the eternall me∣mory thereof. 12. Anno 1510. Bozius ibid. At Knobloch, a Village under the Marquisate of Brandenburgh, one Paulus Formosus on a night stole the Pix where∣in the Eucharist was reserved, he sold it to a Iew, The Iew pierced it through with a Dagger, and blood flowed out, &c. Most of all these are related by Master Master Brerely in his Booke of the Litur∣gie of the Masse, pag. 188. & 399. Brerely Priest; whereupon hee maketh this Conclusion: Miracles shewed by God (saith he) doe forceably confirme the same, for at breaking of the Hoast at sundry times great copie and abundance of blood issued out, as hath beene formerly testified. So they. It were pittie, when as so many Countries have beene gra∣ced with such Miracles, England should be thought unwor∣thy of like honour; nay here also wee heare there was (Anno 950.) at Canterbury Master Fox Acts and Monuments, pag. 1115. ex Osberno, in vita Odonis. a Miracle wrought for confirming divers Clergy men (then wavering) in the Doctrine of Transubstantiation, by a Bloody dropping of the Hoast at Masse.
That these were not Apparitions of true Flesh, and true Blood of Christ, by the iudgement of Romish Schoole-men. SECT. III. YOur Bellarmine, Baronius, Bozius, Mr. Breerly, and Coccius have, for proofe of the Corporall presence of Christ, insisted upon Appa∣ritions of (as they have said) true flesh, red flesh, perfect flesh of the Infant Iesus; and the child Iesus seene, embraced, and kissed in the Eu∣charist: of wine turned into Blood, of Droppes of Blood, sprinkling droppes of Blood, issuing out, and bloodying the fingers of the Priest, that saw it. But we rather beleeve your Schoole-men, of whom (be∣sides many Reverà videri Christum in specie pueri, aut carnis o∣pinantur, sed cum dubitatione, Alen∣sis, Gabriel, Pala∣cius, Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. Disp. 55. §. 2. pa. 710. that doubted) divers, together with Thomas Aquinas, with the Thomists, and other Authors, alleged by your Iesuite, Suarez, denyed all this, saying Dicendum est in huiusmodi appariti∣one non videri Chri∣stum in se: ita Tho∣mas & omnes Tho∣mistae. Suarez. ibid. Quandò apparet ta∣lis specis, quidam dicunt, quod est pro∣pria species Chri∣sti corporis, nec obstare dicunt, quod aliqua tantùm pas carnis, aut quod spe∣cies pueri appare∣at, quià potest Chri∣stus in qua vult spe∣cie apparere in pro∣pria sive aliena: sed hoc est inconveni∣ens, quia species Christi non potest in propria specie videri, nisi in uno loco, in quo definitive continetur: undè vide∣atur in propria specie in coelis, non videtur in hoc Sacramento. Legitur quando{que} multorum Episco∣porum Concilio in pixide reservatum, quod nefas est de Christo in propria specie sentire. Aquinas. par. 3. qu 76. art. 8. Quis facile credat, quando visus est sanguis ab hostia sluere, illud esse sanguinem Christi? vel quando Ca∣lix visus est repleri Christi sanguine, ibi esse Christi sanguinem extra venas corporis, ita vt tangi, aut bibi possit? Et simile est, quandò appareat quasi frustum Carnis, quod illa fit vera Christi caro: nam per sese appa∣rent indecentia, sive multo, sive parvo tempore duret. Et nulla est necessitas tot multiplicandi miracula. Ex∣perientia docet mutari, & tabescere id quod videbatur caro, & sanguis, quod non potest ulla ratione carni Christi attribui. Dicendum est id, quod in huiumdi Apparitionibus videtur, non solùm non esse canem & sanguinem Christi, sed non esse verum sanguinem, ut veram carnem, sed colore tantum, & figurâ. Suarez Iesuit. quo suprà. And the Iesuite Sillivitius Senensis, Moral. quaest. Tom. 1. Tract. 4. cap. 4. & 5. Num. 142. & 101. In istis apparitionibus non videtur caro & sanguis in se, sed tanùm figura & color il∣lam referens. That in such Apparitions there is no True flesh, nor true blood of Christ at all. Their Reasons; First, Be∣cause Christ (say they) cannot appeare in his owne proper forme in two places at once. Secondly, Because it were hainous wickednesse to inclose Christ in a Boxe, appearing in his owne forme. Thirdly, Be∣cause Christ's Blood to issue, and sprinkle out of his veines, who can easily beleeve? Fourthly, Because it were undecencie to reserve such Reliques, experience teaching that they doe putrifie. Thus your owne Schoole-men produced, and approved by Suarez the Iesuite, whose Conclusion and Resolution is, that The flesh thus appearing is not onely not the flsh of Christ, but even no true flesh at all, but onely a co∣lour, and Signe thereof. So they. Do you not then see the different faith of your owne Historians, and of your owne Divines? namely that those Historians as vncleane beasts swallow downe at the first whatsoever commeth into their Mawes; but those your Divines, like more cleane creatures, doe ruminate and distinguish truth from falshood, by sound reason and iudgement, and prove the Au∣thors of such Apparitions flat lyars; the Reporters uncredi∣ble Writers; and the Beleevers of them starke Fooles.
That the Romish Answere, to free their former pretended Mi∣raculous Apparitions from suspition of Figments, or Illusions, is Vnsufficient. SECT. IV. ALbeit in these Apparitions there be not true flesh (say Quamvis non fiat t vera cao Christi, vel reverà vera car (ut respon∣dent Thomistae) sed tantum color, & figu∣ra cius, tamen quod sit extema species, sive imago divinitùs facta, sufficiens est ad confirmationem veritatis. Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. Disp. 55. Sect. 2. some of your Doctors) yet such Apparitions, being miraculously wrought, are sufficient Demonstrations that Christs Flesh is in the Eucharist. But why should not we yeeld more credit to those School∣men? who say Alens. Gabriel, Palacius dicunt quod miracula fiunt veris, & non apparentibus signis & figuris—Asserunt talem appa∣ritionem non esse fa∣ctam virtute Dei, sed Daemonis. Suarez. Ibid. [Where hee ad∣deth; Hoc ab ijs gra∣tis dictum est.] True miracles use to be made in true signes, and not in such as seeme onely so to be; because seeming signes are wrought by the Art of the Divell. And we take it from the Assurance, which your Iesuite giveth vs, that Potest Daemon repraesentare figuras quarum libet rerum, ut argenti, auri, ∣pularum, quemad∣modum peritissimi Sculptores & Picto∣res varias formas, & figuras rerum ità fingunt, ut interdum verè esse videantur. Sed verè & propriè miraculum id dicitur opus, quod omnis naturae creatae vim at{que} potentiam excedit. Et una differentia, qua vera miracula possunt à falsis discerni, haec est, quòd falsa sunt phantastica, & simulata, ideo{que} non diuturna: vel sunt planè inutitila. Perer. Ies in Ex. 7. Disp. 4. Num. 34. & D. 5. N. 36, 38. Tertia ratio sumi potest ad confirmandam veritatem Corporis, ex dignitate personae corpus assumentis: quae cum sit veritas, non decuit ut in eius opere aliqua fictio insit. Aquin. part. 3. qu. 5 Art. 2. Divels and Painters can make such semblan∣ces and Similitudes: and that true Miracles are to be discerned from false, in that false Miracles carie onely a likenes of things, and are un∣profitable. Furthermore, your P Aquinas proveth against the Here∣tikes, from Sense, that Christ had a true Body, Because it could not agree with the dignity of his person, who is Truth, that there should be any fiction in any worke of his. Thus stand you still confuted by your owne domesticall witnesses. Wee may adde this Reason, why there could be no Resem∣blances of Truth, because all the personall Apparitions are said to be of an Infant, and of the Childe Iesus; albeit Christ, at his ascension out of this world Baron. Ann. 34. was 34. yeares of age: and yet now behold Christ an Infant 34. yeares old! as if your  had be∣held Christ, with the Magi, in Bethlehem, at the time of his birth; and not in Bethaven, with his Disciples, at the instant of his A∣scension. Of the Suggesters of such Apparitions; and of their Complices. SECT. V. THe first Apparition of flesh above-mentioned was not before the dayes of the Emperour Arcadius, which was about the yeare 395. The second not untill 700. yeares after Christ; nor is it read of any like Apparition in all the dayes of Antiquity, with∣in the compasse of so long a time; excepting that of one Marcus, recorded by Irenaeus adver∣sus Haereses. lib. 1. ca. 9. Marcus purpureum & rubicundum ap∣parere facit, ut puta∣retur ea gratia san∣guinem stillare in Calicem per invo∣cationem. Irenaeus, who faigned to Make the mixed wine in the
Cup, through his Invocation to seeme redd, that it might be thought, that grace had infused Blood into the Cup: which the same Father noteth to have beene done by Magicke; at what time there were dayly Proselytes and new Converts to the Christian Religion, and on the other side divers Rankes of Heretiques, as namely Valenti∣nians, Manichees, Marcionites, and others, who all denyed, that Christ had any corporall, or Bodily Substance at all. Were it not then a strange thing that so many Apparitions should be had in af∣ter-times, in Churches established in Christian Religion, and no such one heard of in these dayes of Antiquity, when there seemed to be a farre more necessary use of them, both for confirming Pro∣selytes in the faith, and reducing Heretiques from their Errour? (that Apparition onely of Marcus excepted, which the Church of Christ did impute to the Diabolicall Art of Magicke.) As for the Reporters, much need not to be said of them: Simon Metaphrastes is the first, who was of that small Credit with your Cardinall that, in Answere to an Obiection from the same Author, hee said; Bellar. lib. 2. de Pont. cap. 5. §. Neque. And Baronius: Si qua fides adhiben∣da est Metaphra∣sti, qui nullam hîc meretur fidem. Ann. 44. num. 38. I am not much moved with what Metaphrastes saith. And if the Fore-man of the inquest be of no better esteeme, what shall one then thinke of the whole Packe? As for the testimony under the name of Amphilochius (obiected by your Coccius Thesaur. Cath. de Eucharistia. Coccius) writing the life of Basil, and mentioning the like Apparitions of Flesh, we make no more account of it, then doe your two Sed haud dubio falsa, vel supposititia. Lib. de Script. Eccles. Tit. Amphilochius; & Card. Baron. ad Ann. 378. Num. 10. Cardinals, by whom it is reiected as Supposititious and Bastardly. But the Sugge∣sters of these Apparitions, what were they? (a matter observable) ordinarily Priests, together with either old men, weomen, and sometimes young Girles, who (wheresoever superstition raigneth) are knowne to be most prone thereunto. That we say nothing of the lewde Iugglings of your Prists, who in other kinds have beene often discovered amongst us, and in other Countries. We conclude. A true Miracle, for Confirmation of Religion (we are sure) is Divinum opus, the Infidell Magicians being enforced to confesse as much, saying, Exod. 8. 19. Digitus Dei hic est. And as sure are we that a fained miracle (although it be in behalfe of Religion) is impi∣ous and blasphemous against God, who being the God of Truth, neither will, nor can be glorified by a lie: Iob. 13. 7. Hath God need of a Lye? (saith holy Iob.) Wee right willingly acknowledge, that diuers Miracles have beene wrought, for verifying the Eucharist to be a Divine Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Christ: but to be it selfe the true and substantiall flesh of Christ, not one. When a Socrat. Hist. lib. 7. c. 17. Iew, that had beene once Baptized by one Bishop, betooke himselfe to another Bishop, to be againe Baptized of him, in hope of profi, The Water in the Font presently vanished away. Aug. de Civit. lib. 22. cap. 8. Medicum podagicum non so∣lùm dolore, quo ultra solitum cruciabatur: verūetiam podagrâ caruisse, nec ampli∣us quamdiu vixisset pedes doluisse. S. Augustine telleth of a Physitian, who was vexed extreamly with the Gout, and at his Baptisme was freed from all paine, and so continued all his life long. Baron. Ann. 984. Num. 19. Ba∣ronius reporteth another of a Child fallen into a little well, prepa∣red for men of age to be Baptized in, and after that it was held for
drowned, in the opinion of all by-standers, at the prayer of Da∣mascus it arose from the bottome as whole and sound as it was be∣fore. These Miracles happened not for the dignifying of the mat∣ter, which was the water of Baptisme, but of the nature of the Sa∣crament it selfe, albeit voyd of the Corporall presence of Christ. Not to tell you (which your Tanta fuit Evan∣gelii authoritas, ut e∣tiam codices ipsi mi∣racula ediderint: ut Greg. Turonensis in vitâ Patrum narrat de S. Gallo, qui E∣vangeliorum codice accepto civitatis in∣cendium restinxit: ut & S. Martinus, Ecclesia S. Anastasiae slagrante, teste Ni∣cephoro, li. 5. cap. 22. Durant. de Ritib. lib. 2. c. 23. Num. 22. Durantus will have you to know) of Miracles, wrought by the Booke of the Gospell, for the extingui∣shing of Fiers. This first Obstacle being removed out of the way, our passage will be so much the more easier in the follow∣ing Discourse. CHAP. III. That the Romish manner of the Corporall Presence of Christ, in the Sacrament, is mani∣foldly Impossible. SECT. I. NO sooner doe you heare Protestants talke of the Impos∣sibility of your manner of Presence, which your Church prescribeth, but you presently cry out upon them, as vpon Blasphemous Detractors from the Omnipotencie of God, as if they meant Absit ut fidelis quispiam aurem ac∣cōmodet impijs Sa∣cramentarijs, qui ex∣coecatâ mente omni∣potentiam Christi in hoc Sacramento vel comprehendere de∣trectant: quod tan∣quam pestem lethalem vitare, & intellectum nostrum in obsequium Christi captivare debemus. Theologi Co∣lon in Provinc. Conc. Tract. de Sacram. Euch. fol. 92. To tie God to the Rules of Nature, as your Authors are pleased to suggest. Wee hold it necessary therefore to remoue this scandall, thus cast in the way for simple people to stumble upon, before wee can conveniently proceed to the maine matter; and this wee shall endeavor to doe by certaine Propositions. That, by the Iudgement of ancient Fathers, some things (by reason of Contradiction in them) may be called Impossible, with∣out the impeachment of the Omnipotencie of God; yea, with th great advance∣ment thereof. SECT. II. THis Proposition accordeth to the Iudgement of Ancient Fa∣thers, shewing that Aug. de Civit. l. 5. c. 10. Dicitur Deus omnipotens faciendo quod vult, non faci∣endo quod non vult: quod si accideret, nequaquam esset omnipotens: unde proptereà quaedam non potest, quia est omnipotens: non potest mori, non peccare, non falli. Ambros. lib. 6. Epist. 37. ad Chromat. Non posse mori, non infirmitatis est, sed virtutis. Chrysost. in Ioh. Nihil impotentius quàm hoc posse. Adde hereunto Theod. Dial 3. c. 4. Impossibilia sunt omnipotenti Deo, : Sic posse, esse . Na∣zianz. Orat. 36. : vel, . God cannot doe something, even because he
is omnipotent, as not die, not sinne, not lye, because such Acts proceed not from power, but from impotencie, and infirmity. So the Fathers. It is not long since you have beene taught by an exceeding wor∣thy Scholler, that in such Cases as imply Contradiction the anci∣ent Fathers noted the pretence of Gods omnipotencie to have beene anciently Casaub. Exercit. 3 ad Baron. An. 91. Num. 91. Scitum est pio∣rum Patrum, Omni∣potentiam esse Asy∣lum Haereticorum, quo se recipiant, u∣bi rationibus fue∣rint victi. Greg. Na∣zianz. Orat. 51. . Sic Ariani ab Orthodoxis convicti, Christum Deum non esse , eò confugiebant, ut docerent per omnipotentiam Dei hoc esse factum: qui error confutatur ab Augustino, qu. 79. Vct. & novi Test. Potentia (inquiunt) Dei haec est, ut falsa sint vera: mendacis est, ut falsum dicat verum, quod Deo non competit. The Sanctuary of Heretiques. And they give an instance in the Arrians, who denying Christ to have beene God eternall, beleeved him to have beene created God in time; as if it were possible there should be a made God, whose property is to be eter∣nall. Their onely pretence was Gods Omnipotencie, to make false things true: wherein they proved themselves the greatest Lyars. Take unto you a second Proposition. II. That the Doctrine of the same Impossibility (by reason of Contradiction) doth magnifie the power of God, by the universall consent of Romish Doctors; and their divers examples of Impossibility, con∣cerning a Bodie. SECT. III. YOur owne Iesuites doe lay this for a ground: Dicendū, Deum omnia posse facere, quae ullo modo fiant. Omnes Theologi di∣cunt, Deum esse om∣nipotentem, quià po∣test id omne, quod nō implicat contradi∣ctionem, quae ponit esse & non esse simul: & proindè si illud fi∣eret, fieret aliquid, cuius esse esset non esse, &c. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. c. 2 §. Alio igi∣tur. Idem. Adversarij conveniunt in hoc, id non posse fieri, quod implicat con∣tradictionem. Ibid. Ipsa contradictio cō∣sistit in esse, & non esse. Si Deus haberet esse coniunctum cùm non esse, non esset Deus: Si non esset Deus, non esset Omnipotens. Quare posse facere quod implica contradictionem, est Deum posse non esse omnipotentem. Maldon. Ies. Tom. 1. de Euch. qu. 1. p. 153. & Perer. Ies. in Gen. 17 initio. All Divines affirme (say they) that God is omnipotent, because hee can doe any thing that implyeth not contradiction; for that Contradiction both affirmeth and denyeth the same thing, making it to be, and not to be that it is. But God, who is Being in himselfe, cannot make a thing ioyntly to be and not to be. This is a Contradiction, and were not Om∣nipotencie but Impotencie; not an effect, but a defect. To conclude. Every thing either is, or is not: take away this Principle (say you) and farewell all learning and knowledge. So you, and that, without contra∣diction, most truely. As your Doctors have taught the truth in Thesi, and Doctrine, so will they manifest the same in Hypothesi, by examples of Impos∣sibilities, because of Contradiction: namely, that it is I. Impossibile est Deum posse conti∣neri in aliquo loco. Greg. de Valent. Ies. II. Fieri non potest divinâ virtute, ut spiritus existat more corporum divisibiliter. Bellar. lib. 1. de Euch. cap. 14. §.

Fieri non potest, quòd corpus Christi, ut sit in Sacramento, ex uno in alium locum venerit, ita enim fieret, ut à coelo fidelibus abesset, quoniam nihil movetur, nisi locum deserat è quo movetur. Catechis. Rom. de Euch. nu. 31. p. 187. VIII. Dicere Deum facta in∣fecta reddere, quis non videt idem esse, ac dicere Deum posse facere, ut quae vera, non sint vera. Salmeron. Ies. in 2. Tim. 2. Disp. 3. Impos∣sible for God to be contained in one place: Secondly, for a
Spirit to be divided into parts: Thirdly, for Bread to be the Bo∣dy of Christ, at the same instant when it is Bread: Fourthly, for the same thing to be present together at divers times: Fiftly, for one thing to be twice produced in divers places at once: Sixtly, for a Bo∣dy, having quantity, not to be able to possesse a place: Seaventhly, It is impossible for Christ his Body, as it is in the Sacrament, to come from one place into another: Eighthly, Impossible it is to vndoe that which is once done; because this were to make that which is true to be false. So your Iesuites, with others. III. That the Doctrine of Calvin (who is most traduced in this point) accordeth to the former Iudgement of ancient Fathers. SECT. IV. IT is no new Calumny, which you have against Calvin, as if he had impugned the Omnipotencie of God, in this Question of the Sacrament; which Calvin himselfe did refute in his life-time, pro∣fessing, that he is farre from subiecting the power of God to man's reason, or to the order of nature; and beleeving, that even in this Sacrament it exceedeth all naturall principles, that Christ doth feed men's soules with his Blood. But his only exception is against them, who will impose upon God a power of Contradiction, which is no better than infirmity it selfe. Calumniatur (Westphalus) a No∣bis in dubium voca∣ri Dei omnipotenti∣am—at rerum om∣nium conversionem fieri posse à Christo, nos quo{que} fatemur; verùm inde si quis coelum conversum esse in terram colli∣gat, ridiculus erit veritatis aestimator. Calv. in Admonit. ad Westphal.—Rursus. Nos ita addictos ra∣tioni humanae esse iactant, ut nihilo plus tribuamus Dei po∣tentiae quam naturae ordo patitur, & di∣ctat communis sen∣sus. A tam improbis Calumnijs provoco ad Doctrinam ipsam, quam tradidi, quae satis dilucidè osten∣dit hoc mysterium minimè rationis mo∣do metiri, nec natu∣rae legibus subijci; obsecro an ex Physi∣cis didicimus Chri∣stum perinde animas nostras ex coelo pa∣scere carne suâ, quod naturaliter non fieri omnes dicunt? Dicent; doctrina nostra fidei alis superato mundo transcendit coelos. Cur (inquiunt) non faciat Deus, ut corpus idem plura, & diversa loca occupet, ut nullo loco contineatur▪ Insane, quid à Deo postulas, ut carnem faciat non carnem? perinde, ac si instes, ut lucem faciat tenebras—Convertet quidem quando volet lucem in tenebras, & tenebras in lucem, sed quòd exigis ut lux te∣nebrae sint, & non differant quid aliud quam ordinem Sapientiae pervertis? & eadem est carnis conditio, ut in uno certo laco sit, & sua dimensione constet. Calv. Instit. l. 4. c. 17. §. 24. item Beza adversus Hessusium. Wee (saith hee) are not so ad∣dicted to naturall reason, as to attribute nothing to the power of God, which exceedeth the order of nature, for we confesse that our soules are fed with the flesh of Christ spiritually above all Physicall or naturall vn∣derstanding: but that one should be in divers places at once, and not contained in any, is no lesse absurdity then to call light darknesse. God in∣deed can when hee will turne light into darknes; but to say light is darknesse, is a perverting of the order of Gods wisedome. So Calvin, and Beza accordingly with him. And so say we, that it is possible for Christ, (as God) if he were so pleased, to make of Bread an humane body as easily as of stones to raise up Children to Abraham; for there is involved no Contra∣diction in this. But to make Bread to be flesh, while it is Bread, is a Contradiction in it selfe, and as much as to say Bread is no Bread; and therefore to the honour of the Omnipotencie of Christ, wee iudge this saying properly taken to be Impossible.
CHAP. IV. That the Romish Doctrine of the Corporall Presence of Christ in the Sacrament doth, against that which Christ called [CORPVS MEVM, MY BODY] imply sixe Contra∣dictions. The first Romish Contradiction, in making it Borne, and not borne of a Virgin. SECT. I. THe Catholique Faith hath alwayes taught, concer∣ning the Body of Christ, That it was borne of the Virgin Mary: Secondly, that this, so borne, was, and is but One: Thirdly, that this one is Finite: Fourthly, that this finite is Organicall, and consisting of distinct parts: Fiftly, that this Organicall is now Perfect, and endued with all Absolutenesse, that ever any humane body can be capable of. Sixtly, that this Perfect is now also Glorious, and no more subiect to vilification, or indignity here on earth. But your now Romish Doctrine, touching Corporall Presence in this Sacra∣ment, doth imply Contradictions, touching each of these, as now we are to manifest, beginning at the first. Our Apostolicall Article, concerning the Body of Christ, is ex∣presly this; Hee was borne of the Virgin Mary: which is the an∣cientest Article of Faith, concerning Christ, that is read of in the Booke of God: The seed of the woman, &c. Gen. 3. to shew that it was by propagation. But your Romane Article, of bringing the Body of Christ into this Sacrament, is, that The substance of Bread is changed into the substance of Christ's Body, which inferreth a Body made of the substance of Bread, as we have already See above Booke 3. Chap. 3. §. 2. C. 2. proved, and as all substantiall Conversions doe shew, whether they be na∣turall, or miraculous. When the substance of Ayre is naturally changed into the substance of Water, this water is made of Ayre: when the substance of Water was miraculously changed into Wine, the substance of the Wine was produced out of the substance of water: when the Body of Lots Wife was turned into a pillar of salt, the substance of that salt was made of the substance of her Bo∣dily flesh.
CHALLENGE. DOe you then beleeve your Doctrine of Transubstantiation, that it is the substantiall Change (by the operative wordes of Consecration) of Bread into a Body which you call the Bodie of Christ? then is this Body not borne, but made; nor by Propaga∣tion from the Blessed Virgin, but by Production, and Transubstan∣tiation from Bread: which differences, Borne of the Virgin Mary, and not borne of the Virgin Mary, are plainly contradictory. which was the cause that Augustine (as Bertram. de cor∣pore Domini, pag. 61. Ponamusunum testi∣monium Augustini, quod dictorum fidem nostrorum ponat, in fermone ad populū: potest (inquit) animo cuiuspiam cogitatio talis oboriri, Dominus noste Iesus Christus accepit carnem de Virgine Maria, lactatus est Infans, &c. Quo∣modo panis corpus eius, & calix sanguis? Isa, fratres, ideò dicuntur Sacramenta, quiain eis aliud videtur, aliud intelligitur: quod videtur, speciem habet corporalem, quod intelligitur, fructum habet spiritualem. Ista vene∣rabilis Author dicens, instuit nos quid de proprio Domini Corpore, quod de Maria ntum est,—& nunc sedet ad dextram Patris, & quid de isto, quod supra Altare ponirur sentire debemus: Illud integrum est, neque ulla sectione dividitur, Hoc autem figura, quia Sacramentum. Bertram sheweth) distingui∣shed betweene the Body borne of the Virgin, and that which is on the Altar, as betweene Aliud, and Aliud; one, and another thing. And this Argument hath beene fortified Lib. 3. Chap. 3. §. 2. before, and is furthermore confirmed by Saint Augustine Lib. 4. Chap. 7. §. 6. afterwards. The second Romish Contradiction, to the ouerthrowing of that, which Christ called [MY BODY:] by making one Body of Christ, not one, but many. SECT. II. YOur Profession standeth thus: Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 3. The Body of Christ, albeit now in Heaven, yet is (say you) substantially in many places here on earth, even wheresoever the Hoast is consecrated. So you. Next your Master M. Brerely in his Booke of the Liturgy of the Masse, pag. 150. Because Calvin. In∣stit. 4. cap. 17. §. 10. saith: Etsi incredibile videtur, ut in tanta locorum distantia pe∣netrare ad nos possit Christi caro, ut sit nobis in cibum, &c. Brerely laboureth earnestly to draw Calvin to professe a Possibility of Christ's Bodily presence in divers places at once, contrary to Master Caluins plaine and expresse profession in the same Chapter; where he directly confuteth this Romish Do∣ctrine of Madnesse, saying thus: The same Calvin in the same Chap. 17. §. 24. Cur (inquiunt) non faciat Deus ut caro eadem diversa loca occupet, ut nullo loco contineatur, ut modo, & specie ca∣reat? Insane, quid à Deo postulas ut carnem simul faciat esse, & non carnem? perinde ac si instes, ut lucem simul lucem faciat, ac te∣nebras. Ibidem §. 26. Corpus Christi, ex quo resurrexit, non Aristoteles, sed Spiritus sanctu finitum esse tra∣dit, & coelo contineri usque ad ultimum diem. Et §. 30. Cuius rgo amentiae est, coelum terrae potius miscere, quàm non extrahere Christi corpus è coelestisanctuario? To seeke, that Christ his Bodie should be in many places at once, is no lesse madnesse than to re∣quire, that God should make his body to be flesh, and not to be flesh at one time; whereas not Aristotle, but the Spirit of God (saith he) hath taught us, that this his body is to be contained in Heaven untill the last day. Afterwards Calvin inveigheth against the fol∣ly of your Church, which will not acknowledge any presence of Christ in this Sacrament, except it be locall on earth, As if (saith
he) she would pull Christ out of his Sanctuary of Heaven. And at last, after that he had said, As for the obie∣cted sentence, hee ex∣plicateth himselfe, §. 31. Christus illis prae∣sens non est, nisi ad nos descendat, quasi vrò si nos ad se eve∣hat, non aequè eius potiamur praesentia. & §. 36. ut Christum illi rite apprehēdāt, piae animae in coelum erigantur necesse st. [As untruly also doth he alleage Bucer, Be∣za, and Farel p. 237. who had the same sence with Calvin. Master Foxe said that Christ if he list might be on earth, but hee said not so of and in the same time.] Christ his Body is united to the soule of the Communicant, he so explaineth himselfe, that hee meant a spirituall Vnion: so that it doth fully appeare, that Master Brerely in this point (as usually in many others) alleageth Calvins testimony, a∣gainst Calvins sence; and his owne conscience. It is irkesome to see the fury, wherewith your Disputers are carried against Protestants, amongst whom wee see againe your Master See in the former Allegation. Brerely imposing upon Beza the same opinion of the pre∣sence of Christ's Body in Heaven, and in Earth at one time. Al∣though, notwithstanding, Fieri posse, ut Christi corpus possit esse in pluribus locis simul, praeter hunc A postatam nemoinficiatus est, quod cum redere noluit, tollit ab omnipotenti virtute. Salmer. Ies. tom. 9. tract. 23. pag. 173. your Iesuite Salmeron as bitterly ta∣xeth Beza, for contrarily holding it Impossible for one Body to be in two places at once; whom therefore he calleth an Apostata: and whom Beza cum adversarijs congressus, ubi Calvini mysteria non posse defendere, in eam prorupit Blasphemiam, ut Deum neget omnipotentem: disertè enim scribit, Deum non posse efficere, ut Cor∣pus aliquod, manente substantia, sit absque oco, vel in pluribus locis simul; Illud enim Angeli axioma [apud Deum nihil est impossibile] non sine exception accipiendum esse, quod factum fieri nequit infectum—O argutos Philosophos! qui Dei Maiestatem ad suas physicas regulas non erubscunt revocare Prateol. Elench. Hae∣res. lib 2. Tit. Bezanitae. another tearmeth for the same cause, Blasphemous, as if this were indeed to deny the Omnipotencie of God. Whereas, ac∣cording to our former Proposition, it is rather to defend it, be∣cause God is the God of Truth (which is but one) and Truth is with∣out that Contradiction, which is necessarily implyed in your Do∣ctrine of the Locall presence of any one Body in many places at once, as in the next place is to be evinced. That the same Second Romish Contradiction, holding the Presence of one Body in many places at once, is proved, by the nature of Being in distinct places at one time, to be a making One, not One. SECT. III. IN the first place hearken to your Aquinas, (the chiefest Do∣ctor, that ever professed in the Romish Schoole) Catholiciisti cū Thoma in quartum distinct. 14. art. 2. hāc rationem, cur non possit corpus Christi localiter esse, &c.—Quod si verò non possit corpus Christi localitèr esse in di∣versis locis, quia divi∣deretur à seipso, profectò nec possit Sacramentaliter esse eadem ratione: qui licet dicat hoc non esse per lci occupationem, tamen dicit, per realem & veram praesentiam in pluribus Hostijs, sive Altaribus: quae realis prae∣sentia in ot Altaribus, & non locis intermedijs, non minùs tollere videretur indivisionem ri. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 3. pag. 491. Quidam Catholici, atque in cis Sanctus Thomas existimant non posse unum corpus esse simul in diversis locis localitèr; quià (inquiunt) unum est illud, quod indivisum in se est, & divisum à quocunqu alio. ellar. quò suprà. It is not pos∣sible by any Miracle, that the Body of Christ be locally in many pla∣ces at once, because it includeth a Contradiction, by making it not one; for one is that, which is not divided from it selfe. So he, together with others whom you call Catholikes, who conclude it Impossible for the Body of Christ to be corporally in divers places at once. Which al∣though
he speake concerning the locall manner of being; yet his Reason (as See the former testimony. your Cardinall confesseth) doth as well concerne your Sacramentall manner of being on earth. And Aquinas his reason being this, [Vnum] One (saith he) is that, which is not divided from it selfe: but, to be in divers places at once, doth divide one from it selfe, and consequently maketh it not to be One: which being a Contradiction, doth inferre an Impossibility. So he▪ Earnestly have we sought for some Answere to this insoluble Argument, as we thinke: And your greatest Doctor hath nothing to say, but that the Duplex est di∣visio, una intrinseca, in se, altera extrinse∣ca, & accidentalis in respectu oci. Itaque cum corpus est in di∣versis locis, non tolli∣tur indivisio in se, sed extrinseca, in respe∣ctu oci, ut ùm Deus sit unus, est in diver∣sis ocis, & anima ra∣tionalis est in diver∣sis partibus corporis una. Bellar. ibid. Be∣ing in a place is not the essentiall property of a thing, and therefore can be no more said to divide the body from it selfe, then it can be said to divide God, who is every where, or the soule of man, which is one in every part, or member of the Body. So he. We throughout this whole Tractate, wherein we dispute of the existence of a Bo∣dy in a place, doe not tie our selves every where to the precise Ac∣ception of place, as it is defined to be Superficies, &c. but as it signifieth one space or distinct vbi, from another, which wee call here, and there. we returne to your Cardinals Answere. CHALLENGE. AN answere you have heard from your Cardinall, unworthy any man of Iudgement, because of a Triple falsity therein. First in the Antecedent, and Assertion, saying that Being in a place or space is not inseparable from a Body. Secondly in the ground of that, because Place is not of the essence of a Body. Thirdly in his In∣stances, which he insisteth upon (for example sake) which are both Heterogenies. Contrary to this Assertion, we have already proved the necessity of the locall being of a Body, wheresoever it is; and now wee confirme it, by the Assertion of One, then whom the latter Age of the World hath not acknowledged any more accu∣rate, and accomplished with Philosophicall learning; even Si dicas, corpus est hic, & ibi idem, ipsum quidem distra∣has in diversa: prin∣cipio primo perse, & immediato prohibe∣tur corp{us} esse in plu∣ribus ubi: est autem continuias affectus cōsequēs immediatè unitatem; Contradi∣ctiones enim sunt. Iulius Scal. Exercit. 5. qu. 6. Iu∣lius Scaliger by name, who hath concluded, as a principle infalli∣ble, that Continuity being an immediate affection, and property of V∣nity, One body can not be said to be in two places, as here, and there, without dividing it selfe from it selfe. So hee. Certainly, because Place being the Terminus (to wit that, which doth confine the Body that is in it) it is no more possible for the Body to be in many places at once, than it is for an Vnity to be a multitude, or many. Which truth, if that you should need any further proofe, may seeme to be confirmed in this, that your Disputers are driven to so miserable straits, as that they are not able to instance in any one thing in the world to exemplifie a Possibility of the being of a Bo∣dy in divers places at once, but only Man's soule, which is a spirit; and God himselfe, the Spirit of Spirits, of both which See below Chap. 4 §. 2. and Chap. 5. §. 2. hereaf∣ter. Onely you are to observe, that the Cardinals Argument, in proving Space to be separable from a Body, because it is not of the
Essence of a Body, is, in it selfe, a Non sequitur, as may appeare in the Adiunct of Time, which although it be not of the Essence of any thing, yet is it impossible for any thing to be without time, or yet to be in two different times together. The same second Romish Contradiction manifested in Scrip∣ture, by an Argument Angelicall. SECT. IV. MAth. 28. 6. The Angell speaking to the woman, that sought Christ in the grave, said; He is not here, for he is risen, and gone into Galilee: which is as much, as to have said, hee could not be in both places at once; an Argument Angelicall. But you an∣swere that it was spoken Morally. How? (wee beseech you) as if one should say (saith your Loquitur ad mentem sanctarum il∣larum mulierum—Sed optima est sol∣tio, moraliter intelli∣gi, ut si quis dicat, ta∣lis homo non sede ad mensam, coenatus est enim. Bellar. lib. 3 de Euch. cap. 4. Cardinall) Such a man sitteth not at ta∣ble, for he hath supped: what fond trifling is this, and wilfull per∣verting the Truth of God? for this your Argument, A man sitteth not at table, for hee hath supped, is scarce a probable Consequence, that a man is risen from the table, as soone as he hath supped. Con∣trarily, the Angel's Logicke is not by a Peradventure, but necessa∣ry not imaginary, but historicall; not coniecturall but dogmati∣ticall, and demonstrative. For better explanation whereof, we may turne the Causall word (FOR) into an Illative [THEREFORE,] because it is all one (as you know) to say hee is not here in the Grave [For] he is risen out of the Grave, And to say, Hee is risen out of the grave, [Therefore] he is not heere in the Grave. Vnderstand then, first, that the matter subiect of this Argument being no mo∣rall arbitrary Act of man's will; but the omnipotent Resurrecti∣on of Christ from the dead, (which is a fundamentall Article of Christian Faith, yea, and as it were the foundation of all other Articles, without which, as the Apostle saith, 1. Cor. 15. 14. Our Faith were vaine) the Angell must necessarily be thought to have concluded dogmatically; which is the reason that he is so instant, and urgent, saying to the woman, Come, and see the place, where the Lord was laid. Which he addeth (saith your Videlz. Ad com∣probandum dictum [Non est hîc.] Salmer. Jes. Tom. 11. tract. 9. pag. 72. Iesuite) for confirmation of that, which he had said, [He is not heere.] And as much as if he had said (saith Anselme) Quasi dicat, si verbo non credatis, vacuo sepulchro cr∣datis. Anselm. If you beleeve not my word, give credit to the emp∣ty Sepulchre, in satisfying your owne sight. Therefore was it demon∣strative. And againe, the Angell putting them to make use both of his aying, and their owne seeing; Goe yee (saith hee) and tell his Disciples: And they went (saith the Text) to bring his Disciples word. Therefore was his Argument Doctrinall, such whereby he thought so fully to perswade them that they might informe others in an Infallible Truth. It were iniury unto you to deprive you of that light which Augustine offereth unto you in commenting upon these words of Christ; Marc. 26. 12. The Poore you shall have alwayes with you, but me
you shall not alwayes have. The light, which wil expel all Romish dark∣nesse out of every corner of exception to the contrary, is, first if you shall say, that Christ did not speake of his bodily Presence; Aug. tractat. 50. in Ioh. Pauperes ha∣bebitis semper vo∣biscum, me autem non habebitis] loque∣batur de praesentia corporis: habebitis, secundùm providen∣tiam, secundùm Ma∣iestatem, & invisibi∣lem gratiam—se∣cundùm carnem ve∣rò, quam verbum as∣sumpsit, secundùm id, quod de Virgine natum est, &c. nō ha∣bebitis. quare quoniā conversatus est cum Discipulis quadra∣gina diebus aseen∣dit in coelu, & non est hîc. He spake (saith Augustine) of his bodily presence, in saying, you shall not have me alwayes with you. Secondly, if you answer, that Christ de∣nyed not absolutely his Corporall presence, but onely the manner of his presence on earth, in his visible shape: Augustine will reforme you, shewing, that Christ, in saying You shall not have me; by [Me] meant absolutely his Body, as it is distinguished from his God-head, namely, You shall have mee, according to my Maiesty, and my providence, and invisible grace (all spirituall:) but according to my flesh, even that flesh, which was borne of the Virgin Mary [you shall not have me.] Thirdly, If you reason, saying; But yet is it possible for Christ to be here on Earth, and there in Heaven at one instant? Augustine will confute you, who asking, why Christ may not be said to be here in Bodily presence, giveth onely this reason, because he ascended into Heaven, and (as alluding to the former words of the Angell) addeth, And he is not here. So raw therefore, so vaine, and perverse is that Answere of Morall, and Civill reasoning, which your Cardinall obtruded upon his Readers, against an Argument both so Angelicall, and Evangelicall. That the Romish Obiection out of that Scripture, Act. 9. is frivolous. SECT. V. CHrist (Acts 9.) appeared to Saint Paul, then Saul, when he was in his way to Damascus, &c. whence your Cardinall Simul in summo coelo, & in aëre vici∣no terrae. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 3. §. Se∣cundum &c. laboureth to prove a double presence of Christ, at one instant, (to wit) in Heaven with the Saints, and in the Ayre unto Saul. First, because the light in the Ayre Strucke Saul blinde. Secondly, because others in the company of Saul heard not the same voice of Christ, which he heard. Thirdly, because Saul asked saying; Lord, who ar thou? and heard and understood the voice. Fourthly, Because Saul was thereby made a witnesse of seeing Christ risen from the dead. And therefore (saith hee) was this Apparition in the Ayre. Every obiection may receive it's opposition. To the first, thus: Did none of you ever know a mans eyes so dazled with the bright∣nesse of the Sun-beames on earth, that hee could not see for a∣while; and yet did not the Sun remove any whit from his Sphere? So might the glorious shine of the person of Christ in Heaven worke upon Saul on earth. To the second, thus. Have you not read of a voice from Hea∣ven, Iohn 12. 29. which some heard articulately, and said, An Angell speaketh, and the common people said, It thundreth? be∣cause (as your Tolet. Ies. in eum locum. Iesuite confesseth) they heard it but confusedly.
To the third, thus: Men heare, and heare not, so farre as God is pleased to reveale, or not to reveale himselfe, or his word and voice, yea or any sight unto them; for Saint Stephen saw the Hea∣vens opened, and Maiestie of Christ, when others wanted that sight. To the fourth, thus: The eyes of Saul beholding Christ in Heaven might be as good witnesses of Christ his Resurrection, as were the eyes of Saint Stephen, Acts 7. who saw him; and so much more, because he was both made blinde by the brightnesse of that sight of Christ, and after healed in the Name of Christ. If any desire to know the iudgement of ancient Fathers, in this Case, your Cardinall leaveth him to seeke it where hee shall please. Sure we are that Aug. in Psal. 54. & Tract. 1. in Ioh. Caput in coelis, cuius membra calcabantur in terra. Augustine, Ambros. in 1. Cor. 15. Apparuit ei primo in coelo. Ambrose, Pope Greg. Moral. Hō. 34. in Evang. ad finem. Persecutorem de coe∣lo allocutus. Grego∣ry the first, and Isid. Pelus. lib. 1. Epist. 409. . Et Theophylact. in in Act. 9. , &c. Isidore Pelusiota doe expresly affirme that the ap∣pearance of Christ to Saint Paul was [de Coelo] from Heaven. And if all this were true that hath beene obiected, that Christ appeared in the Ayre, yet is your Consequence but lame, that therefore hee was bodily also in Heaven, if we may beleeve your Iesuite Lori∣nus: Potuittantisper de coelo descendisse. Lorin. Ies. in Act. 9. Because Christ (saith he) might for so short a time have des∣cended from Heaven. By all which you may perceive, that your Cardinall, for all his arguing about the Ayre, hath beene (as the Proverbe is) but Beating the Ayre. And as lancke and frivolous is his Confirmation of their Assertion by (as hee saith) Apparitions of Christ unto divers here on earth, when as yet hee was certainly in Heaven: for it is not certaine, that he appeared personally to any here on earth, if the position of your Evangelicall Doctor Aqui∣nas may stand for good, who held it See above Chap. 2 Sect. 3. Impossible for Christ to ap∣peare here on earth, in his proper shape, in two places at once: which sheweth that these Apparitions of Christ were rather only Visions, without any personall appearing. We are not ignorant how much you attribute to your Cardinall Bellarmine, whom you have heard contending so urgently for proofe of the visible Presence of Christ in divers places at once; and what like Esteeme you have of your great Professor Suarez, who now commeth concluding as follow∣eth. Cōcludo, Chri∣sti corpus tantùm es∣se in coelo & in Eu∣charistia; seclusoque odem Eucharistiae mysterio, non solùm non esset corpus ubi∣que, sed neque e∣tiam esset alubi, ni∣si in coelo: & contra∣rium asserere esse magna temeritas fine fundamento, & contra omnes Theologos. Suarez Ies. Tom. 1. in Thom. quast. 14. Art. 1. Disp. 34. §. 4. The Body of Christ, except it's being in the mysterie of the Eu∣charist, is no where but only in Heaven: and to affirme the contrarie were a great rashnesse without ground; and contrary to all Divines. So hee. We leave these your two most eminent Doctors of the Chaire, and both of the same Societie of the Iesuites, the one for Rome, the other for Spaine, in this their Contradiction, that wee may consult with Antiquity it selfe.
That the Opinion of the Being of a Body, in many places at once; implyeth a Contradiction, is secondly proved by the iudgement of Ancient Fathers, thereby distinguishing Christ his two natures, Godhead and Manhood, one from another, by Circumscription and Incircumscription. SECT. VI. ANcient Fathers iudged it Impossible for a Body to be with∣out Determination in one only place at one time: yea (say you) they did so, but meaning Impossible, according to the course of nature, but not absolutely Impossible, as if by Divine Mira∣cle a Body might not be in many places at once. This is your on∣ly Answere, and the Answere of every one of your Answerers, whereat wee should wonder, but that they have given us so often experience, what little conscience they make, how true their An∣sweres be, so that they may be knowne to have answered: other∣wise they well know that the Fathers meant an absolute Impossi∣bilitie; and that this is most evident by the Heresie which they did impugne; and also by their manner of confuting the same. The Eutychian Heretikes (you Alfns. de Castro cnt. Haeres. Eutych. know) confounded the properties of Christs humane nature with his Godhead, pretending (as you doe) the Omnipotencie of Christ, for the patronizing of their he∣resie, As thinking thereby (thus saith Theod. Dial. 2. Dicunt Christi car∣nem spiritualem, & alterius substantiae quàm sit nostra caro: maginantur se per haec Deu magnifa∣cere, cum tamen falsi veritatem accusant. Theodoret, out of Am∣philochius) To magnifie the Lord Christ, whereas this was indeed (as the same Father saith) to accuse God of falshood. You may heare the same voice sound out of the Romane Chaire. Pope Leo Papa Epist. 13. quae est ad Pulcher. Aug. Subrepsie in∣elligo spiritum falsi∣atis, ut dùm affirmat se religiosiùs de filij Dei maiestate senti∣re, si ei naturae nostrae veritatem inesse non dicat, &c. Leo, speaking of Eutyches, the Authour of that heresie, saith that Hee affirmed, that thereby hee did more religiously conceive of the Ma∣iestie of Christ, by denying his humane nature; whom therefore that holy Pope censureth to have beene seduced by the spirit of falsity. Therefore it cannot be but that the Fathers, in confuting an heresie founded upon a pretence of Omnipotencie, did hold that doctrine absolutely impossible, which they withstood, as will now more lively appeare by the Testimonies of themselves. Theodoret a∣gainst this Heretike argueth thus: Theod. Dial. 3. l. 3. ex Euseb. Emis. (Con∣tra eos, qui dicunt Corpus Christi in Divinitate mutatum esse post resurrectio∣nem.) Hos dire necesse est vel divinae naturae manus & pedes, & alias corporis partes tributas esse, vel fateri corpus man∣sisse in suae naturae finibus. Atqui divina natura simplex est & incomposita, corpus autem compositum & in multas partes divisum: non est ergo mutatu in naturam divinitatis, & quidem immortale factum, & divinâ naturâ plenum; sed tamen corpus, quod propriam habet Circumscriptionem. The Body of Christ, being a compounded thing, cannot be changed into a divine nature, because it hath Circumscription. This had beene no good reasoning, ex∣cept his CANNOT had imported an absolute Impossibility.
Ʋigil. lib. 4. con. Eutych. Circumscri∣bitur loco per natu∣ram carnis suae, & loco non capitur per naturam divi∣nitatis suae. Hec fi∣des est confessio Ca∣tholica, quam A∣postoli tradidetunt, Martyres roborave∣runt, & fideles nunc us{que} custodiunt. Et paulò superius. Quia nunc in coelo est, non est uti{que} in terra. Vigilius (anciently Bishop of Trent) might have read a Lesson to the late Bishops at Trent, who against the same Heretique, distin∣guishing the two natures of Christ, his humane nature by being Circumscribed in one place; the divine by being unlocable, doub∣ted not to inferre, saying of his Bodily nature: It being now in hea∣ven is not at all on earth. And, least that any might thinke this was but his owne private opinion, he averreth saying; This is the Catho∣lique profession taught by the Apostles, confirmed by Martyrs, and hitherto held of the faithfull. So Fulgentius upon the same distinction maketh the same Conclusion, saying of his Bodily substance, that therefore Fulgent. de perso∣na Christi, ad Tras∣mund. l. 2, c. 5. Vnus idem{que} homo localis ex homine, qui est Deus immensus ex Patre. Vnus idem{que} secundum humanam substantiam, absens coelo, cum esset in terra; & derelin∣quens terram, cum ascendisset in Coe∣lum. Being on Earth it was absent from Heaven; and going to Heaven it left the Earth. Damascen had to deale with the fore-named Heretique, and professing to deliver the substantiall diffe∣rence of both natures, hee differenceth them by these contrary Charters, Damascen. de fide Orthodoxa lib. 3. cap. 3. Earum naturarum,  a∣struimus salvari: nam creatum; mansit cre∣atum; increatum, in∣creatum: mortale manebat mortale; immortale, immorta∣le: [.] Created, not Created; Capable of mortalitie, and not ca∣pable of mortalitie; circumscribed, and not circumscribed; and In∣visible in it selfe, and visible: which notwithstanding is in the Eu∣charist, by your doctrine, not Capable of Circumscription, because whole in the whole hoast, and in every part thereof, and to the very Angels of God Invisible. Let vs ascend hither to the more primitive Ages, to inquire of Fathers, who had conflicts also with Heretiques, who gaine-said the Truth of either nature. Athanasius urged Christ his Ascention into Heaven, to prove that he was truely man, as God, because his God-head was never out of Heaven, being Athanas. part. 2. Adversus eos qui nul∣lum non miraculum imminuunt, eo quòd carnem negant: . Vndeterminate in place, and uncircumscribed, even then, when it was Hypostatical∣ly united with the Body, being on earth. Therefore it was his Bo∣dy that ascended into Heaven from Earth. His Argument is taken from Circumscription; even as Nazian. Epist. 1. ad Cledon. Hominem & Deum, . Nazianzene also doth Characte∣rize them. Augustine falling upon such Heretiques, as taught a Bodily presence of Christ in the Sunne, and in the Moone, at once, (which you your selves will confesse could not be imagined to be according to the Course of nature) giveth them first this Ca∣ueat: Aug. Epist. 57. ad Dardan. [After his Caveat; Cavendum ne ità divinitatem astruamus hominis, ut corporis veritatem auferamus.] Tolle spatium corporibus, & nsquàm erunt, & quià nusquàm erunt, non erunt. Et paulòpost. Cum carnis substantijs immortalitatem dedit, naturam non abstulit: Et aliquantò post. Distantibus spatijs non corpora simul esse possunt. Idem contra Faustum Manich. lib. 2. cap. 11. Secundùm praesentiam spiritualem pati nullo modo Christus potuit: secundum praesentiam corporalem simul in sole & luna esse non potuit. You may not (saith hee) so defend the Deity of Christ, as to defraud the Truth of his humanity: then he addeth (as if none could faine a presence of a Body without determination in space or place) Bodies cannot be without space. And againe, Ambros. in Luc. 24. Stephanus non super terram te quaesivit, qui te stantem ad dextram Dei vidit. A Bodie cannot be at one time in places distinct one from another. And what els doth that say∣ing of Ambrose imply, spoken as to Christ? Stephen (saith he) who saw thee in Heaven, sought thee not upon earth.
Cyrill of Alexandria is a Father, whose Patronage your Dispu∣ters would bee thought often to rely vpon; hee is now about to deliver his Iudgement so freely and plainly, as if he had meant to stop the mouthes of all our Opposites in the same Answere, which he maketh against certaine Heretiques, who held that God's nature is a Substance, which can receive division and partition: If God (saith Cyril. Alex. Tom. 2. lib. 2. de Trinit. Si verè Sectionem & partitionem divina natura (ut illi di∣cunt) reciperet, & intelligeretur ut cor∣pus: si autem hoc, & in loco omninò, & quantitate; & si quanta facta esset, non effgeret Cir∣cumscriptionem. fol. 89. Cyrill) should be divisible, as a Bodie, then should it be contained in place, and then should it have Quantity, and having Quantity it could not but be Circumscribed. Will you now say (which hitherto hath beene your onely Answere to other Fathers) that Cyrill meant not that it was absolutely Impossible, that Quantity should be without Circumscription, but onely according to the Course of nature? then might the Heretiques, whom Cyrill confuted, have made the same Answere, and consequently Cyril's Consequence and confutation had beene of no force. What shall wee say? must still the antient Fathers be made no better than Asses in ar∣guing, that your Romish Masters (forsooth) may be deemed the only Doctors, even then, when they prepare the same Evasion for Heretiques, which they devise for themselves? but you must pardon us, if wee beleeue that Cyrill (seeing hee durst say that God himselfe, if hee were a Body, must be in a place, as a thing having Quantitie and Circumscribed) would have abhorred your now Romish Faith of beleeving See hereafter, Ch. 3. Sect. 3. Christ's Bodie consisting of Quantity, al∣beit not Circumscribed in place. CHALLENGE. THese so many and manifest proofes of the ancient Fathers, concluding an Impossibility of Existence of a Body without Deter∣mination in one place, may be unto us a full Demonstration that they were Adversaries to your Romish Doctrine of Corporall Presence, and that all your Obiections, out of them, are but so many forged, and forced Illusions. Wee conclude. If Christ himselfe gave a Caveat, not to beleeve such Spirits as should say of his Bodily presence in this world, af∣ter his Resurrection; Mat. 24. 23. Behold here is Christ, and behold there is Christ: then doubtlesse much lesse credit is to be given to your Church, which teacheth and professeth an Here is Christ, and a There is Christ, in the same instant; as wee shall further more con∣firme by like verdict of Antiquity, when wee shall heare the Fa∣thers proue both that See Chap. 5. Sect. 3. Angels, and all created Spirits are finite Crea∣tures, and not Gods, even because they are contained in one place: and also that the holy Chap. 6. Sect. 2. Ghost is God, and no finite Creature, be∣cause it is in divers places at once. But we must handle our mat∣ters in order.
That the Romish Doctors (in their Obiections) have no solid proofe of the Existence of one Body in divers places at once: from the Iudgement of Antiquitie. SECT. VII. IT is a kind of Morosity, and Perversnes in our Opposites, to obiect those testimonies, which have their Answeres, as it were tongues in their mouthes, ready to confute their Obiections. For Chrysost. lib. 3. de Sacerdotio; O mira∣culum! O Dei benig∣nitatem! qui cum patre ursum sedet, & eodem tempo∣re omnium manibus pertractatur. Obij∣cit. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. c. 22. not consi∣dering what went be∣fore these words, in the same place, where Chry∣sostome will not have his hearer beleeve, that the Priest and People communicating doe not [in terris consistere, sed potius in coelum transferri.] then fol∣loweth, O miracu∣lum, &c.—adest nm Sacerdos non igne gestans, sed Spiritum Sanctum. Chrysostome saith not more plainly that Christ, at one and the same time, sitting with his Father in Heaven, is here handled of Communi∣cants on earth; than hee doth say of the Priest and People com∣municating, that They doe not consist or stay on earth, but are trans∣ported into Heaven. And againe, a little after the words obiected, The Priest (saith he) is here present, not carrying the fire, but the ho∣ly Ghost. These and the like sayings of Chrysostome doe verifie the Censure of your See. B. 3. Ch. 4. §. 6. Senensis upon him, that he was most frequent in figurative Amplifications and Hyperbole's. Another Obiection is commonly made out of Chrysost. ad popu∣lum Antioch: hom. 2. Helisaeus▪ Melotem accepit (Heliae) erat posthac duplex Eli∣as, sursum Elias, deor∣sum Elias. Then ap∣plying this to the Sa∣crament; Helias nem∣pe melotem Discl∣pulis suis reliquit: filius autem Dei ascendens nobis carnem dimisit; sed Elias quidem exutus, Christus autem & ipsam nobis reliquit, & ipsam ascendens habuit. Chrysostome, of a double Elias, one above and another below (meaning, by Elias below, the sheepe-skin, or mantle of Elias, received by Helisaeus,) namely, that Christ ascen∣ding into Heaven, in his owne flesh, left the same, but as Elias did his Mantle, being called the other Elias, to wit, figuratively: so the Sacrament, a token of Christ's flesh, is called his flesh. Which must needs be a true Answere, unles you will have Chrysostome to have properly conceited, as a double Elias; so consequently a dou∣ble Christ. As for the next Greg. Nyssen.—Vnu Christi corpus per totum orbem tot fidelium Millibus impertiri, &c. Alleadged by Mr. Breerly, Tract. 2. §. 4. Subd. 1. p. 149. Testimonie, it is no more than which every Christian must confesse, namely, that it is the same whole, & undivided Christ, which is spiritually received of all Christians, wheresoever, and whensoever throughout the world: the same we say Obiectively, although not Subiectively; as the Sixt Booke Chap. 6. and §. 3. will demonstrate. That your most plausible Obiection taken out of Augustine, con∣cerning Christ his Carrying himselfe in his owne hands, is but Sophisticall. SECT. VIII. Aug. Tom. 8. in Psal. 33. Conc. 1. [Effe∣rebatur in manibus eius] Hoc quomodò possit fierin homine, quis intelligat? manibus alienis portatur quis; suis autem nemo portatur. Quomodò intelligatur de Davide secundum literam non invenimus: in Christo autem invenimus, quando commendans ipsum corpus suum, ait, [Hoc est corpus meum:] ferbat enem corpus in manibus suis, &c. AVgustine in expounding the 33. Psalme, and falling vpon a Translation, where the words 1. Sam. 21. are these (by inter∣pretation)
Hee carryed himselfe in his owne hands; saith that these words could not be understood of David, or yet of any other man literally: for [Quomodo fieri potest?] (saith he) How could that be &c. And therefore expoundeth them as meant of Christ, at what time he said of the Eucharist, [This is my Body.] This is the testimonie which not onely your Obijcit Bell. Vox [Quodammodo] Sig∣ni, non propriâ spe∣cie, sed alienâ, nee modo usitato, sed ex∣traordinariè: satis est, quod non figu∣ratè significatur, L. 2. de Euch cap. 24. Cardinall, but all other your Disputers, upon this subiect, doe so ostentatively embrace, and as it were hugge in their armes as a witnes, which may alone stop the mouth of any Protestant; which therefore, above all other, they dictate to their Novices, and furnish them therewith, as with Armour of proofe against all Opposites, especially seeing the same testimony seemeth to be grounded upon Scripture. Contrarily we complaine of the Romish Disputers against this their fastidious and perverse importunitie, in urging a testimonie, which they themselves could as easily have answered as obiected; both in taking exception at the ground of that speech, to shew that it is not Scripture at all, and also by moderating the rigidity of that sentence, even out of Augustine himselfe. THE FIRST CHALLENGE, Shewing, that the Ground of that Speech was not Scripture. PRotestants (you know) allow of no Authenticall Scripture of the old Testament, which is not according to the Ori∣ginall, namely, the Hebrew text; and the Church of Rome al∣loweth of the Vulgar Latine Translation, as of the only Au∣thenticall. But in neither of them are these words, viz. [Hee was carried in his owne hands:] but only that David, now playing the Mad-man, slipt, or fell into the hands of others, as your Tostatus Abulen∣sis. [Et collabebatur inter manus eorum:] Nempè ad modum hominis furiosi o∣stendebat se, ūt insa∣num. Com. in cum lo∣cum. Abu∣lensis truely observeth. So easily might the Transcribers of the Septuagints erre, in mistaking  for : and so impossible it is for you to ground the obiected sentence upon divine Scripture, even in your owne iudgement. THE SECOND CHALLENGE, Shewing, that the Romanists cannot stand to the [QVO∣MODO] of Augustine. THis word [Quomodo, How] implying it to be impossible for David, or any other man to carry himselfe in his owne hands, excepting Christ, as you defend, must argue either an absolute Im∣possibility, or not: if it intend an absolute Impossibility of any man to be carried in his owne hands, in a literall sence, then could not Christ, as man, be carried in his own hands: and if it do not intimate an
absolute Impossibility, then might David or any other man, by the power of God, have carried himselfe in his owne hands. So that whether thus, or so, you will make Augustine contradict himselfe, if his words be taken in the Precisenesse and strictnesse of that which is a Literall sence. THE THIRD CHALLENGE, Shewing that Augustine in another word following, to wit, [QVO∣DAMMODO] doth answere Saint Augustine himselfe to his owne formerly obiected word [QVO∣MODO.] SAint Augustine after hee had said Quomodo, How? (a word see∣ming to signifie an Impossibility) left that it, being taken abso∣lutely, might imply a direct carying of himselfe in his hands at his Supper, hee qualifieth that his speech somewhat after, saying; [Quodammodò, &c.] that is, After a certaine manner Christ ca∣ried himselfe in his owne hands. Which is a modification, and in∣deed a Correction of the excesse of his former sentence. Our next labour must be to find out the meaning of his [Quodammodo] and what his manner of Christ's carying himselfe was, in the iudg∣ment of Saint Augustine. THE FOVRTH CHALLENGE, Shewing Saint Augustine to be an utter enemy to the Romish Cause in all their other conceited manners, concerning Christ in this Sacrament. AGainst your manner of interpreting the words of Christ [HOC EST CORPVS MEVM] properly, you have heard Augu∣stine often pleading for a Figurative sence. Secondly, against your manner of bringing in the Body of Christ, by Transubstantiation, hee hath acknowledged in this Sacrament, after Consecration, the Continuance of Bread. Thirdly, Against your Corporall Existence of Christ in many places at once, in this Sacrament, or else-where without dimension of Place, or Space, he hath already contradicted you in both, holding them Impossible: and also by arguing that therefore his flesh is not on earth, because it is in Heaven. Fourth∣ly, Your manner of properly Eating Christ's Body Corporally, hee will See the fift Booke C. 5. §. 2. and C. 6. §. 3. renounce hereafter, as an execrable Imagination. Where∣fore Augustine holding it Impossible for Christ's Body to have any Corporall Existence in this Sacrament, it is Incredible he could haue resolvedly concluded of Christ's Corporall carrying of his Body pro∣perly in his owne hands.
THE FIFTH CHALLENGE, Shewing that the [QVODAMMODO] of Saint Augustine is the same manner, which the Protestants doe teach. DOe you then seeke after the manner, which Augustine belee∣ved? what need you? having learned it of Augustine himselfe, by his Secundùm quendam modum, (where he saith) this Sacrament after a sort is the Body of Christ: what, literally? Nay; but (for so hee saith) August. Sicut se∣cundùm quendā mo∣dum Sacramentum Corporis, Corpus Christi est; ita Sacra∣mentum fidei fides est. See above §. 8. at (a.) As Baptisme (the Sacrament of Faith) is called Faith. And if you have not the leisure to looke for Augustines iudgement in his writings, you might have found it in your owne Booke of Decrees, set out by Decret. part 3. de Consecr. dictinct. 2. C. Hoc est. Sicut ergo caelestis panis, qui Christi caro est, suo modo vocatur cor∣pus Christi, illius vz. quod, &c.—voca∣tur{que} immolatio car∣nis, quae sacerdotis manibus fit, Christi Passio: non rei veri∣rate, sed significante mysterio. [Observe that in the words, coe∣lestis panis, qui Caro Christi est, the word caro is by the Glosse in Gratian interpreted Species panis, at the letter (f) Caro, id est species panis, to avoid the absurditie of interpreting Christ's flesh to be the Bodie of Christ. Gratian, where Augustine is alleaged to say, that This holy Bread is after its manner called the Body of Christ; as the offering thereof by the hands of the Priest is called Christ's Pas∣sion. Dare you say, that the Priest's Oblation is properly, and li∣terally in strict sence the Passion of Christ? or that Aug. meant a∣ny such a Manner? You dare not, yet if you should, your Glossa. ibid [Coeleste, &c.] Coeleste Sacramentum, quod verè representat Christi carnem, Christi caro vocatur: unde dicitur suo modo, non reiveritate, sed significante mysterio, vt sit sensus, vocatur Christi corpus: i. Significat. Romish Glosse in that place would presently reprove you saying, that by this comparison is meant, that The Sacrament, representing the Body of Christ, is therefore called Christs flesh, not in verity of the thing, but in a mystery (namely) as the representation of Christ therein is called his Passion. In a word rightly might Calvin. Ad∣monit. vlt. ad Westphal. Augustinum totum esse nostrum, omnes libri clamant. Calvin say, spea∣king of these Controversies concerning this Sacrament: All the Bookes of Augustine (upon this subiect) proclaime that hee is of our profession. Much more, concerning Christ his not being corporal∣ly here on earth, will, by the iudgement of Augustine and other Fathers, be found in the fifth, sixt, and seventh Bookes; besides that which they affirme in this Booke, in the thirteenth, and six∣teenth Sections following. THE SIXT CHALLENGE, In generall, concluding the maine Point. BY this time wee thinke you may discerne betweene plaine dea∣ling, and false iugling: for your Disputers have usually allea∣ged, for defence of your Transubstantiation, and Corporall Pre∣sence in the Sacrament, the sentences of Fathers used in their Ser∣mons and Exhortations, wherein commonly they exercised their Rhetoricke in Figurative, and Hyperbolicall speeches, as hath beene confessed by your owne Doctours; and proved by many their like sayings concerning other Sacramentall Rites; but espe∣cially of the Sacrament of Baptisme: whereas our proofes arise directly from the testimonies of the Fathers, which they have com∣monly
had in their sad and earnest Disputations, in confutation of many, and maine Heresies, where indeed they were necessarily to make use both of their Logicke, for discerning Truth from Errour; and also of Grammer; we meane the Exactnesse, and propriety of speech void of Amphibologies, Hyperboles, and Ambiguities, where∣by the minds of their Hearers, or Readers might be perplexed, and the Truth darkned. This one consideration we iudge to be of ne∣cessary importance. And thus much concerning the iudgement of ancient Fathers, touching this second Contradiction. That (thirdly) the Contradiction, and consequently the Impos∣sibility of the Being of one Body in divers places at once, is evicted by two sound Reasons; the first taken from Contradictory Relations. SECT. IX. YOu have already See above Chap. 4. § 3. heard of the Antecedent, which was gran∣ted by Aquinas, viz. It implyeth a Contradiction, to say a Bo∣dy is corporally in two places at once, because this maketh that one Body not to be one. Which being confessed, you have also heard your Cardinall making this Consequence, viz. by the same reason it must follow, that it is absolutely Impossible. But besides, there are Actions and Qualities, whereof some are Relatives, and have re∣spect to some place, and others are Absolutes. Of the Relatives you have determined that Vnum corpus in diversis locis positū unum habet esse sub∣stantiale, sed multa habet esse localia: ex quo fit, ut omnia mul∣tiplicari debeāt, quae consequuntur esse lo∣cale: illa autem non multiplicantur, quae aliunde proveniunt, Relationes verò ad loca necessariò mul∣tiplicantur, propter dimēsiones locorum. Itaque erit idem cor∣pus sursum, & deor∣sum, propinquum, & remotū, poterit mo∣veri in locum, & qui∣escere in alio loco, nec tamen implica∣tur ulla contradictio. Illa enim dicuntur Contradicentia, quae conveniunt uni respectu eodem, eodem tempore, modo, loco. Ac ne id mirum videatur, Anima humana, quae tota est in toto corpore, & quolibet membro Corporis, certè, ut est in capite, est remota à terra, ut in pedibus propinqua, ut in brachio quiescere dicitur, & ut in altero motū movere. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 4. § Ac primum. One Body (say you) as it is in diverse places at once might be below, and above, on the right hand, and on the left, behind, and before it selfe, may move, and not move, at the same instant, without Contradiction: because it is so said in divers Respects, namely of divers places, as the soule of man in divers parts of the Body. So you. These are but Capriccious Chimera's and mungrell fancies of addle braines, who disputing of Bodily Locality can find no exam∣ple, within the Circumferences of the Vniversalities of Crea∣tures, but only Man's soule, which is a Spirit: which point is to be discussed in the twelfth Section. In the Interim know you, that although Relations doe sometimes take away Contradictions, where they are applyable: As namely, for the same Body to be high, and low in respect of it's owne divers parts, to wit, high in respect of the head, and low in respect of the heele, wherein there is no comparison of any whole, or part with it selfe: yet if any should say as much of the same Body, whether whole, or part, as
thus: The same whole head goeth before, and after it selfe: or, the same one finger is longer, and shorter then it selfe; hee may iustly be suspected to be besides himselfe: all such like speeches being as Contradictory in themselves, (and consequently Impossible) as for a man to say, he is elder, and yonger than himselfe. You See above Chap. 4. §. 3. will say, (and it is your common Sanctuary) that place is not essentiall to a Body, and therefore separable from a Body; so that a man may be in two places at once. And you may as well say, that because Time is not of the essence of a man, some man may have a Being without any time, or else in two times at once. Finally, this your Subtilty would have beene iudged a palpable absurdity by ancient Fathers; among whom Theodoret taught this Philosophie, to hold true in Divinity (to wit) that whosoever hath properly one thing on the right hand of it, and another thing on the left, it is Circum∣scribed in place. Whereby hee demonstrateth the truth of Christ's Body, because it is Circumscribed: and that it is circumscribed, be∣cause it is written of him, that Theod. Dial. 2: cap. 23. . The sheepe shall stand on his right hand, and the goates on the left. Nor doe you your-selves teach, nor yet can you imagine his body to want either his right hand, or his left, as he is present in this Sacrament. One word more. The Fathers, who were many, that distinguished the nature of Christs manhood from his God-head, because the first is Circumscribed, and the o∣ther is not circumscribed, would never yeeld to either of both, that it is both crucified and not crucified; as you doe to Christ's bo∣die, teaching it to be at the same time Circumscribed in Heaven, when it is Vncircumscribed, as it is on many Altars vpon earth. That (fourthly) a Contradiction, (and consequently an Impos∣sibility of the Being of a Body in two places at once) is proved by absolute Qualities and Actions, which are voyd of Relation to place. SECT. X. VVEre it possible, that Actions and Qualities, which have re∣spect to Place, might avoid the Contradiction; yet of such Actions and Qualities as have no Relation to place, it will be beyond your imaginations to conceive so, as will appeare by your owne Resolutions. For your Cardinall, and your Iesuite Suarez, with di∣vers others have thus Corpus Christi, in diversislocis posi∣tum, habet unum sub∣stantiale, & quae sunt absoluta in eo non multiplicātur respe∣ctu diversorum loco∣rum, unde quae recipiuntur à corpore, sive Actiones sint, sive Qualitates, sive quaecunque alia, non multiplican∣tur. Ratio, quia corpus unum est, non multa; ut si corpus Christi in uno loco calesiat, in alio erit calidum: si in uno loco vulneretur, in altero erit vulneratum. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 4. Actus contrarij, ut amoris, & odij, assensus, diffensus, non possunt competere uno subiecto in diversis locis, quia vitales actiones proficiscuntur ex potentia naturali, ut à principio agente, & eadem potentia non habet vim naturalem ad efficiendum actus con∣trarios—Ratio; inter actus contrarios—tantam esse repugnantiam, ut etiam per potentiam Dei absolutam non possint esse in eodem subiecto, & loco, quia sese omninò destruunt ex parte obiecti, Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. Disp. 8. §. 2. §. Atque. determined, that such Actions and Quali∣ties
as are reall in a Body, without any relation to place, may not be said to be multiplyed in respect of divers places, wherein the same Body is supposed to be: (As for example) the same Body to be hot in some Countrey, and cold in another at the same time; wounded, and not wounded; passible, and not passible. And the like may be said of Love, and Hatred, which are vitall Actions, proceeding naturally from the Subiect. So that the Body, which in one place is affected with love, cannot possibly but be so affected in what place soever. So your owne Disputers. But have they any reason for these points? Yes they have, (See the Margent) For your Cardinall denying that the same Body, in respect of divers places, may be hot, and not hot at the same time, giveth us this reason: Because (saith hee) it is one Body, and not ma∣ny. So he. A reason Infallible. Your Iesuite Suarez also, deny∣ing that the same party can love, and hate, consent, and dissent at the same time, in respect of divers places, yeeldeth this reason; Because (saith he) these repugnant affections belonging to one subiect, cannot by the omnipotency of God be together in the same, because they destroy one another. Aquinas, and other Schoolemen Quicquid pertinet ad Christū secundùm quod in se est, id po∣test ei tribui in pro∣priâ specie, & in hoc Sacra mento existen∣ti, ut vivere, mori, do∣lere, animatum esse. Aquin. p. 3. q. 81. art 4. Cum Thoma consen∣tiunt Scotus, Alcisi∣dorus, Aegidius, Pe∣trus à Soto, & huic fa∣vet Innocentius. Sua∣rez quo supra p. 602. denying that the same Body can be said to grieve, and not to grieve, both at once, in respect of divers places of being, propoundeth the like Reason; Because Griefe being in the same man, as he is a man, cannot be said to be together with not Grieving in him; lest we should make a man not to be himselfe. Lastly, your Cardinall Putatur à qui∣busdam vetustiorib{us} Theologis Christum propter varias eius existētias simul mor∣talem, & immortalē, passibilem, & impas∣sibilem se repraesen∣tare. Alij huic se sen∣tentiae opposuêre tē∣pore Berēgarij, quia viderunt maximè in∣telligentiae repugna∣re, ut idem corpus sit simul mortale, & im∣mortale. Alan. Card. de Euch. Sacram. lib. 1. pag. 451. Alan denying that the same Body, in respect of divers places, can be said to be Mortall, and Immortall, Passible, and impassible expresseth this rea∣son, which (hee saith) was used of old: Because these sayings are most repugnant to the understanding of man. Enough, enough. CHALLENGE. VVE have in these your Premises received as true Assertions, as sufficient Reasons, and as absolute Confessions as can be desired, which will be as so many Poniards sticking fast in the bowels of your Romish Cause, to give it a deadly wound. As first this: See in this Booke Chap. 7. §. 3. and 4. you teach that Christ, as he is in this Sacrament, hath no natu∣rall faculty, either of motion, of sense, of Appetite, or of Vnder∣standing, all which notwithstanding hee hath in all perfection in heaven. But to understand, and not to understand, to have, and not to have an Appetite, you will confesse to be as absolute Qualities, and Acts Contradictorie, free from respect to place, as are those which you have allowed, to wit, Grieve, and not grieve, love, and not love, alive and not alive: because man hath an appe∣tite and Desire, an Act of understanding in himselfe, not as hee is in one place more then in another. Seeing there∣fore you have beene enforced by infallible Principles of sound learning to hold it Impossible for one to love, and hate; and to
have contrary passions together, because they are Contradicto∣ries, and would inferre, that one man should be, and not be him∣selfe. Therefore are you become necessarily Contradictory to your selves. Can there be a stronger Argument than this, to perswade Christians, that your Doctors are men delivered up to strong de∣lusions, to beleeve lies? of which kind this, of teaching a Body to be in divers places at once, is not the least. CHAP. V. A Confutation of the first Romish Reason; obtruded for proofe of a Possibility of existence of a Bo∣dy in divers places at once, taken from the nature either of a Voice, or Colour. SECT. I. MAster In his Booke of the Liturgie of the Masse: where hee hath other as Idle reasons as this. Brerely thus: The difficulty may be better con∣ceived, rather then directly proved, by an example of the same word: the which, being once uttered, is there∣upon at one instant in the severall hearing of sundrie persons, and that not as a distinct noyse confusedly mul∣tiplyed in the re, but as one and the same peculiar word, distinguished by the selfe-same syllables wherein it was uttered. So hee, and your Doctor Wright In his Booke of the Reall Presence, tract. 2 §. 4. Sbd. 1. p. 149. before him. CHALLENGE. BVt the Doctor was answered, that the Example is many thou∣sand miles remote from the Cause, for our Question is of the Presence of the same Body in divers places at once. We say, the same Body; but this your Example of Word, or Voice, which you Both call the same, is not individually the same in every mans hea∣ring, as is here affirmed, but onely the same in kinde, by a multi∣plication of the sounds, and words uttered, as Philosophy teacheth. Like as we see in throwing a stone into the water, it maketh at the first a Circle, and circle multiplyeth upon circle, till the last come to a large Circumference: Even so the Verbum, quasi arem verberans. Cic. word, by voyce breaking the Ayre, doth make in the Aire Circle upon circle, till it come to the eares of the hearers; every of the parts of the Circle being articulated through the multiplication of the first forme, the divers eares doc no more receive the same individuall voice, than they do the same individuall Aire, whereby the voice is conueyed. So that this Example is no more, in Effect, than to prove the same Bo∣dy
in divers places at once, by the sound of a word in many mens ares; which is not individually the same, and serveth for nothing ra∣ther than to make the Disputer ridiculous. Thus was that Doctor answered, when he confessed of the voice of the Preacher in the Pulpit, which is received by multitudes of hearers, and of his other Example of a colour of a red Cow by mul∣tiplication of its formes seene of thousand mens eyes at once, that it is not Numerically the same. Take unto you a cleare Example and Apposite, when in a looking-glasse, broken into many peeces, you see many faces, (all of them being but so many multiplied and refle∣cted Images of one face) you may see, that every Image in every broken peece of the glasse is not individually the same: wherefore these kinds of Instances are but Mountebanke trickes, devised to delude men, that love darknesse better then light. It might seeme superstitious diligence to confute such sotishnes with the serious iudgement of any grave Father; otherwise Greg. Naz. Orat. 51. Vnius corporis locus duorum, aut plurium non est ca∣pax: sed . Gregory Nazianzen is at hand, ready to tell you, that there is as great a difference be∣tweene Bodies, and Voices, and Sights; as there is betwixt Bodies, and Spirits; so that whereas two Bodies cannot be in one place, yet voices, and sights [] are by an Incorporeall manner ap∣prehended, so that the same Eare is capable of many voices, and the same sight of many Visibles. A Confutation of their second, and third Reasons, taken from the Similitude of man's Soule, or Presence of God, devised to demonstrate a no-Contradiction of a Bodie's Be∣ing in two places at once. SECT. II. TWo other Argumentum sumitur ab exemplis Dei, & animae ratio. nalis. Deus est unus in infinitis locis indi∣visibilis, & anima hu∣mana est tota in qua∣libet pare corporis. Bellar. l. 3. de Euch. c. 3. Instances you have, whereby to maintaine your supposed Bodily Presence in two places at once; one is in man's Soule, the other in God himselfe. First, we will enquire into the na∣ture of the soule. Our exception against a Bodies being in divers places at once, is by reason of the distance betweene place and place, for it is farre lesse than imaginable that one Bodie should in one and the same moment be at Toledo in Spaine, and at Paris in France; and yet not to be in the intermediate Space betweene both, which divideth Toledo from Paris. But the Condition of the Soule is utterly different, for it is in the Bodily members, not as a Body in diuers places, but as a forme in it's owne matter; nor ha∣ving Quantity and extension, (the unseperable properties of a Bo∣dy) but by a formall perfection, As containing the Body, and not contained thereof, Anima est in corpore, ut cōtinens, non ut contenta. A∣quin. 1. qu. 52. . saith your Aquinas. For the Soule is so in the head and foot, that it is aswell in the parts and members be∣tweene both; and therefore, not being possibly severed from them, cannot be said to be divided from it selfe. Insomuch that if any
member of the Body (as for example the hand) should be cut off, and diuided from the Body, the Soule being indivisible ceaseth to be therein. So utterly dissonant is the Soules being in divers places. Nay and your Cardinall having See above Chap. 4. Sect. 3. confessed already, that It is not possible by any divine power, that a spirit should be divisible after the manner of a Body; doth hereby as fully confute himselfe, as if hee had said, there is no comparison to be made betweene Body and Spirit, in respect of Locall being: how much lesse betweene it and God the Father of all Spirits, who cannot be so in many places at once, that he is not likewise both in every intermediate space, be∣tweene place and place, and also in all places without them: this being the propertie of his infinitenes to containe all places, and not to be contained of any. And therefore cannot this manner of pre∣sence, without irreligious impietie, be applyed to any creature; which notwithstanding, Quòd si quis re∣quirat esse in loco tàm circumscriptivè quàm definitivè, id requirere, ut non sit alibi; dicere possu∣mus daritertium mo∣dum existendi in lo∣co, nimirùm, per solam praesentiam, quomodò Deus est in loco. Bellar. l. 3. de Euch. c. 4. §. Altero. your Cardinall blusheth not to do in that manner, as was hitherto (we thinke) never imagined by any Di∣vine before him, namely, a manner of being of a Body in a place, which is neither Circumscriptively, as naturall Bodies are, nor De∣finitively, that is, so that being in one place, it is not at the same time in another, as Angels and Spirits are; but a third, how? By only pre∣sence after the manner as God is in place. So hee. O golden Divine! for who knoweth not that Existence in place onely by presence is a propertie of Divine Infinitenes, which being attributed to any thing, that is not God, doth equall the creature with the Creator. A Confutation of the former two Romish Instances in Man's Soule, and God himselfe, by Ancient Fathers, in their Doctrine concerning Angels, and Men's Spirits. SECT. III. ANcient Fathers (we trow) were profoundly learned both in Philosophicall, and in Theologicall Mysteries, who notwith∣standing (as your Iob 1. 6. [Cum venissent & astitis∣sent Angeli, &c.] O∣rigen. Athanas. Greg. Nazianz. tanquàm dogma fidei tradunt, Angelos moveri lo∣caliter, neque omni∣bus locis praesentes, sed esse cui{que} locum suum, & spatium prae∣finitum cùm illud necessario requiratur, ut ab uno loco in lo∣cum alium veniant. Simili ratione con∣firmat hanc veria∣tem Tert. Apol. c. 22. Chryso. Hom. in Heb. 1. Ambros. l. 1. de Sp. S. c. 10. Damasc. l. 2. de fide c. 3. Nazian. Orat. 2. de Theol. Athanas. Epist. ad Serap. Teste Pined Ies. in cundem locum Ioh. Iesuite witnesseth) held it as a Doctrine of Faith, that Angels, which are Spirits, have every one their owne definite pla∣ces and space, and that they cannot be in divers places, but by moving from one place to another, which cannot be said of any Body that (as you say) is without motion in divers places at once. Surely, if ever such strange and paraphysicall, nay more then Hyperphysicall Croches had entred into the minds of ancient Fathers, we should have heard you alleage, at least some one of them, if not for proofe, yet in pretext and colour of patronizing these your repugnant Pa∣radoxes, concerning a Bodie taking the right hand, or left of it selfe, and the like,—Velut aegri somnia vanae finguntur Species.
For your better satisfaction, we shall alleage some Testimonies, which may sufficiently declare their Iudgement of an Impossibili∣tie of a Spirit's being in divers places at one time, whether we consi∣der the Spirits of Angels, or of men; yea or the humane Spirit or soule of Christ. Of Angels, Damascen; Damascen. Orthod. fid. l. 1. c. 17. & l. 3. c. 7. Angelus dicitur esse in loco, . Deus autem ubique existens, corpora ve∣rò . They are so circumscri∣bed in the place where they worke, that they cannot possibly be in moe places at once. Athanasius, Athanas. Tom. 1. Epist. ad Serap. p. 201. . As the Holy Ghost filleth all places, so An∣gels are contained in a certaine place. Accordingly Ambrose: Ambros. de Sp. S. lib. 1. cap. 10. Sera∣phim quod iubetur exequitur, Spiritus quod vult dividit: Seraphim de loco ad locum transit, non c∣nim complet omnia, sed ipsum repletur a Spiritu. Here∣in doe Angels differ from the holy Ghost, which filleth all things, that the Sraphims doe move from place to place. Pope Gregory would be heard speake: Greg. Moral. lib. 2. cap. 3. Angeli, ut & nos, loco circumscri∣buntur: comparati∣one quidem corpo∣rum nostrorum Spi∣ritus sunt, compara∣tione Dei incircum∣scripti, corpus sunt. Angels are crcumscribed, being, in respect of our Bodies, Spirits: but, in comparison of the uncircumscribed God, they are to be esteemed as Bodies. So they. Our next speculation must be touching the soules of Saints departed. The Author set out by your selves, in the name of Athanasius, unto this Obiection; How doe the soules of Saints so often appeare at one moment of time in the Sepulchres, as they seeme to have done? Answereth that They are not the same Saints, but rather visions, and adumbrations of them, by transfigurations of Angels. He giueth his Reason, why he thinketh the other impossible, Athanas. qust. ad Antioch. 26. Quo∣modò (cedo mihi) una existens Petri aut Pauli anima,  apparere in o monumento, & in mille templis per to∣tum mundum, nè Angelus potest? . E∣dit. Paris. Anno 1627. Be∣cause it is proper (saith hee) to God alone to be at one moment of time in two places at once. So hee. And if the Fathers shall say, in effect, as much of the humane soule of Christ, you (wee should thinke) would require no more. Tertullan among his many divine An∣swers, to prove Christ to be God, hee urgeth the Arian Here∣tiques with this one, as not the least: Tert. de Trinit. circiter medium. Si homo tantummodò Christus, quomodò adest ubique invocatus? cùm haec non hominis natura sit, sed Dei, ut adesse possit in omni loco▪ si homo tanummodò Christus, cur & Mediator invocatur? &c. Because Christ is present in all places, where he is invocated upon, which is a power not incident un∣to man, but proper to the nature of God. So hee. How like you this? And Augustine may not be thought to dissent, when in arguing hee tooke as granted, that the Aug. Epist. 57. ad Dardan. [Mcum ris in Paradiso.] Non ex bis verbis in coelo existimandus Paradisus, ne{que} enim in pso die futurus erat in coelo ho no Christus, sed in inferno secundù animam, & in sepulcho secundùm car∣nem. Soule of Christ, when it departed this life, could not be in Heaven, and in hell at once. As for the Beeing of God in divers places at once, which was your Cardinal's instance, for proof of a Possibility of the Being of Christ's Body in many places, without Contradiction of making One not One, by dividing it from it selfe; wee know not whether rather to cen∣sure it gregiously absurd, or extreamly impious; seeing that the Being of God in divers places at once without Contradiction ariseth from the very nature of God's Infinitenes of Being in whatsoever place: which is (as your owne Schoole might have taught him) so, as Aquinas 1. qu. 52 Art 2. Containing all places, and not contained in any: which the Fa∣thers have as fully declared, in making Being in all places, as filling them with his presence, to bee the property of his Deity. Such then is the impietie of your arguing; by labouring to defend the manner of the Being of a Bodie, by the manner of Being of a Soule or
Spirit, denyed by Nazian. Orat. 51 cont. Apollinar. Obij∣cientem: Duo perfe∣cta non continebat Christus, vz. divini∣tatem & humanita∣tem. Resp.  (ut vas unius modij non duos modios continet) . &c. Nazianzene; and manner of the Being of a Creature, by the manner of the Being of God the Creator, excedeth all Absurdities that can be named. The holy Fathers have some∣thing more to Below Chap. 6. Sect. 2. say to you; but first we are willing to heare what you can say for your selves. A Confutation of the Third Romish Pretence; why they need not yeild to these Reasons, whereby their Doctrine is proved to be so grossely Vnreasonable. SECT. IV. MYsteries of Faith, (saith your Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. c. 3. Argumen∣tum sumitur à myste∣rijs, &c. Cardinall) which excede man's understanding, are only to be apprehended by Faith. Such as are the Articles of the Trinity of Christ his Incarnation, of the Resurrection, of the Creation, and of Eternity it selfe; and so ought this, concerning the Presence of Christ his Body, notwithstan∣ding any Obiection from Reason. So you. Wee answere. Some of these former Mysteries we confesse to be such as excede man's understanding, yet such againe they are, as are not contrary to un∣derstanding, though above it; that is to say, such (and this you will confesse with us) as admit not Contradiction in themselves: for it is no Contradiction to say of the Trinitie there is One God, and Three Persons, because the Essence of the Godhead is common to each person: or to say in the Incarnation there is one Person, and two natures; no more than to say, that in one man there is one person, and two essentiall parts, one his Body, the other his Spirit: or in the Resurrection to beleeve the same that was created, might be restored to life, more than to beleeve that one graine of Corne dying, might revive againe: or in the Creation to beleeve that something may be made of nothing, than to say that a blinde man was made to see. As for the last Obiection, saying that Aeternitas est instans Durationis. Bellar. ibid. §. Quin∣um. Eternity is the instant of Duration, it is an atheologicall Paradoxe: for Eter∣nitie is Duration it selfe, without beginning, or ending; which is conceived without Contradiction. In all these your former Pretences nothing is more considera∣ble than the miserable Exigence whereunto your Disputers are brought, whilest they are constrained, for avoiding of Contradi∣ctions in things subiect to the determination of Sence, to pose us with spirituall Mysteries, which are Obiects onely of Faith, by reason of the Infinitenes of their properties; and therefore may well exceede the reach of mans wit, and apprehension, without any preiudice unto Truth, by contradiction: as if they meant to teach men to put out their eyes, and never any more to discerne any sensible things, by sensible meanes. By which manner of rea∣soning
all the Arguments used by the Apostles against Infidels, for proofe of the Resurrection, and Ascension of Christ's Body; all the Reasons of Fathers against Heretiques, in distinguishing of the Pro∣perties of the divine and humane nature of Christ in himselfe, and their former Testimonies in discerning Bodies from Spirits by Cir∣cumscription, and Spirits from God by Determination in one place; and lastly your owne Consequences of many confessed Impossibili∣ties concerning Place, (as the Impossibility that God should be con∣tained in Place, as for one Body having Quantity to be incapable of a Place, and the like) are all vtterly made voyd. For to what end were any of these, if your Pretences have in them any shaddow of Trueth? CHAP. VI. The third Romish Contradiction, against the words of Christ [MY BODY,] is by making a Body Finite, to be a Body not finite. SECT. I. IF (as you have said) the Body of Christ is, or may be at one time in so many places, then may it be in mo, and consequently every-where at one instant. This Consequence your ancient Schoole-men taught, and your Iesuite Quasi non possit creatura esse ubi{que} hoc (inquam) non obstat, nam omnipo∣tentiam illi intellex∣erunt prorsus natu∣ralem, quia si non a∣lienâ virtute, sed su∣apte naturâ res exi∣stat ubi{que} praesens, haec reverà nulli cre∣aturae convenit. Ar nos altero modo non nisi per absolutam Dei potentiam vbi∣quitatem creaturae convenire arbitra∣mur, Valent. Ies. lib. 1. de vera Christi prae∣sent. in Euch. c. 12. §. Quaesanè. pag. 241. Valentia doth seeme to avow, say∣ing, What hindreth that a Body may be [Vbi{que}] every where at once, not by it's naturall power, but by the omnipotencie of God? So he. This we say is to make a finite infinite; and your old Schoole-Doctors are hereunto witnesses, who have iudged it Veterum The∣ologorum apud D. Thomam ratio haec est, si idem corpus possit esse in duobus locis simul, potest in pluribus, at{que} adeo ubi{que}—Et unà cum codem Thoma dicunt, Haereticum esse affirmare, corpus Christi esse poss in duobus locis simul, quia ubi{que} esse, est pro∣prium Deo. Teste Suarez Tom. 3. qu. 75. Art. 1. disp. 48. Sect. 4. Hereticall, to say, that the Body of Christ can be in divers places at once; because then he may be in infinite. So they. And heare you what your Cardinall Bellarmine hath publikely taught? To say (Dicere corpus Christi esse, vel esse posse in Infinitis locis simul, immensitatem divinam requirit. Bellar. lib. 3. de Christio. c. 18. saith he) that the Body of Christ may be in infinite places at once, is to ascribe an Immensity and infinitenes unto it (namely, that) which is proper unto God. So hee, and so also your other Doctors, to whom the Evidence of Truth commandeth us to assent. For what greater Heresie can there be against that Article of our Faith, concerning the Deity, and Godhead of Christ begotten, not made, than to beleeve that there can be a made God? for so doubt∣les doe they (whosoever they bee) that thinke a finite Body may be made Infinite.
CHALLENGE. YOu understand the Argument, viz. To believe that Christ his Bo∣dy may be every where, is a flat Heresie: but to affirme, that the same Body is in many places at once, doth consequently inferre that it may be every where (as hath beene directly professed.) Ergo your Doctrine of attributing to the Body of Christ an Existence, in many places at once, is by the confessed generall grounds of Christianity plainly Hereticall. And from this our Conclusion your Aquinas will in no wise dissent, who himselfe concludeth Aquinas 1. q. 52. art. 2. Deus est essen∣tia infinita, ideo non solùm in pluribus lo∣cis est, sed ubique. An∣gelus quia est virtutis finitae non se exten∣dit nisi ad unum de∣terminatum—undè sequitur quòd non sit ubique, neque in plu∣ribus locis, sed in uno loco tantùm. That the Angell is not in divers places at once, because an Angell is a finite creature, and therefore of a finite power and operation; it being proper to God to be in many places at once. So hee. That, by the iudgement of Ancient Fathers, the Being in divers places at once inferreth an Infinitenesse proper unto God: which without Heresie cannot be ascribed to any humane Body; Proved from the manner of Existence of the Holy Ghost. SECT. II. STill you maintaine the Reall and Corporall presence of Christ his Body in so many places, as there are consecrated Hoasts at one time in the whole world, be they ten thousand times ten Mil∣lions of Millions, or how many soever: which, say we, is to make the Finite Body of Christ Infinite. For Aquinas (as your Vnum corpus es∣se ubique affirmare est Haereticum. Tho∣mas. Quia Catholici ex hac proprietate essendi ubique dicunt antiquos Patres suffi∣cienter probasse Spi∣ritus Sancti Divini∣ratem, ut patet ex Augustino, Fulgent. Ambrosio, Basil. Teste Suarez. Ies. Tō. 3. disp. 48. Sect. 4. Rat. 1. Ie∣suite witnesseth) held it Hereticall, to affirme One Body to be eve∣ry where, because this is a Divine property, by which the Fathers did sufficiently prove the God-head of the Holy Ghost, (namely) Au∣gustine, Fulgentius, Ambrose, and Basil. So he. But how did the Fathers prove this, thinke you? it were good, that where your owne Authours be silent, we heard some of them∣selves speake. Fulgent. ad Tra∣simund. lib. 2. pag. 325. Spiritus Sancti in no∣bis habitatio non lo∣calis est, inhabitat e∣nim Trinitas in suis fidelibus, sicut tota in cunctis: nec per separatos homines, & separata loca particu∣laritèr separatur. Fulgentius his reason is, Because the Spirit of God dwelleth wholly in all the faithfull separated in divers places. Basil. de Sp. Sancto cap. 22. sub finem. Reliquae virtutes omnes in loco circum∣scriptae esse creduntur, nam Angelus qui astabat Cornelio non erat in eodem loco, quo cùm astaret Philippo: neque qui locutus est Zachariae ab Altari per idem tempus etiam in coelo suam implebat stationem. At Spiritus (Sanctus) simul & in Abaccuc operatus, & in Daniele in Babylonia creditus, & in Catarcta cùm Ieremia, & cum Ezechiele in Chobar; Spiritus enim Domini replevit orbem terrarum, [Quo ibo à Spiritu tuo?] Et Propheta; Quonam ego, inquit, vobiscum sum, & Spiritus meusstat in medio vestri. Basil thus: The Angell, that was with Cornelius, was not at the same time with Philip, nor was he then in Heaven, when he was with Za∣chary at the Altar: But the Holy Ghost was together with the Pro∣phet Daniel in Babylon, with Ieremy in the Dungeon, and with E∣zekiel
in Chobar. Ambros. de Spirit. Sancto l. 1. c. 7. Cùm igitur omnis creatu∣ra certis naturae suae circumscripta limiti∣bus, siquidem & illa invisibilia opera, quae non queunt lo∣cis & finibus compre hendi, substantiae ta∣men suae proprietate clauduntur, quomo. dò quis audeat crea∣turam Spi. Sanctum appellare, qui non habet circumscriptā & determinatam na∣turam?—Ideò cum Dominus servos suos Apostolos destinare voluit, ut agnosceremus aliam esse naturam, aliud gratiam spiritualem, alios aliò destinabat, quia simul omnes esse ubique non poterant; dedit autem Spirit. Sanctum, qui licet separatis Apostolis inseperabilis gratiae muns infunderet: quis igitur dubitat, quin divinum sit quod infunditur, simul pluribus, nec videtur? corporeum au∣tem quod videtur à singulis, & tenetur. Ambrose thus: Because the Apostles could not all be every where, Christ severed them, giving them all the Holy Ghost, which was inseparable in them: none therefore can doubt but it is a Divine Essence. Aug cont. Maxim. Axian. Epist. l. 3. c. 21. Cùm sic laudetis Sp. Sanctum, ut in sanctific and is fidelibus ubique praesentem esse dicatis, tamen negare audeatis esse Deum? [The Vbique spoken of the faithfull hath the sence of Vbicunque, because the number of the faithfull is but finite, and their places distinct, here and there, and not absolutely every-where.] Augustine confuteth an Arian Bishop, thus: You that prayse the holy Spirit, in sanctifying his faithfull wheresoe∣ver they are, how can you deny him to be God? Didymus Alex. lib. 1. de Spirit. Sancto, Hieron. interprete, (extat in Biblioth. S. Patrum Tom. 6. pag. 679.) Iose Spiritus Sanctus, si unus esset de creaturis, saltem circumscriptam haberet substantiam—Spiritus autem Sanctus cùm in pluribus sit, non habet substan∣tiam circumscriptam. [And he proveth it is Pluribus, idem in Prophetis & Apostolis, &c.] Didymus of Ale∣xandria (whom Hierome acknowledgeth as his Master, for the understanding of Scripture) thus: The Holy Ghost (seeing it is in many places at once) may not be thought to be a Creature. Lastly upon the same ground Cyrill of Alexandria maketh the same Conclu∣sion: Cyril. Alex. de Spirit. Sancto (quod non est Creatura.) Quum in loco & circumscriptione intelligant quae facta sunt, Spi. autem Sanctus non sit, de quo psallit David, Quo ibo à Spiritu tuo? The Spirit of God is no Creature (saith hee) because things created are in one place, but of the Spirit of God it is written, Whither shall I goe from thy presence? So these holy Fathers, every one Ga∣tholique, without exception. CHALLENGE. ASyllogisme from these premises will set all straight. To ascribe to a Body an Omni-presency, and power of being every where, is Hereticall. But to say that a Body is in divers places at once, doth con∣sequently inferre a power of being in every place (as it doth in demon∣strating the Holy Ghost to be a divine Spirit.) Therefore to attribute to a Body, a Being in divers places at once, is a Doctrine Hereticall, and implyeth a Contradiction, by affirming a Finite thing to be infinite. Adde but hereunto the former See above Chap. 5. & 6. Testimonies of Fa∣thers, who have distinguished the humane nature of Christ from his God-head, and their denying of all Possibilities of Existence of An∣gels in two places at once: and your Consciences must needs tell you, that it was Impossible for the Fathers to have beleeved your Romish Article of a Corporall Presence in every Hoast consecra∣ted at onetime, on divers Altars in your severall Churches. What shall we then further say concerning a Being of a Body in divers places at once? Surely (that which hath beene plentifully proved already) that such an  is egregiously  as well in Di∣vine, as in naturall Philosophy, because (as this whole Discourse sheweth) they have verified that saying of Aristotle, .
CHAP. VII. Of the (fourth) Romish Contradiction against the words of Christ [MY BODY] by teaching it to be Or∣ganicall, and not Organicall; Divisible, and Indivisible. SECT. I. THe Question is not now of the Mysticall presence of Christ his Body in the Sacrament, which we with the Fathers, especially Greg. Nyssen. in Orat. Catech. C. 37. Per totum orbem ide liū millibus uno die im∣pertitur, totumque cuiusque per partem evadat, & in seipso totū permaneat, &c. Obiected by Master Brereley Liturg. Tract. 2. Subdiv. 1. [Answe∣red before, Chap. 4. Sect. 7.] Greg. Nyssen confesse to be whole, as well in a part of Bread consecrated, as in the whole loafe; even as the Image of the King may be as per∣fect in a penny, as in a shilling. But neither hee, nor any Father e∣ver said that a little Hoast (which boast you call Christ) is equall with a great Hoast; No, for the Fathers in the Councell of See below, Ch. 10. Nice absolutely denyed this: nor yet is Christ wholly represented in the least part of the Hoast, as your Fathers of See Sect. 3. fol∣lowing. Trent have taught, because no such part can resemble Totum Christum, whole Christ Sacramentally, which is not of sufficient bignes to be sensibly eaten in the nature of nourishment; thereby to resemble the Spirituall nourishment of our Soules, which is the Body of Christ. So that all you have said maketh iust nothing for the Corporall, and materiall Presence of Christs Body, which we further impugne. That it is necessary the Body of Christ (wheresoever) consist of distinct members and proportions of a Bodie. SECT. II. THe Body of Christ (as we professe) had perfect Dimensions and Distinctions of parts, an head exposed to pricking with thornes, a face to buffers, a backe to scourges, eyes to visible nod∣dings and mockings, eares to blasphemies, hands and feet to pier∣cing with nayles. This is that Body which we confesse to be the Body of Christ, and which we celebrate in the use of this Sacra∣ment, in Remembrance that he had a Body consisting of proportion of divers parts, distinct one from another. Two of your Magnitudo & figura unitae sunt cor∣pori Christi natura∣litèr & inseperabili∣ter—& Christus corpus suum carnem vocat, Ioh. 6. At certè substantia sinè quantitate & complexione quadam accidentium caro dici non potest—Denique in corpore Christi eius animainest: atqui anima in corpore esse nequit, nisi disposito & organizato. Secundò extensum esse in se, & partem habere extra partem, & proindè situm quendam intrinsecum & ordi∣nem habere, & dispositionem partium, omninò essentiale magnitudini est. Quid enim linea nisi extensio in lon∣gitudinem? &c. Si tollas igitur extensionem, & partes, tollis paritèr magnitudinem. Bellar. l. 3. de Euch. c. 5. Tol∣lere partium distinctionem ponit monstrosam corporis confusionem, ut ibi sit nasus, ubi oculus; & manus, &c. Alan. l. 1. de Euch. c. 3. p. 444. Cardi∣nals
doe both answere that Quantity, magnitude, proportion, and ex∣tension of parts are unseparably united to the Body of Christ in this Sa∣crament: or else (saith one) If the Nose should stand where the Eye is, and the Eye where the Nose is, it should be a confused Monster. So they. So necessary it is; even in your owne faith, that the Bodie of Christ consist of Organicall parts, distinct one from another. That the Romish Church hath decreed a doctrine of Corporall Presence of a Body of Christ, withall the parts thereof in the least indivisible point of the Hoast. SECT. III. THe Canons of that Totus & integer Christus sub specie panis, & sub qualibet eius speciei parte in∣est. Conc. Trid. Sess. 13. Can. 3. Sub quavis particula. Catech. R. de Euch. num. 29. Councell of Trent decreed, as a Doctrine of Faith necessary to salvation, to beleeve, That the Body of Christ in this Sacrament is whole in every part of the Hoast; whereby is meant (saith your In singulis par∣tibus continuis, quan∣tum vis minimis, & e∣jusdem quantitatis. Suarez. Ies. Tom. 3. D. 52. Sect. 2. p. 679. Iesuite) The whole Body of Christ is in every albeit the least part of the Hoast. So he. But we demand; how then shall the Body of Christ but want proportion of distinct parts, which you say are Vnseparably united to a Body? You distinguish, that the Respondeo, quod est difficillimum, ob humani ingenij im∣becilitatem. Dico corpus Domini habere partem extrà partem, si vox [extrà] dicat habitudinem ad subiectum, non si dicat habitudinem ad obiectum, non si dicat habitudinem ad locum. Resp. nego consequentiam, quià di∣stinctio partium in subjecto est essentialis: at distinctio quoad locum non est essentialis, sed impediri potest. Bel∣lar. l. 3. de Euch. Ca. 7. Negatur esse impossibile, corpus quantum in indivisibili puncto collocari: quin potius im∣possibile est corpus Christi esse totum in toto, quùm sit etiam in punctis & terminis, quibus partes specierum Sacramentalium continuantur. Suarez quo supra p. 83. Bo∣dy of Christ being in this Sacrament hath extension of parts of a Body distinctly in it selfe; but in respect of the Place, or of the formes of Bread, under which it is, the whole Body is without distinction in eve∣ry least Part and indivisible Point thereof. CHALLENGE. THis is the common Resolution of the now Church of Rome. The exact discussion of this one point will in it selfe illumi∣nate the eyes of any Reader, to discerne betweene the Spirit of Truth, and of Errour; namely, to know, that there cannot be a greater Contradiction (and consequently Impossibility) than for a Body, consisting of proportionable dimensions of Parts, such as are Hands, Legs, Eyes, and other Organicall members, to have Being any where without Extension, Commensuration, and distinct Proportion of the same to the space, wherein it is, as the Proposi∣tions following will prove.
That the former Romish Tridentine Article is new, and contrary to the nature of an Organicall and humane Body, in the Iudgement of Romish Doctors of latter times. SECT. IV. ALbertus, Scotus, Aegidius are recounted amongst your lear∣ned, and Ancient Schoolemen, who (as your Totum Christi corpus in partib{us} in∣divisilibus specierum panis esse negarunt Albertus, Scotus, Ae∣gidius—quia vide∣tur impossibile, in se corpus extensum, & magnae molis cum tota organizatione, & figura in puncto collocari. Suarez quo supra. p. 683. Iesuite testifieth) Thought it impossible, that a Body that hath extension of parts, should be contained in an indivisible point. The same opinion is ascribed by your Iesuites (as ancient) unto Opinio antiqua, quae fuit Durandi, di∣xit corpus Christi in Eucharistia non ha∣berequantitatē. Fun∣damentum huius o∣pinionis fuit, quod essentia quantitatis est, habere partes ex∣tra partes distinctas inter se, fieri aurem non possit, ut si corpus Christi habeat partes distinctas, in Euch. sit to∣tum in qualibet parte. Teste Maldonat. Ies. Tom. 1. de Euch. c. 8. Arg. p. 180. & Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. c. 5. Durand, and Oc∣cham, & alij dixerunt quidam esse magnitudinem corporis Christi in Eucharistia: ed ita, ut nulla sit figura, nec distinctio partium. Sic Occham. Bellar. ibid. §. At. Occham. Now what greater iniury can there be, than, after that it was lawfull for a thousand, and foure hundreth yeares since the Ascension of Christ, for any Christian to professe (with your ancient Schoole-men) an Impossibility, that The Body of Christ is whole in everie the least part of the Hoast; to impose upon men's consciences, as an Article of Faith, so fond and so palpable a figment. That which seemed to the above-named Durand, and Occham such an O∣pinion, whence (as they thought) it must needes follow, that the Eyes must be where the Nose is, the hand confounded with the legges: which (as your Cardinall Alan truly said) were to make of the Body of Christ a confused Chaos, and altogether See above in this Chapter, Sect. 2. monstrous. That the Organicall parts of the Body of Christ must be propor∣tionable to the Dimension of the places, wherein they are; is proved by the confessed Romish Principle it selfe. SECT. V. THe reason, which your See above, Sect. 2. Cardinall layeth downe to prove it necessary, that Christ his Body should have in it selfe (ac∣cording to the nature of a Body, distinct parts of head and eyes, and other Organs fit for the use of a reasonable Soule, hee taketh from Magnitude, which is an Extension of parts into their proportio∣nable length, bredth, and depth: this (saith he) is inseparably united to Christ his Body in its owne intrinsecall disposition, in it selfe; but not so (saith he) in regard of the place. CHALLENGE. THis your owne Reason may wee iustly retort upon your selves, proving, that if the naturall disposition of the Bodie of Christ be thus proportionably extended in it selfe, it must be
so likewise in respect of place, and space; because the three dimen∣sions of the Body of Christ (as you have confessed) stand thus, that one is an extension in Length, another in Breadth, the third in Depth, and each of these three are distinct one from another. Well then, The arme must be here, and thus farre longer than the foot, the legge here, and thus farre thicker than the finger, the hand here, and thus farre broader than the toe, and accordingly di∣stinctly in other parts. But Hîc, and Hucusque; Heere and There, thus farre, and so farre, being Relatives of space, and place, doe demonstratively shew that that Extension of distinct parts of the Body, which they have in themselves divisibly, the same they must necessarily have in respect of the Vbi, place, or space, wherein the Body is. If therefore you will not Heretically teach a Mathemati∣call, or Phantasticall body of Christ, you must deny the Article of Trent, untill you can beleeve, and make good, that a part of a divisible Body, longer or shorter, broader or narrower, can be (and that equally) in one indivisible point. This is confirmed by the Essence of Christ his glorified Bodie, (as you confesse it to be) now in Heaven, possessing a Reall place in the said proportion of Spaces of length, and breadth, as it had here upon earth, which it doth by the naturall Magnitude, or Quantity thereof. But the said naturall magnitude, or quantity of the said Body of Christ is (according to your owne generall Do∣ctrine) in this Sacrament. Therefore must it have the same Com∣mensuration of Space. Wee should be loath to trouble your wits with these specula∣tions, if that the necessity of the Cause (by reason of the Absur∣dities of your Romish profession) did not inforce us hereunto; Therefore must you suffer us a little to sport at your trifling serious∣nesse, who writing of this divine Sacrament, and seeing it to be round, solid, broken, moulded, in the one kind; and liquid, frozen, and sowring in the other, doe attribute all these to Quanti∣ties, and Qualities, and Accidents, without any other subiect at all. So then by the Romish Faith we shall be constrained to beleeve, in effect, that the Cup is filled with Mathematicall lines, the Mouse eating the Hoast is fed with colours, and formes: that it is Coldnesse that freezeth, and Roundnesse which weigheth downe, and falleth to the ground; as if you should describe a Romish Communi∣cant to be a creature clothed with Shadowes, armed with Idaea's, fed with Abstracts, augmented with Fancies, second Intentions, and Individuall Vagues, and consisting wholly of Chimaera's. That your Romish Doctrine is contrary to the Iudgement of Ancient Fathers. SECT. VI. IF this your profession had beene a Catholike Doctrine, doubtlesse Saint Augustine (who is so devout in his fervent Meditations
upon this holy mystery) would not have oppugned it, as he did, when unto that Question of Volusianus (whether the Body of Christ before his birth did fill the Body of the blessed Virgin) he answered, Aug. Nullum cor∣pus potest esse ubi{que} totum, quantum∣cun{que} corpus, vel quantulumun{que} cor∣pusculum loci occu∣pet spacium, cun∣dem{que} locum sic oc∣cupet, ut in nulla e∣ius parte sit totum necesse est: longè a∣lia natura est animae, quàm corporis, quan∣to magis Dei? l. 1. Ep. 3. ad Ʋolusian: [Whose question to S. Augu∣stine was; Vtrum Christus intemeratae foeminae corpus im∣pleverit?] That every body, be it greater or lesse, wheresoever it is, must needs fill that space wherein it is, so that the same Body cannot be the whole in any part thereof. So hee: which is directly Contradictory to your Article of Trent, for here is expresse mention of Relation to place and space. And whereas for usuall colour of a Possibility, that the whole Bo∣dy of Christ is in every part of the Hoast, you have obiected the Ex∣ample of Man's Soule, which is said to be whole in every member and part of the Body: S. Augustine (as if hee had fore-seene your mystery of Errour) pre-occupateth, saying, In eo, quod di∣citur Deus ubi{que} car∣nali cogitationi re∣sistendū est, & mens  Corporis sensibus amovenda, ne quasi spaciosa magnitudi∣ne opinemur Deum per cuncta diffundi, ut aër, aut lux: om∣nis enim huiusmodi magnitudo minor in sua parte, quàm in ro∣to: sed ita potius, ut est magna sapientia etiam in homine, cu∣ius corpus est par∣vum.—Nam si duo fint homines aequali∣ter sapientes, quo∣rum alter est corpo∣re grandior, non plus sapiuntambo, quam singuli; sic in minore corpore non minor est sanitas, cum mi∣nora, & maiora cor∣pora tam sana sint.—Dispar est profecto in membrorum mo∣libus quantitas: sed par est in disparatis sanitas—quae non quantitas, sed quali∣tas est. Non potuit ergo obtinere quan∣titas corporis quod Qualitas. Aug. Ep. 57. ad Dardan. The nature of a Soule is farre different from the nature of a Body. And againe the same holy Father, seeking to finde out some Similitude, whereby wholly to resemble the Existence of God in respect of place, in the end saith, that Quality hath a prerogative to make some Similitude hereof: and hee doth instance in Wisedome, which (saith hee) is as great in a little man as in a great man; but denyeth that Quan∣tity hath any such Priviledge, for speaking of Quantity and Magni∣tude, In all such Quantity, or magnitude (saith hee) there is lesse in the part, then there is in the whole. And by this same Maxime (con∣cerning whole in respect of Place) hee distinguisheth the God-head from the Man-hood, by which you haue confounded them. And yet againe else-where (as though hee thought this your delusion could never be sufficiently contradicted, or rather derided) hee will further have you not to be so Childish, as not to know, that Idem. Minor est unus digitus, quam tota manus, & minor est digitus unus quam duo; & alibi est iste digitus, alibi ille, alibi coetera manus—Nec solùm immobilibus corporis articulis—sed etiam aeris partes suos implent locos—Lucis{que} pars alia infun∣ditur per hanc fenestram, alia per aliam, & maior per maiorem, per minorem autem minor. Idem. To. 6. Ep. fundamenti. c. 16. The little finger is lesse than the whole hand, and one finger is lesse than two, and that one finger is one where, and the other another where. Vpon which where, and where, being notes of distinct places, we may aske, where are your Disputers now? Nay yet further∣more, passing from grosser Bodies, hee saith as much of Ayre, yea, and of the most subtil of subtils, the light of the Sunne; one part where∣of (saith hee) commeth in at one Window, another at another window, yet so, that the lesse passeth through the lesse, and the greater through the greater. Moreover, if Saint Gregory once Bishop of Rome had beleeved that Christ his Body is whole in every least indivisible part of the Hoast, he would never haue condemned the Eutychian Heretique for beleeving Adiungebat (Haereticus) omne illud, quod in Domino palpari potuit, post resurre∣ctionem in subtilitatem aliquam esse red actam. Greg. Exposi. Moral. li. 14. c. 31. The Body of Christ to have beene brought into such a subtilty, that is cannot be felt. But a greater subtilty there cannot be, than for a divisible Body to be enclosed in every the least indivisible point. Shew vs this Doctrine taught by any Catholike Doctor in
the Church within the compasse of the twelve hundred years after Christ, and then shall we conceive better of your Cause. And lest you may talke (as you vse) of one body penetrating another, wee say unto you, as Damascen said vnto his Reader, that Damascen. lib. 1. de Orthodox. fide. c. 4. . This is impossible, but that either the one or the other must be divided a∣sunder. That the Romish Obiections, against our former Tenet, are feeble and vaine. SECT. VII. IT is ordinarily in the mouthes of every one of you to obiect the Miraculous entrance of Christ into the house, the dores being shut; his comming out of the grave, when it was covered with a stone; his birth from his mother, her wombe being shut; besides the miraculous passing of a Camell through the Eye of a needle, spoken of by Christ; all Mi∣raculous indeed, as we, with many holy Chrysost. Nazi∣az. Aug. Ambros. Fathers, doe willingly Confesse. What therefore? Therefore (say you) the Body of Christ did passe through the substantiall dimensions of the Body of the Doores, Stone, and wombe, and consequently confuteth all this, which hath beene spoken of the Organicall proportions of a body, in respect of space, or place. So you. Wee grant unto you as much as these Fathers speake, in noting each of these to have beene the Acts, and workes of Omnipotencie, but yet without any penetration of Di∣mensions at all, or yet Alteration of the iust proportion of Christs body. Which penetration of Dimensions seemed to your Durand. Disp. 44. qu. 6. [Whom you ther∣fore reiect.] Teste Sua∣rez. Tom. 2. Disp. 48. qu. 54. Art. 4. §. 5. Durand as incredible, as unto us. The principall Testimony which is insisted upon, concerning the passing of Christ through the Doores, is the saying of Chryso∣stome, viz. . Chrysost. Hom. 87. in Iob. 21. [but accor∣ding to the Latine Edi∣tion. Hom. 86. super Ioh. 20. This testimony was obiected against P. Martyr in the Disp. at Oxon. fol 60.] Christ's Body was thinne, or small, changed from [,] that is, it's Thicknes, impalpable unto mortall mans hand, but onely by divine permission and dispensation. So hee. And this is alleadged for proofe of a Possibility of his now Corporall Presence in the Sacra∣ment, voyd of Palpabilitie: never considering the Ordinary and confessed Hyperbole's, wherewith Chrysostome embellisheth his Sermons; insomuch that we may oppose Chrysostome against Chry∣sostome, even in the point in question: who else-where speaking of this Sacrament, saith that Christ herein Booke 3. Chap. 4. Sect. 6. Giveth his Body both to be felt and seene; whereas every Priests hands and eyes can testifie the Contrary. For what? that Christ his Body, in passing through the Doore, should not alwayes have beene palpable in it selfe? The Fathers of the Generall Councell at Ephesus would have protested a∣gainst this; whose Resolution is, that Conc. Ephes. Tom. 5. C. 1. Anathem. 3. Non alienum est ab illo corpus, quod sibi u∣nivit, quod ubique palpabile, & aspecta∣bile existit. The Body which Christ united to his God head is palpable: but you will aske then, how could it passe through either Stones, or Doores, without penetration of Di∣mensions, or els by an extreame tenuity of the Body it selfe? Wee
answere, the divine power constrained the Stone and Doores to yeeld a passage, the Thicknes of his Body continuing the same. We have Ierome for the first part teaching. Hier. Creatura cessit Creatori. The Creature (saith hee) yeelded to the Creatour: and ancient Istin. quaest. & Resp. ad Orthodox. , &c. Iustine, for the second, say∣ing that The passage of Christ through the Doores was, by his Divine power, above nature, in his vnaltred Body; which Body consisteth of thick parts. Hee proceedeth, shewing how; even as was his walking upon the Water, by divine power working upon the water, with∣out any Alteration of his Body, more than was of the Body of Pe∣ter, who was enabled by the same power to tread the water. Each of which sayings of the Fathers, professing a Body of Christ palpable, whether Thinne with Chrysostome, or Thicke with Iustine, doe confute your Tridentine Faith in beleeving a Body of Christ whole in the whole, and whole in every least part of the Hoast, as unpalpable to man as you have said it is invisible to the Angels themselves: which is to bring it to such a Subtilty, as will draw you whether you will or no into a kindred with the Eutychian He∣retiques, who (as your Aquinas. par. 3. qu. 54. art. 2. Respon∣deo. Vide corpus Christi non habuisse partes corporis na∣turales, pertinet ad errorem Eutychij, qui dicebat corpus nostrum in illa resur∣rectionis gloria im∣palpabile, & ventis aëreque subtilius: Et quòd Dominus post confirmata cor∣da Discipulorum palpantium, omne illud, quod in to pal∣pari potuit, in ali∣quam subtilitatem redegit, ut Greg. ex∣ponit, Moral. lib. 14. cap. 31. Aquinas will have you know) held the Body of Christ to have beene as subtill as the ayre, and as the winde im∣palpable; as did also the Prateol. Elench. Haeret. Tit. Eunomi∣ani.—Dicebant corpus nostrum post Resurrectionem im∣palpabile esse & in∣visible; imò aere & vento subtilius: de qua haeresi Grego∣ius Eutychium con∣vincit. Eunomians, and were therefore condem∣ned by Pope Gregory surnamed the Great. Some more difficulty you suppose to be in the manner of Christ his Birth, whereunto when we answer, that Christ in his Birth o∣pened the wombe of his Mother, although without violation of her sacred vessell, wee are therefore presently branded by your Bellar. lde notis Eccles. cap. 9. Sander. de visib. Monarch. li. 7. pag. 321. Maldon. Ies. Com. in Luc. 2. 23. Dis∣puters with the blacke marke of the Heresie of those wicked Spi∣rits, who taught the Corruption of her Virginitie. Which obiecti∣on nothing but personall malice could make, or Impudency de∣fend, as the Obiecters themselves well knew, one of them con∣fessing, that divers Fathers in interpreting that Scripture, which is by the Evangelist applyed to the Virgin Mary, and Birth of Christ, viz. Every Male child that openeth the wombe shall be holy un∣to the Lord; did teach that Docueunt—solum Christum ape∣ruisse vulvam. Mald. in Luc 2.

So hee. A faire company of fellow Heretiques with Protestants, wee trowe: to whom the same Iesuite ioyneth divers Doctors of your Romish Church, whom he calleth Docti, & Catholici. Thus your owne spirit of Contradiction, whereas two words might have quit the Heresie, maintained the Miracle, and defended the Integritie of
that sanctified wombe of the Blessed Virgin, (to witt) that the Vir∣ginall cell might be said to open it selfe, which was shut in respect of other women (who necessarily suffer violent rupture by the birth) being preserued from all hurtfull violence, either from with∣in or from without; which could not be without a Miracle. Furthermore hearken to the answere of some other Doctors of your Church, and you shall finde your owne Doctrine to smell ranke of the Heresie of the Marcionites, in the opinion of the fore-cited ancient Fathers; for your fore-named Apud Maldon. Ies. in Luc. 2. Id Patres dixisse ardore abrep∣tos disputationis cō∣tra Marcionitas, ne Christum corporeum phantasma facere vi∣derentur, si dixissent matris uterum non aperuisse. Iesuite telleth you of some Doctors in your Church (whom hee himselfe approveth) who taught that The Fathers, who said that Christ did open the Matrix of his Mother, speake it in the heat of Dispute against the Hereti∣call Marcionites, who denyed that Christ had any true Body; because that els the said Fathers should seeme to make Christ his Body to be no better than an Incorporeall, and onely imaginary thing. So they. Which proveth, that in the iudgement of those Ancient Fathers, all your defence, in this Case, is at least Phantasticall. Let Isiodore Pelusiota his suffrage be added to the rest, who in an Epistle calm∣ly, and as it were in a coole blood, teacheth that Ibid. Pelusiot. lib. 1. Epist. 23. Aperire vulvam (Luc. 2.) non dicitur de quo∣vis primogenito [. Christ is the only he, who by his birth opened his Mothers wombe, and left it shut & sealed up againe. And maketh bold to tearme them vnlearned, that thinke the contrary: who living above a thousand yeares agoe, is therefore so much the more competent a witnes of the Catholike truth. As for the entrance of the Math. 19 24. Camell, (which is said of Christ) to passe through the eye of a needle: the subtilty of your Obiection is not so needle-sharpe, but that it may be easily blunted, for Christ spake by way of comparison, and implyed as well an Impossibility as a Possibility, Thus; as it is simply Impossible for a Camell (be it Rope, or be it Beast) to passe through the eye of a Needle, retaining the same dimension and property: so is it Impossible for a Rich-man, so long as he hath on him a great Bunch or grossnes of confidence in his riches, and wordly affections, to enter into the Kingdome of God. Although otherwise, as it is possible for God, by his miracu∣lous power so to contract the Camell, that it may passe through the Needles eye; so is it as possible by his omnipotent power of Grace to abate the swelling Bunch of worldly Confidence in the heart of the Rich-man, that hee, being truely mortified, may repose his whole trust in God himselfe, and at length enter into the King∣dome of Heaven. CHALLENGE. SHall not then the novelty of your Romish Article, which was not so much as beleeved of Romish Doctors of this last Age of Chri∣stianity? Shall not your Contradiction to your owne Romish Prin∣ciple? Shall not the expresse Testimony of S. Augustine, who as he was universally acknowledged to be a Catholike Father; so was he never condemned by any other Catholike Father for this his Doctrine concerning the Existence of Bodily Parts according to
proportionable dimensions of Space? Finally, shall not the affinity, which your opinion bath with damnable heresies, perswade you of the falsity of this your Romish Faith? CHAP. VIII. Of the fift Romish Contradiction against the words of Christ [MY BODY] as the same Body is now considered to be most perfect, by making it most Imperfect. SECT. I. NOne will thinke we need to impose any absurd Doctrine upon your Church; the Absurdities which we have al∣ready heard professed therein, under the testifications of your own Disputers, having beene so marvailously and palpably absurd, as hath beene shewen. Among which wee may reckon this, that followeth, as not the least prodigious Conse∣quence of your Romish Corporall Presence (to wit) That your Church of Rome alloweth a Doctrine, teaching a Body of Christ, now glorifyed, to be destitute of naturall and vo∣luntary motion of Sence, and of Vnderstanding. SECT. II. CAtholique Faith never conceived otherwise of the humane na∣ture of Christ, after the Resurrection, but that he was able na∣turally of himselfe, as hee was man, to performe the perfect Acts, which other men can, who are of right constitution of Body, and of sound understanding; such as are the functions of Iudgement, and reason, and of appetite, sence, & motion, according to the liberty of his own will. This Doctrine was above 1000. yeers Catholike. But your now Romane faith is to beleeve, as followeth in the conclusi∣ons set down by your Iesuite Suarez, Suarez. Ies. Di∣co secundò corpus Christi, ut est in hoc Sacramento, potest per se moveri loca∣liter à Deo: loquor de potentia Dei ab∣soluta. Nam iuxta legem statutam sup∣pono corpus Christi nunquam separari à speciebus, nec move∣ri nisi motis illis—ne{que} in hac conclusi∣one invenies Theologum ullum aperte contradicentem. In tertiam Tho. qu. 76 Art. 7. disp. 32. Conc. 2. & Conclu. 3. Corpus Christi ut est in hoc Sacramento non possit naturaliter moverilocaliter ab intrinseco à propria ani∣ma, & interna virtute motiua naturali, ne{que} per se, ne{que} per accidens. Loquor de naturali virtute, non ut est in∣strumentum verbi operans per virtutem miraculorum effectricem. Ratio, quia non potest anima movere corpus suum nisi per membra organica, quae habent extensionem in locum: Sed membra corporis Christi non hoc modo existunt in hoc Sacramento—multo minus potest movere species Sacramentaes, quas nec physic contegere possit, ne{que} ad motum voluntatis movere. Ibid. conclus. ult. Potest ut est in hoc Sacramento virtute extrinseca moveri per Accidens, quia possunt Sacramentales species moveri, vt a Sacerdote, Elevando. Sect. 3. De sensibus exterioribus nominales ciatidicunt posse Christum, ut est in hoc Sacramento, ut Deum audire, &c. Alij hoc negant. Sunt nonnulli, quinegant id fieri posse de Potentiâ Dei absolutâ, ut corpus in extensum à lo∣co aut seipsum videat, autalia. Dico, non potest natraliter exercere actus sensuum exteriorum; Ita tenet Thomas & alij Authores—quia sensus cius non potest recipere has species ab obiectis externis, quia hic actus est ma∣terialis, & extensus suânaturâ—Quamvis potentia absoluta potest—Idem dicendum de sensibus interi∣oribus & appetitu sentiente, quia nòn uti phanasmatibus, nec actum secundum elicere, quia hic actus est materialis, & nisi à materiali & extenso principio non potest intellectus eius, seclso miraculo,—ac∣quirere novas species, nec prius exquisitis uti, quia intellectus hoc non potest facere, nisi simul phantasia ope∣retur cum intellectu: non loquor de speciebus infusis. Haec Suarez in 3. Tho. qu. 76. Art. 7. disp. 53. §. 4. So also Ʋincentius Silliuitius Senens. Ies. Moral. quaest. To. 1. Tract 4. 5. nu. 1 39. & 141. Motus localis non convenit corpori per se, nec possunt actiones sensuum convenire Christo naturaliter, quia hae exercentur, per species in substan∣tia divisibili. At Christi corpus est in sacramento indivisibiliter, &c. without (as he saith) the contra∣diction
of any Divine in your Church. First, that Christ, as he is in this Sacrament, hath no power naturally of himselfe to move himselfe. And this your owne daily experience hath brought you vnto; whilst be∣leeuing Christs Corporall presence in the Hoast, you shut him vp in a Boxe, where you still find the same lying as destitute of power of motion, as any other unconsecrated Bread; which being put toge∣ther with it lyeth so long, untill they both equally waxe mouldy, putrifye, and ingender wormes. Secondly, that Christ in himselfe, as being in this Sacrament, hath no naturall faculty of sence, nor abili∣ty (without a miracle) to heare or see, &c. Thirdly, That he is voyd of all sensible appetite. Lastly, that (without some miraculous power) he cannot possibly apprehend in his vnderstanding any thing present, nor yet remember any notions past. So he. That this is a new, brutish, and barbarous Doctrine, destitute of all an∣cient Patronage either of written or of unwritten Tradition. SECT. III. HAve you any Text, yea or yet pretext either of Scripture, or humane Tradition for countenancing this so prodigious and monstrous a conception? Certainly Scripture telleth us, that Christ his Body by Resurrection is perfected in sense, and Agility; and his soule in Iudgement, and Capacity. Nor can you shew any Father in the Church of Christ within the Circumference of 1400. years af∣ter Christ, who held this your doctrine so much as in a Dreame▪ or who hath not esteemed the Body of Christ to be of the most abso∣lute perfection: we say no one Father, or Teacher of the Evangeli∣call Truth once fancied this unchristian, and false faith. You must therefore derive this from him, whom Christ calleth the Father of lies. VVe shall give you good reason for this our Declamation. That this Romish Doctrine is blasphemously Derogatory from the Maiesticall Body of Christ. SECT. IV. VVHat is this, which we have heard? Christ his humanity▪ after his Resurrection, not to have so much Capacity, as a Child? which is (as he is here) to vnderstand or imagine any thing done? not thè power of a Moale, or Mouse; which is to heare, or see? not the faculty of a little Aut, so as to move it selfe? as if this were not an Antichristian blasphemy against that all-Maiesticall Body, & humane nature of Christ: which being once 1. Cor. 15. 44. sowen in infirmity, is, (as the Scripture saith) since risen in power. Doe you heare? In power, saith the spirit of God, shewing that Infirmity is changed into Potencie, in the Body of every Christian: and you have turned power into infirmitie, even in Christ himselfe, whom you have now trans∣formed into an Psal. 116. Idoll having eyes, and seeth not, eares, and heareth not, feete, and walketh not, heart, and imagineth not: and yet this you professe to adore, as the person of the Sonne of God. O the strength of Satanicall Delusion!
That this Romish Doctrine contradicteth your owne Principle. SECT. V. REmember your See above Chap. 4. §. 10. former generall Principle, which wee ac∣knowledged to be sound and true, viz. All such Actions, and Qualities, which are reall in any Body without any relation to place, cannot be said to be multiplied in respect of divers places, wherein a Body is supposed to be. As for Example: The Body of Christ cannot be cold in one Altar, and hot in another, wounded, and whole, in ioy, and griefe, dead, and alive at the same time. The reason. These are im∣possible (say you) because of Contradiction: for, that the same thing should be capable of such contrarieties, it is repugnant to the under∣standing of man. So you; which is an infallible Truth, when the Modus, or Manner of a thing is compared to it selfe, and not to any thing else: it is necessary that at one and the same time the Modus be onely one, the same Iesuite cannot be sicke in Iapan, and sound and in health at Rome, in the same instant. CHALLENGE. NOw say (we beseech you) is there not the like Contradiction to make the same Christ at the same time, as hee is in Heaven, intelligent, and sensitive; and as on earth ignorant, and senslsse? Or powerfull to move of himselfe, on the throne of Maiestie; and absolutely Impotent, as hee is on the Altar? because these Attri∣butes, of Christ being Intelligent, and potent equally have no Rela∣tion to place. Notwithstanding all which you shame not to pro∣fesse a senslesse, ignorant, and feeble Christ. O come out of Babylon, and be no more be witched by such her Sorceries! CHAP. IX. The sixt kind of Romish Contradiction against these words of Christ [MY BODY] as it is now most Glorious, by making it most Inglorious. SECT. I. BEfore we proceed in discovering the ouglinesse of the Romish Doctrine in this point, wee are willing to heare your In his Booke of the Liturgie of the Masse Tract. 2. §. 4. Subd. 1. Master Brerely his preface in your defence: The carnall man (saith hee) is not for all this satisfied, but standeth still offended at sundry pretended absurd, and undecent indignities: Calvin saying, That he reiected them as unwor∣thy
of the Maiestie of Christ, And Doctor Willet saith: That they are unseemely, and against the dignity of the glorious and impassible Bo∣dy of Christ. So he, at once relating, and reiecting their opinions. That the Indignities, whereunto the Body of Christ is made subiect, by the Romish Doctrine, are most uile, and derogatory to the Maiestie of Christ. SECT. II. ALl Christian Creeds tell us, that Christ our Saviour sitteth at the right hand of God, that is, in perfection of glory. But your Iesuite Suarez delivereth it in the generall Doctrine of the Romish Divines; Suarez Ies. Dicē∣dum tamdiu conser∣vari Christum prae∣sentem sub specieb{us}, quamdiu species illae ibi ita permanent, ut sub ijs possit substan∣tia panis, & vini con∣servari.

VVee thirdly demand whether you thinke it possible for meate, that is undige∣sted by reason of mans infirmity, to descend raw through the Body into the Draught (which in other meates is knowne sometime to be certaine:) you falling into this speculation, tell us concerning the Egestion, that it is held A muribus comeditur, quia Denominationes, qua tantùm indicant motum localm per terminum ius, propriètribuuntur corpori Christi, à quocunque fiant, hu∣iusmodi est commestio. Suarez Tom. 3. qu. 76. Disp. 54. p. 706. Probable that the Body of Christ doth not passe with the formes into the Draught in that Case. So you: affirming this to be but onely Probable, whereas whosoever shall teach that the Body of Christ is not severed from the forme of Bread, so long as it is uncorrupt (which is your Si autem species illae transeant per stomachum indigestae, per aliquam infirmitatem, tunc sunt extia proprietatem refecti∣onis, etiamsi vadant in secssum, non est ibi corpus Domini. Et hanc opinionem Boetius dicit esse probabiem▪ Sia Angel. quosupra. generall Tenet) they
must hold that the same Body in the like case of mans bodily infir∣mity doth passe by Egestion in like sort into the seege. For if (as you do also say) the same Body of Christ hath beene once hidden in a See above in this Booke Chap. 1. Sect. 2. Dunghill, why may you not as wickedly beleeve, that it may passe into the Draught? That the Romish foresaid Indignities are contrary to holy Scriptures, and iudgement of Ancient Fathers. SECT. III. HOly Writ teacheth us, that there is as great difference be∣tweene the humiliation of Christ, when he was on earth, and his now Exaltation in glory, in Heauen, as there is betweene Shame, and Glory, it being now 1. Cor. 15. Philip. 2 8, 9. [] A Body of Glo∣ry. Now for you to believe and professe the personall burning, de∣vouring, regorging, yea and the hiding of that glorious Body of Christ in a dung hill, and the like, are such execrable speeches, as that we stand astonished with horrour to heare them, thinking that we have heard, in these, the scoffes, reproaches, and blasphemies of some Pagans against Christian Religion, rather than the opinion of any, that take to themselves one syllable of the name of Chri∣stians. If this had beene the ancient Faith, some Fathers doubtlesse upon some occasion, by some one sentence or other would have revealed their Iudgement therein: from whose diuerse and copi∣ous Volumes neither doe you alleage, nor we reade any one word of mans spewing up, or Mice eating, or so much as the winde blow∣ing away the Body of Christ; much lesse of the other basenesse spoken of. But contrariwise Origen. in Matth. 15. 27. Id quod mate∣riale est in ventrem abit, & in secessum sm eijcitur. Origen and Cyril. Hier. Catech. Mystag. 5. p. 542. Panis hic , &c. Chrysost. Hom. de Euch. in Lucam: Num vides panem? num vides vinum? sicut re∣qui cibi in secessum vadunt? absit, sic ne cogites [] Cyrill, distinguishing betweene the spirituall Bread, which is the Reall Body of Christ, and the Bread Sacramentall, say That not that Body, but this Bread goeth into the Draught. Which to affirme of Christs Body, were an Assertion abhominable. That the Romish Answeres, for defence of this their vile and beastly Opinion, are but false and fond. SECT. IV. IT was said of Philosophers of old that nothing was so absurd, but some one or other of them would take in hand to defend it: the like may be said of our Romish Opposites, whereof wee have given you divers Instances throughout this whole Treatise, as in the most particulars, so for the point now in Question. And al∣though
many of your Disputers have for modesties sake passed by it, yet have two among you (as it were putting on Vizards on their faces) come in with two fanaticall Card. Bellar. and Master Brerely in pla¦ces above-cited. Answeres. Both which are taken from the condition of Christ his humane Body, whilest he was in the world: Non nulli vix fer∣re possunt Christum quoque modo inclu∣di in parvâ pixide, cadere in terram, comburi, rodi à be∣stia—Annon' cre∣dunt Christum par∣vulum inclusum in angustissimo utero? cundem potuisse in via cadere, humi ja∣cuisse, & remoto mi∣raculo à bestia mor∣deri & comburi potu∣uisle? si ita pati potuit in propria specie, cur mirum videtur si illa sine laesione in specie aliena eidem accide∣re posse dicamus? Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. c. 10 §. Denique. Many (saith your Cardinall) can scarce endure to heare that Christ is included in a Boxe, fallen to the earth, burnt, or eaten of beasts: as though we doe not read, that Christ was in∣cluded in the wombe of the Virgin, lay upon the earth, and might with∣out any miracle have beene eaten of beasts, why may not such things now happen unto him, but [sine laesione] without any hurt at all? So he. Ioyne with this the Determination of your Aquinas. Etiamsi canis hostiam conse∣cratā manducet, sub∣stātia corporis Chri∣sti non desinit esse sub speciebus, part. 3. qu. 80. art. 3. Schoole; That the substance of Christ his Body remaineth still, although the Hoast be eaten with Dogs. But Master Brerely more cunningly, that he might not disguise your opinions, but also make Protestants odious, (if it might be) for their exceptions against them, doth readily tell us, that Pagans, Iewes, and Heretiques conceived Indignities against some mysteries of Christian Religion, as against Christ his Incarnation, and his Crucifying. So he. Both which Answeres are but meere tergi∣versations, by confounding the two most different conditions of Christ: That, then in the state of his humiliation, with This, which is Now in the highest exaltation of Glory. Wee therefore reioyne, as followeth. Your Disputers have so answered, as if Christ his Incarnation in the wombe of a Virgin, his Conversation upon earth, and his Pas∣sion upon the Crosse were not obiects of Indignity, notwithstanding the Spirit of God, hath blazed them to the world to have beene the Indignities of all Indignities, Thus: Phil. 2. 6. Who being in the forme of God, and thinking it no robbery to be equall with God, yet [] made himselfe of no reputation, but tooke upon him the forme of a ser∣vant (such was his Incarnation) and became obedient to death, even (spoken for aggravating the Indignity thereof) The [shamefull] death of the Crosse. Than which never any thing could make more either for the magnifying of Gods grace, and mercy, or for the dignifying of Christ his merit for man, as it is written Ioh. 3. 16. God so lo∣ved the world, that he sent his Sonne, (namely to suffer) that who∣soever should believe in him should not perish, but have life everla∣sting. How could your Answerers but know, that it was not the ob∣servation of the indignities, which Christ suffered, that wrought to the condemnation of Pagans, Iewes, and Heretikes: but their faith∣lessenesse in taking such scandall thereat, as to deprive themselves, by their Infidelitie, of all hope of life by Christ crucified. Hearken furthermore.
That the state of Christ his Humanity cannot be now obnoxious to bodily Indignities; and that the comparing both the Estates (in your answering) is unworthy the learning of very Catechumenists and Petties in Christian Religion. SECT. V. THis Disproportion betweene Christ his estate in the dayes of his flesh in this world, and his now present Condition at the right hand of God, is as extreamely disproportionable as is 1. Cor. 15. Mor∣tality, and Immortality, Shame and Glory, Misery and Blessednes, Earth and Heaven; that being his state of humiliation, and this contrariwise of his exaltation, as all Christians know, and professe. And although the Body of Christ now in eternall Maiesty be not obnoxious to Corporall iniuries, yet may Morall and Spirituall a∣basements be offered unto Christ, as well in the Opinion, as in the Practice of men. Of the opinion wee have an Example in the Ca∣pernaites concerning Christ, whensoever he should give his flesh to be eaten carnally: for the Practice you may set before you the Co∣rinthians, who abusing the Sacrament of the Lord did thereby contemne him, and were made guilty of high Prophanation a∣gainst the glorious Body of Christ. And what else soundeth that Relative iniury against Christ, by murthering his Saints on earth, complained off by his voice from Heaven; Act. 9. 4. Saul, Saul, why persecu∣test thou me? Your Cardinall, in answere to the Obiection of Indignity offe∣red to Christ, by putting him in a Boxe, and of being Eaten with Wormes, and the like; opposed (as you have heard) saying, Why may not such things now happen unto him but [sine laesione] that is, without any hurt? Wee answer that if hee should suffer nothing in his humanity passively to the Laesio corporis, that is, hurt of the Body; yet should there be thereby, in the opinion of men, laesio dignitatis, that is a lessening and obscuring of that his dignity, which is set forth in Scripture, and which our Article of faith, concerning his Bo∣dily sitting at the Right hand of God in Heaven, teacheth us to be in all Celestiall glory and Maiestie. This your Aquinas well saw, when in regard of Indignity he iudged it Nefas nunc esset Christum in propriâ specie in pixide in∣cludi putare. Aquin. part. 3. quest. 76. art. 8. An hainous wicked∣nesse for any to thinke Christ should be inclosed in a Boxe, appearing in his proper forme. And what greater difference can it be for a Body to be Boxed under another forme, more than when that one, and the same Person is imprisoned, whether open faced, or covered, whe∣ther in the day, or in the night, it mattereth not much, for still the same person is shut up in Prison? Againe, if that these Circumstan∣ces now spoken of were not Arguments of Indignity, why doe
your Iesuites, in a point of Opinion, deny that Christ's Body is Transubstantiated into the flesh of the Communicant, because of the See hereafter Book 5. Chap. 7. Sect. 1. Indignity against his Maiestie. Come we to the point of Practice. Let this be our lesson; when there is Reverence in the use of a thing, then there may be Irreve∣rence, and Indignity in the abuse thereof. But your Church hath provided that the Priests be shaven, and the Laicks abstaine from the Cup in a pretence of Reverence. The first, least some part of the Hoast (which you beleeve to be the body of Christ) should hang on the Priest's Beard; the second, least any whit of Christs Blood in the Cup should be split. But how much more indignity must it needs be to be devoured of Mice, Wormes, and sometimes (as your owne See above in this Booke Chap. 2. Sect. 2. stories have related) kept close in a Dunghill? One word more. If these seeme not sufficiently indigne, because there is not Laesio corporis; Hurt of the Body (this being your onely E∣vasion) what will you say of your framing a Christ unto your selves, who as he is in this Sacrament, Is (you say) without power of motion of sense, and of understanding? Why, my Masters, can there be Lamenesse, Blindnesse, Deafenesse, and Impotencie it selfe, without Hurt of the same partie so maymed? &c. This is worse than your dirty imagination of placing him in a Dunghill. THE GENERALL CHALLENGE. THese above specified Sixe Contradictions so plainly and plenti∣fully proved by such forceable Arguments as the light of Di∣vine Scripture hath authorized, the profession of Primitive Fa∣thers testified, Confessions of Romish Doctors acknowledged, and the Principles of your owne Romish learning in most points con∣firmed; your Abrenunciation of your so many Grosse Errours may be as necessary, as your persisting therein will be damnable. Before we can end, we are to consult with the Fathers of the Coun∣cell of Nice, especially seeing that aswell Romanists as Protestants will be knowne to appeale to that Councell.
CHAP. X. Of the Canon of the Councell of Nice, obiected for proofe of a Corporall Prescnce of Christ in the Eucharist. SECT. I. THis (as it is delivered by your Concilij verba. I∣terùm etiam hîc in divina mensa nè hu∣militer intenti simus ad propositum panē & calicem, sed attol∣lentes mentem fide intelligamus situm in sacra illa mensa agnū illum Dei tollentem peccata mundi in∣cruentè, [] à Sacerdotibus immo∣latum: & pretiosum eius corpus & sangui∣nem verè nos sumen∣tes, credamus haec esse nostrae resurrectionis symbola. Propter hoc enim neque mulcum accipimus, sed pa∣rum, ut sciamus, non ad satietatem, sed ad sanctificationem offerri, Vt resert Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 10. Cardinall, taken out, as he saith, of the Vatican Library) standeth thus: Let us not here in this divine Table be in humblenesse intent unto the Bread, and Cup which is set before us, but lifting up our minds let us understand by faith the Lambe of God set upon that Table: The Lambe of God, which taketh away the sinnes of the World, offered unbloodily of the Priest. And we receiving truly his Body and Blood, let us thinke these to be the Symbols of our Resurrection. For this Cause doe we receive not much, but little, that wee may understand this is not to satisfie, but to sancti∣fie. So the Canon. The Generall approbation of this Canon by Both sides. SECT. II. SCarce is there any one Romish Author, handling this Contro∣versie, who doth not fasten upon this Canon of Nice, for the countenancing of your Romish Masse. Contrarily Protestants (as they are set downe by our Hunc canonem Conc. Niceni proba∣tum fuisse Marpurgi Luthero, & alijs.—Martinus Bucerus di∣xit; Ità in Domino sentio: & in hac sen∣tentia opto venire ad Tribunal Dei. Ma∣nu meâ scripsi. Teste Hier. Zanchio Miscell. de Coena Domini, pag. 152. He himselfe assenting unto the same. Zanchy, and your Hoc testimonium Niceni Conc. primi in actis eiusdem Conc. in Vaticana Bibliotheca his verbis, &c. Hoc testimonium agnoscunt etiam Adversarij, ut Occolampadius, Calvin. Instit. l. 4. c. 17. §. 36. Petrus Boquinus, Klebitius: & nituntur hoc testimonio ad gra∣vissimam suam haeresin stabiliendam, &c. Bellar. ibid. Bellarmine) in great numbers (among whom are Luther and Calvin) with ioynt consent approve of this Canon; one of them (Bucer by name) sub∣scribing unto it with his owne hand, in these words: So I thinke in the Lord, and I wish to appeare in this minde before the Tribunall Seat of God. So they. The right Explication of this Canon will be worthy our paines.
The state of the Difference, concerning this Canon. SECT. III. THis (as is propounded by your Cardinall) standeth thus. Per Agnum om∣nes intelligunt Chri∣stum, ut distinguitur contra symbola. Bel∣lar quo supra.—Illi (Protestantes) quasi admoneant, nè quae∣rendum Christum in Altati lapideo. Sed mente conscendam{us} ad coelum, in coelo si∣tum Agnum.—At vult Concilium, ut ad sacram ipsam mé∣sam attendamus: sed in ipsa non tàm Sym∣bola, quàm quae sub illis latent conside∣remus. Ibidem per tó∣tum. All (saith he) by the Lambe understand Christ as he is di∣stinguished from the Symbols and Signes upon the Altar. Next. But the Protestants thinke (saith he) that the Councell admonisheth not to seeke Christ on the Altar, but to ascend up unto him in Heaven by faith, as sitting at the right hand of God. But we all say (saith he) that the Councell would have us to attend unto the holy Table (meaning the Altar below) yet so, that we see in it not so much the outward Sym∣bols, and Signes, as that which lyeth hid under them, viz. The Body and Blood of Christ. So hee. The difference then betweene him and us is no lesse than the distance betweene Aloft and Vnder, that is, betweene Heaven above, and Earth below. Let us set forward in our progresse, but with easie, and even paces; to the end you may better understand the strength of our Proofes, and rottennesse of your Obiections. That the Nicene Councell is marvellously preiudiciall to your Romish Defence: proved by five Observations; Three here. SECT. IV. FIve points are chiefly observable in this Canon. First is the no∣mination of Bread. Secondly, the mention of two Tables. Thirdly, the admonition to lift up our minds. Fourthly, the ex∣pression of the Reason thereof. Fiftly, the Confirmation of the same Reason. First, That, which the Councell would that men be not too in∣tent unto, they call Bread after Consecration; for the Errour, which they would have avoyded, was either the too much abasing of this Sacrament (according to your Cardinals Iubet Concilium ut non inhaereamus speciebus panis & vi∣ni; quasi ibi nihil sit, nisi quod oculi renū∣tiant. Bellar. quo su∣pra. Glosse) and then was it after Consecration, because they needed not to have perswaded any to have too meane an estimation of the Bread unconsecrated; which you your selves hold to be a common and prophane thing: or else the Errour must have beene (as indeed it was) too high a valuation of the outward Element of Bread, which must needs be so, because it was consecrated, and notwithstanding it being so consecrated, in the Canon it is called Bread. which your Fathers of the Councell of Trent would not have endured, especially seeing that we find that your Nic. Cabasila. La∣tini dicunt eos, qui panem & vinum no∣minant, & tanquàm nondùm sanctificatis precantur sanctifica∣tionem post illa ver∣ba [Hoc est corpus meum] rem superva∣cuam facere. Expos. Liturg. cap. 29. Latine Church was offended with the late Greeke Church, for calling the parts of the Eucharist by the termes
of Bread and Wine after the pronunciation of these words [This is my Body,] by you called the words of Consecration. Besides they so call them Bread and Wine, as they name them Symbols and Signes, which properly they could not be, untill after Conse∣cration. Secondly, the , &c.—. Conc. Nicen. Canon expresly noteth and distinguisheth two Tables, in respect of place; the one, as Here; being as much as to say, This Table: and the other opposed hereunto is instiled, That Table. And, of this Table Here, the Councell forbiddeth Chri∣stians to looke Too attentively to the thing set before us: But con∣trarily, concerning That other Table, they command men to Lift up their minds aloft. And not thus onely, but they also distinguish them in respect of their different Obiects. The Obiect of the First Table, Here, they name Bread, and the Cup; the obiects of sense: And the other obiect, opposed to this, is that on the other Table, expressed to be the Lambe of God, the obiect of our mindes. Thirdly, the Admonition or Caution, which the Councell giveth concerning the Bread, is, not to be too intent to it: but touching the Lambe of Christ, they command us to lift up our mindes aloft; for so the word . [] doth signifie, not to be used (we thinke) for an inward looking into the sublimity of the mystery of the mat∣ter before us, as your Cardinall fancieth: but for looking vp aloft unto the Lambe of God in Heaven, according to the Catholike fence of those words, See hereafter Book 7. Chap. 4. Sect. 7. SVRSVM CORDA! The next two proofes out of the same Canon of Nice, to mani∣fest our Protestant profession touching the questi∣on in hand. OVr next two proofes out of the Canon are these. First is their Reason of the former Caution: the Second, the Confirmati∣on of that Reason: both are expresly set downe in the Canon it selfe. Why then did those holy Fathers admonish us not to be too intent to the Bread and Wine set before us? It followeth; Because they are not ordained to satisfie our naturall man, namely, by a full eating and Drinking: but for a Sacramentall participation of the Body, and Blood of Christ, to the sanctifying of our soules: whereas your Church doth attribute to that, which you eate in this Sacra∣ment, a power of sanctifying the Body by it's Bodily touch. But much more will the next proofe vndermine your defence. To confirme their Reason, why the Sacrament was not ordai∣ned for the satisfying of the naturall man, they adde saying; For this cause we receive not much, but little: which one Clause most e∣vidently proveth it to be spoken of Bread and Wine; and not of the Body, and Blood of Christ. As your generall Romane Catechisme (if you have not already learned it) will now teach you to beleeve, saying that Catechis. Rom. Christum Dominum esse in hoc Sacramē∣to non dicimus, ut parvus aut magnus est, sed ut substantia est. Tract. de Euch. num. 36. Christ is not great or small in this Sacrament. And in∣deed
none ever said of the Eucharist, that he eat a little of Christ's Body, or a little Christ, but yet the Sacrament eaten is sometimes more, sometime lesse. Nor this onely, but the Canon furthermore speaketh of taking a little of that, whereof if much were taken (saith it) it might satiate the naturall man. So the Canon. But that the outward Sacrament can truly satisfie the naturall man, you your selves will testifie in your Booke-Cases and Missals, See the fift Booke Chap. 6. Sect. 1. & 2. acknowled∣ging men Drunke with the Sacrament, even unto vomiting with the one part thereof; and also making mention of Men, and Mice be∣ing fed and nourished with the other. So then the naturall man may be satiated with this Sacrament; but with what therein? The Body and Blood of Christ? you abhorre to thinke that; with Acci∣dents? You may be ashamed to affirme it, as from the Iudgement of Antiquity, seeing you were never able hitherto iustly to produce one Father for proofe of the Existence of Accidents without their Subiects: or of nourishing a substance by meere Accidents. Where∣fore untill you can prove some one of all these, give us leave to be∣leeve, that all were of the mind of that one Gregor. Nyssen. Quomodò enim res incorporea corpori cibus fiat? In Orat. de vita Mosis, p. 509. Father, who held it Impossible for an Incorporeall, or not-bodily thing to be food to a bodily substance. And so much the rather, because the Fathers have manifoldly See above Booke 3. Ch. 3. Sect. 7. & 10. &c. acknowledged in this Sacrament, after Consecration, the substance of Bread. Wherefore the Reasoning of the Councell, touching the Eucharist, was like as if one should say of Baptisme; We take not too much, but little, lest it might be thought to have beene ordained not for a Sacramentall meanes of sanctifying the Soule, but for the clensing of the Flesh. None is so stupid as not to understand, by Much and Little, the substance of water. And if you shall need a further Explication of the same sentence of the Fathers of Nice, you may fetch it from the Fathers in ano∣ther Councell held at Toledo in Spaine, Anno 693. who shew this Reason, why they Conc. Tolet. 16. Anno 693. Can. 6. In∣tegrum panem esse sumendum—nequo grande allquid, sed modica tantum obla∣to, secundùm id quod Ecclesiastica consue∣tudo retentat: cuius reliquiae aut ad con∣servandum modico loculo absque aliqua iniuria Sacrificijs cō∣secretur; aut si sum en∣dum fuerit necessa∣rium, non ventrem illius, qui sumpserit, gravis sarciminis o∣nere premat, nec quid indigesticè va∣dat, sed animum ali∣moniâ spirituali refi∣ciat. Take little portions of the Hoast (namely, say they) least otherwise the belly of him that taketh this Sacrament may be stuffed, and over-charged; and least it may passe into the Draught, but that it may be nourishment for the soule. Hereby plain∣ly teaching, concerning the consecrated matter, that were it so much as could burthen the belly, it would through the superflui∣tie thereof goe into the Draught: whereas, if Lesse, it would serve as well, or better for a Sacramentall use, to the replenishing of our soules in the spiritually receiving of the Body of Christ. But you are not so farre bereft of your wits as to imagine that Much, which stuffeth, and after passeth into the Draught, to be Christ's Bodie; and you may sweare that the Fathers meant not meere See above Booke 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 10. Accidents. For mere Accidents have not the property of Substance, through the Muchnesse thereof, either to satiate the naturall appetite, in feeding, or to over-charge the Belly by weight, in pressing it downe to the Draught. Never did any Father father such an Imagination. What can be, if this be not true reasoning, and consequently a full confu∣ration
of your Romane Faith. Therefore this one Canon of Nice being thus undoubtedly gained, concerning the not seeking Christ, Here, on this Table, is sufficient of it selfe to batter downe your As∣sertion by a five-fold force. First, by proofe of no Transubstan∣tiation of Bread; Secondly, no Corporall Presence of Christ's Bodie; Thirdly, no Corporall Coniunction with the Bodies of the Commu∣nicants; and (consequently) Fourthly, no proper Sacrifice thereof; And lastly, no Divine Adoration due unto it. Therefore ought you to bid all these your Romish Doctrines and Delusions avant. Your Obiections, from the former Canon, answered. SECT. V. FIrst you Ob. 1. Cum di∣cit agnum Dei sicum esse in sacra mensa, & eundem agnum opponit symbolis, de∣clarat agnū propriè esse in mensa: & non solùm ut per symbola repraesentatur. 2. Ag∣nus dicitur à Sacer∣dotum manibus im∣molari, quod non fit in coelo: neque enim tàm lōgas manus ha∣bent Sacerdotes, ut ad coelum pertingant 3. Dicimur verè su∣mere corpus Christi, & quòd non solùm corde sed & corpore sumitur, prebatur: quià corp{us} & sanguis Domini dicuntur es∣se nostrae resurrectio∣nis symbola, quià cùm nostris corporib{us} cō∣iunguntur. Si autem sola esset animorum coniunctio, solus ani∣mus resurrecturus sig∣nificaretur. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. c. 10. Obiect, that The Lambe is said to be placed on the Table, mistaking what Table is meant; for the Canon specifying two Tables, one Here, which is of the Eucharist, and another That Table, namely in Heaven, saith that Christ is placed on That Table, according to our Faith of his sitting at the right hand of God in Heaven. Secondly, hee is said (say you) to be sacrificed by the hands of the Priest; which cannot be done, as hee is in Heaven. The words of the Canon, truly resolved, doe cashiere this Obie∣ction, as thus: The Lambe of God set at that Table (namely in Hea∣ven) is sacrificed by the hands of the Priest Here, to wit, on the Table below (representatively) as hereafter the Catholique Fathers themselves will shew. And these two may easily consist, without any necessity of the Priest reaching his hands as farre as the high∣est Heavens; as your Cardinall pleasantly obiecteth. Thirdly, you alleage; Wee are said to partake truly of the Body of Christ. As though there were not a Truth in a Sacramentall, that is Figu∣rative Receiving; and more especially (which See above Chap. 1. Sect. 2. hath beene both proved, and confessed) a Reall, and true participation of Christ's Body and Blood spiritually, without any Corporall Coniunction. But it is added (saith he) that These (namely, the Body and Blood of Christ) are Symbols of our Resurrection; which is by reason that our Bodies are ioyned with the Body of Christ: otherwise if our Coniunction were onely of our soules, onely the Resurrection of our soules should be signified thereby. So hee, that's to say, as successesly as in the former. For the word, HAEC, These, (which are called Symbols of our Re∣surrection) may be referred either to the Body and Blood of Christ, immediatly spoken of, and placed on the Table in Heaven (which we Commemorate also in the Celebration of this Sacrament) and in that respect may be called Symbols of the Resurrection of our Bodies: because, 1. Cor. 1. 15. If Christ be risen, then must they that are Christs also rise againe. Or else the word, These, may have relation to the
more remote (after the manner of the Greekes) to wit, Bread and Cup on the first Table, because (as immediately followeth) they are these whereof not much, but little is taken; as you have heard. Which other See below Booke 5. Chap. 8. Sect. 6. Fathers will shew to be indeed Symbols of our Resurrection, without any Consequence of Christ's Bodily Coniun∣ction with our Bodies, more than there is by the Sacrament of Bap∣tisme, which they call the Earnest of our Resurrection; as doth also your Iesuite Ad futuram re∣surrectionē, per Bap∣tismi Sacramentum, ius & pignus accepi∣mus. Coster. Institut. Christ. l. 4. c. 4 See more in the Booke following. Chap. 8. Sect. 6. Coster call it The Pledge of our Resurrection. (But this our Coniunction with Christ is the subiect matter of the Fift Booke.) Lastly, how the Eucharist was called of the Fathers a Sacrifice, is plentifully resol∣ved in Chap. 5. Sect. the Sixt Booke.
THE FIFTH BOOKE, Treating of the third Romish Doctrinall Consequence, arising from your depraved Sence of the Words of Christs Institu∣tion [THIS IS MY BODY:] concerning the manner of the present Vnion of his Body with the bodies of the Receivers, by Eating, &c. CHAP. I. The state of the Question. SECT. I. A Christian man consisting of two men, the Outward, or bodily; and the Inward, which is, Spirituall; this Sacrament, accordingly, con∣sisteth of two parts, Earthly and Heavenly: as Irenaeus spake of the bo∣dily Elements of Bread and Wine, as the visible Signes and Obiects of Sense; and of the Body and Blood of Christ, which is the Spirituall part. Answerable to both these is the dou∣ble nourishment and Vnion of a Christian; the one Sacramentall, by communicating of the outward Elements of Bread and Wine, united to man's body, in his Taking, Eating, digesting, till at length it be transubstantiated into him, by being substantially incorpora∣ted in his flesh. The other, which is the Spirituall, and Soules food, is the Body and Blood of the Lord (therefore called Spiritu∣all, because it is the Obiect of Faith) by an Vnion wrought by God's Spirit, and man's faith; which (as hath beene professed by Protestants) is most Reall and Ineffable. But your Church of Rome teacheth such a Reall Vnion of Christ
his Body and Blood with the Bodies of the Communicants, as is Cor∣porall; which you call [Per contactum] by Bodily touch, so long as the formes of Bread and Wine remaine uncorrupt in the bodies of the Receivers. Our Method requireth that we first manifest our Protestant De∣fence of Vnion to be an Orthodoxe truth. Secondly, to impugne your Romish Vnion, as Capernaiticall (that is) Hereticall. And thirdly, to determine the Point, by comparing them both toge∣ther. Our Orthodoxe Truth will be found in the Preparations following. That Protestants prosesse not only a Figurative and Sacramentall Participation and Communion with Christ's Body; but also a spiritually-Reall. SECT. II. ALl the Bookes of the Adversaries to Protestants are most e∣specially vehement, violent, and virulent in traducing them in the name of Sacramentaries, as though we professed no other man∣ner of feeding and Vnion with Christ's body than only Sacramen∣tall, and Figurative. For Confutation of which Calumny it will be most requisite to oppose the Apologie of Calvin. in hijs li∣bris, vz. Consensio in re Sacramentaria: & Defensio cōtra West∣phalium: & Explica∣tio de vera partici∣patione coenae Dom.

If you shall aske Calvin what he liked not, he will answere you, Fateor me ab∣horrere ab hoc crasso cōmento localis prae∣sentiae. Substantiā Christi animae nostrae pascuntur: sed secun∣dum virtutem, non secundùm substan∣tiam. I doe abhorre your grosse Doctrine of Corporall Presence. And Signum tantùm porrigi, centies con∣trà.

Our Ca∣techisme teacheth (saith hee) not only a signification of the Benefits of Christ to be had herein, but also a participation of the substance of Christ's flesh in our soules. And with Swinckfeldius, maintayning only a Figurative perception, we have nothing to doe. If you fur∣ther demand what is the Feeding, whereby we are united to Christ's body, in this Sacrament? hee tels you that it is (IV.) Not carnall, but Spirituall, and Reall; and so Reall, that the soule is as truly re∣plenished with the lively virtue of his flesh, by the powerfull worke of the Spirit of God; as the body is nourished with the corporall Element of Bread in this Sacrament. If you exact an Expression of this spi∣rituall Vnion, to know the manner, hee acknowledgeth it to be Ergò in coena miraculum agnoscimus, quod & naturae sines, & sensus nostri modum exsuperat: quòd Christi caro nobis fit communis, & nobis in alimentum datur.—Modus incomprehensibilis. above Reason.

That the Body of Christ, by this Sacrament, was ordai∣ned only for food to the Christian man's Soule. SECT. III.

To wit, that Bread
and Wine being the most vitall nourishments, for the conservation of man's bodily essence, are therefore chosen (as the Fathers teach) to represent and exhibit unto him (although, in themselves, but Signes and Symbols) the very Body and Blood of Christ. Therefore the Body and Blood of Christ are our Reall nourishments in this Sa∣crament. And such as is our food, such must be our Vnion, by feeding there∣on; which wee say is by Faith, in this Sacrament: and you may not gain-say it, who, to comfort your Disciples, are Alanus, & alij ex citatis Authori∣bus dicunt, quandò re-ipsà non potest suscipi hoc Sacra∣mentum, ad perfici∣endam hanc unio∣nem, sufficere quòd hoc Sacramentum in voto suscipiatur, quià hoc satis est, ut ho∣mo fiat membrum Christi vivum, & uni∣atur illi.

Sa∣cerd. l. 2. c. 29. taught to in∣struct them, that even without this Sacrament the spirituall Vnion may be presented to the soule of man, with the Body of Christ; and that as a sufficient meanes of uniting him to Christ, by a spiri∣tuall manner of Eating. And this (you say) is To receive Christ his Body truly; albeit this be to receive him only by faith and desire. So you. Whence you perceive our Inference, viz. If our spirituall Vnion with Christ his Body may be really and truly made by Faith, and Desire, without this Sacrament: then, in our Sacramentall eating thereof, may the Communicant be much more made par∣taker thereof by Faith and ardent Desire; the Sacrament it selfe being a Seale of this our Christian Faith. CHAP. II. That only the Godly faithfull Communicants are Parta∣kers of the Bodie and Blood of Christ; and there∣by united to Christ, in the iudgement of Protestants. SECT. I. OVr Church of England in her 28. and 29. Article saith thus: The Body of Christ is given to be eaten in this Sacrament only after a spirituall manner, even by faith: wherein the wicked, and such as are void of faith, eate it not; although they doe visibly presse with their teeth the Sacraments of the Body and Blood of Christ, yet are they in no wise Partakers thereof. But your Romish Church flatly otherwise, as you all know; and therefore hath your Sympresbyter Master M. Brerely Tract. 2. Sect. 5. Sub. 2. Brereley endevoured to assume some Protestants to be on your side, whom he hath alleaged with like faithfulnesse, as he hath ci∣ted Master Calvin: then whom he could not have, in this case, a greater Adversary. For although Calvin grant, with all Protestants,
that the wicked and faithlesse receive truly, by way of Sacrament, the Body of Christ; yet doth he deny that they have in their bo∣dies any Corporall coniunction or Vnion with Christ, because the Vnion, which we have (Calvin. Epist. 372. et in the same Epistle he saith of Papists, Dā∣nantur, qui dicunt Iudā non minùs cor∣poris Christi partici∣pem fuisse, quàm Pe∣trum. In his Institut. lib. 4. c. 17. Non alia quàm fidei manduca∣tio. §. 8. Cordis sinum tantùm protendant, quo praesentem am∣plexentur. §. 12. Vin∣culum coniunctionis est Spiritus Chri∣sti. §. 13. Non carna∣lis. §. 16.

Saepiùs, fateor, occurrit ápud Au∣gustinum istaloquendi forma, Comedi corpus Christi ab infidelibus, sed seipsum explicat, &c. Haec Calvinus. saith he) is Only spirituall; only with the soule; onely with the heart; onely by faith: and although it be offe∣red to the wicked, to be really received, yet doe they not receive it, because they are Carnall. Their onely Receiving therefore is but Sa∣cramentall. So Mr. Calvin. It had beene good that your Priest had suspected his Iudge∣ment, and (as well in this Case, as in others) by doubting his owne eye-sight had borrowed your Sextum eorum Pronunciatum est, Improbos non suscipere corpus Christi, licet symbola suscipiant. Calvin. Instit. l. 4. c. 17. §. 33. & Beza. Teste. Bellar. lib. 1. de Euch. c. 1 §. Porrò. Cardinall his Spectacles: then would hee have clearly perceived that (together with other Pro∣testants) Calvin held that The wicked, although they receive the Symbols and outward Signes of Christ's body, yet the body it selfe they doe not receive. So your Cardinall, of the Doctrine of Protestants. For although, indeed, Calvin said that The wicked eate the Body of Christ: yet, explaining himselfe, he added these two words [In Sa∣cramento, that is, Sacramentally;] which in Calvins stile is alwayes taken for Symbolically only. As for the consent of Protestants here∣in, we put it to your great Cardinall and Champion, their greatest Adversary, to expresse. Ex Vbiquitistarum opinione sequitur corpus Christi non posse verèmanducari ore corporali, sed solum ore spirituali per fidem: est ipsissima sententia Sacrmentariorum. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch c. 17. §. Secundo ex. He ioyneth Lutherans to the Calvinists in one consent, for denying the Orall and Corporall Eating thereof; and for believing the Eating of it to be Only by Faith. Yet left any may say, that in receiving the same Sacrament he doth not receive the thing signified thereby; you may haue a Similitude to illustrate your iudgments, as thus: The same outward word, concerning Iustification by Christ, commeth to the eares of both Vnbelee∣vers and Beleevers. But the Beleevers only are capable of Iustifi∣cation. That only the Godly-faithfull are Partakers of the Body and Blood of Christ, and thereby Vnited unto him; in the iudgement of Ancient Fathers. SECT. II. CHrist, speaking of that which is the most Reall Eating, saith Ioh. 6. [He that eateth me remaineth in me, and shall live for ever.] Vpon which Text Saint Hierome concludeth; Hieron. in Ma∣lach. 1. Immundi mū∣dissimum sanguinem bibunt. [But only Sa∣cramentally, for it go∣eth beore in the same place;] Quando Sacramenta violantur, is, cuius sunt Sacramenta, violatur. But Hier. in E∣sa. 66. Omnes magis amatores voluptatis, quàm amatores Dei; dum non sūat sancti corpore & spiritu: nec com∣dunt carnem Christi, nec bibunt eius sanguinem. The men
that live in pleasure neither eate the flesh of Christ, nor drinke his Blood. Next, Origen inferreth that Orig. in Matth. 15. Verbum, caro fa∣tum, verus cib{us}, quē qui comedit vive i aeternùm: quem nul∣lus malus potest ede∣re.—alioqui nequa∣quam▪ scriptum uis∣set, [Quisquis ederit, vivet in aeternum.] No wicked man can eat Christ his flesh. And Saint Augustine most peremptorily; Aug. Tract. 59. in Ioh. Illi manducabāt panem Dominum, Iudas autem panem Domin. [Responde Bellar. lib. 1. de Euch. c. 13. Iudas non utilitèr edebat, sicut qui pa∣nem comedit, reijci rursùs, dicitur non comedere. [But it is plaine, that Saint Au∣gustine distinguisheth Signum à signato, and saith; Iudas did not eat Panem Dominum.] Et Tract. 26. being cō∣stant to himselfe upon these words; [Qui mā∣ducat carnem meam, in me manet:] Qui non manet in Chri∣sto proculdubiò non māducat spiritualem carnem eius nec bi∣bit eius sanguinem, licet carnalitèr & vi∣sibilitèr premat den∣tibus Sacramentum tantae rei, & iudiium sibi manducet. To the same purpose Cyril. Alex. lib. 10. in Ioh. c. 13. Sola membra Christi comedunt carnem Christi. Without doubt (saith he) they doe not spiritually eate the flesh of Christ, nor drinke his blood, although that they doe visibly and carnally presse the Sacra∣ment thereof with their teeth, and notwithstanding eate their con∣demnation. So he, thereby distinguishing the inward soules Eating Spirituall from the outward and Sacramentall Eating; as he doth man's Spirit from his Teeth. In which respect he as verily denied that Indas ate his Lord the bread, as hee affirmed him to have eaten The bread of the Lord. Therefore the Bread Sacramentall was not the Bread the Lord. Idem Cyril. Alex. lib. 4. in Ioh. (Citante Sudrez. Tom. 3. qu 79. Disp. 64. Sect. 3.) Sicuti enim si quis liquefactae cerae aliam ceram infuderit, aleram cum altera per totum commisceat necesse est: ità si quis carnem & sangui∣m Domini recipit, cùm ipso ità coniungitur, ut Christus in eo & ipse in Christo inveniatur. Cyrill Bishop of Alexandria teacheth, that whosoever doth truly receive the body of Christ, Is in Christ, and Christ in him; both so ioyned, one with the other, as waxe melted with waxe is united together. All these so evident Testimonies of so ancient Fathers doe in∣ferre this Conclusio against you, that none doe really eate the Bo∣dy of Christ, who receive him but only Sacramentally. And See hereafter, Chap. 8. Sect. 4. after∣wards other Fathers will be found to ioyne their Consent hereun∣to: where they teach that none eate his flesh, with whom Christ hath not a perpetuall vnion. Now, for you to answere, that their meaning is not that the ungodly eate it not really, but that they eate it unworthily, and therefore unprofitably for their salvation; is but recoyling and giving backe, when you want a shield for your defence. For the Testimonies alleaged, which deny that the faith∣lesse and godlesse men Eate Christ's Body, speake directly of the Act of spirituall Eating, and not only of the Effect, as you fancie; Peruse you their Testimonies, and be you our Iudges. That by Spirituall Eating your Romish Corporall Vnion (through Sacramentall Eating) is excluded. SECT. III. SAcramentall Eating and Vnion professed by your Church is (as you may remember) said to be Corporall, by Christ's bodily Touch of the body of the Receiver: but seeing the godly and faithfull man only can be partaker of the body and blood of Christ, and be really united unto it (as the Fathers have declared) what could these holy Fathers have thought of your Barbarous or ra∣ther
Brutish faith, that teacheth such a Corporall Vnion, by a bo∣dily Touch and Eating, whereby (according to your owne Do∣ctrine) Rats, Wormes, and Dogges, and whatsoever vile beast may be as reall partakers of the bodie of Christ, as Peter, or Iohn, or whosoever the essentiall member of Christ? Wherefore you must suffer us to reason aswell against your Corporall Coniunction, by bodily Touch, as Haec sententia sc▪ de vnione Corpo∣rali) multis Theolo∣gis visa est improba∣bilis,—quòd non propter corporalem coniunctionem, sed propter spiritualem, institutum est, dicen∣te Christo, [Verba measunt vita.] Sua∣rez Ies. Tom. 3. Disp. 64. Sect. 3. p. 822. Many of your Divines have done against bodi∣ly Vnion, by coniunction and commixture: but why? even Because the Sacrament was not ordained for a bodily, but for a spirituall Con∣iunction. So they. So that wee need say no more, but (fore-seeing what you will obiect) we adde the Propositions following. CHAP. III. That wicked Communicants, albeit they eate not bodily Christ's Bodie, yet are they Guilty of the Lords Bodie, for not receiving it spiritually (name∣ly) thorow their Contempt, for not receiving the Blessing offe∣red thereby. SECT. I. THe Apostle, 1. Cor. 11. 27. Whosoever (saith hee) Ea∣teth this Bread, and Drinketh this Cup unworthily, he shall be guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord And (Vers. 29.) eateth and drinketh Damnation to him∣selfe, not discerning the Lord's Bodie. Your Rhemish Professors (men not the least zealous for your Romish Cause) obiecting this against the Protestants, call upon you saying first, Rhemists Annot. in. . Cor. 11. vers. 27. Hereupon marke well, that ill men receive the Body and Blood of Christ, be they Infidels, or ill livers, for else they could not be guilty of that which they receive not. Secondly, That it could not be so hainous an offence for any to receive a piece of bread, or a cup of wine, though they were a true Sacrament; for it is a deadly sinne for any to receive any Sacrament with will and intention to con∣tinue in sinne, or without repentance of former sinnes; but yet by the unworthy receiving of no other Sacrament is man made guilty of Christ's Bodie and Blood, but here, where the unworthy Receiver (as Saint Chrysost. Hom. 60. & 61. adpop. Antioc. Chrysostome saith) doth villany to Christ's owne person, as the Iewes and Gentiles did, that crucified him. Which invincibly proveth against the Heretikes, that Christ is herein really present. And guilty is he, for not discerning the Lord's Body, that is, because hee putteth
no difference betweene this high meate and others. So your Rhe∣mists. Your Cardinall also, as though he had found herein something for his purpose, Bellar. Obijcit Cyprian. Serm. de Lapsis, de ijs qui post negatum Christum, sinè poenitentia, ac∣cedunt; plus eosiam manibus at{que} orc de∣linquere, quàm cùm Dominū negârunt. Deinde Cyprianum recensere miracula facta in vindictam e∣orum, qui corpus Christi tantùm vio∣lant. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 9. [See this answered in the 7. Section following.] fastneth upon the sentence of Cyprian, who accoun∣ted them, that after their deniall of Christ presented themselves to this Communion, without repentance, to offer more iniurie to Christ, by their polluted handes and mouthes, than they did in denying Christ: and besides he recordeth Examples of God's miraculous vengeance upon those, who violated the body of Christ in this Sacrament. So hee. All these points are reducible unto three heads. One is, that ill men might not be held guiltie of the Body of Christ, except they did re∣ceive it, as being materially present in this Sacrament. Next is the Guilt of prophaning this Sacrament, which being more hai∣nous than the abuse of any other Sacrament, therefore the iniury is to be iudged more personall. The last, that the Examples of God's vindicative Iudgements, for Contempt hereof, have beene more extraordinary: which may seeme to be a Confirmation of both the former. Before we handle these points in order, take our next Position for a Directory to that, which shall be answered in the VI. Section. That some Fathers understood the Apostles words 1. Cor. 10. spiri∣tually, (namely) as signifying the Eating of Christ's Flesh, and drinking his Blood; both in the Old Testament and in the Newe. SECT. II. VPon those words of the Apostle, 1. Cor. 10. v. 4. [They ate of the same spirituall meate, &c.] The Iewes received the same spi∣rituall meate, Aug. Tract. 26. in Ioh. sup. illa verba A∣postoli. 1. Cor. 10. de fi∣delibus Iudaeis [Om∣nes eandem escam spiritualem (in Man∣na) edebant, & bi∣bebant eundem po∣tū spiritualem, &c.] Corporalem escam diversam, illi Man∣na, nos aliud, sed spiritualem eandem: aliud illi, aliud nos bibimus, sed aliud specie visibili, idem autem significante virtute, Item. Eandem quam nos escam; sed Patres nostri, (nempe fideles) non Patresillorum. Aug. ibid. saith S. Augustine. Yea (saith your At eandem interse, non nobiscum eandem. Bellar. lib. 1. de Euch. c. 14. §. Quià. Cardinall) the Iewes received the same among themselves, but not the same with us Christians. So hee. Albeit the words of Augustine are plainly thus; The same which we eat: so plainly, that divers of your own side doe so directly and truely acknowledge it, that your Iesuite Iudaeos eandem escam spiritualem edisse nobiscum: exposuit hunc locum de Manna Augustinus, & qui eum secuti sunt multi, ut Beda, Strabo, & Author Glossae ordinariae—repro∣batum hoc esse à posterioribus. Ego persuasum habeo, Augustinum, si nostrâ aetate fuisset, longè aliter sensu∣rum fuisse, omni genti Haereticorum inimicissimum, cum videret Calvinistás ad eundem ferè modum hunc locum interpretari. Maldon-Jes. in Ioh. 6. v. 50. col. 706. Mal∣donate, not able to gain-say this Trueth, pleaseth himselfe notwith∣standing in fancying that If August. were alive in this Age, he would think otherwise, especially perceiving Hereticall Calvinists, (and Calvin. Inst. lib 4. c. 14. §. 23. Eandem no∣biscum—Contra Scholasticorum dogma, quo docent, veteri lege tantùm adumbrari gratiam, & novâ prae∣sentem conferri. Cal∣vin
himselfe) to be of his opinion. So hee. Was it not great pitty that Augustine was not brought up in the Schoole of the Iesuites! surely they would have taught him the Article of Transubstantiation, of the Corporall presence of Christ in the Sa∣crament, and Corporall Vnion; against all which there could not be a greater Adversarie than was Augustine: whom Mal∣donate here noteth to have beene the Greatest Enemie to all Here∣tickes: whom Bertram de Corp. Dom. p. 20. Quaeres, fortasse, quam ean∣dem? nimirum ipsam, quam hodie popu∣lus credentium in Ecclesia manducat. non n. licet—diversa intelligi, quoniam unus idem{que} Christus, qui populum in mare baptizatum carne suâ pavit, eundem{que} potum, in petra, Christum sui sanguinis undam populo praebuisse.—vide nondum pas∣sum Christum esse, etiam tamen sui corporis & sanguinis mysterium operatum fuisse: non n. putamus ullum fidelium dubitare, panem illum Christi corpus fuisse effectum, quod discipulis Dominus dicit [Hoc est cor∣pus meum.] Bertram followed in the same Exposition: and, by your leave, so did Eandem escam spiritualem] Id est, Corpus Christi in signo spiritualiter intellecto: idem, quod nos; sed aliam Escam corporalem, quam nos. Aquinas in 1. Cor. 10. your Aquinas also; The same (saith he) which wee eate. Thus much by the way. Wee goe on to our Answeres. That the wicked Receivers are called Guiltie of Christ's Bodie not for Eating of his Body unworthily, but for un∣worthily Eating the Sacrament thereof. SECT. III. THe Distinction used by St. Augustine hath bene alwayes as generally acknowledged, as knowne, wherein hee will have us to discerne, in the Eucharist, the Sacrament from the thing re∣presented, and exhibited thereby. Of the Sacrament hee saith that Aug. in Ioh. Tract. 26. Sacramentum su∣mitur à quibusdam ad vitam, à quibus∣dam ad exitium: Res vero ipsa, cuius est Sacramentum, omni homini ad vitam, nulli ad mortem, qui∣cun{que} eius particeps fuerit. It is received of some to life, and of some to destruction: but the thing it selfe (saith hee) is received of None, but to Salvation. So hee. No Protestant could speake more directly, or conclusively for proofe, First, That in the Sacrament of the Eucharist the Body of Christ is as well tendred to the wicked, as to the Godly. Second∣ly, that the wicked, for want of a living Faith, have no hand to receiue it. Thirdly, that their not preparing themselves to a due receiving of it, is a Contempt of Christ his Body and Blood. Fourthly, and Consequently that it worketh the iudgement of Guiltines upon them. All which both the Evidence of Scripture, and consent of Antiquity doe notably confirme. For the Text obiected doth clearely confute your Romish Consequence, because S. Paul's words are not; Hee that eateth the Body of Christ, and drinketh his Blood unworthily, is guilty of his Body and Blood: but, Hee that eateth the Bread, and drinketh the Cupp of the Lord unworthi∣ly, &c. which we have proved throughout the 2. Booke to signifie Bread and Wine, the signes and Sacraments of his Body and Blood, af∣ter
Consecration. And (to come to Antiquity) All the Fathers above cited Ch. 1. §. 6. who denyed that the wicked Communi∣cants are partakers of the Body and Blood of Christ (albeit knowing, as well as you, that all such unworthy Receivers are guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ) have thereby sufficiently confuted your Consequence, which was, that because the wicked are Guilty of Christ's bodie, Ergò his Body is Corporally present in them. But we pursue you yet further. That a Guiltines of Contempt of Christ's Body and blood is to be acknowledged in all prophane Neglect, by whatsoe∣ver person capable of this Blessed Sacrament. SECT. IV. GVilty of the Lords Body:] that is, Guilty of the Contempt there∣of, as you well know. Now because Contempt of a good thing is as well seene in a wilfull refusing to receive, as in a contemptuous manner of receiving; the Guiltines by the same Contempt must (*) See above. Chap. 2. § 1. needs be against the thing offered, whether it be Corporall or Spirituall; and consequently against the Giver himselfe. In which respect Christ compareth the Refusers of the promises of the Go∣spell of Salvation vnto beastly Hogs, which trample under their feet pearles of highest price, even because they would not beleeve them; Beleeving being our spirituall Receiving. From the same guilt of Contempt followeth the Obnoxiousnes to punishment, de∣nounced by our Saviour; To shake of the dst of their fee, for a testimonie against them, in not receiving the Gospell of peace. There∣fore is that saying of Hierome common to every Sacrament, Luc. 9. 5. Contempt of a Sacrament (saith he) is the contempt of him whose Sacrament it is: As also that other of Rupertus, saying Rupertus in Ioh. 6. Si qu existimat' illo Sacramento se non egere, in eo Ip∣so, quòd manducare & bibere contemnit, quantumvis Catho∣licae professionis ho∣mo sit, à societate membrorum Christi, quae est Ecclesia, se praecidit, &c. The not receiving of the Eucharist (if it be in contempt) doth separate the Contemner from the societie of the members of Christ. Hence it was, that whereas Quemadmodum enim frigidè accede∣re []—sic non cōmunicae de istis [] Chrys. inprimam ad Cor. 10. hom. 24. Chrysostome called man's Indevotion in receiving the Eucharist Dangerous, hee named the Contempt of not parti∣cipating thereof, Pestilence and death it selfe. But not to presse you further with other such like speeches of the Fathers, wee shall referr you to your Divines of Collen, who in their Councell censured those, who Contemptuously refused to communicate of this Sacrament, to be but Conc. provinciale Coloniense fol. 29. can. 14. Qui non tutum hunc panem vitae, qui de coelo descen∣dit, accipere deside∣rant, homines solo nomine, Christiani sunt Capernaitis de∣teriores, etiam vo∣luntarie in filium Dei peccantes, & Corpo∣ri Dominico & san∣guini contumeliam inferentes terribili quaedam expectatio iudicijmant. onely in name Chri∣stians, worse (say they) than the Capernaites, offering contumely (marke we pray you, against your Rhemists) to the Body and Blood of Christ; and are made thereby obnoxious to the terrible iudgement of God. A Conclusion, whereby is satisfied from your owne Do∣ctors your owne maine Obiection, even in Terminis Terminanti∣bus, as the Schoole speaketh, professing both a guiltines of Christ's
Body in not receiuing it, and an obnoxiousnes thereupon un∣to Gods Iudgement. As for your obiected speech of St. Aboue. §. 4. Cyprian, it is of easie disgesti∣on, because Comparisons of Magis, and Minus, (as learning tea∣cheth) are altered upon all different respects. Some in persecution denyed Christ, in the extremity of their feare; and some in their wilfulnes profaned the Sacrament of the Eucharist, instituted by Christ: this latter is the greater sinner before God, who iud∣geth sinne not onely secundùm actum, aut effectum, according to the wicked deed done; but secundum Affectum, that is, but much more according to the depraved Affection and Disposition of the mind of the Doer. In which respect wee may well thinke that Iudas his traiterous, and scornefull kisse was more hainous than Peters periury. Have you not read what the Apostle hath written against such as Apostate from their Faith, and vow of Baptisme, saying, Heb. 6. 6. They crucifie unto themselves the sonne of God? which is much more than Cyprian spake of the Guiltie Receiver of the Eu∣charist, yet dare not you conclude that therefore there is a Corpo∣rall Presence of Christ in the water of Baptisme. And as in the Guilt of sinne; so is it in the Guilt of punishment also, which followeth sinne, as a shadow doth a Body. In which consideration Ag∣stine doth parallell Baptisme, and the Eucharist together, saying, Aug. lib. contra Fulgent. Donatist. Si∣cut qui manducat, et bibit sanguinem do∣mini indignè, iudici∣um fibi manducat, & bibit. Sic qui indig∣nè accipit Baptisma, udicium fibi accipit, non saluem. As he that drinketh the Blood of the Lord unworthily drinketh his owne iudgement: so doth he who receiveth Baptisme unworthily. By these Premisses you will furthermore easily discerne, that your other Romish Doctors have beene no lesse ignorant than they were arrogant, in concluding it to be an Infallible Consequence, that because Christ receiveth an iniurie in his body and blood, by the abuse of the Sacrament of the Eucharist; therefore his Body and blood is carnally present therein. As if they would teach, by the like Infe∣rence, that because the Empresse Contum elia il∣lata imagini, ad per∣sonam repraesenta∣tam pertinere cen∣setur. Nota est Histo∣ria. Theodorij, de vin∣dicta quam in Anti∣ochenos exercuit, propter deiectā Im∣peratricis imaginē. Niceph. lib. 13. Hist. c. 3. Teste Suarez. Ies. Tom. 1. in 3. Thom. disp. 54. §. 3. Edocia was (as is confessed) reproached by the Citizens of Antich, in their despight wrought upon her image; therefore was she personally present in the same Image. You seeme to be zealously bent against all unworthy usage of this holy Sacrament; it is well, yet were it better that you saw your owne guiltines herein, to repentance. For inasmuch as every one is an unworthy Receiver (in the iudgement of S. Ambros. in 1. Cor. 11. Indignus est Do∣mino, qui aliter my∣steriū celebrat, quàm ab o traditum est. Ambrose) who doth celebrate it otherwise than was appointed by Christ himselfe: your Ten Transgressions of Christ his Institution of this Sacrament (discovered in the first Booke) convinceth you of a ten-fold Guil∣tines, of the Vnworthy Receiving of this Mistery. Your last ob∣iection of Guiltines is taken from the Executions of Gods pu∣nishments. Wee therefore reioyne.
That the Examples of Gods vindicative Iustice have appeared against the Contemners of many holy things, with∣out respect to the Corporall Presence of Christ therein. SECT. V. COme wee to the open iudgements and punishments of God, upon the Contemners of this Sacrament, the visible Testi∣monies of his Iustice, and Arguments of the pretiousnesse and ho∣linesse of this mystery. These we beleeve to be true, and the Apo∣stle hath made it manifest, where (speaking of the great plague, which fell upon the Corinthians, who had prophaned this Sacra∣ment of the Body and Blood of Christ) he pointeth this out as their sinne, saying, 1. Cor. 30. [Ob hanc causam] For this cause are many sicke among you, and many sleepe, &c. Yet was not this for not Discer∣ning the body of Christ to be corporally in the Eucharist (as your Disputers pretend:) but (to use Saint Hierome's words) Hier. in 1. Cor. 11. Reus erit corporis & sanguinis Christi, qui tanti mysterij Sacra∣mentum pro vili de∣sp exerit. They were guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ, because they despised the Sa∣crament of so great a mystery; (namely) by their prophane behavi∣our at their receiving thereof, as if they had beene at the Heathe∣nish Bacchanals: or as Primasius yeeldeth the Cause, Prias. in end locum. Quià accipe∣rent quasi cibum cō∣munem. For that they tooke it as homely, as their common bread. All can point at the dolefull Example of God's vengeance upon Iudas, the first unworthy Receiver; and therefore the subiect of the first Document of Gods iudgement, notwithstanding that hee re∣ceived but the Sacrament only, and not the very body of Christ, as Saint Augustine observed, saying; See above Chap. . lit. (o) Hee received not the bread the Lord, but the bread of the Lord. And how iustly, may we thinke, did God punish certaine Optatus lib. 2. Donatists, who casting the holy Sacrament to Dogges, were themselves devoured of Dogges? Neither have these kind of God's iudgements beene proper to the Abuse of this Sacrament only, as you have instructed men to be∣leeve; for looke into the sacred story, and you shall find the men of 1. Sam. 5. Ashdod, for medling with the Arke of God, Afflicted with Em∣rods: the men of 1. Sam. 6. Bethshemesh smitten with a great slaughter, for but peeping into God's Arke. Also 2. Sam. 6. Vzzah, no Priest, doth but touch the same Arke (albeit with a good intent, to support it) and he is suddainly strucke dead. Levit. 10. Nadab and Abihu prophaned the Altar of the Lord with offering strange fire thereon, and both of them were immediatly burnt with fire from Heaven, and perished. Dan. 5. Belshazzar will needs carouze in the sacred bowles of Gods Tem∣ple, in the contempt of God, and of his Law, and behold a wri∣ting upon the wall; signifyng that his dayes were at an end, as it came to passe. And yet was there not any peculiar existence of
God in these Things. 2. King. 2. Boyes are mocking God's Prophet in Bethel, by noting him for a Bald-pate, and are devoured by Beares. The Numb. 11. People loathing Manna are choaked with Quailes. If sacred stories will not preuaile, peradventure your owne Le∣gends will rellish better with you: so then your Quidam, qui sancti Anthonij ima∣ginem abolere cupi∣ebant, non tulerūt il∣lud scelus impunè, sed èvestigio peste illâ, quae dicitur Antonij, correpti interierunt. Bozius de signis Eccles. l. 15. c. 12. ex Lindano. Bozius will tell you of them, Who were suddainly strucke with the plague, called Saint Anthonies plague, only for seeking to pull downe and demolish Saint Anthonies Image. Have you faith to beleeve this? and can you not conceive a like right of Iudgement against the Prophaners of the Sacramentall Image of Christ himselfe? Be it therefore furthermore knowne unto you, that the Sacra∣ment, which is celebrated by Protestants, although it containe no Corporall Vnion of the body of Christ, yet is it not so bare Bread, as your Doctors have calumniously suggested unto you, but that God hath manifested his Curses upon prophane Communicants and Contemners of this holy Mysterie, which hath in it a Sacra∣mentall Vnion of the Bodie and Blood of Christ. One example, whereof we reade, is of one that being afflicted in Conscience for his Abuse of the Sacrament, in receiving it but in one kind, Manlius locorum cōmunium collect. Mi∣nister cuiusdam Sar∣toris Lipsiae, Anno 1553. ob temeratam institutionem divinā quâ praecipitur ut species utraque ad∣ministretur, unicam tantùm recipiēs, cō∣scientiae crimine op∣pressus, exclamavit, ô (inquit) Ego sum &c. Did cast himselfe head-long out of a window and so died. The other is that which he (who now writeth these things) saw and can testifie, viz. Sir Booth, of Saint Iohn's Coll. in Cam∣bridge. A Batchelour of Arts, being Popishly affected, at the time of the Communion tooke the Consecrated Bread, and forbearing to eate it, convayed and kept it closely for a time; and afterwards threw it over the wall of the Colledge: but a short time after, not induring the torment of his guilty Conscience, he threw himselfe head-long over the Battlements of the Chappell, and some few houres after ended his life. Thus farre of this Subiect, concer∣ning an Vnion with Christ, as it is professed in our Church. A Confutation of the Romish professed Corporall Coniuncti∣on of Christ his Bodie with the Bodies of the Communicants. SECT. VI. I. That the Errour of the Capernaites Ioh. 6. was an opi∣nion of the Corporall Eating of the flesh of Christ. MAster Brerely, the Author of the Booke of the Liturgie of the Masse (lately published, and largely applauded by all of your profession) Master Brerely, Liturg. Tract. 2. Sect. 3. doth bestow a whole Section in explicating the Errour of the Capernaites, so that it must wholy reflect (forsooth) upon the Protestants. It is not needfull we should deny, that in this Chapter of Saint Iohn Christ doth speake of the Eucharist, which
if we did, we might be assisted by your owne Bishop Iansen. Concord. in Ioh. 6. per totum. Iansenius, together with divers There are rec∣koned by some these Authours, Bil, Cusa∣nus, Caietane, Tapper, Hesselius: to whome may be added Peter Lombard. lib. 4. dist. 8. lit. D. others, whom your Iesuite Maldonat. in Ioh. 6. vers. 53. Scio doctos, scio Catholicos, scio religiosos, & probos viros: sed impediunt nos quo minùs in Haereticos acriter in∣vehamur, qui hoc ca∣pite de Eucharistia non agi contendunt. Maldonate confesseth to have beene Learned, Godly, and Catholique; yet fret∣teth not a little at them, for so resolutely affirming that in this Chapter of Saint Iohn▪ there was no speech of the Eucharist, be∣cause by this their opposition hee was hindred (as the c Iesuite him∣selfe saith) That he could not so sharply and vehemently inueigh against Protestants. Let it then be supposed as spoken of Sacramentall ea∣ting with the mouth, as some of the Fathers thought; but yet on∣ly Sacramentally, and not properly, as by them will be found true. We returne to the Discourse of your Romish Priest. Above at (a.) Christ ha∣ving spoken (saith he) of eating his flesh, and the Capernaites answe∣ring [How can he give us his flesh to eate?] They undorstood eating with the mouth, yet were (a speciall observation) never reproved of Christ for mistaking the meaning of his words, a strong reason that they understood them rightly, but for not believing them: and Christ often repeating the eating of his flesh, and drinking of his Blood, and requiring them to beleeve, and when he saith [The flesh profiteth no∣thing, it is the Spirit that quickeneth] it is not spoken to exclude the Reall Presence, or to qualifie his former sayings, but to admonish them not to iudge things by carnall reason, and yet more euidently in the words following, [There are some of you that beleeve not.] He said not (saith Saint Augustine) there be some among you that understand not: So plainly did hee hereby instruct them not how to understand, but to beleeve; for had he, for their better understanding, intended hereby to have qualified, or corrected his former sayings, as to be meant Eating spiritually by Faith, he would have explained himselfe in plaine tearmes, and so have satisfied the Iewes. Vpon which premi∣ses I doe conclude, that because our Sauiour did reprove his sorupulous hearers not for want of understanding, but for want of beleefe, it doth from thence, and other premises abundantly follow that his fore-said promise was not obscure, and figurative, but plaine and literall for our reciving of him without out our bodily mouthes. Thus farre your celebrious Priest, namely so, as in almost all other his Collections, not understanding the Truth of the matter. His Inferences stand thus. First, Christ reprehended the Caper∣naites, for not Beleeving his words concerning Eating his Flesh: but not for not for understanding them. Therefore it followeth that they understood his words, of Eating his flesh, right well. Second∣ly, They understood his speech: Therefore Christ, in saying The flesh profiteth nothing, it is the spirit, that quickneth, did not thereby qualifie his former speech, to instruct their understanding. Thirdly, They needed no instruction for their understanding; Therefore Christs words of Eating his flesh, were not figurative. Fourthly, these his words were not figurative: Therefore his words of Ea∣ting his flesh teach a Corporall Presence thereof in the Sacrament.
Each of these Consequences are delivered as ignorantly, as confi∣dently. For common learning teacheth, that there is a double con∣sideration of Truth, in every True speech: the one is , that it is True; the second is , what is the Truth, or true sence thereof. To the apprehending of the first is required Beliefe, whereupon Aristotle gave that Rule to every Scholler, that inten∣deth to learne the principles of any Art (to wit) Oportet discentem credere: A Scholler is bound to beleeve. The other point, touching the Truth, or true sence, what it is, is the obiect of man's under∣standing; so that there is a great difference betweene both These in the case of a Reprehension. As for example; the Master teaching the definition of Logicke, saying, It is an Art of disputing rightly, may iustly reproue his Scholler for his not beleeving it, because his not beleeving is wilfull: so can hee not for his not understanding it, for that hee therefore learneth, because hee doth not understand; ex∣cept it be, that being taught he either through carelesse negligence, or else affected ignorance will not understand. This agreeth with the Current of Scripture, Ioh. 6. vers. 38. Christ being the Oracle of Truth, which descended from Heaven to reueale the will of his Father, might iustly exact beliefe, that whatsoever he spake to the sonnes of men was most true: as it is written, The will of God is, that whosoever beleeveth in me, &c. Vers. 40. vz. That they must eate his flesh. But his hearers could not understand , what was the true sence of these words, which caused them to say, This is an hard saying. Therefore (like Schollers of preposte∣rous wits) would they not beleeve , namely That they were True: hence it was that Christ reproued them for not Beleeving only, vers. 64. and not for not understanding. Because it was as lawfull for Christ's Disciples to be ignorant of his darke Sayings and Para∣bles, (which were therefore so spoken, that his Schollers might more earnestly labour to know them) as it was after lawfull for them to seeke of their Master, (whose precept is to Matth. 9. 7. Seeke, and promise to Find) how to understand them. As it is written; Matth. 13. 36. His Disciples said unto him, Declare unto us the Parable of the seed: and Christ answered them, He that soweth, &c. That admirable Doctour of Gods Church Saint Augustine will shew himselfe herein an understanding Scholler of Christ (See his Testimonie) requiring of all the Disciples of Christ, in the first place, Beliefe of Christ's words, that they are True, before they did understand what was the Truth thereof: confirming his Rule by that Scripture; Except you beleeve you shall not understand. O, but the Capernaites (saith Master Brereley) did understand Christ's wordes right well. And Saint August, in Ioh. 7. Tract. 27. [Sunt qui∣dam in vobis, qui non credunt.] Non dixit, sunt quidam in vobis, qui non intel∣ligunt, sed causam dixit quare non in∣telligunt, nempè quià non credunt—ut Propheta, nisi credideritis, non intelligetis. Aliquantò superiùs. Illi non putrunt illum erogaturum corpus suum—Ille autem dixit, se ascensurum in coelum—Certè tunc intelligetis, quià co modo, quo putatis, non erogat corpus—[Caro non prodest quicquam] sicut illi in∣tellexerunt carnem, spiritualiter intellectum vivisicat. And Master Brerely out of Aug. in Psal. 98. [Nisi quis man∣ducaverit,] Dixerunt, durus est hic sermo: acceperunt illud stultè, carnaliter illud cogitaverunt. Augustine contrary to Master
Brerely, expresly answereth, They did not understand the Truth of Christ his speech, but apprehended it foolishly and literally: nor was there ever any Father, or Authour, no not in your owne Romish Church (wee thinke) before one Master Breerley; that thought o∣therwise. His second Assertion, touching that speech of Christ, [The flesh profiteth nothing, it is the spirit, that quickeneth,] That it was not spoken by Christ to Qualifie his former termes of Eating his flesh, is very like also to be his owne, being flatly contrary to the same Father, whom he avouched; for Saint Augustine saith that Christ, by these wordes, taught the Capernaites to understand his other words of Eating spiritually: a Truth which Master Brerely's owne great Master Cardinall Sed verus & literalis sensus co∣rum verborum est, carnalis intelligen∣tia nihil prodest, ut exponunt Theophyl. Euthem. nec non O∣rigines. Bellar. lib. 1. de Euch. c. 14. Bellarmine hath published, alleaging for proofe thereof the Testimonies of other Fathers, saying; Chry∣sostome, Theophylact, Euthemius, and also Origen so expoundeth it. So hee. Master Breerly his third Inference is, Therefore the words, speaking of Eating his Flesh, are not Figurative; which indeed is the maine Controversie, for never any but an Infidell denied the speech of Christ to be true; nor yet did ever any, but an Orthodoxe, un∣derstand the Truth of the speech, what it was, that's to say, whe∣ther the Truth be according to a Litterall Sence (as Master Brereley would have it) or else in a Figurative: which hath beene our de∣fence and proofe throughout the Second Booke, from all kinde of Evidences of Truth. Here therefore we are onely to deale with Master Breerly, and with his pretended witnesse Saint Augustine, to whom hee would seeme to adhere. Notwithstanding (that wee may beleeve Master Brereley himselfe) Master Brereley Liturg. Booke 4. §. 8. at Fourthly. If wee should attend to the propriety of speech, Christ's blood is not properly drunke. So he: albeit Christ his speech was as expresly for drinking his Blood, as for Eating his Bodie. And every Schoole-boy will tell him, that every speech, which is unproper, is figurative. As for Saint Augustine, hee standeth as a sworne witnesse against the proper and literall sence of Eating Christ's flesh, calling it See. afterwardes Chap. 6. Sect. 3. in the Challenge. Flagitious. Besides, rather than we should want witnesses, to aver this Truth, divers Iesuites will be ready in the following Chapter to tell Master Brereley flatly, that if hee say the words, Eating Christs flesh, are properly spoken, he speaketh false. CHALLENGE, Proving the obiected Saint Augustine to contradict the Romish Doctrine of Corporall Presence, as Protestantly as can be desired. MAster Brereley his Conclusion, taken from Christ's speech of Eating, is to inferre a Corporall Presence of Christ in the Sa∣crament.
But Saint Augustine (cited above in the Margent) thus; Christ, to them that thought hee was not to give his Body to be eaten, said that hee himselfe was to ascend up into Heaven, and then indeed they were to know, that he meant not to give his Body to be eaten, after that manner which they conceived, which was carnall, by tearing and renting it in peeces. Wherein you may plainly discerne the Argument of Saint Au∣gustine to be, that Christ by his Bodily Ascension would shew to the world, that he being bodily absent from the Earth, his flesh could not be here eaten by Bodily Tearing asunder. Thus he against the Capernaits, which must as necessarily confute the Romanists Cor∣porall Eating his flesh, whether it be by Chewing, or Swallowing; whether visibly or invisibly it mattereth not; because it being the same Body that ascended, were it visibly, or invisibly, it is equally absent from Earth. We have no list, after so plaine a discoverie of Master Brereley his manifold ignorances, to play upon his Person, but rather doe pray that at the sight of his Errours he may be re∣duced unto the Truth now, after his (fondly miscalled) Strong Rea∣soning to the contrarie. CHAP. IV. That the manner of Eating the Body of Christ, once professed in the Church of Rome, was both Capernaitically-Hereti∣call, and is also still no lesse, in the profession of divers in the same Church. SECT. I. THe first member will appeare by the faith of the Church of Rome, in the dayes of Pope Nicolas, whose faith (about the yeare 1059.) may be best knowne by the Oath, which was prescribed by him unto Beren∣garius, concerning the Eating of the body of Christ in this Sacrament. Which oath (as your Baron. An. 1059. num. 11.

Cardinall Baronius doth cer∣tifie you from the stories of those times) Pope Nicholas and a Gene∣rall Councell held at Rome revised, approved, and prescribed to Be∣rengarius
to take, for the abiuration of his errour, concerning the man∣ner of eating the body of Christ: and the same Oath was after publi∣shed by the Popes authoritie throughout all the Cities of Italy, France, and Germanie; and wheresoever the report of Berengarius should come. So he. You cannot now but expect such a forme of an Oath, which must be as truely Romish, as either Romane Pope, or Romane Coun∣cel could devise. Marke then the enioyned tenor of the Oath. I Berengarius Arch∣deacon &c. doe firmely professe, that I hold that Faith, which the Re∣verend P. Nicholas and this holy Synod hath commanded me to hold, (to wit) That the body of Christ is in this Sacrament, not onely as a Sacrament, but even in trueth is sensibly handled with the hands of the Priest, and broken and torne with the teeth of the faithfull. So the Oath. The same forme of Abiuration is registred in the publique Papall Ad perpetuam rei memoriam. &c. Bulla P. ante Gratian. Extat in Decret. de Consecrat. Dist. 2. C. Ego Berengarius. Decrees: and the Body of these Decrees hath beene lately ratified by the Bull of P. Gregory the thirteenth.

Alan. Card. l. 1. de Euch. cap. 37. p. 435. Alan. It is said (saith he) to be torne with the teeth of the faithfull no lesse properly, than if it should be said so of the Bread, if it were eaten. Yea and your Cardinall Hoc Concilium Generale fuit—Et haec Abiuratio apertissimè significat rem à Concilio definitam sub Anathemate: nec anathematizantur nisi Haereses damnatae ab Ecclesiâ. Bellar. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 21. §. Primùm: Bellarmine, for proofe of Transubstanti∣ation, hath recourse unto the same Roman Councell, which he stileth Generall, and noteth the thing defined to have beene the iudge∣ment of the Church; and that the same Iudgement was delivered un∣der the Censure of an Anathema and Curse against the Gain-sayers: and therefore he, with his Disciple Mr. In his Reioind. pag. 270. Fisher (who also allea∣geth the same) are challengeable to hold it according to the lite∣rall sence therof; because it will not admit of any qualification, by any Trope or figure that can be devised. First, because the words are purposely set downe, as a forme of Recantation and Abiuration of Heresie: but (as Nullae sunt exactiores formulae loquendi, in ma∣terià fidei, quàm eae quibus utuntur ij, qui Haeresin abiurant. Bellar. lib. 2. de Imag. sanct. cap. 22. §. Se∣cundò nulla. you confesse) There are no formes of speech more exact and proper in phrase, concerning the matter of faith, than such as are used by them that abiure Heresie. And Secondly, for that this forme of words, of Tearing with the teeth the flesh of Christ, was also made purposely for Abiuration, and abandoning all figurative Sence, for the defence of the literall Exposition of the words of
Christ, [This my Body, &c.] therefore was it taken literally. But what (thinke you) will Cavin say to this your (then) Romish forme of Profession, in the literall sence? Calvin. l. 2. defens. Sacram. Nonne cen∣tum potiùs mortes praeoptandae sunt, quàm ut quis tanti Sacrificij monstro se implicet? pag. 25. A man should rather wish to die an hundred times (saith he) than once to intangle himselfe in a Doctrine, so monstrously sacrilegious. Which Censure of his wee now endeavour to make good. That the former Romane Faith, of Properly Eating the Body of Christ, is Capernaitically-Hereticall at this day; as is proved by some of your owne Doctors of the now Romane Church. SECT. II. YOu have heard of Berengarius his Abrenunciation of Heresie, according to the faith of the (then) Romane Church, in Breaking the Body of Christ, and tearing it sensibly with their teeth. Hearken now a little, and you shall heare, in a manner, an Abre∣nunciation of that (then) Romane faith, by denying it to be ei∣ther properly Broken or yet really Torne, even by the Iesuites them∣selves. Caro Christi, Dùm in hoc Sacra∣mento manducatur, non dentibus atteri∣tur, quià tangi ne∣quit, est{que} immorta∣lis & impartibilis. Manducatio autem realis requirit con∣tactum rei edendae, ut possit dividi & transmutari. Quod hîc de corpore Chri∣sti fieri nequit. Salme∣ron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 20. p. 136. Reall Eating (saith your Salmeron) requireth a reall touch and tearing of the thing which is eaten: but the Body of Christ is not torne with the teeth, or touched by them that eate him, because he is herein impartible. So he. Your Iesuite and Cardinall Bellarmine is as it were in a maze, saying and gain-saying, as you may per∣ceive: yet notwithstanding, whether he will or no, must perforce confesse no lesse, when he saith that Si de ratione mā∣ducationis esset at∣tritio dentibus facta, Dico, Christi corpus verè & propriè man∣ducari, etiam cor∣pore in Eucharistia, non quòd attritio est necessaria ad man∣ducationem, satis ést enim transmissio in stomachum degluti∣endo. Sin verò attri∣tio dentibus facta sit de ratione manducationis: Dico Christi corpus propriè manducari, non tropicè: non enim dicimus corpus Christi absolutè manducari, sed manducatur sub specie panis, quaesententia significat species manducari visi∣biliter & sensibiliter, ac proindè dentibus atteri. Bellar. l. 1. de Euch. c. 11. §. Respon. corpus. The Body of Christ is not abso∣lutely eaten, but eaten vnder the formes of Bread: and that is to say (saith he) the formes of Bread are sensibly and visibly eaten. So hee. If this imported a literall manner of eating, then might your Car∣dinall have said as literally of himselfe; My clothes are torne, therefore my body is rent in pieces. Not to trouble you with the Cardinal's Philosophie, that talketh of Eating and tearing of Co∣lours. But to the point. If onely the Accidents of Bread be (as he saith) Sensibly eaten, then was Pope Nicolas his Prescription of Eating Christ's body sensi∣bly, in your Cardinal's opinion, not true. And upon the same ground it is, that your Iesuite Frangi, metaphorica, & non proprià locutioest, colligitur ex Thoma qu. 77. art. 7. & patet, quià fractio propriè & in rigore significat divisionem & discontinuationem partium: quae constat non fieri in partibus corporis Christi. Suarez. in Thom. qu. 75 Disp. 47. Art. 1. Sect. 4. Suarez, out of Thomas, and other Schoole-men, affirmeth the word [Broken] to bee a Metaphori∣call phrase, not properly belonging to the body of Christ; because
it requireth that there should be a Separation of the parts of that which is properly broken. So hee; as also your Canus, see in the former Section. Canus hath conclu∣ded. And your Si propriè lo∣qui velimus, falsae sunt omnes istae Pro∣positiones, Corpus Christi māducatur à nobis, corpus Chri∣sti devoratur, cor∣pus Christi frāgitur, quià ipsi modi, qui his verbis significan∣tur, non conveniunt corpori Christi, quod est in hoc Sacramen∣to: sed hae sunt verae, Recipitur à nobis su∣mitur à nobis. Mal∣den Jes. Tom. 1. de Sa∣cram. Tract. de Euch. p. 144. Verè sumitur, sed non atteritur. Ibid. p. 143. Iesuite Maldonate is so bold as to tell you, that these Propositions, The Body of Christ is eaten, is Broken, Torne with the Teeth, or Devoured of us (properly taken) are false. Thus your Iesuites, as if they had expressly said, that to thinke the Body of Christ to be eaten, torne, or devoured (properly taken) is a carnall, Ca∣pernaiticall, and (as your owne Nisi sanè intelligas verba Berengarij, in maiorem haeresin incides quàm ipse fuerit. Igitur omnia referas ad species ipsas &c. Glossa apud Gratian. de Consecrat Dist. 2. C. Ego Berengarius. Glosse in Gratian concludeth) an Hereticall opinion. Will your have any more? It is but the last day, in respect, when Ob. Scoto Brittannus, apud Pontificios—corpus Christi Cyclopum dentibus eri. Resp. Dansqueius Theol. Canon. in scuto B. Mariae Aspricollis. An verò mortales artus corporis Christi dentibus teri ore blasphe∣mo, mente nequissimâ potes comprobare? non magis id facias quàm Caiphas, cum tunicam à pectore laceravit. one of your grave Criticks so much abhorred the conceit of pro∣per Tearing Christ's Bodie, that he called the Obiecting thereof, against your Church, in his blinde zeale, Blasphemie: and answe∣reth, that you doe no more Teare Christ's flesh, than Caiphas tore his, when he rent his clothes. The Case then is plaine. That the former Romish and Popish Faith, for the manner of of receiving of the Body of Christ, is but somewhat altered; yet miserably inconstant and faithlesse. SECT. III. PRotestants may have in this place iust matter of insulation a∣gainst your Romish Professors, to prove their infidelity in that which they seeme to professe. As first, that the ground of your Doctrine of Corporall presence is the literall and proper interpre∣tation of the words of Christ, when he said [Take, eate, this is my Body:] yet now are you compelled to say that Properly eaten, is no proper, but a false sence. Your Second Doctrine is, that the iudgement of a Romane Pope, in a Romane Councell, in a matter of faith is Infallible. Not∣withstanding Pope Nicolas, with his Romane Councell, is found to haue grossly erred in a tenor of Abiuration, which of all others (as hath beene confessed) is most literall, and was therefore purpose∣ly devised against a figurative sence of the words of Christ; and forthwith published throughout Italie, France, Germany, &c. to direct men in the faith of sensuall eating, breaking, and tearing the flesh of Christ with their teeth: yet notwithstanding, your com∣mon Iudgement being now to reiect such phrases, taken in their proper signification, and in a manner to abrenounce Berengarius
his Abrenunciation, what is, if this be not an argument that ei∣ther you say, you care not, or else beleeve you know not what? Let us goe on, in pursuite of your Doctrine of the Corporall man∣ner, of eating, which you still maintaine, and it will be found to be Capernaiticall enough. CHAP. V. That the now Romish manner of Eating, and bodily receiving of the Body of Christ, is suffi∣ciently Capernaiticall in three kindes. TEll vs not that no Doctrine of your Church can be called Hereticall, before that it be so iudged by some generall Councell: no, for Rectum est Index sui & obliqui, and therefore an evident Truth written in the word of God doth sufficiently condemne the contrary of Heresie, as well as light doth discover and dispell Dark∣nes. And this is manifest by the example, which we have now in hand, of the Capernaites, old Heretickes, (as all know) even because they are set downe in Scripture to have perverted the sence of Christ his words of Eating his flesh; and thereupon to have de∣parted from Christ, Iohn 6. Your Romish particu∣lar manner of Corporall Re∣ceiving of the Body of Christ in this Sacrament is three-fold. 1. Orall, in the Mouth. 2. Gutturall, in the Throat: and (permit vs this word) 3. Ventricall, in the Belly of the Communicant. That the Romish Orall manner of Receiving Corporally the Body of Christ, with the mouth, is Ca∣pernaticall. SECT. I. CHewing the Sacrament with the Teeth was the forme of Ea∣ting, at the time of Christ his Institution, as is proved by your owne Suarez. See a∣bove, Booke 1. c. 1. §. 4. Confession, in granting that the vnleavened bread, which Christ used, was [glutinosus,] that is, gluish, clammie, and such as was to be cut with a knife. But that the same manner of Eating, by Chewing, was altered in the Apostolicall or Primitive times is
not read of by any Canon; yea or yet admonition of any Father in the Church, whether Greek, or Latine. That also Chewing continued in the Romish Church til a thousand and fiftie yeares after Christ, is not obscurely implyed in the former tenour of the Recantation of Be∣rengarius, prescribed by the same Church: which was to eat (as you have heard) By tearing it with the teeth. And lastly that this hath since continued the ordinary custome of the same Church, is as evident by your Cardinall Alan, and Canus, See above Chap. 4. Sect. 1. (d. c.) who have defended the manner of eating by Tearing. Nor was Swallowing prescribed by any untill that the queazie Stomacke of your Hostiam saliv â reverentèr liquefa∣ctam in corpus dimit∣tat: non est enim dentibus terenda, vel palato admovenda, sed ante ablutionis sumptionem degluti∣enda. Coster. Ios. Insti∣tut. lib. 1. cap. 5. Iesuites, not en∣during Chewing, perswaded the contrarie. Which kinds of Ea∣ting, whether by Chewing or Swallowing of Christ's flesh, being both Orall, none can deny to have beene the opinion of the Nimis carnaliter intelligebant (Discipuli Capernaitae) credentes eius carnem comedi oportere, sicut ede∣bantur animalium carnes, quae dentibus conteruntur. Madridius Ies. de frequenti usu Eucharistiae, cap. 4. Caper∣naites. First of not Chewing; and then of Swallowing in the VI. Chapter following.

Nis manducaveritis car∣nem meam] Si secun∣dùm literam sequa∣ris hoc ipsum quod dictum est, occidit haec litera: vi tibi aliam proferam ex Evangelio literam quae occidit, [Qui non habet, inquit, gladium, vendat tu∣nicam, & mat gla∣dium] si verò spiritu∣aliter, nō occidit, sed est in eo spiritus vi∣vificans. Origen calleth a killing letter, that is, a pernitious interpretation, even as of that other Scripture [He that hath not a sword, let him buy one, &c.] but this latter is altogether figurative, as you know, and hath a spiritu∣all understanding, therefore the former is figurative also. Athanasius, Athanas. Tract. in illa verba.—Qui∣cun{que} dixerit ver∣bum in filium homi∣nis, &c.] Quod hominibus corpus suffecisset ad cibum, ut▪ vniversis mundi alimonia fiere. Sed propterea as∣censionis su mminit, ut os a corporali intellectu abstraheret—Quae locutus sum (inq́uit) spiritus sunt & vita. i. e. corpus in cibum dabitur, ut spiritualiter unicui{que} tribuatur, & fiat singulis praeservatio ad re∣surrectionem. confuting the Capernaiticall conceit of Corporall eating of Christ's flesh, will have us to observe, that Christ after hee spake of his flesh, did forthwith make mention of his As∣cension into Heaven, but why? That Christ might thereby draw their bodily thoughts from the bodily sence, namely, of eating it cor∣porally upon earth, which is your Romish sence. Tertullian like∣wise giveth the Reason of Christ's saying [It is the spirit which quickeneth] because the Capernaites so understood the wordes of Christ's speech of Eating his flesh, As if (saith Tertul. de Capernaitis. Quia durum & intolerabile existimârunt sermonm, quasi verè carnem suam illis edendam determinâsset, praemisit, [Spiritus est qui vivificat.] lib. de Resur. carnis. Tertullian) Christ
had truly determined to give his flesh to be eaten. Therefore it was their Errour to dreame of a truly corporall eating. August. in Job. 6. Non moritur.] Non qui panem premit dente, sed qui man∣ducat in Corde. Tract. 26.—Idem in Psal. 98. Spiritua∣liter intelligite, non hoc Corpus, quod videtis, manducaturi estis, & bibituri san∣guinem illum, quem fusuri sunt, qui me crucifigent: Sacrame▪ tum commendavi vo∣bis, spiritualiter in∣tellectum vivificabit vos. Augustine out of the ixt of Iohn bringeth in Christ expounding his owne meaning of eating his flesh, and saying, You are not to eate this flesh which you see, I have commended unto you a Sacrament, which being spiritually understood shall revive you. Plainly denying it to be Christs Body which is eaten Orally, and then affirming it to be the Sacrament of his Body: and as plainly calling the manner of Cor∣porall Eating, a Pressing of bread with the teeth. We say, Bread, not the Body of Christ. For, when he commeth to our Eating of Christ's flesh, he exempteth the corporall Instruments, and requireth only the spirituall, saying, Aug. apud Gra∣tian. de Consecrat. Dist. 2. Vt quid.] Quid pa∣ras dentem, & ven∣trem? crede, & man∣ducâsti. Ex Aug. de re∣med. Poenitent. §. Vt quid. Why preparest thou thy Tooth? It is then no corporall Eating: and hee addeth; Beleeve, and thou hast eaten. Saint Augustine goeth on, and knowing that corporall Eating of any thing doth inferre a Chewing, by dividing the thing eaten in∣to parts (as your owne Iesuite hath See above Booke 4. Chap. 7. §. 3. confessed) lest we should un∣derstand this properly, he teacheth us to say Idem rursus apud Gratian ibid. Christ{us} manducat{us} vivit, quia resurrexit occisus: nec, quandò mandu∣camus, partes de illo facimus & quidem in Sacramento id fit: nôrunt fideles quem∣admodùm manducet carnem Christi, per partes manducatur in Sacramentis, ma∣net integer co. Ex Aug. Serm. de ver∣bis Evangelij. Christ is not divided into parts. Contrarily, when we speake Sacramentally, that is, figuratively and improperly, hee will have us to grant that Christ his flesh is divided in this Sacrament, but remayneth whole in Heaven. Say now; will you say that Christ's Body is Divided by your eating the Eucharist, in a literall sence? your owne Iesuits have ab∣horred to thinke so. And dare you not say that in Eating this Sacrament you doe Divide Christs Body, in a literall sence? then are you to abhorre your Romish literall Exposition of Christ's speech, which cannot but necessarily inferre a proper Dividing of the flesh of Christ. Lastly, doe but call to remembrance Saint See above Chap. 3 § 1. in the Challenge. Augustines Observation (iust the same with the now-cited Testimonie of A∣thanasius) to wit, Christ's mention of his, Ascension in his Bodie from earth, lest that they might conceive of a Carnall Eating of his Flesh; and these premises will fully manifest, that Saint Augu∣stines Faith was farre differing from the now Romish, as Heaven is distant from Earth. Wee still stand unto Christ's Qualification of his owne speech, when hee condemned all Carnall Sence of Eating his flesh, saying thereof, The flesh profiteth nothing &c. For conclu∣sion of this point, you may take unto you the commandement of Saint Chrysost. in Ioh. 6. (Graecè) Hom. 47. (La∣tine) Hom. 46. [Verba, quae ego locutus sum, spiritus & vita.] Spi∣ritus, hoc est Spiri∣tualia, hoc enim ni∣hil carnale, nullam consequentiam car∣nalem habentia: [.—Caro non prodest quiequam.] Quid hoc? nunc de ipsa carne dixit? absit, sed pro carnaliter audire deijs, qui caraliter accipiunt quae dicuntur.—Quomodò non prodest quicquam caro, sinè qua nemo potest vivere? vide quòd non de carne, sed de carnali auditione dictum est. Chrysostome, as followeth, Did not Christ therefore speake of his flesh? farre be it from us (saith he) so to thinke! for how shall that flesh not profit, without which none can have life? but in saying [The flesh profiteth nothing] is meant the carnall understanding of the words of Christ. And that you may know how absolutely he abandoneth all carnall understanding of Christ's words, of Eating his flesh, hee
saith, They have no fleshly, or naturall Consequence at all. So he. Ergo, say we (to the Confutation of your Romish beliefe) no corporall touch of Christ in your mouthes, no Corporall eating with your Teeth, no Corporall swallowing downe your Throate; how much lesse any Corporall mixture in your bellies or guts? CHALLENGE. VVHether therefore the Capernaites thought to eate Christ his flesh raw, or rosted, torne, or whole, dead or alive; seeing that every Corporall eating thereof, properly taken, is by the Fathers held as Carnall and Capernaiticall, it cannot be that the Romish manner of Eating should accord, in the iudgement of An∣tiquity, with the doctrine of Christ. Notwithstanding you cite us to appeare before the Tribunall of Antiquity, by obiecting counter-Testimonies of ancient Fathers; and we are as willing to give you the Answering. The extreme Vnconscionablenesse of Romish Disputers, in wresting the figurative Phrases of Ancient Fathers to their Literall and Corporall manner of Receiving the Body of Christ. SECT. III. IT is a miserable thing to see how your Authours delude their Readers, by obtruding upon them the Sentences of Fathers in a literall Sence, against the evident Expressions of the same Fa∣thers to the contrary. I. Orig Hom. 5. in diuers. Script. loca. Sub tectum tuum ingre∣ditur, imitare Cen∣turionem, & dic non sum dignus, Domine, &c. Obijc. Bellar. l. 2. de Euch. c. 8 Nō vidi Ad∣versariorū respōsum ad hoc. [Yea, Resp. O∣rig. ibid.] Intrat nunc Dominus sub tectum credentium duplici figurâ vel more, quan∣dò enim sancti Ec∣clesiarum Antistites sub tectum tuum in∣trant, tune ibidem Dominus per cos in∣greditur, & tu sic existimes, tanquàm Dominum suscipiendum. Then followeth the other figure,] Cum hic sanctus cibus, & incorruptibile pulum, &c. Origen (say you) will have the Com∣municant to thinke himselfe Vnworthy, that the Lord should enter under the roofe of his mouth. Right, hee saith so, but in the same sence wherein he equivalently said, that Hee who entertaineth a Bi∣shop and Spirituall Pastor, must know that now Christ entreth under his roofe, namely, Christ, figuratively. II. Chrysostome (who speaketh in the highest straine) saith that Chrysost. Hom. 60. ad pop. Antioch. Multi dicunt velle se eius for∣mam videre, ipse concedit, non tantùm videre, sed & tangere, & manducare, & dentibus terere. So Chrysost. ibid. Lingua rubescit sanguine Christi. Et lib. 3. de Sacerdotio, & Hom. 47. in Ioh. [] spiritualia sunt. We see, touch, eate, and teare with our teeth the flesh of Christ. True, but, to note that hee spake it in a Rhetoricall and figurative Sence, he equiualently saith also in the same place; Our tongues are made red with his blood. And else-where, to put all out of question; These (saith he) are spiritu∣all, and containe no Carnall thing. Yet what need you our Com∣ment? Your Iesuite Maldonate would gladly prevent us: Dentibus teri, quema dmodùm Chrysost. ocutus est, hae non possunt nisi Sacramento-tenùs Intelligi non propriè. Maldon▪ Ies. in Matth. 26. 2. The
words of Chrysostome (saith he) of tearing the flesh of Christ, cannot be otherwise understood, than Sacramentally. Even he which conclu∣ded but now, that to say See above Chap. 4. §. 2. we Eate Christs flesh, properly, is a false proposition. III. Gaudentius (say you) saith; Gaudent. Promi∣sit corpus suum, por∣rigit tibi corpus suū, corpus accipis. Ob. Bellar. l. 2. de Euch. c. 21. [Albeit a little af∣ter upon these words, I Nisi manducaveri∣tis:] Voluit Christus animas nostras pre∣ioso suo sanguine sanctificari, per ima∣ginem pretiosae pas∣sionis, quo omnes fi∣deles populi exem∣pla passionis ante o∣culos habentes, quo∣tidiè gerentes in ma∣nibus, & ore sumen∣tes ac pectore, re∣demptionis nostrae op' indelebili memo∣riâ teneamus. Gau∣dent. Tract. 2. De Ratio∣ne Sacramentorum. Wee receive the bodie, which Christ reacheth. We grant he said so, but he interpreteth himselfe, saying; Christ would have our soules sanctified by the Image of his Pas∣sion. IV. But Aug. l. 2. con. Ad∣vers. legis & Proph. c. 9 Christum sanguinem dantem, fideli corde atque ore suscipimus. Ob. Bellar. quo supra. cap. 24. §. In sex to. Augustine teacheth that Wee receive the body of Christ both with heart and mouth. Which your Obiector Notandū. Non corde tantùm, sed e∣tiam ore dici,—Bellar. ibid. [yet it fol∣loweth immediatly in Saint Augustine giving this generall Rule for such sayings,] Agi in omnibus Scripturis secundum sanae fidei regulam, figurativè dictum vel factum si quid exponitur de quibuliber rebus & verbis, quae in sacris paginis con∣tinentur, expositio illa ducatur, &c. [Teaching in all other Scriptures (as in this) a figurative sence, wherein any mt∣er of Horrour or Turpitude may seeme to be contained.] no∣teth, as being very notable for the Orall Receiving, Corporally: albeit the same Saint Augustine immediatly expresseth, that this and all other such Speeches are to be vnderstood figuratively and unproperly. V. But Pope Leo is brought in, saying, [Leo Serm. 14. de Passione Christi. Ipsum per omnia & spirite & carne gustemus. Ob. Bellar. quo supra c. 28. [Gustemus pro Gestamus; for he speakes of Baptisme lawfully administred, whereby we are said to Put on Christ, Gal. 3. By which (saith he) Corpus regenerati fiat caro crucifixi. [Other places obiected out of Leo we grant, as Serm. 6. de Ieiun. 7. Mens Ore sumitur, quod corde credi∣tur. And so say wee; Ore, Sacramentally.] Gustamus] We taste with our flesh the flesh of Christ. Nay, but you have corrup∣ted his Saying, for his word is [Gestamus] Wee beare or carrie it (namely) by being baptized (as there is expressed) whereof the A∣postle said; You have put on Christ. VI. But Pope Gregorie (say you) saith, Greg. Papa Hom. 22. in Evang. Qui sanguis super u∣trumque postem ponitur, quandò non solùm ore corpotis, sed etiam ore cordis hauritur. Ob. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. c. 32. [But Greg. a little after, Et in superliminare domus agni sa nguinem ponimus, quià crucem illus pas∣sionis in fronte poamus.] The blood of Christ is sprinkled upon both postes, when we receive it both with heart and mouth. Which (wee say) he spake with the same Improprietie of speech, wherein hee addeth equivalently that, The blood of Christ is sprinkled upon the upper postes, when wee carry in our fore-heads (by Baptisme) the signe of the Crosse. VII. But, Isych. lib. 6. in Levit. cap. 22. Per ignoratiam percipit, qui nesit quià corpus hoc & sanguis est secundùm veritatem, &c. Ob. Bellar. quo supra. [yet the same Isych. lib. 1. in Levit. cap. 2.] Carnem aptam ibo fecit post passionem: si enim non fuisset crucifixus, sacrificium eius corporis minimè concederemus, comedimus autem nunc cibum smenes memoriam passionis.] Non receiveth (saith He∣sychius) save hee that perceiveth the truth of his blood. But how? even as hee himselfe there addeth, By receiving the memorie of his Passion. VIII. But Optatus tels us that Optat. Milevit. lib. 6. cont. Parmen. In Altaribus membra Christi sunt portata.—Altare sedes est corporis & sanguinis Christi.—Immane facinus quandò fregistis calices sanguinis Christi. Obijcit▪ Bellarm. quo supra. Albeit the same Optatus in the same Booke; Iudaeos estis imitati, illi injecerunt manus Christo, à vobis pas est in Altari.] The members of Christ are upon the Altar: and that The Altar is the seate of his Body and Blood: and that it is an hainous thing to breake the Chalices of the Blood of Christ, &c. Wee grant these to be the Phrases of Optatus, indeed, which you have obiected: but, alas! my Masters, will you never learne the Dialect of the Ancient Fathers, after so many Exam∣ples, as it were lights, to illuminate your iudgements? Wherein
(as other Fathers have done) Optatus will instruct you, for his owne language, who in this Booke inveighing against the mad∣nesse of the Donatists, for their iniuring of the Ministers of Christ; Now (saith he) doe you imitate the Iewes, they laid hands vpon Christ, and Christ is now beaten by you on the Altar. So hee; by the same Hyperbole making as well the Priest, that ministreth at the Altar, Christ; as he did the Signes and Symboles of the parts of Christ (which are his Body and Blood) the members of Christ: even as Christ himselfe said to Saul, the Persecutor of the Faithfull; Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? The great Oratour Chrysostome is further obiected, flowing in his Rhetorike, and saying of this Sacrament that Chrysostomus in 1. ad Cor. 10. Hom. 24. Non conspicaris cum tantùm, sed tangis, &c. Wee see him on the Altar: and that He is held in the hands of the Priest: (namely) in the same Rhetoricall sence, wherewith Aug. Vos estis in mensa, vos estis in ca∣lice. Teste Beda in 1. Cor. 10. Augustine said of all the faithfull Christian Communicants; You are on the Table; you are in the Cup. Or as Chrysostome himselfe required of per∣sons baptized in their perfect age, saying, Chrysost. in Mare. Hom. 14. Tenete pe∣des Salvatoris. Hold you the feet of our Saviour. Yet one more. Augustine doubted not to say of this visible word, the Sacra∣ment of Christ, that De Consecrat dist. 2. Can. Cum frangi∣tur. Dum sanguis de calice in ora fidelium funditur. Aug. The Lord's blood is powred out into the mouthes of the faithfull. And Hierome is as bold to say of the audible word of God, that when it is preached, Hier. in Psal. 147. Quando audim{us} sr∣monem Dei, caro Christi & sangus e∣ius in auribus fideliū funditur. The blood of Christ (by it) is powred into the eares of the Hearers. Master Master Brereley. Cyprian de Coena Dom. Christus pin∣cerna porrexit hoc poculum, & docuit, ut non solùm exterius hoc sanguine fruere∣mur, sed & interius aspersione omnipo∣tenti animâ munire∣mur. Litur. Tract. 2. §. 2. Subd. 4. Brereley would thinke much not to be suffered to put in his Vie, iu the name of Cyprian: Wee are anointed with his blood, not only outwardly, but also inwardly our soules are fortified with the sprinkling thereof. So Cyprian. What meaneth this? not onely outwardly, meaning in Body (saith Master Brereley, and ad∣deth) which convinceth our Bodily receiving thereof. So hee. From the same Cyprian, who, in the same place, saith in the same stile, Cyprian. paulò post. Cruc haeremus, sanguinem sugimus, & intra ipsa redemp∣toris vulnera figimus linguam, &c. We cleave to his Crosse, sucke his blood, and fixe our tongues within the wounds of our Redeemer, which are all Sacramentall, Allego∣ricall, and Tropolasticall Phrases; as Cyprian will clearely expresse himselfe, in respect of our outward man, and spiritually of the in∣ward. CHALLENGE. BY this this time it may appeare that all your so serious and ex∣quisite Collections out of the Fathers, for proofe of a Corporall Presence of Christ in this Sacrament, and Vnion with the Parta∣kers thereof, doe appeare, by this Encounter of iust Parallels, to be indeed the idle Imaginations of your Teachers, and the rro∣neous Intoxications of all their Disciples, who yeeld assent unto them. For to interpret the figurative speeches of the Fathers lite∣rally, is all one as to sticke Goose-feathers in their Caps, and plain∣ly
to befoole them, by making them of all others the most egregi∣ously absurd (as you have already heard,) and no lesse fond in the outward letter then are these others that follow; to wit, of Gauden∣tius; Gaudent. Tract. 2. lubemur caput Di∣vinitatis eius cùm pedibus incarnatio∣nis manducare. We are commanded to eate the head of Christ's Deity, with the feet of his Incarnation. Or the saying of Saint Hierome; Hier. in Psal. 147. Ego corpus Iesu E∣vangelium puto.—Et cùm dicit, [Qui bibit sanguinem me∣um] licet in mysterio possit intelligi, tamé veriùs sanguis eius, sermo Scripturarum est. When Christ said, Hee that drinketh my blood, although it may be under∣stood in a Mystery, yet the truer blood (saith hee) is the word of Scripture. Or as, before him, Origen: Orig. in Numb. 23. Hom. 16. Bibere dicimur sanguinem Christi, non solùm Sacramentorum ritu, sed cùm doctrinae e∣ius verba recipimus, in quibus vita consi∣stit: sicut ipse dicit, Ioh▪ 6. Verba mea spiritus sunt & vita. We drinke the blood of Christ (saith he) not only by the rite of a Sacrament, but also in re∣ceiving his word, whereof it is said, My words are spirit and life: So they. And so iust cause have we to complaine of the Vnconscionable∣nesse of your Obiecters, by their so often abusing the Testimonies of these holy Fathers; insomuch that you had need of the often Admonition of your owne Senensis: Saepe monuimus non esse Concionatorum verba sempe in rigoreaccipienda: multa enim Declamatores per Hyperbolen enuntiant & inculcant vel occasione persona∣rum inducti, vel affectuum impctu, vel orationis cursu rapti. Hoc interdùm Chrysostomo contigit. Sixtus Se∣ens. Biblith. l. 6. Annot. 152. I have often given warning (saith he) that the sayings of Fathers be not urged in the rigidnesse of their words, because they use to speake many times HYPERBO∣LICALLY, and in excesse, being either transported by the vehemen∣cie of their Affections, or carried with the Crren of their speech. So hee. CHAP. VI. The Second Romish Corporall Vnion of the Body of Christ, with the Bodies of the Communicants, is with Swallowing it downe. SECT. I. YOur Generall Tenet is, That the Body of Christ is pre∣sent in the Bodies of the Receivers, so long as the formes of Bread and Wine continue. Next, that Satis est ut trans∣missio fiat in stoma∣chum, deglutiendo. Bell. l. 1. de Euc. c. 11. It is swallowed downe, and transmitted into the stomacke▪ yet further, that your Priest in your Romane Masse is enioyned to pray, saying, Missale Roman. authoritate Concili Tridentini, & Pap Pij quarti. Ordinariu missae. Corpus tuum, Domine, quod sumpsi, & sanguis, quem potavi adhaereat visceribus meis. O Lord, let thy bodie which I have taken, and blood which I have drunke, cleave unto my Guts, or Entrailes. And a lesse Missale parvum pro Sa∣cerdotibus in Anglia, Iuss Pai Quinti Papae editum. Deus, qui humani generis vtramque substantiam praesen∣tium munerum alimento vegetas, & renovas Sacramento, tribue quaesumus ut corum & corporibus nostris sub∣sidium non defit, & mentibus. Missall (but yet of equall Authoritie) teacheth all you
English Priests to pray, saying; O God who refreshest both our sub∣stances with this food, grant that the supply and helpe hereof may not be awanting either to our bodies, or soules. So that finally, If through infirmity of the eater it passe from the stomacke downewards, it then goeth into the Draught and place of egestion. As hath beene evicted from your owne See above in the fourth Booke C. 8. §. 2. Conclusions. That this former Doctrine is fully and filthily Capernaiticall. SECT. II. IN this Romish Profession every one may see, in your Corporall Presence, two most vile and ougly Assumptions; One is of your Devouring of Christ, and feeding bodily of him. The other is a pos∣sibilitie of (sauing your presence) passing him downeward into the Draught, or Seege; that being as ill, this peradventure worse, than any Capernaiticall infatuation: for which cause it was that your Ie∣suite Maldonate, although granting that you doe corporally re∣ceive it into your stomackes, yet See above C. 4 §. 2 denied, for shame, that you are Devourers thereof. But, I beseech you, what then meaneth that, which your Ro∣mish Instructions, Decrees, and Missals (as we have Ibid. §. 1. heard) doe teach you to doe with the Hoast, in case that any either through Infirmitie, or by Surfet and Drunkennes shall cast up the same Hoast out of his stomacke? We demand, may your Communicants be Vomitores, to cast it up againe, and can you deny but that they must first have beene Voratores, to have devoured that which they doe so disgorge? Will you beleeve your Iesuite Osor, Jes. Tom. 2. Conc. 2. in Ioh. 6. Caro mea verus est cibus &c. Vorare, est sine masticationeglutire. Osorius? To Devoure a thing (saith he) is to swallow it downe without chewing. Say now, doe not you swallow the Sacrament with chewing it? then are you Capernaiticall Tearers of Christ's Body. But doe you Swallow it with∣out Chewing? then are you Capernaiticall Devourers thereof. Say not, that because the Bodie of Christ suffereth no hurt, there∣fore hee cannot be said by Corporall swallowing to be Devoured: for his Bodie was not corrupted in the grave, and yet was it truly buried; and his Type thereof, even Ionas, without maceration was swallowed vp into the belly of the Whale, and yet had no hurt. Notwithstanding, he was first caught and devoured, who was af∣ter cast up and vomited.
That the same Romish manner, of Receiving it downe into the Belly, is proved to be Capernaiticall by the Iudge∣ment of Antiquity. SECT. III. THeophylact Theoph. in Ioh. 6. p. 304. Capernaitae putabāt, quòd Chri∣stus cogeret eos , voratores carnis suae esse: nos hîc spiritualiter in∣telligimus, ne{que} car∣nium voratores su∣mus. noted the Capernaites opinion to have beene, that the Receivers of the Body of Christ are , Devourers of flesh, whereas the words of Christ (saith hee) are to be understood spiritually, and so will it be known that we Christians (what?) are not De∣vourers of Christ. So hee. But, that Swallowing, properly taken, is a Devouring, hath beene proved: and, if Devoured, then why not also (that which is the Basest of all Basenesse) passed downe by gestion into the Seege? whereof the Ancient Fathers have thus determined: Origen, that Origen in Matth. 25. [Quod si quic∣quid in os ingredi∣tur, in ventrem abit, & in secessum ejici∣tur.] E ille cibus sanctificatus verbo Dei, iuxta id quod habet materiale, in ventrem abit, & in secessū eijcitur. Coe∣terum iuxta precati∣onem pro proportio∣ne fidei factus sit uti∣lis, efficiens ut per∣spicax sit anim{us}. Nec materia panis, sed su∣per eo dictus sermo prodest non indignè comedenti. Et haec quidem de symbolico corpore: multa por∣ò & de verbo dici possunt, quid factum est, caro, verus que cibus, quem qui co∣medeit vivet in ae∣ternum. The materiall part of this sanctified meate passeth into the Draught: which (saith he) I speake of the symbolicall Bodie, &c. Here will be no place for your Bellar. Ista omnia rectè intelligi possunt de Eucharistia—at materiale, quod in se∣cesum abit, sunt ac∣cidentia, non respe∣ctu formae naturalis, sed sanctificationis & magnitudinis: nam magnitudo ad mate∣riam potius pertinet quàm ad formam—Et per hoc quòd Symbolicum corpus vocat, intelligit cor∣pus Christi, ut est hîc symbolum & signum sui ipsius, ut erat in cruce. Lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 8. Cardinal's Crotchets, who confessing Origen to have spoken all this of the Eucharist, would have vs by Materials to understand Accidents in respect (saith hee) of sanctification, which they had, and of Magnitude, which belongeth rather to the matter of a thing, then to the forme: and, by Symboli∣call Body, to conceive, that this was meant of the Body of Christ it selfe, as it is present in this Sacrament, a Signe, or Symboll of it selfe, as it was on the Crosse. So he: as if he meant to crosse Origen's intention throughout every part of his Testimony. For first, That which he called Bread, he calleth also meate san∣ctified: Secondly, that meate he teameth materiall. Thirdly, This materiall, he saith, passeth into the Draught. Lastly, concluding his speech, concerning the Sacramentall Body, and saying, Hither∣to have I spoken of the symbolicall body; immediately he maketh his Transition to speake of the incarnate Body of Christ, as it is the True soules meate. But first meerly Accidents were never called by the Ancient Fathers Meates. Secondly, never Materials. Third∣ly, never Magnitude in it selfe, without a Subiect, was iudged o∣therwise then Immateriall. Fourthly, never any Immateriall thing to have Gravitie, or weight in pressing the guts to make an ege∣stion into the See Booke 4. Chap. 10. Draught. If every one of these be not, yet all, as a foure-fold cord, may be of force to draw any Conscionable man to grant, that Origen was of our Protestants faith. And that which is more than all, hee, in his Transition, expresly sheweth his faith, concerning Christ's Body, as Spirituall Bread, by discerning it from the Sacramentall, which he named a Symbolicall Body, as one Body distinctly differing from the other. As for your Cardinals pa∣geant
of Christ's Body in this Sacrament, as being a Signe and Sym∣bol of it selfe, as it was on the Crosse, it Booke 2. C. 2. §. 6. hath once already, and will the Booke 6. C. 5. §. 7. second time come into play, where you will take small pleasure in this figment. Againe, concerning the Body of Christ it selfe, Cyrill. Hierosol. Cate. Mystag. 5. Panis hic  &c. Cyrill Christi∣anly denyeth it to goe either into the Belly, or into the Draught; and Chrysot. de Euch. in Ecaen. Non sicut reliqui cibi in seces∣sum vadunt: absit! ne sic cogites. Chrysostome (as iudging the very thought thereof Execra∣ble) denyeth it with an Absit! Finally Ambros. lib. 5. de Sacram. cap. 4. Non iste panis est, qui va∣dit in corpus, sed pa∣nis vitae aeternae, qu animae nostrae sub∣stantiam fulcit, Ibid. Supersubstantialis. Ambrose is so farre from the proper swallowing of Christ in this Sacrament, that distingui∣shing between Corporall Bread and the Body of Christ, (which he calleth super substantiall Bread, and Bread of everlasting life, for the establishing of man's soule) hee denyeth flatly that this is that Bread which goeth into the Body. If any mouse, which your say may run away with the hoast, be wholly fed thereon for a monthes space, the Egestion of that Creature will be as absoute a Demonstration as the world can have that the matter fed upon, after Consecration, is Bread: And why may you not aswell grant a power of Ege∣stion, as confesse (which you doe) in that Creature a digestion thereof. Two false Interpretations fell upon the Catholike Profession, concerning the Doctrine of the Eucharist, in the dayes of Saint Augustine; both which that holy Father did utterly explode. The first was by the Manichees, who teaching Aug co. Fast. Manich. lib▪ 20. cap. 11. Ex fabula vestra de Sp.

Edit. Parisijs Ann. 1555. that Christ was Hanged on every tree, and tied unto all meates which they eate, would needs have their Religion to be somewhat agreeable to the Catholike Profession. An Imputation which Saint Au∣gustine did abhorre, namely, that it should be thought that there was the same reason of the opinion of Mysticall bread, among the Orthodoxe, which the Maniches had of their Cor∣porall bread. As for example, that Christ should be Fastened or tied to mens guts, by eating, and let loose againe by their belch∣ing. Which Hereticall Doctrine how shall it not accord with your Romish, which hath affirmed a passage and Entrance of Christs body into, and Cleaving unto mens See Chap. 7. Sect. 1. Guts by eating? and a Repasse againe by Vomitting, albeit the matter, so fast and loose, in the iudgement of St. Augustine, be Bread still, after Consecration. The Second Calumniation against the true Professours was by others, who testified that Catholikes in the Eucharist ado∣red Ceres and Bacchus, after the manner of the Paganes. What answere, doe you thinke, would a Romish Professor have made
in this Case? doubtles (according to your doctrine of Corporall presence) by saying thus: Whereas some affirme that we adore Bread and Wine in this Sacrament, yet the truth is wee adore that, whereinto Bread and Wine are Transubstantiated, (to wit) the Bodie and blood of Christ the sonne of God. But S. Augustine, as one fancying nothing lesse; Wee (saith he) are farre from the Gods of the Pagans, for we embrace the Sacrament of Bread and wine. This is all, and all this he spake after Consecration. Whereupon we are occasioned to admonish our Christian Rea∣der to take heed of the fraudulent practice of the Romish Sect, be∣cause of their abusing of the Writings of ancient Fathers. Whereof take unto you this present Editio Paris. Anno 1614. Noster panis—mysticus fit nobis [Corpus Christi] non nasci∣tur. Whereas the di∣rect Sence is, that Bread consecrated is not naturally bread (as were the Spicae, that is, ares of corne, spoken of by the Ma∣nichees) but made My∣sticall and Sacramen∣tall by Consecration. example. The Paris Edition An. 1555. hath the Sentence of S. Augustine thus: Noster Panis—Mysti∣cus fit nobis, non nascitur. But the last Paris. Edition Ann. 1614. hath foisted in and inserted [Corpus Christi;] albeit the sence be full without this Addition, to signifie that Common Bread is by Consecration made Mysticall or Sacramentall (according to S. Au∣gustine his owne exposition, saying that Wee embrace the Sacra∣ment of Bread, and Cup;) and also the Phrase of [Panis fit corpus Christi] Bread is made Christs Bodie] be repugnant to a common Principle of all Christianity, which never beleeved a Body of Christ made of Bread. So that the foresaid Addition is not a correcting, but a Corrupting of the Text. CHALLENGE. HOw might it concerne you upon these premises, if there be in you any spirit of Christianity, to suffer Si praeceptiva locutio flagitium aut facinus videtur iube∣re, figurata est, ut [Nisi manducaveri∣tis carnem mem:] facinus videtur ju∣bere. Ergò figura est, praecipiens passioni Domini esse commu∣nicandum, & suaviter & utiliter reconden∣dū in memoria, quià pro nobis caro eius crucifixa & vulnera∣ta sit. August. de Doct. Christ. lib. 3. Cap. 16. S. Augustine to be your Moderator in this whole Cause? who upon the speech of Christ [Except you eate my flesh] giveth this generall Rule, That whensoever we fid in Scripture any speech of commanding some eynous Act, or forbidding some laudable thing, there to hold the speech to be figurative, even as this is of eating the flesh of Christ. So hee. And what this figurative speech signifieth, this holy Father decla∣reth in the next words: It Commandeth (saith hee) that wee doe Communicate of the passion of Christ, and sweetly and profitably keepe in memory that his flesh was crucified for us. Thus you see hee exclu∣deth the Corporall, Sensuall, and Carnall Eating, that hee might e∣stablish the spirituall of mind, and Memory. If St. Augustine by this his counsell might have prevailed with your Disputers and Doctors, they never had fallen upon so many Rocks, and Para∣doxes, nor sunke into such puddles of so nastie and beastly Absur∣dites, as have beene now discovered; which by your Doctrine of Corporall Presence you are plunged into.

Iustly, because if this Doctrine were true, you must likewise grant that the same Bodie of Christ, which
you say is eaten of myce and Rats, is mingled within their guts, and entrails; and so such vile Creatures should be as really capa∣ble of Communion with Christ's Body, as the most sanctified a∣mong Christians can be: for which the Beasts themselues, if they could speake, would (as the Asse unto Balam) condemne the foo∣lishnes of your Prophets, namely those, of whom you have See above at (b.) heard your Iesuite confessing, that this is the Doctrine of Almost all late Diuines, which is to adde one Capernaiticall Absurdity to another. It onely remaineth to know with what Spirits these your New Divines have thus written; your See his Testimo∣nies cited a little be∣fore, lit. (.) Suarez telleth vs, saying, That they speake so in hatred of Heretiques (meaning Protestants) against whom they writ. Who would not now magnifie the Profession of Protestants, to observe their Adversaries to be so farre transported with the Spirit of malignity and giddines against them, that by the iust Iudgement of God they are become so starke blind in themselves, as that they fall into opinions not onely (as is confes∣sed) Rash and Absurd; but also Capernaitically-Hereticall? And indeed they who imagined a Corporall Eating, how should they not aswell have conceived a Corporall fleshly Commixtion? CHAP. VIII. Of the Romish Obiections out of the Fathers, for proofe of Corporall Presence, and Corporall vni∣on with the Bodies of the Com∣municants. SECT. I. IT cannot be denyed but that many antient Fathers are See the Testimo∣nies in the 3.  Section following. frequent in these kind of Phrases; Our Bodies are nourished and augmented by the flesh of Christ, and his Body is mingled with our flesh, as melted waxe with waxe: yea, we have a corporall and naturall vnion with him. These kind of sayings of the Holy Fathers have beene obiected, not onely by your new Witnes Suarez in the former Section, at (a, b.) Divines, for proofe of a Corpo∣rall Coniunction of Christ with the Bodies of the Communicants, but also by your Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. per totum. Cardinall, and all other like Romish Professors, for defence of a Corporall Presence of the Body of Christ in this Sacra∣ment; but with what coloured Consciences (white or blacke) they have beene so obiected, commeth now to be scanned by iust Processe.
That the obiected Sentences of Fathers doe not intend a Cor∣porall Coniunction, so properly called, even by the Confession of Romish Divines of best esteeme. SECT. II. ALl your Obiectors produce the Testimonies of Fathers, for proofe of a Corporall Presence of Christ, as vehemently as the others of them have done for maintaining of an Vnion properly and really Corporall. Notwithstanding the most eminent Cathe∣drall Doctors in your Romish Schooles, to wit, Bellarmine, Tolet, and Suarez doe explode that Corporall Commixture. The first Car∣dinall and Iesuite now mentioned, singling out these Fathers, who seeme most peremptorily and Emphatically to teach a Corporall nourishing, Corporall Augmentation, Corporall and naturall mix∣ture, and Vnion of Christ's Body with ours; such as were Ireneus, Hi∣lary, Nyssen, Cyrill, and others, (as if he had forgot himselfe, and meant to answere for us) saith: Non est novum apud Irenaeum, Hil∣larium, Nyssenum, Cyrillum, & alios, ut Eucharistia dicatur alero corpora nostra: sed non intelligunt Patres, cum hoc dicunt, Eucharistiâ nutriri vel augeri mortalem substanti∣am Corporis no∣stri, si enim fa∣cerent Eucharistiam cibum ventris, non mentis, quo nihil ab∣surdius fingi possit. Bellar. l. 2. de Euch. c. 4. ad finem. The Fathers in so saying are not so to be understood, as if the mortall substance of our bodies were nourished thereby, for so they should make it meate for the Belly, and not of the mind, than which nothing can be more absurd. The Second Cardi∣nall and Iesuite, speaking of Cyrill and Hilarie, Cum dicunt Hil∣lar. & Cyril. nostra corpora habere vni∣onem corporalem & naturalem cum corpore Christi: Doctores hi non sunt ità intelligendi, utvelint ex Christo sumpto, & sumen∣e fieri unum Ens naturale (indigna est illis doctrina) sed hoc dicere voluerunt propter unionem, quae rati∣one charitatis & fidei sit, adesse intra nos ipsos verè & realiter Christum ipsum, qui Causa est fidei eiusdem. Tolet. in Ioh. 6. Annot. 29. They say (saith hee) that our Bodies have a naturall Coniunction and Vnion in this Sa∣crament w the Body of Christ, but are not so to be vnderstood, as if there were a naturall Vnion (which were a Doctrine unworthy of them) but their meaning is, that for the Vnion-sake, which is of Faith and Charitie, Christ is really and truly within us, who is the cause of faith. So hee. Your Third Iesuite of prime note we Suarez in the Chap. 7. §. 1. have heard already (in Confutation of your new Divines, who collected from such Testi∣monies a Proper Corporall Coniunction) terming this Doctrine Rash, absurd, and repugnant to the dignity and Maiestie of the Sa∣crament.
That the Obiected Sentences of Fathers make not for the Ro∣mish Corporall Vnion; proved by their owne Dialect. SECT. III. THe expresse Testimonies of the obiected Fathers you may read in the Margent, as they are marshalled by your owne Ie∣suite Suarez. Jes. in Thom. part. 3. disp. 64. §. 3. recenset vz. 1. Ire∣naeum.

Lib. . de Trinit. He might have added Iustine Martyr, and others. Docet Apostolus ex natura Sacramentorum esse hanc fidelium unitatem, ad Galatas scibens: Quotquot baptizati estis in Christo, Christum induistis—Quod unum sunt in tantâ gentium, conditionum, sexuum diversitate nunquid ex assensu voluntatis, an ex Sacramen∣ti vnitate? quia his & Baptisma sit unum, ita{que} qui per andem rem sunt unum natura unum sunt. Hilar. de Tri∣nit. lib 8 Susipiens Christum non idem fit post lavacrum, qui ante Baptismum fuit, sed Corpus regenerati fiat caro crucifixi. Leo. Ser. 14. de Passione Domini. Suarez, to wit, Irenaeus, Chrysostome, Cyril Alexand. Grego. Nyssen. Pope Leo, and Hillarie. The Summe is, The mixture of Christ's Body with ours, by a Corporall and naturall Vnion in deede, and not one∣ly in faith or Affection. Two kind of Semblances are to be observed, one in their like Hyperbolicall Phrasing, concerning Baptisme; and the other tou∣ching our Coniunction with Christ. Of Baptisme Hilarie the 6. obiected saith, Christians by Baptisme, which is one, are made one, not onely in affection but also in nature. Leo the 5. obiected, saith also, that By Baptisme the Body of the Re∣generate is made the flesh of Christ crucified. And marke what your Cardinall Tolet hath collected from Augustine, namely that Tolet. Com. in Ia. 6. Anot. 26. Docet Augustinus lib. 1. de Pecc. merit. Parvulos per Baptismum participes fieri huius Sacramanti (Eucharistiae) quod hac ratione fit, nam per Baptismum sunt de corpore mystico Ecclesiae, ad unitatem Christi pertinent; hoc Sacra∣mentum huius unitatis corporis ignum est, & ideo ho Sactamento aliquo modo participant, nemp quantum rem significatam, & dici possunt arnem Christi manducare & bibere sanguinem. In∣fants by being Baptized, are made partakers of the Eucharist, because they are memberr of the mysticall Body, and are so made in a sort par∣takers of this Sacrament, that is to say, of the thing signified, eating his flesh, and drinking his Blood. So hee. By which your Obiector must be inforced to admit a like Reall coniunction, and consequently of a Reall presence of Christ in Baptisme, as they have for the Bodily Vnion and Presence of Christ in and by the Eucharist. Yea, and the Fathers with the like accent and Emphasis of speech say as much of other things: Isidor. Pelus. Verbum Dei [.] Lib. 2. Epist. 281. Item Gregor. Nissen. de Sancto Stephan; Gratiâ Spiritus sancti permixtus est & contem∣peratus. Isidore Pleusiota of the word

Of the participation of the bread of Idolaters, with the participation of the Sacramen∣tall bread of the Lords Supper; Primas. in 1. Cor. 10. Sicut Salvator dixit [Qui mandu∣cat meam carnem, manet in me]—Sic Idolorum panis Daemonum partici∣patioest. Et ut multi de uno pane partici∣pantes unum corpus sumus: sic si de o∣dem pane manduca∣mus, vnde Idolola∣trae, unum cum illis Corpus efficimur. That as by the one Christians are made partakers of Christ's flesh, so by that other are men made par∣takers with Divels. So Primasius. Wherefore your Disputers, by comparing these Sentences of the Fathers with the former, if they shall take them as spoken properly, and not Sacramentally and figuratively, shall be com∣pelled to allow proper Commixtures and nourishings of man's Soule, by the Word. First, a proper mingling of God's Spirit with Man. Secondly, a proper incorporating of Man into Christ; and a proper mixture of Man with Divels. And againe upon due Comparison of the Testimonies of Fathers, obiected by you, with these now alleadged by us concerning the Eucha∣rist it selfe, it will necessarily follow, that by the same reason, wherewith you have sought to prove one kind of proper Presence of Christ's bodie, and Transubstantiation, and Vnion; you Augustin. Consess. lib. 7. cap. 10. Mandu∣cabis me, Tu me in te mutabis, & tu muta∣beris in me▪ Theophy∣lact. in Ioh. 6. Qui mā∣ducat me vivet prop∣ter me, & quod am∣modo miscetur mihi.

[Primasiu his Testimony i at the letter (i) immediately going before. must allow fower more. One of Christs bodie into the bodie of the Communicant: a Second of a Christian Communicant into Christs bodie. A Third of a Naturall bodily Vnion of Christians among themselves. And fourthly (which is Damascen's) of Christ's bodie into men's soules. All which kind of Presences, Vnions, Mixtures, and Transubstantiations, taken in a proper sence, you cannot but condemne as Atheologicall and sencelesse, in your owne iudge∣ment, notwithstanding all the former alleaged Phrases of ancient In Liturg. . And Concil. Nicen. Can. 13. Si quis egreditur de Corpore, ultimo & necessario viatico non privetur &c. Aquin as part. 3. qust. 73. Art. 4.

And what talke you of the Eucharist, as being called the Viati∣cum, and food-provision for our iourneying through death, by the ancient Fathers? as though this were an Argument of Christs Corporall Presence in the Sacrament, and Coniunction with them that participate thereof; except you meant to make the same Consequence in behalfe of Baptisme, wherewith Basil. Exhort. ad Baptismum▪ de Baptismo sic moe Inveem: . Nazia, Orat. 0. de Baptismo, vult Morientem  Teste C. in Baronium 16. cap. 52. Basil exhor∣teth both young and old to be provided, as of their Spirituall Viaticum.
That the obiected Testimonies of Ancient Fathers make against the Romish Corporall Vnion of Christ's Bodie with the Bodies of the Commu∣nicants. SECT. IV. YOur Romish Corporall Vnion is distinguished from the Corpo∣rall Vnion spoken of the Fathers, by two Properties, which are universally beleeved in your Church: one is the note of the dis∣continuance of the Bodie of Christ, saying that See above C. 7. §. 1. at (c) and (d.) The Body of Christ continueth no longer in the Body of the Communicant, than whilest the outward formes of Bread and Wine do remaine uncorrupt, The other is the note of Community, beleeving that The Corporall Coniunction with the Communicant is equally as common to the prophane and godly Receiver, as are the outward Symbols, and Signes, which they Sacramentally Eate or Drinke. Such are these your two Principles, concerning Corporall Coniunction, both which are notably contradicted by two contrarie notes of Corporall Coniunction, spoken of by the Fathers. The first is of the Perpe∣tuity of Christian Coniunction with Christ, against your Non-resi∣dencie thereof. The Second is of the Peculiarity of this Vnion, (namely) onely unto pious, and faithfull Receivers; and both these by the Testimonies of the obiected Fathers, yea even in the most of your See above §. 3. Cyril. Qui manducat, manet in me: Chri∣stus in nobis habitat. Hil. Manet in nobis. obiected Testimonies themselves. That the Fathers meant by their Corporall Vnion a perpetuall re∣sidence in the Receivers, their owne See above §. 3. Irenaeus, Cyril, Hil. Testimonies above-cited doe declare, noting that it is the Vnion whereof Christ spake, saying, He that eateth me remayneth in me, and dwelleth in me, &c. A Truth so apparent, that your best reputed Iesuite Suarez. Si quis dixeritunionem cor∣poralē durare solùm quamdiu Christi prae∣sentia durat sub spe∣ciebus—ex hoc contra mentem San∣ctorum, Illi enim di∣cunt, illam Vnionem, quâ totum Ecclesiae corp{us} Christo, ut ca∣piti, coniungitur—Et eandm  um a quae  inter ipsos Christianos, ut mem∣bra Christi. Et suam sententiam cōfirmāt ex Testimonio Pauli 1. Cor. 10. [Quoniam unus panis,  cor∣pus mi sumus, qui de uno pane partici∣pamus:] quod probat Sanctos loqui non de transeunte Vnione, sed de durabili & permanente. In Thō. 3. qu 79. Disp 64. §. 3. Ratione etiam. Suarez is inforced to confesse, that The Corporall▪ Vnion, spoken of by the holy Fathers, is not Trasient and Passable, but permanent and durable: which hee proveth both from their expresse words, and also by the ground of their Speech, which is the Doctrine of Saint Paul, 1. Cor. 10. For we being many are one Bread, in as much as we are partakers of one bread; which are spoken of a permanent Vnion of Christians, as they are members of Christ. As for the second note of Vnion, professed by holy Fathers, we have already See above Chap. 2. Sect. 2. learned from this their generall Doctrine, that the Godly onely are truly Partakers of the flesh of Christ. And that our Vnion with Christ, by virtue of this Sacrament, is proper to the Godly and Faithfull, is now further confirmed by the Testimonies See above §. 3. obiected. Some expressing the Vnion to be such whereby Christ abideth in us, and we in him, as you have heard: and some, that who∣soever hath it, hath spirituall life by it; whereas They who eate
the Bread of iniquity, doe not eate the flesh of Iesus, nor drinke his Blood, saith Hieron. Come∣dentes cibos impie∣tatis, non comedūt carnem Iesu, nec bi∣bunt eius sanguinem In Isa. c. 66. Hierome; whereas your Popish Vnion is Suarez. Haec V∣nio cōmunis est pec∣catorib{us} indignè mā∣ducātibus. Quo suprà §. Tota haec. common to both. For, indeed, what is it for Christ his Body to be receiued of the wicked, but, as it were, to have him buried in a grave a∣gaine? And to feed the ungodly with such precious food, is like as if a man should put meate into the mouth of a dead Carkasse. The former Assertion being so generally the Doctrine of primi∣tive Fathers, it is, in it selfe, a full and absolute Confutation of the Romish Defence, throughout the whole Controversie, touching the Corporall Vnion with the Body of Christ, as properly so taken. Have not then your Disputers, in urging the iudgement of holy Fa∣thers, spun a faire thred, trow yee, whereby they have thus evi∣dently strangled their whole Cause? A Determination of this point in question. I. That the former obiected Sentences of Fathers, concerning Corporall Vnion, are Sacramentally and Spiritual∣ly to be understood, as proper to the Godly and Faithfull Receiver. SECT. V. HOwsoever the sound of their words have seemed unto some of you, to teach a proper Corporall Vnion with the Bodies of the Communicants, yet the Reasons wherewith the said Senten∣ces are invested doe plainly declare, they meant thereby a Spiritu∣all Vnion onely; first and principally, because they ground their sayings upon that of Saint Iohn, Ioh. 6. He that eateth my flesh abideth in me, and hath life, and I will raise him up at the last day: He dwelleth in me, and I in him, which many of your owne Doctours have See above. expounded to be taken spiritually, as doth also your Bishop Iansnius Con∣cord. in Ioh, 6. spar∣sim Dominus non lo∣quitur de manduca∣tione sacramental, sed de spirituali, quae est per idē non mor∣tuam—per mandu∣care significat crede∣re, & non secundùm primariam intentio∣nem, sed de Sacra∣mētali loquutum esse probatur, 1. quiasupra manducare pro cre∣dere sumpsit. 2. tan∣tùm manducātes in∣telligit cos, qui ma∣nent in Christo, & Christus in illis—Certè ita docet Au∣gust. l. 3. de Doctrina Christ. c. 16. [Nisi manducaveritis] fa∣cinus vel flagitium videtur iubere, figura est praecipiens Passi∣oni Domini esse com∣municandum. Iansenius, out of Augustine. Secondly, because they make the Vnion perpetuall to the Receiver. Thirdly, because they hold this Vnion proper to the spirituall Communicant, excluding the pro∣phane from any reall participation of Christs flesh. Fourthly, be∣cause they taught the same Vnion, whereof they speake, to be made without this Sacrament, even by See above §. 3. Baptisme; and that Really, as your Iesuite Tolet hath said. Fiftly, because they have compared this Vnion to the continued-Vnion betweene Man and Wife. Good and solid Reasons, we thinke, to perswade any reasonable man that they meant no proper Corporall Vnion. Whereby, peradventure, your Iesuite Tolet was See above §. 3. induced to grant, that Hilarie and Cyril, by the Corporall Vnion of Christ's Bodie with ours, meant the Vnion by Faith and Charitie. As also, whereas Damascene saith, That by this Communion wee are made ioynt-bodies
with Christ. And lastly, Cyril of Ierusalem calleth the Communi∣cants, by reason of their participation of the Bodie and Blood of Christ, Christophers, that is (being interpreted) Carriers of Christ; and that hereby we are made partakers of that divine nature: a Sen∣tence much urged by your Disputers, notwithstanding your Suarez. Damasc. lib. 4. cap. 14. Hoc sa∣cramento—nos Christi concorporei existimus;—& ani∣mo & voluntate co∣pulamur. Cyril. Hierosol Catechis. 4. Mystag. sumpto corpore & sanguine Christi efficimur comparticipes cor∣poris & sanguinis, —cum eius sanguinem & corpus intramembra nostra receperimus, atque ità (ut B. Petrus dicit) divinae naturae consortes efficimur. Hinc Suarez. Vbi propter Sacramentalem susceptionem non agnoscit altam Vnionem praeter spiritualem per gratiam &c. n 3. Tom. qu. 79. Disp. 64. Sect. 3. §. Nihilominus. Sua∣rez seeth nothing in it but a Spirituall Vion by Grace and Affecti∣on. Which two Testimonies we may adde to the former Fathers, for proofe that onely the Godly have Vnion with Christ. II. That the obiected Ancient Fathers, without Contradiction to themselves, have both affirmed and denied a Cor∣porall and perpetuall Vnion of Christ's Bo∣die with the Bodies of the Com∣municants. SECT. VI. THree acceptions there may be of the word Corporall Vnion, the first Literall, and proper, which this whole Booke proveth out of the Fathers to be Capernaiticall, by Corporall Touching, Corpo∣rall Tearing with Teeth, Corporall Swallowing and Devouring, and Corporall mixture with our flesh; a sence seeming pernicious to Origen; and to Augustine odious and flagitious, as See above Chap. 6. Sect. 3. in the Chall. hath beene proved. The second is a Corporall Coniunction Sacramentall: that as they called Bread broken the Bodie of Christ, by reason of the Sacramentall Analogie with his Bodie Crucified (as hath beene plentifully demonstrated:) so have they called the Sacrament all Vnion with our Bodies the Corporall Vnion of his Body with ours; namely, that as the Bread is eaten, swallowed, disgested by vs, and incorporated into our Bodies, to the preservation of this life, so, by the virtue of Christ's humanity dying, and rising againe for us, our Bodies shall be restored to life in that day. In which re∣spect Bread the Sacrament of Christ's Body, being so changed into the Substance of our flesh, is in us a perpetuall pledge of our Resurrection to glory. The last is a Spirituall Vnion, that as the Body of Christ is im∣mediately foode of the Soule onely, so is the Vnion thereof im∣mediately wrought in the Soule; and because, in Christian Phi∣losophy, the Body followeth the Condition of the Soule, according to the tenour of Iudgement used in the last day, when as the vn∣godly Soule shall take unto it selfe it's owne sinfull Body, and car∣rie it into Hell, and the regenerate Soule shall returne to it's owne
Bodie, and being united thereunto be ioyntly raised to immortali∣tie and blisse, and all this by our Spirituall and Sacramentall (for they are not divided in the Godly) Communicating of the Bodie and Blood of Christ. This ought not to seeme unto you any novell Doctrine, having heard it professed by your Iesuite, in your publique Schooles, saying; Suarez. Glori corpori respondet gloriae animae, sicut beartrudo animae re∣spondet gratiae & Charitati: ut sicut hoc Sacramentum neque haber neque habere potest aliam efficaciam circa glo∣riam animae praeter cam quam habet cir∣ca gratiam & chari∣tatem, ita neque ali∣ter potest efficere gloriam corporis, quā gloriam animae. Con∣cludit. Hoc Sacramé∣tum non aliam con∣ferre vitam & im∣mortalitatem corpo∣ris, quàm nutriendo & cōservando gratiā & charitatem. In 3. Thom. qu. 79. Disp. 64. §. 2. The glory of the Bodie depends on the glorie of the soule, and the Happinesse of the soule depends on Grace therein, neither doth this Sacrament (saith he) any otherwise conferre immortalitie to the Bodie, than by nourishing and preserving grace in the soule. So hee. In which respect wee concurre with the iudgement of ancient Concil. Nicen. Hoc Sacramentum Sym∣bolū Resurrectionis. Ignatius; Pharmacum immortalitatis. Cyril. Cib{us} nutriens ad im∣mortalitatem. Teste Suarez Ies. ibid. And Irenaeus contra Haeres∣lib. 4. cap. 34. Corpora nostra participantia Eucharistiā ia non sunt corruptibilia, spem resurrections habentia. Fathers, who call this Sacrament the Symbol and Token of the Resurrection, the Medicine of Immortality, by which our verie bodies have hope of Immortality. So they. Yea and (which is a further Evidence) as your obiected Optatus Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch c. 7. ex Optato. Optatus vocat Eu∣charistiam Pignus sa∣lutis, tutelam fidei, & spem resurrectionis. called the Eucharist, The pledge of Salvation, and hope of the Resurrection: so doth Basil. Exhort. ad Baptis. Baptismus est virtus ad resurrectio∣nem, & arabo. Basil speake of Baptisme, tearming it our Strength unto Resurrection (be∣ing a Sacrament both of his death and Resurrection) and the Earnest thereof. Nor can wee desire a more pregnant confutation of your Corporall Presence, than that the Eucharist is called of the Fathers a Pledge, as you have obiected. To this purpose wee are to consult with Primasius; hee telleth vs that Christ dying left us a Primas. in. 1. Cor. 11. Savator Deus exemplum dedit, ut quotiescunque hoc facimus in mente habeamus▪ quòd Christus pro nobis mortuus est, ideo nobis dicitur corpus Christi, ut cum recordati fuerimus, non simus ingrati gratiae eius. Quemadmodum quis moriens relinquat ei, quem diligit, aliquod pignus, quod ille post mortē eius quandocunque viderit, numquid potest lachrymas continere, si perfectè dilexerit? and Coterus the Ie∣suite. See above Booke 4. Chap. 9. §. 5. Pledge for our Memorandum of him after his death: By which Pledge what Christian (as often as hee shall be put in minde of his death) can then containe himselfe from weeping, if he doe perfectly love him? The comparison here is taken from a man, who before his death willeave some thing of worth with his friend, as a Pledge of his love, and a token of his Remembrance of him after his death. But the Pledge and the Pledger are two different things in themselves, and as different in place, the Pledge being a present token of a Friend absent. Nothing now remaineth but some one Father to be Modera∣tor in this Point, and no-one more fit than he, who is as vehement∣ly obiected against us, as any other, namely, Cyprian. de coena Dom. Ad participation emspiritus, non usque ad consubstantialitatem sed usque ad societatem germanissimam.—Nostra & ipsius coniunctio non miscet personas, neque unit substantias, sed affectus consociat, & confderat voluntates. Cyprian; who spea∣king without all Ambages and Hyperboles saith that our Partici∣pation of this Sacrament Worketh not any consubstantiall Vnion: that the Coniunction of Christ with us hath in it no mixture of persons (vz. of Christ and Christians:) that it uniteth not the substances, but ioy∣neth affections, and affianceth our wils. After this, hee elegantly ex∣presseth
the Analogie betweene the Sacramentall, and Spirituall nourishment: Item. Potus & e∣sus ad eandem per∣tinent rationem, qui∣bus sicut corporea nutritur substantia, & vivit, & incolumis perseverat: it à vita Spiritus hoc proprio alimento nutritur: & quod est esca carni, hoc animae est sides, quod ci∣bus corpori est verbum spiritui, excellentiori virtute peragens aeternalitèr, quàm agunt alimenta carnalia tem∣poralitèr. [Idem Cyprian. & alia multa habet contra Carnalem Coniunctionem, deoena Dom. As by Eating and drinking (saith hee) of the bodily substance our Bodies are fed and live: so is the life of the soule nouri∣shed with this food. So he. III. That the former Doctrine of the Fathers is consonant to the Profession of Protestants. SECT. VII. IF you take the Corporall Vnion of Christ's bodie with ours as you doe, by a Bodily Touch, bodily Eating, Swallowing, and Mixture with our bodies, We abhorre this as much as did the Ancient Fa∣thers in these their precedent Item's, (to wit) First, Ambrose op∣posing hereunto Christs [Noli me tangere,] Touch me not, which was spoken to Mary. Against your Touch. Secondly, Augustines [Non dentis, sed mentis] Against your proper eating. Thirdly, Theophylact's [We devoure not his flesh.] Against your Swallowing. Fourthly Cyprians [We mingle not persons.] Against your Trans∣mitting him into your Bowels and Entrailes. And, for a further Discoverie of Romish stupidity in your Doctrine of Transubstan∣tiation, the Analogie betweene the Sacrament and Christ, in the Doctrine of Antiquity, is alwayes of the substance of Bread and Wine, with his Bodie and Blood. But we never read in ancient Bookes of your Sacramentall Eating of Accidents, Drinking of Accidents, or being fed and living by Accidents. Wherefore muster you all those Testimonies of Fathers, which speake of the Nourishment, augmentation, and subsistence of our Bodies by the bodie and blood of Christ, and all such Sentences will be so many witnesses of your incredible pervicacie, who seeke to prove an Augmenta∣tion of our bodies, by the bodie and blood of Christ, in the Eu∣charist: and yet professe (according to your owne Romane faith) that as soone as the Formes of Bread and Wine eaten and drunke are corrupted (which you know is done in a very short time) the Bodie and Blood of Christ hath no longer Residence in the bodie of the Communicant.
CHALLENGE. THrice therefore, yea foure-times unconscionable are your Dis∣puters, in obiecting the former sentences of holy Fathers, as teaching a Corporall and Naturall Vnion of Christ's body with the bodies of Christian Communicants, once, because they in true sence, make not at all for your Romish Tenet: next, because they make against it: then because the Corporall Coniunction, though it be of the Bodie of Christ, and Bodies of Christians, in respect of the obiect, yet for the matter and subiect, it is of Sacramentall Bread united with our owne Bodies, in a mysticall relation to the Body of our Redeemer: and lastly, and that principally, because they meant a Spirituall Coniunction properly, and perpetually belonging to the Sanctified Communicants, and herein consonant to the pro∣fession of Protestants. Wherefore primitive and holy Fathers would have stood amazed, and could not have heard, without horrour, of your Corporall Coniunction of Christ his Body in Bo∣xes and Dunghils, in Mawes of Beasts, in Guts of Wormes, Mice and Dgges, as you have taught. Fie, Fie! Tell it not in Gath, nor let it be once heard off in any heathenish Nation to the Blaspheming of the Christian profession, and dishonouring of the broad Seale of the Gospell of Christ, which is the blessed Sa∣crament of his precious Bodie and Blood. Before we can proceed to the next Booke, wee are to remove a rub which lyeth in our way.
CHAP. IX. That the Obiection taken from the slanders of Iewes and Pagans, against Christians, by imputing the guilt of Eating man's flesh, unto them, in re∣ceiving of the Sacrament, is but ig∣norantly and idly urged by your Disputers. SECT. I. MAny leaves are spent by Maister Breely in his Liturgie Tract. 2. §. 2 subd. 4: pag. 121. where, in his margent, hee citeth Vadian, whom hee na meth a Zwinglian: And if so, how farre hee was from confessing a cor∣porall presence, the Romish Authours, who condemne him for the contrarie opinion, doe proue to be false. See aboue Cap. 5. §. 3. Master Brereley in pressing this Obiection; the strength of his inforcement stan∣deth thus. Iustine Martyr, in the yeare 130. writing an Apologie to the heathen Emperour, when hee was in Discourse of the Eucharist (The reported Doctrine whereof, concerning the reall Presence, was the true and confessed Cause of this slander) and, when he should have removed the suspi∣tion thereof, did notwithstanding call the Eucharist, No common Bread, but, after Consecration, the food wherewith our Flesh and Blood are fed, &c. Then he proceedeth in urging his other Ar∣gument, borrowed from the Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 4. Cardinall, to wit, Iustine his com∣paring the change in the Eucharist to be a worke of Omnipoten∣cie, and for his not expounding the words of Christ figuratively. Then is brought in In the Margent of Master Brerely ibid. Attalus the Martyr, whilst he was under the tortures, and torments of his Persecutors, saying, Behold your doing, [Hoc est homines devorare,] This is a devouring of men: We Christians doe not devoure men. To whom is ioyned Tertullian, ma∣king mention of the same slander of Sacrificing a Childe, and ea∣ting his flesh, [Ad nostrae doctrinae notam:] To the infamie of our Pro∣fession. At length Master Brerely concludeth as followeth; So evi∣dently doth this slander, thus given forth by the Iewes, argue sufficient∣ly the doctrine of Reall Presence, and Sacrifice, and for as much as the slander went so generally of all Christians, it is probable that it did not arise from any sort of one or other Christian in particular. So he.
THE FIRST CHALLENGE, Against the Ignorance of the Obiector, and the falfe ground of his Obiection. SECT. II. THe confessed light of History will discouer the mist of Preiu∣dice in our opposites; for Irenaeus, Augustine, and Epiphanius doe all declare, that the ground of this Slander against Christians, for eating man's flesh, was the detestable fact of some Heretiques, who professing themselves Christians, notwithstanding in Celebra∣tion of the Eucharist, did indeed eate man's flesh, as your Iesuite Maldonat. Mon∣tanistae Peputiani (ut Author est August. lib. de Haeres. cap. 17. Et Epiph. in Haeres. 49.) Infantem con∣spersum farinâ sole∣bant compungere, & sanguinem ab illa ex∣pressum miscere fati∣nâ, & ex eo panē cō∣ficere ad Euchari∣stiam. Vnde credo natam fuisse illam notam, quam Genti∣les inurebant Chri∣stianis, quod Infan∣tes occiderunt. Lib. de 7. Sacrā. Tom. de Euch. §. Sexta Quaestio. Mal∣donate, and Cardinall Baronius.

Sic iam, de initiandis tyronibus, fabula tàm detestanda quam nota est &c. Hac Baronius locis supra notatis. Baronius doe both witnesse. The former of these fixing a Credo upon it, against your obiected [Probabile] to the contrarie. Againe, looke but into the Testimones, as they are alleaged by the Obiector, and recorded in the Histories themselves, and it is found, that, that Slander raised against Christians, was alwayes for eating the flesh of a Child, or Infant, as their Eucharist, and there∣fore could not reflect upon any Christian and Sacramentall com∣municating of Christ his flesh in the Eucharist, wherein the Bodie represented (according to our Christian profession) is not of a Child, but of a man of more than thirty yeares of age. I say it could no more reflct on them than that other heathenish Gretzerus Jesuita de cruce lib. 1. cap. 51. Ethinci aliqui mentiebantur Christianos Asinum pro Deo colere, Tert. Apolog cap. 16. alij Asini caput, & per Iudibrium Chri∣stiani appellabantur Asinarij &c. Lie, that Christians did worship an Asse or Asses head for their God. So childish∣ly hath your Priest vaunted, in calling his Obiection An evident Argument, which will afterwards Booke. 6. Cha. 9. §. 2. be encountred with an Argu∣ment against your Romish Sacrifice from the Answere of Cyril of Alexandria unto the Emperour Iulian the Apostate, in defence of Christian Religion, farre more Evident than yours was from the Apologie of Iustine to the other Infidell Emperour.
A SECOND CHALLENGE, Against the Insufficiencie of the Reasons collected out of Iustine. SECT. III. THe Bellar. supra. Consequences deduced out of Iustine Martyr have beene answered in effect alreadie. First, Hee calleth the Eu∣charist Not common Bread, and so doth every Christian speake of every sacred and consecrated thing: you Papists will be of∣fended to heare even your Holy Water (no Sacrament) to be called Common-water. Secondly, Iustine said, As Christ was made flesh by incarnation, so is the Eucharist by Prayer. It were an Iniurie to Iustine, for any man to thinke him so absurd, as, dealing with an Infidell, to prove unto him one obscure my∣sterie of Christianitie by another; And the calling of the Eucha∣rist Flesh Sacramentally, as being a Signe of Flesh, could be no mat∣ter of Scandall to the Pagans, who themselves, in their Sacramen∣talls, usually called the Signe by the name of the Thing signified, one instance whereof you have heard out of Homer, calling the Lambe sacrificed, (whereby they swore for Ratification of their Covenants) their faithfull oathes. Againe, the generall Profession of Christians, so well knowne to beleeve that Christ once cru∣cified, ac cording to the Christian Creed, set at the right hand of God, in highest Maiestie, might quite free them from all heathenish suspition of Corporall Eating the flesh of Christ. Thirdly, that , that is, The meate blessed by gi∣ving of Thankes, Iustine calleth Christ's flesh, namely, Improper∣ly, which who shall affirme properly, without a Figure (by the Censure of your owne Iesuites) must bee iudged See above Booke 2. Chap. 1. §. 4. Absurde. THE THIRD CHALLENGE, Against the Vnluckinesse of the Obiectors, by their urging that which maketh against them. SECT. IV. FOr, first, they have told us of the Martyr Attalius, that hee upbraided his heathenish persecutors, who put him to death, calling them Devourers of mens flesh, and avouching, in behalfe of all true Christians, that they Devoure not man's flesh; which no Romish Professor at this day can affirme; this
Profession, that you swallow and transmit that flesh of Christ into the stomacke; this having beene confessed by your owne Iesuite to be a Devouring. So that the Doctrine of that primitive Age (as you now see) was as different from your Romish Noveltie, as are Corporall, and not Corporall Eating of the same Bodie of Christ. Finally, All our premised Sections, throughout this Fift Booke, doe clearely make up this Conclusion, that the Bo∣die of Christ, which Protestants doe feed upon, as their soules food, is the Bodie of Christ once Crucified, and now sitting in glorious maiestie in Heaven: and that Bodie of Christ, beleeved by you, is of Corporall Eating, in deed and in truth of Bread (as hath beene proued, and will be further discovered in a generall See hereafter in the Eight Booke. Synopsis.) Wherefore let every Christian studie with syncere conscience To eate the flesh of Christ with a spirituall appetite, as his Soules food, thereby to have a Spirituall Vnion with him pro∣per to the Faithfull; not subiect to Vomitings, or Corruption, and not common to wicked men, and vile beasts, but alwayes working to the salvation of the true Receiver: so shall he abhorre all your Capernatticall fancies. Thus much of the Romish Consequence concerning Vnion; the next toucheth the Sacrificing of the Body of Christ, whereunto we proceed, not doubting but that we shall find your Dis∣puters the same men, as hitherto wee have done, per∣emptorie in their Assertions, Vnconscionable in wresting of the Fathers, and vaine, fan∣tasticall, and absurd in their Inferences and Con∣clusions.
THE SIXTH BOOKE, Entreating of the fourth Romish Consequence, which concerneth the pretended proper Propitiatorie Sa∣crifice in the Romish Masse, arising from the depraved Sence of the former words of Christ; [THIS IS MY BODY:] and confuted by the true Sense of the words following, [IN REMEMBRANCE OF MEE.] The State of the Controversie. WHosoever shall deny it (say your Fathers of Si quis dixerit, non offerri Deo ve∣rum & proprium Sa∣crificium, aut non esse Propitiatorium, Anathema fit. Conc. Trid. Sess. 22. Con. 1. & 3. Visibile. cap. 1. Sacramentum verè propitiatorium. cap. 2. Trent) to be a true and proper Sa∣crifice: or that it is Propitiatorie, Let him be Anathema, or Accursed. Which one Canon hath begot two Controversies (as you Prima Contro∣versia est, sit nè Missa verè & propriè di∣ctum Sacrificium. Se∣cunda, sit nè Propi∣tiatorium. Bellar. Praef. ante Tract. de Missa. know) One, Whether the Sacrifice in the Masse be a proper Sacrifice. 2. Whether it be truly Propitiatorie. Your Trent-Synode hath affirmed both; Protestants deny both; so that, Proper, and Improper, are the distinct Borders of both Controversies. And now whether the Affirmers or Denyers, that is, the Cursers, or the parties so Cursed deserve rather the Curse of God, we are forthwith to examine. We begin with the Sacri∣fice, as it is called Proper. This Examination hath foure Trials: 1. By the Scripture. 2. By the Iudgement of Antient Fathers. 3. By Romish Principles; and 4. By Comparison betweene this your Masse, and the Protestants Sacrifice, in the Celebration of the holy Eucharist.
CHAP. I. Our Examination by Scripture. SCriptures alleaged by your Disputers, for proofe of a Proper Sacrifice, are partly out of the new Testa∣ment, and partly out of the old. In the new, some Objections are collected out of the Gospell of Christ, and some out of other places. Wee begin∣ning at the Gospell, assuredly affirme that if there were in it any note of a Proper Sacrifice, it must necessarily appeare either from some speciall word, or else from some Sacrificing Act of Christ, at the first Institution. First of Christs words. That there is no one word, in Christ his first Institution, which can probably inferre a Proper Sacrifice; not the first and principall words of Luc. 22. [HOC FACITF: DOE THIS.] SECT. I. WHen we call upon you for a Proofe, by the words of Christ, wee exact not the verie word Offering, or Sacrifice, in the same Syllables, but shall bee content with any Phrase of equiva∣lencie, amounting to the sense or meaning of a Sacrifice. In the first place you object those words of Christ, [Hoc facite, Doe this,] from which your Councell of [Hoc facite] Tunc, ut à Sancta Sy∣nodo definitum est, Christus Sacerdotes instituit, praecepit{que} ut & ipsi & qui suc∣cessuri cis essent, cor∣pus ejus immolarent. Catechis. Trid. de Euch. num. 58. Trent hath collected the Sacrifi∣cing of the Body of Christ: which your Cardinall avoucheth with his Certum est, pro∣bari Sacrificium Mis∣sae his verbis [Hoc fa∣cite] &c. Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 12. Certum est, as a Truth without all exception; as if [Doe this,] in the literall sense, were all one with [Doe you Sacrifice.] But why? because, forsooth, the same word in the Hebrew Originall, and in the Greeke Translation is so used, Levit. 15. for Doe, or Make, spoken of the Turtle-dove prepared for an Holocaust, or Sacrifice: and 1 Kings 18. 23. where Elias (speaking of the Priests of Baal, and telling them that he meant to have a Sacrifice,) said, Doe, or Make. So he, together with some other Iesuites. But vainely, ri∣diculously, and injuriously. I. Vainely, because the word, Doe, in those Scriptures did not simply in it selfe import a Sacrifice, but only consequently (to wit) by reason of the matter subject then spoken of, which was a mat∣ter of Sacrifice: and are so explaned by just circumstances, as may appeare in the places objected, Levit. 15. where was speech of a Turtle-dove appointed for a Sacrifice. And so likewise in 1. Kings 18. 23. was there mention of a Bullocke to be ordained for a Sacrifice. Whosoever, having spoken of his Riding, shall com∣mand one servant, saying, Make ready: and after, being an hun∣grie,
and having spoken of meat, shall command another, saying likewise, Make ready, None can bee so simple as to confound the different sences of the same word Make, but knoweth right well that the Significations are to bee distinguished by the different subjects of Speech; the first relating to his horse, and the other to his meat, and the like, wherein the different Circumstances doe di∣versifie the sence of the same word. II. Ridiculously. For if the Hebrew and Greeke Gnaschah, Heb: the same in Greeke, , in Latine, Fa∣cio. Iud. 6. 29. Ios. 5. vers. ult. Ioh. 13. 7. , and Marc. 11. 3. Si quis dixerit, ; Editions, which signifie Doe this, doe necessarily argue a sacrificing act or Sacrifice, then shall you be compelled to admit of strange and od kindes of Sacrifices; one in Gedeon his destroying of the Altar of Baal: another in Moses his Putting off of his shooes. A third in Christs washing of his Disciples feet. A fourth (to goe no further) in the Mans Loosing of his Colt. In all which Instances there are the same originall words now objected, by interpretation, Doe, or Make. III. Injuriously. First, to the Text of Christ, wherein the word is not indefinite, Doe, but determinate, [Doe this.] Next, Injurious to your owne many Authors: for the words, [Doe this] (by the See above Booke 5. Chap. 2. §. 2. confessions of your owne Iesuites and others) have refe∣rence to all the former Acts of Christ his Celebration, then spe∣cified; as namely, Blessing, Breaking, Eating, &c. Yea and, if your Cardinalls Answer were held so Certaine among your selves, then would not your Iesuite Maldonate have so farre slighted it, as to say, Maldon. Non quòd contendam il∣lud verbum [Facite] illo loco significare idem quod sacrifica∣re. Lib. 7. de Sacram. Tom. 1. part. 3. de Eu∣charist. I will not contend, that in this place the word [Doe] signifieth the same with, Doe sacrifice. Next, Injurious to antiqui∣tie, which (as is confessed) Quod olim dici∣mus, Missas facere, Veteres quo{que} dixe∣runt Divine mysteria celebrare. Hilar. &c. Ex Cassand. Liturg. cap. 16. called Doing Masse the Celebration of the Sacrament. Besides, Injurious to your owne Masse, in the Ca∣non inserted by Alexander Papa & Martyr, Passionem Domini inserens Ca∣noni Missae, ait, [Hoc quotie scunque fece∣ritis,] Id est, Bene∣dixeritis, Fregeritis, Distribueritis, &c. Id. Cassander ibid. cap. 9. Alexander Pope and Martyr, of the Primitive age, in these words; [Doe this as often] that is, Blesse it, Breake it, Distribute it, &c. A plaine and direct Interpretation of the words [Doe this.] Lastly, Injurious to S. Paul, who, in his Comment upon the words of Christ his Institution, doth put the matter out of question, 1. Cor. 11. where, after the words [Doe this, as often as you doe it, in remembrance of mee,] vers. 25. immediately ex∣pounding what was meant by Doing, expresseth the Acts of Doing, thus: As often as you shall eat this Bread, and drinke this Cup, &c. Which his Command of Doing, by Eating and Drinking, was spoken generally to all the faithfull in Corinth; that you may not imagine it was wholly restrained to the sacrificing Priests. Other Romish Doctors also, if they had beene so sure of the force of the word [FACITE,] as your Cardinall seemeth to be, then surely would they not have sought to prove it from Virgils Calfe, where it is said; Cùm faciam Vitulâ—and were there∣fore noted by Calvin and Chemnitius of bold Ignorance. But these two Protestants, for so saying, have beene since branded by your Operae-pretium erit imposturam Ad∣versariorum refuta∣re. Calvinus fingit Catholicos irà pro∣bare Propositionem nostri argumenti ex Virgilii verbis, Cùm faciam vitula, &c.  Kemnitius ridet Ca∣tholicos.—sed er∣rant, nec bon fide referunt argumenta Catholicorum. Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, c. 12. Cardinall with a marke of Imposture, as if they had falsly taxed
your Romish Authors of such fondnesse. But now what shall wee say to such a Gnostick, who, as though he had knowen what all the Doctors in the Church of Rome had then written and ented, durst thus engage his word for everie one? It may bee, hee presu∣med, that none of them could bee so absurd. But your Iansenius will quit the report of Calvine and Chemnitius from the suspicion of Falshood, who witnesseth, concerning some Romish Authors of his time, saing; Sunt qui ex ver∣bo [Facite] Sacrifi∣cium ostendere co∣antur, quia alquan∣dò accipitur pro Sa∣crificare, ut cum Vir∣gilius dicit—Cùm faciam vitula pro fru∣gibus ipse venio. Ianse. oncord▪ in eum locum. cap. 31. p. 904. There are some who endeavour to prove the word [Facere] to be put for [Sacrificare] by that saying of Virgil,—Cùm faciam vitula. So he. And why might not they have beene as absurd, as some others that came after, yea (by your leave) Et Poeta, Cum faciam vitulâ, &c. Va∣lent. Ies. lib. 1. de Sacrif. Missae, c. 4. §. Faten∣tur. p. 519. Eam vim habet verbū Facien∣di, ut cum Poeta di∣cit, Cùm faciam Vi∣tulâ, &c. Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 27. pag. 205. §. Septimo. Ie∣suites themselves, of your Bellarmines owne Societie, who in like manner have consulted with the Poet Virgil about his Calfe; but as wisely (according to our Proverb) as Walton's Calfe, which went &c. For the matter subject of the Poets Sacrifice is there expres∣sed to have beene Vitula, a Calfe. You have failed in your first Objection. That a Proper Sacrifice cannot be collected out of any of these words of Christs Institution; Is GIVEN, Is BROKEN, Is SHED. SECT. II. THe Text is Luc. 22. 20. [Which Is broken, Is given, Is shed] in the Present Tense; and This Is the Cup of the new Testament in my Bloud; wherein, according to the Greeke, there is a varying of the Case: whereupon your Disputers, as if they had cried , are commonly more Instant in this Objection than in any other: some of them spending eight full leaves in pressing this Text, by two Arguments, one in respect of the Case, and another in regard of the Time. Of the Grammar point, concerning the Case. This is the new Testament in my Bloud:] Now what of this? Bellarm. de Missa, lib. 1. cap. 1, 2. In Grae∣co Textu , dicit, Calix qui fun∣ditur, non hic est san∣guis qui funditur: itaque indicant san∣guem fundi, ut erat in Calice. It is not said (saith your Cardinall) This is the Blood shed for you, but, This is the Cup shed for you: Therefore is hereby meant The Bloud, which was in the Chalice, because wine could not be said to bee shed for us for remission of sinnes. But how gather you this? Because in the . Greeke (saith M. M. Breely Liturg. tra. 3. c. 3. subd. 2. Breerly)  varieth the Case from the word [Sanguine,] and the Genus from the word [Testamentum,] and agreeth evidently with Calix: which drive Beza unto a strange An∣swer, saying that this is a Soloe cophanes, or Incongruitie of speech. So he; which Objection he learned, peradventure, of the Rhemists A. upon Luc. 22. 20. Rhemists, who are vehement in pressing the same; their Conclusion is: This proveth the Sacrifice of Christ's Blood in the Chalice. In which one Collection they labour upon many ignorances. 1. As if a Soloe co∣phanes
were a prophanation of Scripture by Incongruitie of speech; which (as one Rodolph. Goclenius Professor Marpurg. Pro∣blem. Gram. lib. 5. De∣mosthenes. —pro . Cic. 2. de Orat. Benedicere au∣tem, quod est peritè loqui, non habet defi∣nitā aliquā regionē, cujus terminis septa teneatur. Vox [Sep∣ta] non congruit cum  Benedicere, sed referenda est ad vo∣cem Eloquentiae. Hee observeth the like in Plato, Virgil, Homer, pag. 232, 233, 261, 262. Protestant hath proved) is used as an Elegancie of speech by the two Princes of Orators, Demosthenes for the Greeke, and Tully for the Latine; and by the two Parents of Poets, among the Greekes Homer, and by Virgil among the La∣tines. 2. As though these our Adversaries were fit men to upbraid Beza with one Soloecophanes, which is but a Seeming Incongruitie, like a Seeming Limping, who themselves confesse Sixtus Sensis Biblioth. lib. 8. pag. ult. Nos ingenuè fa nonnullas mendas in hac nostra editione inveniri, etiam Soloe∣cismos, & Barbaris∣mos, hyperbata, &c. Ingeniously that in their Vulgar Latine Translation (which is decreed by the Councell of Trent to be Authenticall) there are meere Solecismes, and Barbarismes, and other faults, which wee may call, in point of Grammar, down right halting. 3. As if a Truth might not be deli∣vered in a Barbarous speech, or that this could be denied by them, who defend Solecismes, and Barbarismes, which had crept into the Translation of Scriptures, saying that Rhemists Preface before the New Testa∣ment. Ancient Fathers, and Do∣ctors have had such a religious care of former Translations, that they would not change their Babarismes of the Vulgar Latine Text, [as nubent, & nubentur] and the like. 4. As if there were not the like Soloecophanes of Relatives not agreeing with their Antece∣dents in case, whereof you have received from D. Fulke against Greg. Martin. D. Fulke divers Apoc. 1. 4. & 8. 9. & 3. 12. &c. Examples. 5. As if this Soloecophanes now objected were not justifiable, which is defended by the Myrrour of Grammarians Ioseph. Scaligeri No∣tae in novum Testamen∣tum. Luc. 22. 20. : Mera est An∣tiptosis, pro, . Ioseph Scaliger by a figure Antiptôsis, and explaned anciently by . Basil. Reg. Moral. 21. Basil a perfect Greeke Father: referring the Participle [Shed] unto the word Blood, and not unto the Chalice; which marreth your Market quite. And that this is an undeniable Truth, will appeare in our Answer to the next Objection of Time; for if by Given, Broken, and Shed is meant the time future, then these words Shed for you, for remission of sinnes, flatly conclude that hereby is not meant any proper Sacrifice of Christs Blood in the Cup, but on the Crosse. Let us proceed therefore to that point. Of the Time signified by the Participles Given, Broken, Shed. These words being of the Present time, Therefore it plainly follow∣eth that Breaking, Giving Christ's Body, and shedding his Blood is in the Supper, and not on the Crosse: So your Bellarm. lib. 1. de Miss. cap. 12. Datur, Frangitur, Funditur, in Praesenti tempore, docet apertissimè nō fusum esse in Cruc sanguinem, sed in Coena. Cardinall: most invin∣cibly say your Rhemists upon Luc. 22. 20. Rhemists, and M. Breerly, as dancing merily after their Pipes; M. Breerly, Liturg. Tract. 3. §. 3. subd. 1. p. 319. This point (saith hee) is cleerely determined by the Evangelists themselves in their owne origin all writings, Broken, Gi∣ven, Shed. And Ibid. subd. 3. p. 319. The Evasions, which our Adversaries seeke, whereby to avoid this, are enforced, racked, and miserable shifts. And againe, for corroboration sake. Ibid. subd. 1. p. 317. The word Broken also, spoken in regard of the outward formes, which are in time of Sacrificing, is more forcible, because not meant of the Crosse: for when they saw hee was dead, fulfilling the Prophecie [A Bone of him shall not be Broken]
they brake not his legs. Ioh. 19. 33. So hee, and so they. Alas! what huge Anakims, and Gyants have wee to deale withall, no Argument can proceed from them but most Evident, Forcible, and Invincible; yet may we not despaire of due Resistance, especially being supported by your owne Brethren, as well the Sonnes of Anak, as were the other: besides some better aid both from Fa∣thers, and Scriptures, for proofe that these words Broken, Given, Shed, spoken in the Present time, doe signifie the Future time of Christs Body being Broken, and Bloodshed; and both Given up as a Sacrifice instantly after upon the Crosse. What Authors on your side may satisfie you? whether your Two See above. chap. 2. . 4. choyse Iesuites, Salmeron and Valentia? or will you be di∣rected by most voices, whereby it is confessed (namely) that Iansenius referring it to the Cup, yet saith: [Qui effunditur] communiter intelli∣gitur de effusione fa∣ctâ in Cruce, & rectè. Concord. 131. By Blood shed, is commonly understood of it shed upon the Crosse. But what need have wee of the severall members, when as the whole Body of your Romish Church is for us, rendring the word shed, in the Future Tense [Fundetur,] shal be shed, as referred to the Crosse? What thinke you by this? say M. Breerly. Liturg. Tract. 3. §. 3. subd. 1. Our Adversaries are in great straights, when they are glad to appeale from the Originall Greeke Text which they call Authenticall, unto the Latine Vulgar Translation, which they call old, rotten, and full of corruptions. This were well objected, indeed, if that Protestants should alledge your Vulgar Latine Edition, as a purer Translation, and not as a true Translation of the words of the Text▪ to teach you that it is meant of the Future Time: and that this were urged by them, as a ground of Perswasion to themselves, and not rather (as it were by the Law of Armes) an Opposition, and indeed Conviction upon their Adversaries, who, by the Decree of your Councell of Trent, are bound See hereafter Booke . Not to reject it upon any pretence whatsoever. And to have this your owne Authenticall Translation to make against you, is to be in straights indeed, because all the Decrees of that Councell, by the Bull of Pope Pius 4. are put upon you to bee beleeved under the bond of an Oath. Is it possible for you to shake off these shackles? Yes, M. Breerly can, by an admirable Tricke of wit: Liturg. in the place above cited. Neverthelesse (saith hee) I answer in behalfe of the Vulgar Interpreter, that as hee translateth in the Future Tense, [which shall bee shed] so doth hee use the Present Tense in the other words Given, and Broken, to signifie that it was then given in the Sacrament, and afterwards to bee given upon the Crosse, both together. As if you should tell us in plaine English that your Church in her Vulgar Latine Text doth equivocate, tea∣ching that It shall be shed, in the Future, doth signifie also the Pre∣sent Tense Is shed, that is, It is, shall be. A fit man (forsooth) to inveigh against a Soloecophanes. But how then can Protestants in∣terpret the Present to signifie the Future? Wee tell you, because you have in Scriptures, and other Authors thousands of Examples of the Present Tense put for the Future, to signifie the certaintie or
instancie of that which is spoken: but was it never heard nor read, that the Future Tense was taken for the Present Tense, because there is no Course, nor Progresse to the time past. And if Shed bee ta∣ken not in true sence, then shall it be lawfull for everie pettie Ro∣mish Priest at every Masse-saving to correct your Romish Missall, authorized by the same Tridentine Fathers, which hath it Missale Rom. Ca∣lix Sanguinis—qui effundetur. Shall be shed. One word more with M. Breerly, only desirous to know of him, if hee allow of the Tense either Present or Future, whether it was straightnesse, or loosenesse, that occasioned him to deliver it in the Preterimperfect Tense Liturg. Tract. 3. c. 3. subd. 3. p. 145. Was shed. But he will expect that wee an∣swer his Reason. Hee urged the word, Broken, that because this could not be meant of Broken on the Crosse, for that His Legs were not there Bro∣ken (according as it was prophesied) therefore it must inferre it to have beene Broken at his Supper, when hee uttered the word Bro∣ken; which is like his other manner of Reasons, blunt, and broken at the point, as it became one not much conversant in Scripture: else might he have answered himselfe by another Prophecie, tea∣ching that the word Broken is taken Metaphorically by the Prophet Esay, chap. 53. speaking of the crucifying and Agonies of Christ, and saying, Hee was Broken for our iniquities: (namely, as two of your Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 3. c. 3. p. 90. Frangitur, i. e. Cla∣vis, Lanceâ, Flagellis laniandum est. Barra∣das Tom. 4. in Concord. c. 4. è Chrysost. in 1 Cor. hom. 24. quod fiangi∣tur, hoc est, quod Cla∣vis frangitur. Iesuites acknowledge) By nailes, speare, and whips; and is to be applyed to the Breaking of his sinewes, nerves, and veines, as your Bellarm. Vtcun{que} possit fractio, &c. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 12. §. Ad quartum. Cardinall confesseth. That the words of Christ, [Given, Broken, Shed,] are taken for the Future Time; proved by the same Text of Scripture, and consent of An∣tient Fathers. SECT. III. AS for our selves, we, before all other Reasons, and against all opposition whatsoever, take our light from the same Scrip∣ture (immediately after the Text objected) wherein it is said of Iudas, Luc. 22. 21. He that betrayeth me; and againe, Christ of himselfe, Vers. 22. I goe my way, both in the Present Tense, but both betokening the Fu∣ture: because neither Iudas at that instant practised any thing, nor did Christ move any whit out of his place. Lastly, if ancient Fa∣thers may be held for indifferent and competent Origen. Hom. 9. in Levit. [Effundetur] Teste Bellarm. lib. 2. de Euch. c. 8. Tertull. l. 3. in Marc. [Tradetur] Teste Bellarm. ibid. c. 7. Ambros. lib. 4. de Sa∣cram. c. 5. [Confrin∣getur.] Athanas. in 1 Cor. 11. [Tradetur.] Missa Basilii [Effundetur.] Isidor. Com. in Exod. 1. 50.

Expositors, we have Origen, Tertullian, Athanasius, Basil, Ambrose, Theodoret, Isi∣dore, Pope Alexander, and Chrysostome, All for the Future Tense, by their Confringetur, Tradetur, Effundetur. What, my Masters, is there no learning but under your Romish caps?
That the objected words of Christ, and the whole Text, doe utterly overthrow the pretended Sacrifice in the Romish Masse. SECT. IV. AMong the words of Institution, the first which offereth it selfe to our use, is the formerly-objected word, BROKEN; which word (said your Iesuite See above Book 2. Chap. 2. Suares) is taken unproperly, be∣cause in the proper and exact acception it should signifie a dividing of the body of Christ into parts. So he, and that truly. Else why (wee pray you) is it, that your Roman Church hath left out of her Masse the same word [Broken] used by Christ in the words, which you terme words of Consecration? Although you (peradventure) would be silent, yet your Bishop Ex qua intellige, a verba [Quod pro∣vobis frangitur] non esse ad Consecratio∣nem necessaria: sed consultò à Latinis praetermissa, ne esset locus absurdae intelli∣gentiae, quâ quis exi∣stimare possit verè frangi corpus Christi. Iansen. Concord. cap. 131. in Matth. 26. Iansenius will not forbeare to tell us, that It was left out, lest that any man might conceive so fondly, as to thinke the body of Christ to be truly broken. So hee. It is well. The word, [Shed] is the next, which properly signifieth the is∣suing of blood out of the veines of Christ; But, That Blood of Christ (saith your Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 12. §. Ad secundum. Sanguis Christi reipsa non e∣ de Corpore. Cardinall, speaking of the first Institution) did not passe out of his Body. Even as See above Booke 4. Chap. 2. Sect. 3. Aquinas had said before him. But most emphatically your Alphonsus. Alfosus lib. 6. ad∣versus Haeres. Tit. Eu∣charistia, res. ult. Cum Sanguinem po nobis semel in ara Crucis eusum, post resurrectionem nun∣quam eum fuurus sit: convincitur inde eti∣am, nunquam sangui∣nem verum ils in∣tegrè alicubi ee ine ejus corpore vero.—Sol. Ob. Quamvis sub specie vini totus Christus lateat, non tamen species illae to∣tum Christum signifi∣cant, sed solùm san∣guinem eusum in Cruce, & à corpore separatum. Christ his Bloud was once shed upon the Crosse, never to be shed againe after his resurre∣ction, which cannot be perfectly separated from his Body. And accor∣dingly your Iesuite Coster. Euchirid. cap. 9. de Sacrificio. §. Ex quibus. Christus veram sanguinis effusionem passus in cruce, san∣guine ipso à corpore separato. Hic vero tantum illius mortis repraesentatio. Coster; The true effusion of his Blood, which is by separating it from the Body, was only on the Crosse. So they. Hearken now. These words, Blood shed, and Body broken, were spoken then by Christ, and are now recited by your Priest either in the proper sence of shedding, or they are not. If in a proper sence, then is it properly separated from his Body, (against your former Confession, and Profession of all Christians;) But if it be said to be shed unproperly, then are your Objectors of a proper Sence of Christ his words to be properly called deceitfull Sophisters, as men who speake not from conscience, but for contention: who being defeated in their first skirmish, about Christs words, doe flie for refuge to his Acts, and Deeds; whither wee further pur∣sue them.
That there was no Sacrificing Act in the whole Institution of Christ, which the Romish Church can justly pretend for defence of her Proper Sacrifice; proved by your owne Confessions. SECT. V. THere are six Acts of Christ, which your Proctors, who plead for a proper Sacrifice, do pretend for proofe thereof, as being ascribable to the Institution of Christ, and are as readily and round∣ly confuted by their owne fellowes, as they were by others fre∣quently and diligently fought out, or vehemently objected: which the Marginals will manifest unto you, in everie particular▪ to be no essentiall Acts of a proper Sacrifice. 1. Not Sotus cum ali hanc Elevationem ut Oblationem pertine∣re aliquo modo ad substantiam hujus Sa∣crific existimant.

Some thinke) Is it not of the Essence of a Sacrifice. And why should not they so judge? (say wee,) for many things are Sacrata, that is, Consecrated, which are not Sacrificata, that is, Sacrificed. Else what will you say of Water in Baptisme, yea of your Holy-water-sprinckle? of your Pots, Bells, Vestments? which, be∣ing held by you as Sacred, are notwithstanding not so much as Sa∣cramentals. Besides, if Consecration made the Sacrifice, then Bread being only consecrated, it alone should be the Sacrifice in your Masse. 4.

And for that also (if it were essentiall) the People might be held Sacri∣ficers, aswell as Priests. So they, of these Particulars; whereof some are more largely discussed afterwards. (i) Suarez.

CHALLENGE. COnsider now (wee pray you) that (as you All Tota Essentia Sa∣crificii pendet ex In∣stitutione Christi. Suaz, & Salmeon suprà. confesse) The whole Essence of a Sacrifice dependeth upon the Institution of Christ. And that Non est in pote∣state Ecclesiae insti∣tuere Sacficium. Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 28. p. 19. Idem albi, vde supra at (h) It is not in the power of the Church to ordaine a Sacrifice. Next, that if any Sacrifice had beene instituted, it must have appeared either by some word, or Act of Christ, neither of which can be found, or yet any shaddow thereof. What then (we pray you) can make more both for the justifying of your owne Bi∣shop of Bitontum, who feared not to publish in your Councell of Trent, before all their Father-hoods, Quidam biton∣tinus Episcopus in Conc. Trid. (ut Ca∣nus & Alii reerunt) tentavit defendere, Christum  ncte Coenae non obtulisse Sacrificium. Suarez q. sp. disp. 74. Sect. 2. p. 949. That Christ in his last Sup∣per did not offer up any proper Sacrifice? As also for the condem∣ning of your owne Romish Church for a Sacrilegious Depravati∣on of the Sacrament of Christ? Vpon this their Exigence whi∣ther will they now? To other Scriptures of the new Testament, and then of the old. Out of the new are the two that follow. CHAP. II. That the other objected Scriptures, out of the new Testament, make not for any Proper Sacrifice among Christians, to witt, not Acts 13. 2. of [.] SECT. I. ACTS 13. 2. S. Luke reporting the publike Ministe∣rie, wherein the Apostles with other devout Chri∣stians were ow exercised, saith [,] which two of your Bar in An. 44. nu. 3.

Hac voce Sa∣crificium probaur, quia non significat publicu mus, quia non potest significare ministerium Verbi, aut Sacramentorum, quia haec non exhi∣bentur Deo; at hîc ministrantibus & Do∣mino; & , eum ad sacra accom∣modatur & absolutè ponitur in Scripturis semper accitur pro ministerio Sacrificii. Vt Lu. 1. de Zacharia. Et Cl de Sanctes prf in ssas Graecorum. Cardinalls translate, They sa∣crificing. But why Sacrificing, say we, and not some other ministeriall Function, as preaching, or administring the Sa∣crament, seeing that the words may beare it? They answer us, be∣cause 1. This Ministerie is said to be done To the Lord, so is not Preaching. 2. For that the word [] whensoever it is ap∣plyed to sacred Ministerie and used absolutely, it is alwayes taken for the Act of Sacrificing. So they. When we should have answered this Objection, wee found our selves prevented by one, who for Greeke-learning hath sca had his equall in this our age, name∣ly, that Casabox Exercitt. 16. cap. 41.

Phenix M. Isaac Casaubon. Looke upon the Margent,
where you may finde the word, , to have been used Eccle∣siastically for whatsoever religious ministration, (even for sole Pray∣ing, where there is no note or occasion of Sacrifice) and he instan∣ceth in the Fathers, mentioning the Morning and Evening  of the Church. But you will not say (wee thinke) that there was any proper Evening Sacrifice in use in those times. What can you say for your Cardinall his former lavish asserti∣on, who is thus largely confuted? Nay, how shall you justifie your selves, who are bound by Oath not to gain-say in your Disputati∣ons the Vulgar Latine Translation, which hath rendred the same Greeke words [,] Ministrantibus eis, that is, They ministring, and not, They sacrificing? which might be said as well of preaching, praying, administring the Sacrament; all which (to met with your other Objection) being done according to the will of God, and belonging to his worship and service, might be properly said to have beene done unto God. That the Second objected place out of the new Testament, to witt, 1 Cor. 10. cannot inferre any Proper Sacrifice. SECT. II. 1. Cor. 10. 18. BEhold Israel—are not they who cat of the Sacrifices partakers of the Altar? then vers. 20, 21, 22. But that which the Gentiles offer they offer to Devills, and not unto God, and I would not have you partakers with Devills: yee cannot drinke of the Cup of the Lord, and the cup of Devills: you cannot be partakers of the Table of the Lord, and the table of Devills. Hence Bellarmine; Postremum Ar∣gumentum ex Scrip∣turis habetur, 1 Cor. 10. Ubi primò Men∣sa Domini compara∣tur cum Altari Gen∣tilium. Ergo, Mensa Domini est quoddam Altare, & proinde Eucharistia Sacrifici∣um. 2. Ita vult Sacri∣ficium Deo oblatum in Eucharistia, sicut sunt Sacrificia à Iu∣daeis Deo, vel à Gen∣tilibus Daemonibus suis oblata. 3. Docet ita manducantē Eu∣charistiam partici∣pem esse Altaris Do∣minici, ut manducans Idolothyta particeps rat Altaris Idolo∣rum, per Sacrificia. Ergo Eucharistia est Sacrificium. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 14. Here (saith hee) the Table of the Lord is com∣pared with the Altar of the Gentiles: Therefore is the Table of the Lord certainly an Altar, and therefore it hath a Sacrifice. 2. Because the Eucharist is so offered, as were the Sacrifices of the Iewes. And 3. Because he that eateth the Eucharist is said so to be partaker of the Lord's Altar, as the Heathen of things sacrificed to Idolls are said to be partakers of the Idolls Altar. So hee; following only his owne sence, and not regarding the voyce or judgement of any other. If we should say, in Answer to his first Objection, that your Cardi∣nall wanted his spectacles, in reading of the Text, when hee said that the Apostle compareth the Table of the Lord, whereon the Eu∣charist is placed▪ with the Altar of the Gentiles (which was the Altar of Devills) it were a friendly answer in his behalfe▪ for the words of the Text expressely relate a Comparison of the Table of the Lord with the Table of Gentiles, and Devills; and not with their Altar. And although the Heathen had their Altars, yet (which crosseth all the former Objections) their common Eating of things sacrificed unto Idolls was not upon Altars, but upon Tables, in
feasting and partaking of the Idolothytes, and not in Sacrificing, as did also the Aenaeid. 8. pst Sa∣crificium Aenaeas invi∣tat estad Epulas. Gentiles. The whole scope of the Apostle is to dehort all Christians from communicating with the Heathen in their Idoll Solemnities whatsoever; and the summe of his Argument is, that whosoever is Partaker of any Ceremony, made essentiall to any worship pro∣fessed, hee maketh himselfe a partaker of the profession it selfe, whether it be Christian, vers. 16. or Iewish, vers. 18. or Heathe∣nish and Devillish, vers. 20. And againe; the Apostle's Argu∣ment doth aswell agree with a Religious Table, as with an Altar; with a Sacrament, as with a Sacrifice, and so it seemeth your Aquinas. Non po∣testis Calicem Domi∣ni bibere & Daemo∣niorum ul.] Quo∣ad Sacramentum san∣guinis. Non potestis mensae Domini parti∣cipes esse, quoad Sa∣cramentum corporis, & mensae Daemonio∣rum. In 1 Cor. 10. Aquinas thought, who paraphraseth thus upon the Text; You cannot be partakers of the Table of the Lord, in respect of the Sacrament of the Lords Body, and of the table of Devills. To an Objector, who avoucheth no Father for his Assertion, it may be sufficient for us to oppose, albeit but any one. Primasius therefore, expounding this Scripture, maketh the Comparison to stand thus: See above Booke 5. Chap. 8. Sect. 3. at the letter (i). As our Sa∣viour said; Hee that eateth my flesh abideth in mee, so the eating of the Bread of Idols is to be partakers of the Devills. But this partici∣pation of Devills must needs be spirituall, and not corporall; you know the Consequence. CHAP. III. That no Scripture in the old Testament hath been justly pro∣duced, for proofe of a Proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist. THe Places of Scripture, selected by your Disputers, are partly Typicall, and partly Propheticall. That the first objected Typicall Scripture, concerning Melchi∣sedech, maketh not for proofe of a Proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist. SECT. I. The State of the Question. WEE are loth to trouble you with Dispute about the end of Melchisedech his ministring Bread and Wine to Abraham, and his Company; whether it were as a matter of Sacrifice unto God, or (as Divers have thought) only of refreshing the wearie Souldiers of Abraham; because the Question is brought to be tried by the judgement of such Fathers, who have called it a Sa∣crifice. Wherefore we yeeld unto you the full scope, and suppose (with your Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 6. Cardinall) that the Bread and Wine brought forth had
beene sacrificed by Melchisedech to God, and not as a Sacrifice admi∣nistred by him to his Guests. Now, because whatsoever shal be ob∣jected will concerne either the matter of Sacrifice, or else the Priest-hood & office of the Sacrificer, we are orderly to handle them both. That the Testimonies of the Fathers, for proofe of a Proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist, from the Type of Melchisedech's Sacri∣fice, are Sophistically, and unconscionably objected out of Psalm. 110. and Heb. 5. SECT. II. SOme of the objected Testimonies (See the Bellar. lib. 1. de Mis∣sa, cap. 6. ex Ambro∣sio. Panem & Vinum obtulit. De Sacram. lib. 5. cap. 1. Quod too orbe celebratur. lib. 4. de Sacram. c. 4. & 6. August. lib. 17. de Civit. Dei, cap. 17. & alibi.

Visibile Sacrificium. In his Liturgie, Tract. 3. Margent) com∣paring the Sacrifice of Melchisedech to the Eucharist, in the name of a Sacrifice, doe relate no further than Bread and Wine, cal∣ling these Materials, The Sacrifice of Christians: such are the Te∣stimonies of Ambrose, Augustine, Chrysostome, Theophylact, Ocu∣menius, and Cassiodore, together with two Iewish Rabbins; promi∣sing that at the comming of Christ all Sacrifices should cease, Ex∣cept the Sacrifice of Bread and Wine in the Eucharist. This is your first Collection, for proofe that the Eucharist is a Proper Visible Sacrifice. But first Vnconscionably, knowing and See hereafter Chap. 5. Sect. 1. confessing it to be no better than a Iewish Conceit, to thinke the Bread and Wine to be properly a Sacrifice of the new Testament. Wherefore, to labour to prove a Proper Sacrifice, in that which you know and ac∣knowledge to be no Proper Sacrifice, doe you not blush? How much better had it becomne you to have understood the Fathers to have used the word Sacrifice in a large sence, as it might signifie any sacred ministration, as Isidore doth instruct you? Who, if you aske what it is, which Christans doe now offer after the order of Melchisedech? he will say, that it is Bread and Wine. Isidor. Victimas jam, non qales Judaei, sed quales Melchisedech offerunt credentes: Id est, Panem & Vinum. i. e. corporis & sanguinis Sacramenum. Lib de Vocat. Gent. cap. 26. That is (saith he) the Sacrament of the Body and Blood. Even as Ierome long be∣fore him; Hieron. Epist. ad Evag. Pane & vino sim∣plice, puroque Sacrificio Christo dedicaverit Sacramentum. Melchisedech in Bread and Wine did dedicate the Sacra∣ment of Christ: distinguishing both the Sacrament from a Proper Sacrifice, and naming the thing, that is said in a sort to be offered, Not to be the Body and Blood of Christ, but the Sacrament of both. Your second kinde of objected Sentences of Fathers doe indeed compare the Bread and Wine of Melchisedech with the Body and Blood of Christ in the Eucharist. In this Rancke wee reckon the Cyprian. lib. 2. Epist. 3. ad Cecil. Christus idem quod Melchisedech panem & vium, idem sc. suum Corpus & Sanguinem. Euseb. Caesar. lib. 5. Demonstr. cap. 3. Sacerdotes vno & pane, & Corporis & Sanguinis ejus mysteria repraesentant, quae sanè mysteria Melchi∣sedech tanto ante Sp divino cognoverat. Hieron. Epist. ad Marcell. Melchisedech in Typo Christi Panem & Vinumobtulit, & Mysterium Christianum in Salvators sangume & Corpore dedicavit. Et Quaest. in Genes. Melchisedech oblto pane & vino, i. e. Corpore & Sanguine Domini Jesu. Eucher. Lugdun. lib. 2. c. 18. in Gen. Vt Olationem Panis & Vini, i. e. Corporis & Sanguinis ejus Sacramentum in Sacrificium Christus instr illus [Melchiz.] offerens, panem & vinum, carnem viz. & sanguinem suum. Hc Bellarm. lib. 1. de Mssa, cap. 6. Testimonies of Cyprian, Hierome, Eusebius, and Eucherius, saying
that Melchisedech himselfe offered up the Body and Blood of Christ in this Sacrifice: which Body and Blood of Christ you will All sweare (we dare say) was not the proper Subject matter of the Sa∣crifice of Melchisedech, who performed his Sacrifice many thou∣sands of yeares before our Lord Christ was incarnate in the flesh, to take unto him either Body, or Blood. And therefore could not the Fathers understand, by the Sacrifice of Christ's Body and Blood, any thing but the Type of Christ his Body and Blood; these being then the Object of Melchisedech's faith, as the cited Sentences of Hierome and Eusebius doe declare. Which is a second proofe of the unconscionable dealing of your Disputers, by inforcing Testimo∣nies against common sence. But will you see furthermore the Vnluckinesse of your game, and that three manner of wayes? First, your ordinarie guize is to object the word Sacrifice out of the Fathers, as properly used, whereas your Allegations tell us that they used it in a greater lati∣tude, and at libertie. Secondly, and more principally, whereso∣ever you heare the Fathers naming Bread and Wine the Body and Blood of Christ, ô then behold Transubstantiation of Bread into Christ his Body; and behold it's Corporall presence, and that most evidently! this is your common shout. And yet behold in your owne objected Sentences of Fathers, that which was most really Bread and Wine of Melchisedech, was notwithstanding by the fore-named Fathers called the Body and Blood of Christ: A most evident Argument that the Fathers understood Christ's words, in calling Bread his Body, figuratively. That the Apostle to the Hebrewes, in comparing Melchisedech with Christ, did not intimate any Analogie betweene the Sacrifice of Melchisedech, and of the Body and Blood of Christ in the Eucharist. SECT. III. BVt, Bellarm. Non vi∣detur pose negari, &c. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 6. §. Accdit. you pre-occupate, viz. The Apostle, speaking of Melchi∣sedech, saith, [Of whom I had much to say, and that which is un∣interpretable, because you are dull of hearing.] Chap. 5. vers. 11. Whence it may seeme (saith vour Cardinall) a thing undeniable, that the Apostle meant thereby the mysterie of the Eucharist, because it was above their capacitie, and therefore hee purposely forbare to mention either Bread or Wine. So your Answerer. To whom you may take, for a Reply as in our behalfe, the Confession of your much-estee∣med Iesuite Ribera, who telleth you that Ribera Jes. Id non ideò dixerat, quod sermonem illum ta∣cere vellet, erat enim id, id quod in hac E∣pistola agit, valdè ac∣commodatum, sed ut magis illos excitaret studio audiendi, & intentiores redderet—Non desperat Paulus quae scripturus est posse ab illis percipi, si animum attendant, aut certè à nonnullis eorum, qui eruditiores erant, per quos coeteri etiam paulatim intelligerent. Com. in Heb. 6. num. 1. Where also he hath these words: Cum llorum & imbecillitatem & tarditatem accusat, ideirco facit, ut pudo∣re ad melius intelligenda incitarentur: [Missa nunc faciamus rudimenta, & ad perfectionem feramur.] Hoc est, Date operam ut mecum intelligatis, quae perfectis dici solent. The Apostle naming it a
thing Inexplicable, and calling them Dull, meant not thereby to con∣ceale the matter implyed (which was so pertinent to that hee had in hand) from them, because of the want of their Capacitie: but did, in so saying, rather excite them to a greater Attention; shewing thereby that he did not dispaire, but that they were capable of that which hee would say; at least the learned among them, by whom others might have learned by little and little. So hee, proving the same out of those words of the Apostle, [Passing by the Rudiments, &c. Let us goe on unto perfection:] that is, (saith he) Doe your diligence in hea∣ring, that you may attaine unto the understanding of these things, which are delivered unto those that are perfect. This is the Briefe of his large Comment hereupon. Notwithstanding, what our Op∣posites faile of, in the point of Sacrifice, They intend to gaine from the Title of Priesthood. Of the Priesthood of Melchisedech, as it is compared with the pretended Romish Priesthood, out of the Epistle to the Hebrewes. SECT. IV. The State of the Question. Aarons Priesthood (said your Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 6. ex Epi∣panio. Sacrificium crucis peractum est, ergo aliud Sacrifici∣um esse oportet, quod jugiter offeratur—Igur necesse est in Ecclesia veram Sacri∣ficandi actionem ad∣mittere; quae Christo summo Sacerdoti per Ministros suos tribua∣tut, qualis actio nulla erit, si Missae Sacrifi∣cium auferatur. Ibid. §. Est etiam. Ad ae∣ternum Christi Sa∣cerdotium necesse est ut Christus saepiùs offerat per se, vel per suos Ministros, jam quidem ciuentè, &c. Ibid. §. Respondeo quod.—Sacerdos verè & propriè non est, qui Sacrificium proprium offerre non potest. Ibid. §. Respondeo autem. Propriè tamen non dicitur Sacrificium aeternum, quod semel actum est, nec dicitur aeter∣num Sacerdotium cum non jugiter sacrificatur. Ibid. §. Secunda Causa. Cardinall) is translaed into the Priesthood of Melchizedech, and this into the Priesthood of Christ, [A Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedech:] which, because it is perpetuall and eternall, cannot be performed properly by Christ himselfe, and therefore must be executed by his Ministers, s Vicars on earth. So he, accordingly as your Conc. Trid. Sess. 22. C. 1. Christus Sacerdos secundum ordinem Melchisedech; & si semel obtulit in cruce, ut aeternam redemptionem operaretur: quia tamen pr mortem ejus Sacerdotium extinguendum non erat &c. Councell of Trent hath decreed. Insomuch that M. Sanders will have the whole Ministe∣rie of the new Testament to issue Novi Testamenti ministerium jam inde à Melchizedech petitum, jam & Christus voluit secundum ejus ordinem dic▪ Sacerdos, & Presbyteri sunt Ministri Christi, i. e. ejus, qui fuit Sacerdos secundum ordinem Melchizedech. Sand. de Visi. Monar. lib. 1. pag. 20. §. Quae cùm. Originally from Melchizedech. This is a matter of great moment, as will appeare; which we shall resolve by ortaine Positions. The foundation of all the Doctrine, concerning Christ and Mel∣chizedech, is set downe in the Epistle to the Hebrewes.
That the Analogie betweene Melchizedech his Priesthood, and the eternall Priesthood of Christ in himselfe, is most perfect, and so declared to be, Heb. 5, 6, 7, Chapp. SECT. V. THe holy Apostle, in the Epistle to the Hebrewes, comparing the Type Melchizedech with the Arch-Type Christ Iesus, in one order of Priesthood, sheweth betweene Both an absolute Ana∣logie, although not in equalitie of Excellence, yet in similitude of qualities and offices. As first in Royaltie, Melchizedech is cal∣led The King of Iustice and Peace. So Christ (but infinitely more) is called Our Iustice and Peace. Secondly, Melchizedech, in respect of Generation, was without Generation from Father or Mother (ac∣cording to the formalitie of Sacred Storie:) so Christ, according to the veritie of his Humanitie, without Father; and, in his divine nature, without Mother: of whom also it is written, Who shall de∣clare his Generation? Thirdly, in Time, Melchizedech a Priest for ever, having neither beginning nor end of Dayes (according to the same Historicall Tenure:) so Christ an eternall Priest, Chap. 5, 6. Fourthly, in Number, only One, who had no Predecessor, nor Suc∣cessor. So Christ, who acknowledged no such Priest before him, nor shall finde any other after him for ever. Fifthly, Christ was Vniversally King and Priest, as the Apostle noted, Chap. 7. 4. say∣ing, That the Priesthood was changed from Aaron and Levi to Christ, in Iuda. That is, that Christ's Power might be both Regall, and Sacerdotall, saith Mutatum Sacer∣dotium de Sacerdota∣li in Regalem, ut ea∣dem ipsa sit Regalis & Sacerdotalis. Chry∣sost in Heb. 7. Horn. 13. Fuit in Melchize∣dech singularis digni∣tas, quòd Sacerdoti∣um administrabatur per Regem. Teste Greg. Valent. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 4. Chrysostome; which was a singular dignity, as your Iesuite well observeth. That the nature of everie other Priesthood (be it of your Romish High-Priest) dissenteth as much from the Priesthood of Melchizdech, as the Priesthood of Mel∣chizedech agreeth with the Priest-hood of Christ. SECT. VI. IF Comparison might be made of Priesthood, whom would you rather that we should instance in, than in your intituled Summus Pontifex, that is, the High Priest, your Pope: who notwithstanding cannot be said to be a King, as Melchizedech, much lesse as Christ, Bellarm. Regnum spirituale Christo proprium:—item Regnum divinum u∣niversale, ratione Hy∣postaticae Vnionis; item gloriae in Beatitudine: Temporale terrenum Christo conveniebat. Lib. Recog. pag. 28. Everlasting. Secondly, Much lesse a King of Peace, who hath beene reproved by Antiquitie for being Victor, Pacis perturbator. Irenam apud useb. Hist. lib. 5. cap. 24. A Troubler of the Peace of Christ's Church: And generally complained of by others, as
being Non tantum con∣tra Barbaros, sed etiā ejusdem patriae, san∣guinis, & fidei Prin∣cipes Domini nostri Dei pacis minus paci∣fici Vicarii. Espnc. in 1. Tim. digress. lib. 2. cap. 6. pag. 273. Nothing lesse than the Vicar of the God of Peace, because of his raising hostile wars against Princes of the same Nation, Blood, and Faith: And for Leodiens. Epist. ad Paulum 2. de Greg. Sep∣timo; Novello schis∣mate Regnum & Sa∣cerdotium scindeba. Teste Espencaeo q sup. Distracting the Estates of Princedome and Priest∣dome. Thirdly, not King of Iustice, because some Popes have exci∣ted Subjects and Sonnes to rebell against their Leige Soveraignes and Parents. Fourthly, not Originally without Generation, by ei∣ther Father or Mother; some of them having beene borne in law∣full wedlocke, and of knowne honest Parents: albeit of other-some the mothers side hath beene much the surer. It will be no Answer to say, as Pope Non secundum ordinem Aaron, cu∣jus Sacerdotium per propaginem sui semi∣nis in ministerio tem∣porali fuit, & cum Ve∣teris Testamenti Le∣ge cessavit: sed se∣cundū ordinem Mel∣chizedech, in quo ae∣torni Pontificis for∣ma praecessit. Leo Pa∣pa Serm. 2. in. Annivers. die Assumpt. ad Pontif. Leo in effect did, viz. that, as Priests, you are not as were the Leviticall; by naturall pro∣pagation; but by a spirituall ordination: because a spirituall Pro∣pagation is no proper, but a metaphoricall Generation. Fifthly, not without Succession; seeing that Succession, as from Saint Peter, is the chiefe tenure of your Priest-hood. Nor will that of Epiphanius helpe you, in this Case, to say that Nunc sanè non amplius semen secun∣dum successionem e∣ligitur, sed forma jux∣ta virtutem quaeritur. Epiphaa. cont. Hrs. 55. You had no Succession by the seed of Aaron: because although this may exempt you from the Leviticall Priest-hood, yet will not it associate you with the Priest-hood of Melchizedech, or of Christ, whose Characters of Priest-hood was to be Priests soly, individually, and absolutely in them∣selves. As little can your ordinary Answer availe, telling us that you are not Salmeron Ies. Nos in Christo Sacerdo∣tes sumus tanquam Vicarii—Satis est nobis illum Princi∣pem semper vivere. Com. in Heb. cap. 10. Disp. 19. Successors, but Vicars of Christ, and Successors of Peter; because, whilest you claime that the Visible Priest-hood and Sacri∣fice of Christ is still in the Church, which is perpetuated by Suc∣cession, you must bid farewell to the Priest-hood of Melchizedech. But if indeed you disclaime all Succession of Christ, why is your Iesuit licensed to say, that your Ribera. Successor quidem Christo Pe∣trus, & reliqui post cum Pontifices in of∣ficio gubernandi Ec∣clesiam, & pascendi oves Christi Verbo praedicationis, & Sa∣cramentorum Admi∣nistratione. At non successit in officio re∣demptionis, & Ponti∣ficis per se Deum ira∣tum placantis—in quo non sunt Succes∣sores, sed Ministri Christi. In Heb. 10. num. 8. Roman Popes doe succeed Christ in their Pastorship over the Church, although not in their Priest-hood by offering Sacrifices, expiating sinnes by their owne virtue? Are not the titles of Pastor and Priest equally transcendent in Christ? Sixthly, not in respect of the no-necessity of a Succession, which was Immortality, because the Popes shewed themselves to be sufficiently mortall, insomuch that one Pope maligning ano∣ther, after death hath dragged the Carcasse of his Predecessor out of his Platina in Vitis Sergii 3. Formos, Ste∣phans, Christopheri. Grave; to omit their other like barbarous outrages. Seventh∣ly, not Personall Sanctity, Heb. 7. 23. Holy; impolluted, and separated from sinnes. For whosoever, being meerely man, shall arrogate to himselfe to be without sinne, the holy Ghost will give him the Heb. 7. 26. Lie. As for your Popes, we wish you to make choice of whatsoever Hi∣storians you please, and we doubt not but you shall finde upon record, that many of them are noted to have beene as impious and mischievous in their lives, and in their deaths as infamous and cursed, as they were contrarily Bonifaces, Innocents, or Bene∣dicts in their names. Can there be then any Analogie betweene your high Roman Priest and Christ, the Prototype to Melchize∣dech, in so manifold Repugnances? Yet notwithstanding, every (*) 1 Io. 1. 8.
one of you must be (forsooth) a Priest after the order of Mel∣chizedeck. Nay, but (not to multiply many words) the Novelty of your Pretence doth bewray it selfe from Lombard. de Ordi∣nat. Prsb. Accipiunt etiam calicem cum vino, & patinam cum Hostiis, ut sciant se accipisse potestatem placabiles Deo hostias offerendi. Hic ordo à filiis Aaron sumpsit initium. &c. Lib. 4. Distinct. 24. lit. 1. Peter Lombard, Master of the Romish Schoole, who Anno 1145. taught (how truly looke you to that) that every Priest at his Ordination, in taking the Chalice with wine, and platter with the Hoast, should understand that his power of sacrificing was from The order of Aaron. Nor may you thinke that this was his private opinion, for He (saith your P. Lombardus collegit sententias Theologorum, & Ma∣gister Theologorum scholasticorum dici meruit. Lib. de Script. Eccles. Tt. Petrus Lombardus. Cardinall of him) collected the sentences of Divines, and de∣served to be called the Master of Schoolmen. Thus farre of the Person of Christ, as Priest; in the next place we are to enquire into his Priestly function. Of the Function of Christ his Priest-hood, now after his Ascension into Heaven; and your Cardinall his Do∣ctrine sacrilegiously detracting from it. SECT. VII. BY the doctrine of your Cardinall, in the name of your Church, Bellarm. Crucis Sacrificium non est perpetuum, sed effe∣ctum ejus—nec di∣citur aeternum quòd non jugiter sacrifica∣tur—non in coe∣lis jam Sacerdos per solam orationem, nec mediante oblatione Victimae, quià tùm necesse est eum sem∣per offerre.—Ergo Eucharistia & Sacri∣ficium quod jugiter offertur—Obla∣tio in coelis non est propriè dictum Sa∣crificium—ergò non est verè ac pro∣priè Sacerdos, cùm verum ac proprium Sacrificium offerre non potest. Lib. 1. de Missa, c. 6. sparsim. And,—Christus non sacrificat nunc per se visibiliter, nisi in Eu∣charistia. Bellar. ibid. cap. 25. §. Quod au∣tem. And, Sacrificium crucis, respecte Chri∣sti norum. Ibid. cap. 20. And, Per Ministros suos perpetuò sacrificat seipsum in Eucharistia: hoc enim solummodo perpetuū habet Sacer∣dotium. Bellarm. ibid. cap. cod. ad finem. The old Priest-hood of Aaron was translated into the Priest-hood of Christ: Every Priest (saith the Apostle) must have some thing to offer, else he were no Priest. Thus his Priest-hood is called Eternall, and must have a perpetuall offering, which was not that upon the Crosse. Nor can that suffice, which the Protestants say, That his Preist-hood is perpetuall, because of the perpetuall virtue of his sa∣crifice upon the Crosse; or because of his perpetuall Act of Intercession, as Priest in Heaven; or of presenting his passion to his Father in Heaven, whither his Priest-hood was translated. No, but it is cer∣taine that Christ cannot now properly sacrifice by himselfe, He doth it by his Ministers in the Eucharist, Because the sacrifice of the Crosse, in respect of Christians, is now invisible, and seene onely by Faith: which although it be a more true sacrifice, yet it is not, as our Adver∣saries say, the onely sacrifice of Christian Religion, nor sufficient for the Conservation thereof. And againe, His sacrificing of himselfe in the Sacrament, by his Ministers, is that by which only e is said to have a perpetuall Priest-hood. Accordingly your Cardinall Alan. Christus in ipso coelo non aliquid Sacerdotale facit, nisi re∣spectu nostri Sacramenti, quod ipse per nostrum ministerium efficit continuò & offert. Lib. 2. de Euchar. cap. 8. §. Reliqua. Alan; Christ (saith he) performeth no Priestly function in Heaven, but with relation to our Ministery here on earth, whereby he offereth. So they for the dignifying of their Romish Masse, as did also Rhemists. Christ his Priesthood consisteth in the perpetuall offering of Christ his Body and Blood in the Church. Annot. in Heb. 7. 17. your Rhe∣mists;
but with what Ecclipse of Iudgement and good Consci∣ence, is now to be declared. If we take the Sacrifice of Christ for the proper Act of Sacrifi∣cing, which is destructive; so was Christ his Sacrifice but One, and Once, Heb. 7. and 8. But understanding it as the subject mat∣ter of the same Sacrifice, once so offered to God upon the Crosse, and after his Ascension entred into Heaven, and so is it a perpe∣tuall Sacrifice presentative before God. For as the high-Priest of the Law, after the Sacrifice was killed, entred into the holy place once a yeare, but not without Blood, Heb. 9. 7. so Christ having purchased an eternall redemption, by his Death upon the Crosse, went into the holy place (of Heaven) with the same his owne blood. V. 12. To what end? Alwaies living to make supplication for us. Ch. 7. V. 3. and 25. Hence followeth the continuall use, which the soules of the faithfull have, of his immediate function in Heaven: Having a perpetuall Priest-hood, he is able continually to save them that come to God by him. V. 24, 25. Whence issueth our boldnesse and all∣confidence, alwaies to addresse our prayers to him, or by him unto God: We having an high Priest over the house of God, let us draw neare with a true heart, infull assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinckled from an evill Conscience. Ch. 10. 22. The evidence of these Scriptures hath drawne from your Iesuit Ribera (even then, when he professeth himselfe an earnest defender of your Romane Masse) these Acknowledgements following Ribera Ies. in his Comment upon the pla∣ces alleaged, Chap. 7. 23. Chap. 8. 2, & 3. Chap. 9. 23. His Booke is familiar with you, where you may peruse the places. viz. upon the Ch. 7. 23. That Christ is a true Priest, and all other doe partake of his Priest-hood, in offering sacrifice, onely in remembrance of his Sacri∣fice: And that he did not performe the office of Priest-hood onely upon earth, but even now also in heaven: which function he now dischar∣geth by the virtue of his Sacrifice upon the Crosse. He proceedeth. No man (saith he) will deny this Position (namely) that Christ now ever exercizeth the office of a Priest, by presenting himselfe for us. So he. This is still Christ's function of Priest-hood, whereunto this Apostle exhorteth all Christians, at all times of need to make their addresse; which Saint Iohn propoundeth as the only Anchor-hold of Faith in his Propitiation, 1. Iohn 2. If any sinne, we have an Ad∣vocate with the Father, Iesus Christ the righteous, and he is (what?) The Propitiation for our sinnes. The which every faithfull Christi∣an doth apply, by faith, unto himselfe, as often as he prayeth to God, in Christ's name, for the remission of sinnes, saying, Through Iesus Christ our Lord. How therefore can this his function of Priest-hood, without extreme sacrilege, be held Insufficient to his Church, for obtaining pardon immediatly from God, who seeth not? As for other your ordinary Objections, taken from two sentences of the Apostle, speaking of the Examples of things celestiall, and of Purging sinnes now with better Sacrifices, you should not have trou∣bled
us with them, knowing them to be satisfied by your owne Authors Ribera Ies. Tho∣mas Expositionem afe, nem∣pè pe [Coelstia] ap∣psum coelum, cujus figura erat tabernaculum.

That the former Romish Sacrilegious Derogation, from Christ's Priestly function in Heaven, is contradicted by ancient Fathers; first inrespect of Place, or Altar, and Function. SECT. VIII. THeodoret is Thd in Psal. 109. Sacerdos nunc est Christus, non ipse ali∣quid ens, sed vo∣ca ur Caput Offeren∣tium, quando quidem corpus ū Ecclesiam vocat. Objected by Bel∣larm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 6. alleaged by you, as denying that Christ now of∣fereth any thing by himselfe, but only in the Church: albeit he saith not so, simply; but, that he offereth not in the Church personally, which all confesse: for otherwise Theodoret presently after His words imme∣diately following are these: Et proptereà Sacerdotio fungitus ut homo: recipit au∣tem ea quae offerun∣tur ut Dens. Offert autem Ecclesia Cor∣poris & ejus sanguinis symbola. So Theod. expresseth, that Christ exerciseth his Priest-hood still as man. As for the Church, his words are not, that She offereth the Body and Blood of Christ in Sacrifice, but, The Symbols of his Body and Blood. Therefore is this his Testimony unworthily and unconsci∣onably objected. But we will consult with the direct speeches of Antiquity. 1. If you aske of the Offering, Ambrose answereth you, that Ambros. Nunc Christus offertur, hic in Imagine, ibi in ve∣ritate, ubi apud Pa∣tr Auvocatus po Nobis. Lib. 1. doffic. cap. 48. sub fiem. The offering of Christ here below is but in an image: but his offering with the Father is in truth. If of the Priest, Augu∣stine telleth you, Aug. in Psal 94. Impous in ara Sacrificium, quando Deum laudamus: at verò Sacerdotem si requiras, super coelos est, interpellat po te, qu terris mortuus est pro te. The Priest is to be sought for in heaven, even Hee, who on earth suffered Death for thee. There is some difference then sure. As little reason have your Disputers to object that one and onely Testimony of Augustine, Aug. lib. 20. de Civit. cap. 10. Episcopi & Presbyterr (inquit) sunt propriè Sacerdotes. Bellarm. objiit. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 17 Presbyteri propriè Sacerdotes: which hopake not absolutely, but comparatively (namely) in respect of Lay-Christians, who in Scripture are otherwise called Priests. (As your owne Duplex Sacerdotium, alterum Interius, omnium fidelium, qui aquâ salutari abluti sunt, Apoc. 1. 16.—alterum Exterius tantùm eorum, qui externo Sacramento ordinis ad aliquod proprium, sacrumque ministerium asuntur. Catechis. Rom. par. 2. de Ordine, num. 22. Catechisme distinguisheth, calling the former the Inward, which only the Faithfull have by the Sacra∣ment of Baptisme; the other Outward, by the Sacrament of Or∣ders.) And with the like liberty doth Saint Augustine call the Sacrifice of the old Testament (although most proper) but a Signe, in respect of the Spirituall Sacrifice of this worke of mercy;
which he Aug. ibid. In A∣po. 20. 6. [Sed erunt Sacerdotes Christi, & regnabunt cum Eo, &c.] Non utique de solis Episcopis aut Presbyteris dictum est, qui propriè jam vocantur in Ecclesia Sacerdotes: sed sicut omnes Christianos dicimus propter my∣sticum Chrisma, sic omnes Sacerdotes, quià membra unius Sacerdotis, &c. [For there is a double Reason of naming Christians Priests; one is in ge∣nerall, because of their offering up spirituall Sacrifices of Praiers, and Praises to God, 1 Pet. 2. 5. And another is in speciall, by pub∣lique Function, com∣mending the same spiri∣tuall Saes, in pub∣lique Service, in the name of the Church. And s, according to the s e of terming them properly Priests, wherewith before (as you have heard) in com∣paring Almes with the Iewsh Sacrifice, hee called Almes the true Sacrifice, and the other but The signe of it notwithstanding the bo∣dily Sacrifice of the Iewes was, in proprietie of Speech, The true Sacrifice, other but Analogicall.] calleth True, namely in the Truth of Excellency, al∣though not of propriety, as you may see. And lastly, here you have urged one, than whom there is scarcely found among Prote∣stants a greater Adversary to your fundamentall Article of your Sacrifice, which is the Corporall existence of Christ in the Eu∣charist. All which notwithstanding, the dignity of our Evange∣licall function is nothing lessened, but much more amplified by this comparison. If furthermore we speake of the Altar, you will have it to be rather on earth below, and to that end you object that Scripture, Heb. 13. 10. We have [] that is, an Altar (saith the Apo∣stle) whereof they have no right to eat, that serve at the Tabernacle. This s in their Aotat. upon the place: and M. Breerly in his Booke of the Liturgie Tract. 3. Sect. 3. Subd 4. some of you greedily catch at, for proofe of a proper Sa∣crifice in the Masse, and are presently repulsed by your Aquinas. Istud al∣tare ve est crux Christi, in quâ Chri∣stus immolatus est, vel ipse Christus in quo, & per quem preces nostras offerimus: & hoc est Altare aum, de quo Apoc. 8. Com. in hunc locum. Aquinas, expounding the place to signifie Either his Altar upon the Crosse, or else his Body, as his Altar in Heaven: mentioned Apoc. 8. and called The golden Altar. If wee our selves should tell you, how some one affirmeth that This Altar, spoken of by the Apostle, is the Body of Christ himselfe in Heaven, upon which, and by which all Christians are to offer up their spirituall Sacrifices of Faith, De∣votion, Thankfulnesse, Hope, and Charity; you would presently an∣swer, that This one certainly is some Lutheran or Calvinist, the words are so contradictory to your Romish Garbe: notwithstan∣ding you may finde all this in the Antididag. Coloniens. de Missae Sacrificio. §. Psthac.—[Habemus Altare] Heb. 13. & Apoc. 8. [Aureum altare,] in qo, & pe quod omnes Christiani universa Sacrificia spirituala fidei, de∣votionis, gratiarum actionis, spei, & charitatis Deo Patri debent osterre.—Atque ità fit, ut Christus sit altare, Sacerdos, & Sacrificium. August. lib. 10. de Trinitate. Antididagma of the Divines of Collen. And your Argument drawne from the word Altar, in this Scripture, is so feeble and lame a Souldier, that your Bellarm. Quia non desunt ex Catholicis, qui inter∣pretantur hunc locum vel de Cruce, vel de Christo ipso; non urgeo eum. Lib. 1. de Misso, cap. 14. Cardinall was content to leave it behind him, because Many Catholikes (saith he) interpret it otherwise. But we are cited to consult with the Antient Fathers, be it so. If then we shall demand where our high Priest Christ Iesus is, to whom a man in fasting must repaire, Origen. Jejunans debes adire Pontificem tuum Christum, qui utique non in terris quaerendus est, sed in coelis: Et per Ipsum debes offerre Hostiam Deo. In Levit. cap. 16. Hom. 10. Origen resolveth us, saying, He is not to be sought here on earth at all, but in Heaven. If a Bi∣shop be so utterly hindred by persecution, that he cannot partake of any Sacramentall Altar on earth, Gregory Nazianzen will for∣tifie him, as he did himselfe, saying, Greg. Nazian. Si ab his Albus me ar∣bunt, at aliud habeo, cujus figurae sunt ea, quae nec oculis cernimus, super qod nec asia▪ nec manus asc, nec ullum Artificum instiumentum auditum est; sed menis hoc opus est, huic que per contemplationem astabo, in hoc gratum immolabo Sacrificium, oblationes & Holocausta, [] tantò praestantiora, quantò Veritas un brâ. Oral. 28. pag. 484. I have another Altar in Heaven, whereof these (Altars) are but signes; a better Altar, to be beholden with the eyes of my mind, theye will I offer up my oblations: as great a Difference (doubtlesse) as betweene Signes and Things.
This could not he have said of those Altars, if the Sacrifices on them both were, as you pretend, subjectively and corporally the same. If we would know how, what, and where the thing is, which a Christian man ought to contemplate upon, when he is exercised in this our Eucharisticall Sacrifice? Chrisst. in 1. Cor. 10. Hom. 24. ud sa∣nè tremenuum Sacri∣ficium, ut cum con∣cordia ad illud ac∣damus, ut Aquilae sa∣cti ad ipsum coelum evolemus: ubi enim cadaver, ibi aquilae. Cadaver Domini cor∣pus, propter mortem: Aquilas autem non oportet ad inferiora trahi aut repere, sed ad superiora volare, & solem justuiae intuer oculo mentis acutissi∣mo. Aqilarum enim haec mena est, non Graculorum. Chrysostome is ready to instruct him, Not to play the Chough or Iay, in fixing his thoughts here below, but as the Eagle to ascend thither where the Body is, namely (for so he saith) in Heaven. According to that of the Apostle, Heb. 10. Christ sitting at the right hand of God. V. 12. What therefore? Therefore let us draw neere with an Assurance of faith. V. 22. If we would understand wherein the difference of the Iewish Religion and Christian Profession especially consisteth, in respect of Priest-hood, Aug. adversus Iu∣daeos, cap. 9. Nam & Aäron & Sacerdotiū jam nullum est, in ali∣quo templo, & Chri∣sti Sacerdotium est aeternum in coelo. Augustine telleth us that They have no Priest-hood; and the Priest-hood of Christ is eternall in Heaven. And the holy Fathers give us some Reasons for these and the like Resolutions. For if any would know the Reason why we must have our Con∣fidence in the Celestiall Priest, Sacrifice, and Altar; Oecumen. in Heb. 10. super haec verba, [Cum certitudine fi∣dei.] Cum deinceps nihil visibile supersit, ne{que} Templum, hoc est coelum; neque Pontifex, id est, Chri∣stus; neque Hostia, quae Corpus illius est, fide deinceps opus est. Oecume∣nius and Ambros. in Heb. 10. Cum fiducia, ait Apostolus: nihil enim hic visibile, neque Sacerdos, neque Sacrificium, neque Altare. Ambrose will shew us that it is because Here below there is nothing visible; neither Temple, ours being in Heaven; nor Priest, our being Christ; nor Sacrifice, ours being his Body; nor yet Altar, saith the other. Heare your owne Canus: Canus loc. Theol. lib. 12. cap. 12. Oblatio, quam Christus in coelis incruentum fecit. pag. 421. Christ offereth an unbloody Oblation in Heaven. Thus in respect of the place of Residence of Christ our high Priest, and his Function, which hath beene al∣ready confirmed by the Fathers of the first Councell of Nice. And thus farre of the place of this Altar the Throne of Grace; something would be spoken in respect of Time. That the former Sacrilegious Derogation, from Christs Priestly Function in Heaven, is contradicted by Scriptures and Fathers, in respect of the Time of the execution thereof. SECT. IX. CHrist his bodily existence in Heaven (as we have See above Chap. 3. Sect. 9. heard) is set out by the Apostle in these termes: He abideth a Priest for us. He continueth a Priest. He having a continuall Priest-hood. He, without intermission, appeareth before God for us. Thus the Apostle. But what of this, will you say? Doe but marke. Are you not All heard still proclaiming, as with one voice, that your Romish Sacrifice of the Masse is the onely , and Barredas. Quod singulis diebus Chri∣stus offert incruentè, Hoc juge Sacrificium est Ecclesiae. Tom. 4. lib. 3. cap. 15. Salmeron. Eusio sanguinis semel facta semper prodest, modò jugiter offeratut. In Heb. 10. Disp. 19. Becanus. Juge Sacrificium Veteris Testamenti fuit figura Missae in novo, ratione determina∣tionis temporis: sicut ille offerebatur mane & vespere, ita Christus à principio mundi usque ad finem. Apoc. 13. Agnus occisus—Lib. de Analog. utriusque Testam. cap. 13. num. 14. Iuge
Sacrificium, that is, the Continuall Sacrifice; Continually offered: Whereof the [Iuge] and Continuall Sacrifice of the Law was a signe. So you. But it were strange that the Iuge Sacrificium of the Law, continuing both Morning and Evening, should be a figure of your Masse-Sacrifice, which is but only offered in the Morning. As if you would make a picture, having two hands, for to represent a Per∣son that hath but one. But, not to deny that the Celebration of the Eucharist, may be called a Iuge Sacrificium (for so some Fa∣thers have termed it:) Yet, they no otherwise call it Iuge, or Continuall, than they call it a Sacrifice, that is, Vnproperly; be∣cause it cannot possibly be compared for Continuance of Time to that Celestiall of Christ in the highest Heaven, where Christ of∣fereth himselfe to God for us day and night, without Inter∣mission. Whereupon it is that Irenaeus exhorteth men to pray often by Christ at his Altar, Irenaeus. Nos quo∣que Victimas offerre ad altare frequenter. Est ergò Altare in coelis, illuc etiam pre∣cs nostrae & oratio∣nes dirigendae; & templum—ut ex A∣poc. apertum est. Lib. 4. cap. 34. Which Altar (saith he) is in Heaven, and the Temple open. Apoc. 11. 19. Greg. Sine inter∣missione pro nobis Holocaustum Re∣demptor immolat, qui sine cessatione Patri suam pro nobis inear∣nationē demonstrat. Moral. lib. 1. cap. 24. in Iob. Where (saith Pope Gregory) our Saviour Christ offereth up his burnt Sacrifices for us without inter∣mission: And whereupon your Iesuit Coster, out of Ambrose, affir∣meth, that Coster Enirid. contro. cap. 9. Solut. ad Object. 1. ex Ambros. Sicut in coelis Christus corpus suum, olim in cruce vulneratum & occisum, tanquam juge Sacrificium paternis oculis perpetuò pro nobis exhibet: ità hîc in terris per Ministerium Sacerdotum idem Corpus in specie mortui & exanguis offert. [That is objectively; for it is the Bloody Body, that is presented by us in the Eucharist.] Christ exhibiteth his Body wounded upon the Crosse, and slaine, as a [Iuge Sacrificium] that is, a Continuall Sacrifice, perpetually unto his Father for us. And to this purpose serve the fore-cited Testimonies of Augustine, Gregory Nazianzen, Ambrose, Chrysostome, and Oecumenius; some pointing out the Altar in Heaven, as the Truth, Some by Exhortations, and Some by their Examples instructing us to make our Continuall Approach unto the Celestiall Altar. CHALLENGE. NOw you, who so fix the hearts and minds of the Spectators of your Masse, upon your sublunary Altars and Hoasts, and appropriate the Iuge Sacrificium thereunto (in respect of Time) during onely the houres of your Priestly Sacrificing; allow your attention but a moment of Time, and you will easily see the Im∣piety of that your Profession. The Iuge Sacrificium of Christ, as it is presented to God by him in Heaven, hath beene described to be Continuall, without Intermission, Alwayes (that is) without any Interruption of any moment of Time: to the end that all sorts of Penitents and faith∣full Suters, solliciting God by him, might finde (as the Apostle saith) , that is, Helpe at any time of need. The gates of this Temple, Heaven, being ever open: the matter of this Sa∣crifice, which is the Body of Christ, being there ever present. The
Priest, who is Christ himselfe, ever executing his Function. Whereas, contrarily, (you will confesse, we dare say) that the Doores of your Churches may happen to be all locked, or interdi∣cted; your Sacrifice shut up in a Box, or lurched, and carried away by Mice; your Priest taken up with sport, or repast, or journey, or sleepe: yea, and even when he is acting a Sacrifice, may possibly nullifie all his Priestly Sacrificing Act, by reason of (See hereafter Booke 7. Chap. 5. Sect. 5. Confessed) Almost infinite Defects. Therefore the Sacrilegiousnesse of the Doctrine of your Masse is thus farre manifested, in as much that your owne Ministeriall Priest-hood doth so prejudice the personall Priest-hood of Christ, as it is in Heaven, as the Moone doth by her interposition ecclipse the glory of the Sunne: by confounding things distinct, that is, (as we have learned from the Fathers) Image with Truth; The state of Wicked Partakers with the Godly; Matters Visible with In∣visible; Signes with Things; Worse with Better; Iayes with Eagles; and the like. Of the second Typicall Scripture, which is the Passeover: shewing the weaknesse of the Argument taken from thence, for proofe of a Proper Sacrifice in the Masse. SECT. X. FIrst it is meet we heare your Objector speake, even your Bellarm. Immo∣latio Agni Paschalis potest quidem dici fi∣gura Passionis: nam fi Agnus ille fuit figu∣ra Eucharistiae, Eu∣charistia autem figu∣ra Passionis, quis ne∣gat Agnum istum fi∣guram fuisse & Re∣praesentationem Pas∣sionis? Quarè Joh. 19. Videmus Evange∣listam reddere can∣sam, cur non fuerant crura Christi confra∣cta in Passione, quia scriptum est de Agno Paschali, [Os non comminuetis ex eo.] Tamen magis imme∣diatè & principaliter Ceremonia Agni Pa∣schalis potiùs fuit fi∣gura Eucharistiae, quàm Passionis. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 7. §. Il∣lud.—Quod cele∣bratio Agni Paschalis fuit figura celebrationis Eucharistiae, probatur ex Scripturis, 1. Cor. 5. Pascha nostrum immolatus est Christus, itaque epulcmur in azymis Veritatis—Dicent Adversarii impletum fuisse hoc in Cruce—At constat Apostolos in coena manducasse carnem Christi,—Verum Agnum Paschalem, ad cujus epulum nos hortatur Apostolus. 1. Cor. 5. Epulemur, &c. Bellarm. ibid. §. Quod igitur, & §. Dicent. Car∣dinall, who albeit he confesseth the Paschall Lamb to have been the figure of Christ on the Crosse, yet did it in the Ceremonies thereof (saith he) more immediatly and principally prefigure the Eucharist than the Passion, which is proved by Scripture, 1. Cor. 5. [Our Passeover is offered up, therefore let us feast it in the Azymes of Sincerity and Truth.] Which offering up was not fulfilled on the Crosse; but it is evident that the Apostle did eat this true Paschall Lambe, the flesh of Christ, at his Supper: and this Apostle exhor∣teth us to this Feast, in saying, [Let us therefore keepe our feast, &c.] So hee, bestowing a large Chapter of Arguments, wherewith to bleare our eyes, lest that we should see in this Scripture [Our Passeover is offered up] Rather the Immolation of Christ on the Crosse, than in the Eucharist. We willingly yeeld unto his allea∣ged Testimonies of Ancient Fathers, who by way of Allusion, or Analogie, doe all call the Eucharist a Paschall Sacrifice. But yet that the words of this Scripture should more properly and principally meane the Eucharisticall Sacrifice (as if the Iewish Passeover did rather prefigure the Sacrifice of Christ in the Masse, than on the Crosse) not one.
It were a tedious worke to sift out all the Drosse of his Argu∣mentations; Neverthelesse, because he putteth Protestants unto it, saying us followeth, Bellarm. q suprà §. Dicent &c. Dicent Adversarii Apostolum loqui de Immolatio∣ne in cruce facta: at nos probabimus figu∣ram illam propriè im∣pletam fuisse in c∣na. But our Adversaries (saith he) will say, that the Apostle, in saying our Passeover is offered up, speaketh of Christ's Sacrifice offered upon the Crosse, but we will prove that this figure was properly fulfilled at his Spper: (So he) We will now shew you that other Adversaries, than Protestants, are ready to encoun∣ter this your Champion. First, the choisest Chieftaine of his owne side, armed with the Authority of Christ himselfe, Ioh. 13. 1. [Before the day of the Passeover, Iesus knowing that his howre was come, that he must passe out of the world unto the Father.] Now when was this spo∣ken? Even then, saith Job. 13. 1. [Antè diem Paschae sciens Iesus, quia venit ho∣ra, ut transiret ex hoe mundo ad Patrem.] Hîc mortem Transi∣tum vocat.—Allu∣dit ad Pascha, ac fi Latinè diceret, Antè diem festum Transi∣tûs, sciens quia venit hora ut transiret ipse: Ipse enim Pascha no∣strum immolatus est Christus—Opti∣mus autem terminus, Transitus ejus ex hoc mundo ad Patrem. Tolet. Ies. Com. in um locum. Tolet, your Cardinall and Iesuit, When he came to the celebrating of the Sacrament of his Body and Blood, that is, at his last Supper. But what was meant hereby? namely, Christ alluded unto the Iewish Passeover (saith he) in signification of his owne passing over by death to his Father. So he. So also your Iesuit August. in Psal. 68. Cum venit Dominus ad Sacramentum san∣guinis & corporis sui, ità loquitur, [Sciens quod hoa venit, ut transiret ad Patrem de mundo.] Quibus verbis expressit trans∣itum Paschae Teste Pe∣rerio Ies. in Exod. cap. 12. Disp. 8. Pererius, out of Augustine. A second Scripture is the objected Text 1. Cor. 5. [Our Passe∣over is offered up, Christ:] that is, As the figurative paschall Lambe was offered up for the deliverance of the people of Israel out of Egypt, so Christ was offered up to death for the Redemption of his people, and so passed by his passion to his Father. So your 1. Cor. 5. Pascha nostrum immolatus est Christus, ergò E∣pulemur Azymis sin∣ceritatis, & veritatis. [Aquinas assignt Rati∣onem, quare fideles de∣bent esse Azym: quae quidem Ratio sumitut ex my Passionis]—Sicut Agnus figuralis immolatus est à fils Israel. ut populus li∣beraretur—it à Christus occisus ab Israëlitis, ut populus liberaretur à servitute Diaboli. Christus enim per passionem transt ex mundo ad Patrem. Joh. 13. Haec Aquin. Com. in 1. Cor. 5. And Tollet in his Testimony before cited. So Becanus Ies. Aquinas. [Our Passe∣over.] Namely, by his Sacrifice in shedding his Blood on the Crosse. So your Iesuit [Pascha nostrum. 1. Cor. 5] Nempè per immolationem in cruce, & effusionem sanguinis illius, liberatum est genus humaum. Analog. utriusu Testam. cap. 13. pag. 313. Becanus. And, By this his Passeover on the Crosse was the Passeover of the Iewes fulfilled. So your Bishop Impleta erat figura Paschalis, quando e∣rum nostrum Pascha est immolatus Christus Iesus, & nos per ejus sanguinem liberati eramur. Iansen. Concord. ∣vang. cp. 131. pag. 895 Iansenius, as flat diameter to your Cardinal's Objection as can be. A third Scripture we finde, Ioh. 19. [They broke not his legs, that the Scriptures might be fulfilled which is written, A bone of him shall not be broken:] which your Joh. 19 [Cruta non confregerant, ut impleeur quod scriptum est, Osnon com∣minuetis ex eo.] Bellarm. q sup. yet gaine-saith with his. Tamen &c. §. Illud. Cardinall himselfe confesseth to relate only to Christ's Sacrifice on the Crosse; and notwithstan∣ding dare immediatly oppose, saying, Neverthelesse the Ceremony of the Paschall Lambe did more immediatly and properly prefigure the Eucharist than Christs passion: wherein, whether he will or no, he must be an Adversary to himselfe. For there is no Ceremony more principall in any Sacrifice than are these two, viz. The mat∣ter of Sacrifice, and the Sacrificing Act thereof. Now the matter of the Sacrifice was a Lambe, the Sacrificing Act was the killing thereof, and offering it up killed unto God. Whether therefore the Paschall Lambe did more principally prefigure the visible Body of Christ on the Crosse, or your imagined Invisible in your Masse, whe∣ther
the slaine Paschall Lambe bleeding to death, did more pro∣perly and immediatly prefigure and represent a living and perfect Body of Christ, than that his Body wounded to death, and blood∣shed, Common sense may stand for Iudge. The Ancient Fathers, when they speake of the Sacrifice of Christ's Passion, in a precise propriety of speech, doe de∣clare themselves accordingly. If in generall, then as Origen. Sacrifi∣cium, pro quo haec omnia Sacrificia in typo & figura praeces∣serunt, unum & per∣fectum immolatus est Cristus. Hujus Sa∣crificii carnem quis∣quis tetigerit, sancti∣ficabitur. In Levit. cap. 6. Hom. 4. Origen: All those other Sacrifices (saith hee) were prefigurations of this our perfect Sacrifice. If more particularly, then as Chrysostmus de Cruce & Latrone. 1. Cor. 5. Pascha nostrū immolatus est Chri∣stus: estivitas ergò &c. Vides crucis n∣tuitu perceptam lae∣titiam? in cruce enim immolatus est Chri∣stus: Ubi immolatio, amputatio peccato∣rum; ubi amputatio peccatorum, reconci∣liatio Domini—novū Sacrificium—nam ipse Sacrificium erat, & Sacerdos; Sacrificiū secundum carnem, Sacerdos secundum Spiritū, offerebat secundum Spiritū▪ offereba∣tur secundum carnem—& altare Crux fuit. Chrysst. T. 3. pag. 826. Chrysostome, from the objected Text of the Apostle. 1. Cor. 5. [Our Passeover is offered up, Christ, Let us therefore keepe our feast, &c.] Dost thou see (saith he) in beholding the Crosse, the joy which we have from it? for Christ is offered upon the Crosse, and where there is an Immola∣tion, there is Reconciliation with God: this was a new Sacrifice, for in this the flesh of Christ was the thing sacrificed, his Spirit the Priest and Sacrificer, and the Crosse his Altar. In so much that, else-where he teacheth every Christian how, as a spirituall Priest, he may . Idem. Tom. 5. Serm. 88. Edit. Savil. pag. 602. Alwaies keepe the Passeover of Christ. What greater plainenesse can be desired? and yet behold, if it bee possible, a greater from Sacrates Hist. lib. 5. cap. 22. Origenes Doctor valdè sapiens cum animad∣verteret Legis Mosaicae praecepta ad literam non posse intelligi, praeceptum de Paschate ad divinam contemplati∣onem traduxit: . Origen, calling the Sacrifice on the Crosse the the Onely true Passeover. Which saying his Reporter Socrates im∣braceth, as a Divine Contemplation. From Typicall Scriptures we descend to Propheticall. CHAP. IV. That the objected Propheticall Scriptures of the old Testa∣ment are by your Disputers violently wrested, for proofe of a Proper Sacrifice in the Masse. The first Text is Malachy chap. 5. vers. 1. THE Texts are two. The first, which is, Mal. 5. 1. is objected by your Cardinall in this manner: [From the rising of the Sunne to the going downe of the same, my name shall be great among the Gentiles, and in every place shall Sacrifice, and Oblation be offered to my name.] This, saith your Cardinall, See the Testimony fol∣lowing. Is a notable Te∣stimony for the Sacrifice of the Masse.
The State of the Question. BE so good, as to set downe the State of the Controversie your selves, Insigne testimo∣nium pro Sacrificio Missae, Mal. 5. 1. in his verbis [Ab ortu solis usque ad occasum magnum est nomen meum in Gentibus, & in omni loco sacri∣ficatur & offertur no∣mini meo Oblatio munda: quià magnum est nomen meum in Gentibus, dicit Dominus. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 10.

Ergò non loquitur de spirituali, sed de Sacrificio propriè dicto. The whole Controversie is, whether this Scrip∣ture spake of a Sacrifice properly so called, or of an Vnproper Sacri∣fice, such as are Prayers and Thanksgiving, &c. So you. You con∣tend for a Proper Sacrifice, and We deny it: and how that we are to grapple together, we shall first charge you with alleaging a corrupt Trnslation, as the ground of your false Interpretation. That the Romish Objection is grounded upon a false Text, which is in your Romish Vulgar Translation; even by the judgement of Ancient Fathers. SECT. I. YOur Romish Vulgar Translation (which was decreed in the Councell of Trent to be the only Authenticall, and which there∣upon you are injoyned to use in all your Disputations; and not this only, but bound also thereunto by an Oath in the Bull of Pius Quartus, not to transgresse that Decree) doth deliver us this Text [In every place is sacrificed and offered to my name a pure Ob∣lation, &c.] without any mention of the word Incense at all: whereas (which your Cardinall Bellarm. In He∣braea, & Graeca Edi∣tione sic legmus [In∣censum offertur no∣mini meo, & Sacrifi∣cium mundum.] Quo supra. confesseth) Both the Hebrew and Greeke Text hath it thus: [Incense is offered in my name; and a pure offering, &c.] and that More plainly, saith your Septuaginta A∣pertiùs. Valent. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 4. p. 526. Valentia. Which warranteth us to call your Vulgar Translation false, as we shall now prove, and you perceive, without any farre Digression. For we meddle not now with the generall Controversie, about this Translation, but insist only upon this Particular, that as A Lion is knowne by his claw, so your vulgar Translation may be discer∣ned by this one Clause, wherein the word, Incense, is omitted quite. If ye will permit us, without being prejudicated by your Fa∣thers of Trent, to try the Cause by impartiall Iudges, which are the ancient Fathers of Primitive Times; especially now, when you your selves are so urgent in pressing us with multitudes of their Testimonies, for Defence of your Romish Sacrifice, even in their
Expositions of this Text of Malachy: Looke then upon the Bellarm. Vocem illam [Incensum] in∣terpretatur Tertull. Orationem, ut & an∣te eum Iren. lib. 4. cont. Haeres. cap. 33.

Mar∣ginals, and you shall finde mention of the word Incense (according to the Hebrew and Greeke Texts) in the very same objected Te∣stimonies of Tertullian, Irenaeus, Hierom, Chrysostome, Eusebius, and Augustine. Notwithstanding, we should not be so vehement, in condemning your Romish Translation in this point, if the mat∣ter, now in hand, did not challenge us thereunto: the word, In∣cense, being sufficient in it selfe to satisfie all your Objections ta∣ken from the Sentences of Fathers, and vrged by virtue of the word, Sacrifice, and Oblation, as will appeare. That the Text of Malachy doth not imply a proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist, by the Expositions of ancient Fathers. SECT. II. TWo words we finde in this Prophet, concerning the new Te∣stament: One is, Incense, in the Text now alleaged; the other is the word, Levites. The first in Chap. 1. vers. 3. [In every place there shall be an Offering of Incense, and a Sacrifice, &c.] You All affirme of Prayers, Praises, and holy Actions, that they are Spiri∣tuall, and no proper Sacrifices. But the Fathers, by you objected, (to wit, Tertullian, Irenaeus, Hierome, Chrysostome, Eusebius, and Augustine) doe See the preceding Marginalls. Expound Incense to signifie these Spirituall Du∣ties, which are unproperly called Incense. Therefore may we as justly conceive, that the word, Sacrifice, used by them, and ap∣plied to the service of God in the new Testament, was meant Improperly; and that so much the rather, because your Cardi∣nall hath no Objection out of the Fathers for his advantage in the word, Sacrifice, which he looseth not by the word Incense, from point to point. For the first Objection we oppose, saying, The word Incense, is likewise used without See in the Testimo∣nies above cited, for it is called absolutely In∣cense, and not Incense of Prayer, &c. Addition. To the second, We according∣ly say, Incense was meant also to be Pure: for you will not ima∣gine, that God would promise to his faithfull in Christ Impure things. To the third; It is as well said concerning Incense, as of Sacrifice (against the Iewes, vers. 10.) I will not receive any offe∣rings at your hands: Isaiah 1. 13. Incense is an abominination unto mee. To the fourth, The same Godlesse Iewes did joyntly contemne Gods worship made by Incense, as by Sacrifice; except you shall thinke it credible, that the same men should be both devout and pro∣fane in one prescribed Service of God. To the last, Malachy in the same sentence (and as it were with the same breath) equally taketh exceptions to the Iewish Priests, in both Sacrifice, and In∣cense.
Therefore as the word, Incense, so accordingly the word, Sacrifice, was used improperly of the Fathers. Doe you not now see what reason your Cardinall had, to make choise of a cor∣rupt Text, wanting the word Incense? which he peradventure foresaw would prove as bitter as Coloquintida in his Pottage. The second word in Malachy is [Levite,] I will purge the sonnes of Levi; which was spoken (as your Cardinall Bellar. Postquam dixerat Malachias [offertur nomini meo oblatio munda] Ex∣ponit cap. 3. à quibus offerenda sit munda oblatio: Purgabit, in∣quit, filios Levi: Vbi, per Filios Levi, non possunt intelligi Levi∣t veteris Testamen∣ti—sed nostri Sa∣cerdotes. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 10. §. Quintum. confesseth) of the Ministers of the new Testament. Well then, did the Prophet call the Ministery & service of the new Testament, Pure Sacrifice? And did he not in the like manner call the Ministers of the new Testa∣ment Purged Levites? as also some of the Ancient Augustine, Ambrose, Cyprian, Leo. Fathers (you know) used to doe: And as your Church, in degrading of Arch-Bishop Cranmer from his order of M. Foxe Act. Monument. pag. 2117. Levitico ordine te privamus. Deaconship once did. There∣fore both alike were used Improperly, in imitation of this Pro∣phet, and also of that in Isa. 66. Isaiah, I will send them Priests and Levites. That the Text of the Prophet Malachy doth confute the Romish Pretence of Sacrifice, even by the objected Testimonies of Ancient Fathers. SECT. III. PErmit you us, for brevity sake, to contrive this Section into Ob. and Sol. your Cardinal's Objections, and our Solutions or Answers. 1. Ob. Sacrifice is called pure, Ergo, Christs Body. Sol. And Chrysost. (who is Chrysost. in Psal. 95. (objected) Malachias appellat Thymiama purum, sacras preces. objected) termeth Prayers, Pure Incense. 2. Ob. The word, Sacrifice, signifieth not Prayers, Praises, or Pious Actions, for these are improperly called Sacrifices, Ergo, &c. Sol. First, Tertull. ob. by Bel∣larm. lib. 3. cont. Mar∣cion. ex Psalm. 57. In Ecclesiis benedicite Dominum Deum, ut pariter concurreret Malachiae prophetia, In omni loco Sacrifi∣cium mundum: Glo∣riae sc. relatio, & Be∣nedictio, & Laus, & Hymni. [Which words Bellarmine restraineth to Prayers and Prai∣ses only, in the Masse; whereas Tertullian speaketh of Prayers in generall.] Againe, Lib. 4. advers. Marc. a little after the begiuning. Dicente Ma∣lachia, Sacrificium mundū, s-simplex oratio de conscientia pura. [Where he expoundeth Pure Sacrifice to be Praier.] Tertullian (objected) expounded the word Sa∣crifice, to signifie Benedictions, and Praises. And secondly, Euseb. Demonst. lib. 1. cap. 6. In omni loco Incensum & Sacrificium, &c.] Quid aliud significat quàm orationis Incensum, & Sacrificium, quod [mundum] dicitur? est enim non per cruores, sed per pias actiones summo Deo offerendum. Euse∣bius (objected) calleth this Pure Sacrifice, Pious Actions and Pray∣ers. Which your Cardinall could not Answer, but with a mar∣vellous and miserable Illusion. 3. Ob. By the word, Bellarm. Resp. Non quasi Oratio sit ipsum Incensum, seu Sacrificium, sed illud quod per Ora∣rationem, i. e. per verba Consecrationis perficitur. Solent enim Patres verba Consecrationis orationes, sen my∣sticas preces interpretari. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 10. [First sondly, for the words of Consecration containe in them no terme of Prayer: And secondly falsly, for the Fathers did not call these words Prayer. Both which have beene amply discussed.] Sacrifice, were not meant Spirituall Sacrifices, &c. Sol. Yet Hieron. (objected) Mal. 1. Vt sciant Judaei carnalibus Victimis spirituales successuras. Thymiama, hoc est, O∣rationes Sanctorum offerendas, Oblationem mundam, ut est in Ceremoniis Christianorū. Bellar. Licet per Incen∣sum intelligat Orationem, tamen per Sacrificium intelligit Eucharistiam: dicit enim offerri in Ceremoniis Chri∣stianorum. [Be it so, but the Question is, whether the Action of the Eucharist be not called spirituall, that is (as is confes∣sed) an Vnproper Sacrifice. Hierome (ob∣jected) expresly nameth the Sacrifice, in Malachy, Spirituall.
To come to your Cardinals principall Reason. 4. Ob. The Iewish Sacrifices were called Vncleane, not in respect of the Offerers, but of the Offerings; intimating thereby, that this Offering in the new Testament can be no lesse than the very Body of Christ. Sol. I∣renaeus (objected) plainly putteth the difference to be made, by Malachy, betweene the Sacrifices, as they were the Offerings of the wicked Iewes, and the Sacrifices of godly Christians; and he giveth this Reason, because Irenaeus (b.) ad∣vers. Haeres. lib. 4. cap. 34. speaking as well of Sacrifices in Judaico populo, as in Ecclesia, saith; Non Sacrificia sanctificant hominē, sed Conscientia pua ejus, qui offert &c. Then of Eleemosynae, which the Apostle cal∣leth Hostiam accep∣tabilem: Oportet nos oblationem Deo fa∣cere in sententia pu∣ra. And then, Ecclesia offert oblationē hanc Fabricatori puram, offerens ei cum grati∣arum Actione ex cre∣atura ejus. Judaei au∣tem non offerunt, quia manus eorum plenae sanguine &c. The Iewes (saith he) offered up their Oblations with wicked hearts, but the Christians performe theirs with pure Consciences. And that the Iewish Sacrifices were not rejected for themselves, but for the impiety of their Sacrificers; your owne Iesuit Ribcra Ies. Ad lo∣ca Scripturae adducta respondere Apostoli. Apud S. Clementem lib. 6. Const. Apost. C. 22. in hunc modū. Recusabat Deus po∣puli Sacrificia saepe∣numero in eum pec∣cantis, atque existimantis Sacrificiis eum, & non poenitentiâ placatum iri. Idem docet Irenaeus, lib. 4. cap. 33. In Hos. 6. num. 24. Ribera confirmeth both by the Constitutions of Pope Clement, and also by this Testimony of Irenaeus. A Truth so evident to your Divines of Collen, that they presume Antididag. Colon. Tract. de Sacrif. Missae, §. De Consecratione. Quis ignorat vetera Pa∣trum Sacrificia, quae Christum figurabant, vel ob id quod Deus ea praecepisset, per se munda fuisse? Nihilominus tamen frequentius immunda vocantur in Scripturis, non ratione sui, sed propter malam voluntatem offerentium. None to be ignorant; for that the Sacrifices of the old Testament were all cleane and pure, because God hath ordained them, and they became impure by the wicked hearts of the Offerers. And Tertullian giveth the same Observation for the Reason, why God, in rejecting them, said, Tertull. lib. 3. advers. Marcionem. Sacrificia rejecta, qui à non secundum Dei religionem celebranda, sua jam, non Dei fecerant. pag. 160. And, Sacrificia spiritualia accepta, which hee nameth above, Cor contribulatum, lau∣dem, &c. Lib. adversus Iudaeos. I will no more of your Sacrifice, and not of my Sacrifice. But you will say, Some of the Fathers spake directly of the Proper Sacrifice of the new Testament. We answer, that as they ap∣ply it to the Eucharist, they meant no proper Sacrifice, as the Sub∣ject, but onely as the Object therein, which was that of the Crosse. In which respect Chrysost. (objected) in Psal. 95. Ex hostia prima mensa mystica coeleste Sa∣crificium, summeque venerandum. Est autem in nobis varia differentia: Lex multas habet Hostias, Gratia no∣va unam—Vis scire Victimas, quas Ecclesia habet?—quando fit Sacrificium mundum & immacu∣latum? audi Scripturam Tibi palàm exponentem hanc differentiam. Et Sacrificium, quod antea dixi spirituale, illud mysticum donum, in qo Apostolus Ephes. 5. Christus tradidit se ipsum pro Nobis Deo Sacrificium. Chrysostome (objected) calleth it that Sacrifice, whereof Saint Paul writeth, saying, [Christ gave himselfe up a Sacrifice for his Church.] Eph. 5. Lastly, Cyprian (objected) cal∣leth it the Cypr. (ob.) ex lib. 1. cont. Iudaos, cap. 16. Novum Sacrificium, Sacrificium Laudis. New Sacrifice of Praise: which is, you know, a Spiri∣tuall, and no Corporall or Proper Sacrifice. The first Propheticall Text is finished.
The second Propheticall Text (as is pretended) is Psal. 72. 16. concerning an [Handfull of Corne in the Top of the Mountaines:] objected to proue a Sacrifice in the Romish Masse; but yet as very Romishly, as were the rest. SECT. IV. OF this Corne your Psalm. 72. juxta Heb. [Et erit pugillus frumenti in summita∣tibus montium] vulg. Lat. [Et erit firma∣mentum in terra in summis Montium.] Galatinus de Arcanis Cath. Veritat, lib. 10. cap. 5. Hoc est, dicit Chaldaea Translatio Rabbi Jonathae, Et et Sacrificium panis in summis montium—Cum ergo ait, E∣rit placenta frumenti in terra, in capité montium, vult dice∣re, quod placenta pa∣nis fiet Sacrificium in Capitibus Sacerdorū, qui sunt Ecclesia. Haec ibi—Nec mi∣rum de sapientibus antiquis Judaeorum Messiam placentam trumenti, & frustum panis iuturum dixisse. The same hath Coccius Thesaur. Cath. lib. 6. Art. 4. pag. 679. He ad∣deth other Authors,  witt, P. Galatinus, Claud. Sanctesius, & Genebrard. in hunc Psal. Cocis▪ ibid. Art. 16. pag. 763. Disputers Coccius, Duraeus, Sanctesius, Genebrard, out of Galatinus, and He out of the Chaldee Tran∣slation, and other his supposed Iewish Rabbins, have observed a Cake on the top of the Mountaines. But what of this? This Cake, forsooth, was by their Doctrine a Propheticall prediction of the Romish Wafer-Cake, which is heaved up over the head of the Priest for, a Sacrifice. And this is called, by Master Breerly, M. Beerly in his Protestants Apol. no∣ting Duraeus the Iesuite to have urged the same out of Galatini. A most strong Argument, in behalfe of the said Doctrine. But wee must tell you, that your Galatinus is too credulous, and that his Rabbi∣nicall Abstracts are no better than the Gibeonites old torne shooes, and mooldy bread, seeming to have come from farre, even from old Rabbins, when as they were invented and brought from their lat∣ter Rabbins and Glozers, as it were from the next bordering Countries: because your Author Galatinus (who produceth the foresaid Rabbinish prediction of that Cake) is branded, for such like his Conceipts, with the marke of a Vaine man, by your judicious Senensis Biblioth. lib. 2. §. Traditiones. Non possum satis mi∣rari studium Petri Galatini, qui—in eam Vanitatem devenit, ut doceret opera Thalmudica in Latinum verti oporrere, & publicè in Scholis Christianorum explicari. Senensis. And the Chaldee Paraphrase, which talketh of your Sacrificed Cake, is rejected, as being a corrupt Puddle of Iewish Fa∣bles, (and fabulous in this very point) by your great Romane Dictator Bellarm. in Psal. 71. vers. 16▪ Scio quod Paulus Burgensis ex Paraphrasi Chaldaica adferat ad probandum hoc in loco Sacrificium Missae: sed scio etiam quam multis fabulis Judaicis Pharaphrasis illa scateat, ideò piget ex lacunis Expositionum Judaicarum hau, &c. Bellarmine. Which we speake not, as being offended to heare any Rabbi calling that, which is in the hand of your Priest, and above his head, A Cake, which in your Romish Phrase is called a Wafer-cake: for if it be indeed & truly a Cake, then is not it Accidents only, but hath still in it the substance of Bread. And so farewell your Helena of Trent, called Transubstantiation. Now because the Sacrifice can be no better than the matter thereof will permit it, it followeth that the Sacrifice is not properly the Body of Christ, but the Ele∣ment of Bread. And thus your Authors (after their laborious knea∣ding and moulding, their greedy longing, and their sweetly chew∣ing hereof) are at length in a manner choaked with their owne Cake.
CHAP. V. Of our Second Examination of this Controversie, by the Iudgment of Ancient Fathers, shewing that they never called the Eucharist a Sacrifice properly. Our generall Proposition. The ancient Fathers never called the Eucharist properly a Sacri∣fice: proved by many Demonstraations. THE Demonstrations, which we are to speake of, are many; some taken from the proper, and some from the pretended Subject of the Eucharist; some from the paritie of like spee∣ches of Fathers, as well in other Sacraments, Acts, and Adjuncts, as in these which are be∣longing to the Eucharist. The first Demonstration is, That the Fathers called Bread and Wine a Sacrifice; as being the Subject matter of the Eucharist, but Vnproperly. SECT. I. THat Antient Fathers called Bread and Wine a Sacrifice, even before Consecration, we have it confessed asseverantly by your owne Maldon. Ob. Ire∣num lib. 4. cap. 32, & 34. Scribit Christia∣nos Deo offerre pri∣itias creaturatum panem & vinum—Dicebatur etiam sa∣crificare homo profa∣nus, qui Sacerdoti tradebat victimam, ut eam pro se sacrifica∣ret: non quòd illa traditio esset Sacrifi∣cium. Ita ocuti sunt etiam Christiani an∣tiqui, ut constat ex verbis Cypriani in Serm. de Eleemof. Locuples matrona fi∣ne Sacrificio in Dominicum veniens. Nec necesse est (ut Irenaeus oquitur) de proprio Sacrificio, quia nefas est credere Ecclesiam obtulie rem ullam corpoream & errestrem Deo post abrogata omnia hujusd, Sacrificia terrena. Maldonat. loco ciat. Accipiendo Sacrificium pro re, quae sacrificatur, negati non debet, panem & vinum aliquo modo in Missa offerri, & prinde pertmere ad rem praesentem: na cùm ante Consecrationem dicimus [Suscipe, Sancte Pater, hanc tuam immaculaam Hostiam] certè pronomen, Hanc, demonstrat ad sensum id quod tunc manibus tenemus, id autem panis est. Et similes sunt in Liturgia non paucae sententiae, quae panem offerri apertè sanè demonstrant. Denique veteres Patres passim idem tradunt, Iren. lib. 4. cap 32. dicit Ecclesiam of∣ferre Sacrificm ex creaturi. Et Cypr. lib. 2. Ep. 3. Christum obtulisse Calicem vino & aqua mixtam. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 27. §. Repondeo ut. Iesuit, where he will have you furthermore to ob∣serve, that Bread and Wine, before Consecration, is called an Im∣maculate Sacrifice, even in your Roman Masse. And that the Pri∣mitive Fathers called Bread and Wine, Sacrifice, after Consecration also, we have likewise proved in two full See above Chap. 3. Sect. 2. Sections: which your Cardinall is bound to acknowledge, who, to prove that Melchize∣dech Sacrificed Bread and Wine, produced the Testimonies of Am∣brose, Augustine, Chrysostome, Oecumenius, and Theophylact, to conclude them to have beene Figures of the Eucharist, which we desire you to cary still in minde, untill we end this Section. Hereupon we demand, whether you think that Bread and Wine, in the Eucharist, can be called of Christians a Sacrifice properly,
either before, or after Consecration? No (saith one Valent. Ies. obj ci∣enti Melchizedechum otulie panem & vinum caùm. Resp. Sacerdotium Christi secundùm ordinem Melchizedech—E∣tiam ratione rei obla∣tae, non quatenus ob∣latione illius substan∣tiae determinatae, se∣panis & vini exerce∣batur. Lib. 1. de Misse, cap. 4. Iesuit) Be∣cause it is not agreeable to our Priest-hood. No (saith a Bellarm. respondens quaestioni. An cum so∣lus Panis mutaur, si propriè sacrificare∣tur? Inquit, Id absur∣dissimum esset: tùm haberet Ecclesia Sa∣crificium inanimum, & vilius multò quàm habuerint olim He∣braei. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 27. §. Sed haec. Second) be∣cause it were most absurd that the Church of Christ should have a life∣lesse Sacrifice, and consequently more vile than was the Iewish. No, (Nefas est, crede∣re Ecclesiam obtulisse rem ullam corpoream & terrestrem Deo post abrogata omnia hujusmodi Sacrificia terrena. Maldon. lib. de 7. Sacram. Tom. 1. de Euch. part. 3. §. Pri∣mum Argumentum. saith a Third) because it were an heinous impiety now, after the abrogation of the terrene Sacrifices of the Iewes, to beleeve that the Church of God should professe an Offering of Corporall and earthly Sacrifices. No (Salmeron. Com∣munis sensus est om∣nium Christianorum, non esse aliud Sacri∣ficium quàm Corpus & Sanguinem Chri∣sti—At si panis esset Sacrificium, se∣queretur, quòd res inanimata sacrificarē∣tur——Et quòd summa Latria esset circa panem & vi∣num. Tom. 9. Tract. 29. §. Quinta. saith a Fourth) for it is the judgement of all Chri∣stians, that there is no Sacrifice in Christian Religion, but the Body and Blood of Christ: because otherwise the Act of Sacrificing thereof, being a Divine Worship, should be exercized upon Bread and Wine. So they. Wee would be glad to take the Apostle of Christ to be our Guide, for our better security, he (as is likewise Bellarm. Aposto∣lus declarat, non esse terrenú aliquid quod offert Christus, si esset super terrain, ex Heb. . 4. Etostendit nunc mellores hostias offerri. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 6. §. Resp. quid. confessed) teacheth, that God now is not to be worshipped, by way of Sacri∣fice, with any outward thing. Oh that your Divines would exercise their quils in publishing such sound Truths as this is, we then would wish them Good speed in all their Writings. Notwithstanding, upon consideration of the Premises, we are inforced to complaine of the Vnconsciona∣blenesse of your Cardinall, who, to prove a proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist, did (as you may remember) produce the Testimonies of five Fathers, wherein that, which they called a Sacrifice, they expressed to be Bread and Wine; which by the joynt and conso∣nant Confession of the Cardinall himselfe, and other prime Iesu∣ites of his owne society, cannot be held to be proper Sacrifices without Absurdity and Impiety. And the like obliquity of Iudge∣ment you may finde in your Romish Divines, in alleaging the Testimonies of Irenaeus, for proofe of the Sacrifice of your Masse, which your Iesuit Maldonat hath truly observed to have beene spoken of Bread and Wine, even Rhemists Annot. in Luc. 22. 19. before Consecration. One word more. By this you may perceive another proofe of the Idiome of Ancient Fathers, in Extending the word [Sacri∣fice] beyond it's literall sense: which (beside the former) the last annexed Testimony of To these former, we adde another objected Testimony of Augustine. Lib. de fide ad Pet. Diac. cap. 19. Nullatenus dubites unigenitum Dei filium obtulisse hostiam Deo pro nobis, cui nunc cum Patre & Spiritu Sanct offerimus Sacrificium panis & vini, in fide & charitate, in Catholica Ecclesia per uni∣versum mundum. Augustine confirmeth, shewing, that now there is in this our Sacrifice no other Subject but Bread and Wine. This may serve for the present, concerning the true and proper Subject of the Eucharist, Bread and Wine. We in the next place are to examine the pretended Subject, which your Church will have to be the Body and Blood of Christ. (*) See above at (a).
Our Second Demonstration is, that the Ancient Fathers held not the Body and Blood of Christ to be the proper Subject matter of the Eucharist, in calling it a Sacrifice. SECT. II. HOw commeth the Body and Blood of Christ to be a Proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist? Your Cardinall will tell us, to wit, Bread and Wine are consecrated, and by Consecration made the Body and Blood of Christ: so that now Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, . 27. §. His igi∣tur.—In Missa Sacrificio requiritur ut res prophana sit sa∣cra: sic hic, ubi panis convertitur in corpus Christi—§. Respon∣deo, &c. Non panis sed quod x pane fa∣ctum propriè sacri∣catur. [For still the Question is that of Lom∣bads; Quaetur si quod gerit Sacerdos, sit propriè Sacrificiū. Lib. 4. Dist. 12. li. G.] Not Bread (saith he) but the Body of Christ is the Thing sacrificed. This is plaine dealing, and as much as if he had said, If there be in the Eucharist no Transubstan∣tiation of the Bread into Christ's Body, by Consecration, then can∣not Christ's Body be a proper Sacrifice. But that there is no such Transubstantiation or Corporall Presence of Christ's Body in the Sa∣crament, hath beene proved to be the Iudgement of Ancient Fa∣thers, by many Demonstrations thorow-out the third and fourth Bookes. A stronger Argument there needeth not. Our Third Demonstration is, because the objected places of Anti∣quity, for proofe of a Representative Sacrifice, properly so cal∣led, doe not point out any where the Body of Christ as the proper Subject, but only as the Object of the Sacrifice spoken of. SECT. III. The necessary use of this Distinction. OVr Distinction is this. These words, The Body and Blood of Christ, as they are applyed to the Eucharist, in the name of Sacrifice, may admit of a double Acception; one is to take them subjectively, as being the proper Materiall Subject of this Sacra∣ment, the other is to understand them objectively: that is, to ac∣compt the Body and Blood of Christ, as they were the Sacrifice of Christ upon the Crosse, to be only the proper Object of a Christi∣an Celebration, according to the Direction and Institution of Christ, saying, Doe this in remembrance of me. Your Romish Church professeth the Body and Blood to be the proper Subject; we nay, but the proper Object of our Celebration. This Distin∣ction, well learned, will be unto our Reader as an Ariadne's thred, to winde him out of the Labyrinth of all Obscurities, and seeming Repugnancies of Ancient Fathers; out of all the confused Subtil∣ties and equivocall Resolutions of your Romish Disputers; and out of the Perplexities wherewith some Protestants also may seeme (in some sort) to have beene intangled.
The Demonstration it selfe is, Because the Eucharist, being only Com∣memorative and Representative, cannot be a proper Sacrifice: answering the Romish Objection taken from the Sacrifices under the Law. SECT. IV. THat it cannot be called properly a Sacrifice, which is onely for Commemoration and Representation, is the Conclusion of your owne Bellar. Si sola re∣praesentatio Sacrificii crucis, tùm non po∣test dii oblatio in hunc modum: Offero tibi Pater, &c. ac à Patribus oblatio dici∣tur. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 15. § Quartò. Cardinall; although it cannot be denied, but that Improperly it may be called, as well as you may call the Image of Christ crucified, the Crucifix. But, to come to your Obje∣ction, your Rhemists Annotat. in Lc. 22. and Bellar. Finis rat Sacrificio∣rum praecedentium reptaeentare Sacrifi∣cium Crucis, ut futu∣rum, Et ficut veter Sacrificia non amit∣ebant verans & pro∣priam rationem Sa∣crificii, ex co quòd es∣sent representativa ita nec Sacrificium Eucharistiae amittit propriam Sacrificii rationem, propter Commemoratione. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 12. §. Quod verò. Romish Divines and Romish Cardinall are very earnest and instant in proving that because the Iewish Sacrifices, being Representations of the passion of Christ, were notwithstan∣ding true and proper Sacrifices: Therefore the being Representative, can be no hindrance that the Eucharist should be a proper Sacrifice. So they. But yet so, as if they had meant to say nothing to the purpose, because the Iewish Sacrifices, albeit they were Represen∣tations of Christs Passion, yet were they not only Representations thereof, as the Eucharist is, but were also beside that Sacrifices in themselves, and so ordained to be by God; first in their matter, as Bulls, Sheepe, Goats; next in their Sacrificing Act, which was de∣structive, as to be slaine; and lastly, in their proper and peculiar end, which was (as your Bellarm. Sacrificia illa Levitica non culpam & poenam aeternam, sed immunditiem legalem, & poenam temporalem explabant.—Patet ex Dei promissione de remissione pecca∣torum; ex mensura Sacrificii majori & minoris pro majore & minore delicto. Levit. 6. & 4, & 5. At pro pecca∣tis gravioribus, ut blasphemia, homicidio, &c. nulla videmus instituta Sacrificia. Lib. 4. de Poenitent. cap. 15. §. Respondeo. & §. Ex his. Non quoad culpam & poenam Gehennae, nisi quatenus figna erant protestantia fidem in Christuum, ut docent communiter Theologi. Idem lib. 2. de effect. Sacram. cap. 17. Et omnia illa erant Sacri∣fieia vera, & signaula promissionis Christ venturi & morituri. Idem lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 24. Cardinall witnesseth) for expiation of le∣gall Pollutions, and remission of temporall punishments. Each one of these may satisfie your Objection. The Confirmation of the former Demonstration out of the Fathers first Explaining of themselves. SECT. V. SAint Ambrose setting forth two kinde of Offerings of Christ, here on earth, and above in Heaven, he saith that Ambros. Vmbra in Lege, imago in Evan∣gelio, veritas in coe∣lestibus: antè agnas offerebatur▪ nunc Christus offertur qua∣si Homo, quasi reci∣piens passionem, & offert sese ipse quasi Sacerdos, ut peccata nostra dimittat, hîc in imagine, ibi in veritate, ubi apud Pattem pro nobis quasi Advocatu intervenit. Lib. 1. de offic. cap. 48. Christ here is offered as one suffering, and above he himselfe Offereth himselfe an Advocate with the Father for us. And this our offering of him he calleth but an Image; and that above he calleth the Truth. Clear∣ly shewing, that we have in our Offering Christ's Body only, as it is Crucified, which is the Object of our Commemoration; But the
same Body, as it is now the personall subject of a present Time, and Place, they behold it in Heaven; even the same Body, which was once offered on the Crosse by his Passion, now offered up by himselfe to God, by Presentation in Heaven; here in the Church only by our Representation Sacramentally on earth. Saint Augustine dealeth as plainly with us, where distingui∣shing three States of Offerings up to Christ, he August. Hjus Sa∣crific caro & sanguis antè adventum Chri∣sti per victimas simi∣litudinum promitte∣batur; in passione Domini per ipsam Veritatem: post A∣scensum per Sacra∣mentum memoriae celebratur. Con. Fau. lib. 20. cap. 21. Tom 6. Nonne semel immo∣latus est Christus, & tamen in Sacramen∣to quot: diè immola∣tur? Hee addeth, Nec tamen mentitur, qui dicit Christum immo∣lari: si enim Sacra∣menta non haberent similitudinem rerum ipsarum, quas reprae∣sentant, non essent Sacramenta. Ex qua similitudine nomina corum accipiunt. Aug. lib. Epist. 23. S of this above, Booke 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 5. Andye againe more plainly in his 20. Booke against Fautus, Cap. 21. it followeth; Vt Baptismus dicitur sepulchrum; sic, Hc est corpus meum. saith first, that under the Law Christ was promised In the similitude of their Sa∣crifices: meaning, his bloody death was prefigured by those bloo∣dy Sacrifices. Secondly, in the offering at his Passion he was De∣livered up in truth, or proper Sacrifice, this was on the Crosse. And thirdly, after his Ascension, The memory of Him is celebrated by a Sacrament, or Sacramentall Representation. So he. For although the Sacrifices of the Iewes were true Sacrifices, yet were they not truly the Sacrificings of Christ. Note you this Assertion. A∣gaine, speaking of his owne Time, when the Sacrament of the Eucharist was daily celebrated, he saith, That Christ was once sa∣crified (namely upon the Crosse) and Is now daily sacrificed in the Sacrament; nor shall he lie (saith he) that saith Christ is sacrificed. So he. No, holy Augustine, shall he not lye, who saith that Christ, as the personall Subject of this Sacrament, is a proper Sacrifice in the literall Sense? (for, whether Proper or Vnproper, are the two Seales of this Controversie.) Now interpose your Catholike Resolution. Say first, why is it called a Sacrament? tell us; See above Booke 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 8. out of his Epist. 23. ad Bonifa∣cium. If Sacraments had not a similitude of things, which they represent, they were no Sacra∣ments, from which similitude they have their Appellation and name of the things (to wit) The Sacrament of the Body of Christ is called his Body, as Baptisme is called a Buriall. Be so good as to explaine this by another, which may illuminate even a man, in the point of Sacrifice also, although otherwise blinded with prejudice. Epist. 23. ad Boni∣fac. Paulò ante verba superiora, nempè, Pa∣scha Appropinquan∣te saepè dicimus cra∣stinam Domini passi∣onem, cum ille ant multos  passus fit, nec omninò nisi semelista passio facta , nempè isto die: (dicin us) Christus resurrexit, cum ex quo resurrexit tot Anni transierunt, cum nemo ita ineptus sit qui nos ita loquentes argat nos esee men∣tos—ut dicatur ipse Dies, quia non est ipse, sed similis—nonne semel immolatus est Chri∣stus? &c. As when the day of Christ's Passion (faith he) being to morrow, or the day of his Resurrection about to be the next day but one; we use to say of the former, To morrow is Christ's Passion; and of the other, when it com∣meth, it is Christ's Resurrection, yet will none be so absurd as to say, we lye in so saying, because we speake it by way of Similitude: even so when we say, this is sacrificed, &c. So Saint Augustine. Who now seeth not, that as the Buriall of Christ is not the Sub∣ject matter of Baptisme, but only the Representative Object there∣of; and as Good Fryday, and Easter-day, are not properly the daies of Christ his Passion or Resurrection, but Anniversary, and Repre∣sensative, or Commemorative Resemblances of them: So this Sa∣crifice is a Similitude of the Sacrifice of Christ's on the Crosse, and not materially the same. We omit Testimonies of other Fathers, which are dispersed in this and other Sections. Although this one Explanation might satisfie, yet shall we adjoyne others, which may satiate even the greediest Appetite.
The fourth Demonstration, from the Fathers Explanation of their meaning, by a kinde of Correction. SECT. VI. ANcient Fathers in good number call that, which is repre∣sented in the Eucharist, and which we are said to offer, The same Host, not many; the same Oblation, no other; the same Sacri∣fice, and none but it: but they adde by a Figure , that is, a Correction of the excesse of their speech, or rather for Caution∣sake, (least their Readers might conceive of the same Sacrifice herein as properly presnt) saying in this manner; We offer the same Sacrifice, or Rather the Remembrance thereof; alluding some∣time expresly to the Institution of Christ, [Doe this in remembrance of me.] The Fathers are these, viz. Chrysost. in Heb. 10. Hom. 17. pag. 1171. [Christus semper suo sanguine intrat] Ipse Sacrificium Sacer∣dos, & Hostia: si hoc non esset, multa oportebat etiam Sa∣crificia offerri, saep. ùs oportebat crucifigi.—Eandem ipsam Hostiam, quam Chri∣stus immolabat, offe∣rimus, [,] vel potiùs Recordationem ipsi∣sius, &c. Chrysostome, Theophylact. in Heb. 10. pag 885, 886. Nunc & ipsi sine san∣guine immolamus? Ita quidē, Sed Christi tunc reminiscimur o∣bitus: & una nobis est immolatio, non multae, quandoquidē & ille semel immola∣tus est. Eundem sem∣per offerimus, quin pos Oblationis il∣lius memoriam faci∣mus, perinde ac si es∣set hoc tempore im∣molatus. Quocirca u∣num effe hoc nostum Sacrificium constat.—Vnicum est & semel oblatum—nam & unus est san∣guis, & semel fosus. Theophylact, Theod. in Hebr. cap. 8. Cumeffecitur alia Sacrificia non essent necessaria, cur novi Testamenti Sacerdotes mysticam Liturgiam seu Sacrificio pera∣gant? sed clarum est iis, qui sunt in rebu divini eruditi, nos non aliud Sacrificium offerre, sed unius illius sal∣taris memoriam peragere—Dixit enim, Hoe facite in memoriam mei. Thodoret, Ambros. in Heb. 10 Offeri∣mus quidem, sed Recordationem salutaris mortis ejus, & una haec Hostia, non multae. Ambrose, Euseb. Demonst. Evan∣gelic. lib. 1. cap. 10. Sacrificamus & incendimis, aâs autem magni Sacrificii illius memoriam, . Eusebius, and Primasius in Heb. cap. 10. Quod Deus &c. Offer quidem Saceres nostri, sed ad recodationem mortis ejus—sicut ipse dixit, Hoc facit in Commemo rationem —Vn hostia, non mul∣tae—Corpus unum cum illo, quod suscepit in utero virginali, non autem multa Corpora, nec nunc qui∣dem aliud magnum, aliud minu. Primasius. Your only Answer is, that their Exception, here used, was not to note that it is not the same Body of Christ here Corporally pre∣sent, which was offered upon the Crosse, but that it is not offered in the same manner by effusion of Blood, as that was; which is indeed a Part, but not the whole Truth. For survay the Margi∣nals, and then tell us; If that your Sacrifice were the same Body of Christ Corporally present, why should Theophylact apply hs qualification not to the manner, whether Bloody or Vnbloody, but to the person of Christ, saying,▪ We offer the same Christ, who was once offered, or rather a Memoriall of his Oblation? And Theodo∣ret applying it directly to the thing, [Non aliud] We offer not ano∣ther Sacrifice, but a memoriall thereof? why Eusebius, Wee offer a Memoriall in stead of a Sacrifice? plainly notifying unto tis, that they meant the same very Body, which was the Subject of the Sa∣crifice on the Crosse, to be the now proper Object of our Remem∣brance in the Eucharist, but not the Subject therein. Which agreeth with that which in the former Section was said by Ambrose, Our offering up of Christ in an Image; and Augustine his celebrating of this Sacrament of Remembrance. Semblably, as Hierome speakes of the Priest, who is said to take the Person of Christ in this Sacrament, so that, He (saith Hier. Tom. 5. lib. 13. Com. in Ezech. cap. 44. Qui offerat Deo Sacrificium, ita ut verus Sacerdos sit, imò Imitator ejus, qui est Sacer o secundum ordinem Meleizedech. Idem Tom. 9. lib. 4. cap. 26. in Match. Sicut Melchizedech panem & vinum offerem, ipse quo que veritatem corporis & sanguinis sui repraesentet. Hierome) be a a true Priest, or rather an Imitator of him. But a Priest and an Imitator is
not Identically the same that is represented. Master Breeley is not Christ. Lastly, The same (said Primasius) in all places, which was borne of the Virgin, and not now great, and now lesse. So he. But have we not heard you number your many Hoasts on one Altar, at one Time? and yet the Fathers say, We offer not many, but the same, which must needs be the same one, as Object; else shew us where ever any Father denied but that upon divers Altars were divers Breads; or that but, according to their outward Demensions, they were now greater, now lesse; which no way agreeth with the Body of Christ, as hath beene proved in discussing the See above Booke 4. cap. 9. Sect. 4. Canon of the Councell of Nice. The fifth Demonstration: Because the Body and Blood of Christ, as they are pretended by the Romish Church to be in this Sacra∣ment, cannot be the Representative Sacrifice spoken of by Ancient Fathers; against your vaine Instance in a Stage-play. SECT. VII. THat the Subject matter of this Sacrament (by you called the same Sacrifice, which Christ offered up upon the Crosse) ought to be Representative, and fit to resemble the same Sacrifice of his Passion, is a matter unquestionable among all. In which respect the Fathers have so often called it a Sacrifice of Commemoration, Representation, and Remembrance; and that the thing to be repre∣sented is his Body crucified, and his Blood shed in that Sacrifice of his Passion, is a point as questionlesse, which accordeth both to the words of Christ his Institution [Doe this in remembrance of me,] and to the Exposition of Saint Paul, to be a [shewing foth of the Lords death untill he come:] yea and is also consonant to the last mentioned Doctrine of the Fathers, calling it A Sacrifice of Christ, or rather a Remembrance thereof. The only Question will be, how This, which you call The same Sacrifice, meaning the Body of Christ subjectively in the Eucha∣rist, being invisible, can be said to represent, figure, and resemble the same Body, as it was the Sacrifice on the Crosse? We yeelding unto you a possibility, that one thing, in some respects, may be a Representation of it selfe. Your Tridentine Fathers to this purpose say, that Co. Trid. Chri∣stum reliquisse Sacri∣ficium Ecclesiae suae visibil, quo cruentum illud in cruce pera∣gendum repraesenta∣retur. Sess. 22. cap. 1. Christ left this visible Sacrifice to his Church, whereby his Body sacrified upon the Crosse should be represented. So they. From whom (it may seeme) your Rhemists learned that lesson, which they taught Others, that Rhemists Annot. in Luc. 22. Christ's Body, once visibly sacrificed upon the Crosse, In and By the selfe same Body is immolated and sacrificed under the shapes of Bread & Wine, and is most perfectly thereby resem∣bled: and therefore i most properly Commemorative; being called the same Sacrifice by the Ancient Fathers. And againe, This nearely and lively resembleth that. So they. But this we utterly deny, be∣cause
although a thing may in some sort be represented by it selfe, yet (say we) there is no Representative quality of any Body and Blood of Christ (as it is said by you to be in the Eucharist) of his Body and Blood Sacrificed upon the Crosse. And upon the Truth or Vntruth of this our Assertion dependeth the gaining or losing of the whole Cause, concerning the Question of Sacrifice, now controverted betweene us. Two of yout Iesuits have undertaken to manifest your Repre∣sentation (by a more fit example than doe your Rhemists) thus; Barradas Ies. Eri tibi stupendam Dei adinventionem no∣tam facimus. Animo concipiamus Regem aliquem post reporta∣tam de Hostibus Vi∣ctoriam, &c. Sic Christi corpus veluti in scena peronatur, i. e. speciebus panis & vini velatur, &c. Tom. 4 Concord. Evang. lib. 3. cap. 13. §. Opti∣mus. And Bellarmine. Even as a King (say They) having got a Victory, should represent himselfe, after his warre, in a Stage-play in sight, &c. So they, even in earnest, which hath beene as earnestly, yet easily; confuted by us [See above 2. Booke, Chap. 2. Sect. 6. there answered.] Corpus & sanguis Domini sub specie panis & vini signa sunt corporis ejus passi, & sanguinis effusi, &c. See above also in the same place, Cha. 3. already; although, indeed, the Play deserveth but laughter: and that so much the rather, because the Representative part (as your Councell of See hereafter, Cha. 6. Sect. 1. Trent hath defined) is in your Masse a visible Sacrifice, whereby the Bloody Sacrifice of Christ on the Crosse might be represented, as you have heard. CHALLENGE. YOu (except you will be Players, and not Disputers) must tell us, where ever it was seene or heard of a King, as Conquerour; or yet of any other, of what condition soever, acting himselfe, and that visibly, perfectly, and truly (as you have said) yea or else any way semblably representing himselfe, when as yet the same King, or party, was to all the Spectators altogether Invisible? If you can, then shew where this was acted, whether it were not in Vtopia? and who was the Actor, if not ? and of what disposi∣tion the Spectators were, whether not like the man of Argos, who is said daily to have frequented the Theater and Stage alone, void of all Actors, yet seeming to himselfe to see all Varie∣ties of Actions, occasioning him to laugh, and applaud at that which he saw represented to himselfe onely in his owne phantasti∣call braine? Now have you nothing else to answer, but (which you have al∣ready said) that The Body and Blood in the Eucharist are visible, by the visible shapes of Bread and Wine. Whereas it had beene much better you had answered, indeed, nothing at all, rather than not only to contradict that, which was said by your Fathers of Trent, (decreeing the Representation to be made By the Sacrifice on the Al∣tar it selfe; and more expresly by your See above, at (b) Rhemists, In and by the same Body in the Eucharist:) but also to expose your selves to the reproofe of your Adversaries, and Scorne of any man of Com∣mon sence; as if you would perswade him his money is Visible to any that will use his eyes, which he hath therefore locked up close
in his Coffer, least any man might see it. But this we have dis∣cussed sufficiently in the 2. Booke, and 2. Chapter, §. 6. The sixth Demonstration of the no-Proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist, because divers Epithets objected, as given by Fathers to this Sacrifice, are used also by them where there is no Proper Sacrifice. SECT. VIII. IT is objected by your Cardinall, that Ancient Fathers gave certaine Epithets, and Attributes to the Eucharist, 1. Some cal∣ling it a Full and pure; 2. some terrible Service; 3. some termed it in the plurall number Sacrifices and Victimes; and 4. some Anun∣bloody Sacrifice. So hee, Bellom. lib. 5. de Miss, cap. 5 § Quin∣tò—Partes ad no∣men Sacrificii Epi∣theta ae, è addunt, quae soli vero Sacrifi∣cio conveniunt, & quae ineptè dicerent de ola  praesentati∣one. Cyp. li. 2. Epist. 3. Plenum & verum Sa∣crificium. Chrysost. Hom. ad pop. Anti∣och & omnes Graeci, Passion terribile Sa∣crificium & horroris plenum. Aug. lib. 0. de Civit. Dei, cap. 20. Summum verumque Sacrificium. Euseb. lib. 1. Demonst. E∣vang. cap. ult. Sacri∣crificium Deo plenū. [This last is not undoub∣tedly spoken of the Eu∣charist.] Ibid. §. Se∣cundo.—Si Patres putâssent Sacrificium Eucharistiae non esse Sacrificium nisi re∣praesentativum, nun∣quam dixissent in nu∣mero multitudinis offe: ri Deo Victin as, & Sacrificia. Of the Epithete (Unbloody) in the next Section. concluding from each of these, that they meant thereby a Proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist. We en∣counter all these foure kinde of Instances with like Epithets given by the same August. de Civitat. Dei, lib. 10. cap. 6. Ve∣rum Sacrificium om∣ne opus bonum, ut Deo adhaereamus, factum. Tertull. In omni loco Sacrificium mundum, gloriae scilicer & rogatio, benedictio, laus, hymni Lib. 3. advers. Marcionem. Rursus, Sacrificium mundum oratio simplex de purâ Conscientia.

Fathers to other Things (in your owne judgement) improperly called Sacrifices; as namely to Prayers, Praises, giving Thankes, and Hymnes, instiled True, Pure, and Cleane, and the only perfect Sacrifices, by Primitive Fathers. Secondly, they are as zealous concerning the second Cyrill. Apol. Lectio Scripturatum terribilium. Teste I well art. 17. Chrysost. in 1. Corinth. Mm. 40. De Baptismate pauld post initi, post pronunciationem . point, in terming holy Scriptures Terrible; the Rules touching Baptisme, Terrible words, and Horri∣ble Canons; and the Christian, duly considering the nature of Bap∣tisme, One compassed about with Horror and Astonishment. Where∣of more See Booke 7. Chap. 2. Sect. 1. hereafter. And indeed what is there, whereby we have any apprehension of Gods Majesty, and Divine Attributes, which doth not worke a holy Dread in the hearts of the Godly? And the third Instance is as idle as any of the rest, because the holy Eseb. lib. 1 Demonst Evang cap. 10. Poò has rursus incorporeas & intelligentia praeditas hostias pro∣phetica nunciant oracla. Immola Deo Sacrificium laudis & Orationes sanctas, &c. Iust. Martyr. Dialog. cum Try∣phon. pag. 269. Supplicationes & gratiarum actiones solas esse charas Victimas Deo. Fathers named Prayers, Giving of Thankes, and other holy Actions, Sacrifices, and Hoasts, in the plurall number. And is not there in the Eucharist, Prayers, Hymnes, and Thanksgivings? nay, but know, that in as much as the Fathers have called the Eucha∣rist in the plurall number Hoasts, and Sacrifices, it proveth that they were not of your Romish Beleefe of Concomitancy, to thinke (with you) that Bread being changed into Christ's Body, and Wine into his Blood, make but one Sacrifice; for there can be no Identity in Plurality. The Answer to the fourth Epithete followeth.
The seventh Demonstration of no-Proper Sacrifice in the Eucharist: Because the principall Epithet of Vnbloody Sacrifice, used by the Fathers, and most urgently objected by your Do∣ctors, for proofe of a Proper Sacrifice, doth evince the Contrary. SECT. IX. IT hath beene some paines unto us, to collect the objected Te∣stimonies of Fathers, for this point, out of your divers Writers, which you may peruse now in the Margent, with more ease, and presently percelve, both what maketh not for you, and what against you; but certainly for you just nothing at all. For what can it helpe your cause, that the Celebration of the Eucharist is often called , that is, An unbloody Sacrifice, a Reasonable & unbloody Service or Worship? In the first place three Basil. in his Masse, ob. by Salmero , Tom. 9. Tract. 30. §. Sed contu∣tans: and by Lindanus Panop. lib. 4. cap. 53. Nos appopinquantes Altari tuo sulcipere, & dignissimos offerre hanc , (Lindanus, non car∣nis, sed mentis) . Salme∣ron Ies. Absque sangui∣ne hostiam: & ad∣mitte . [And not till long aster the words of Consecration, begin∣ning at [Respice, Do∣mine.] Missa Chrysost. Ob. abesdem qo suprà. Hanc nostram suppli∣cationem, tanquàm ad Altare, admittere non recuses, & ac nos idoncos qui Tibi  nostris pro¦patis offeramus. Idem Saneron. Offe∣rimus Tibi rationa∣bile & incruencum obs quium. [Which words are in the body of your Liturgies put be∣fore the words of Conse∣cration (Edit. Aatuer. ex officina Plantin. 1960. cum privilegio Regis.) but which Lin∣dan will have to be st after Consecration.] The Liturgie of S. ames: Pro oblatis, sanctificatis, pretiosis, immaculatis donis divinis oremus Dominum—acceptis eis in supercoe∣leste, mentale, spirituale Altare, in odorem spiritualis fragrantiae, &c. Paulò post: Deus Pater, qui oblata tibi do∣na mera, frugum oblationes accepisti in odorem suavitatis. [And after followeth the words of Consecration: Sancto, qui in Sanctis, &c.—Suscipe incorruptum Hymnum in sanctis & incruentis Sacrificiistuis.] Liturgies, or (if you will) Masses are objected, to prove that by unbloody Sacrifice, and Reasonable and unbloody worship, is betokened the Sacrifice of Christ's body and blood in the Masse; one of Basil, another of Chrysostome, and (by some others) the Masse of Saint Iames of Ierusalem. In which Epithet of Vnbloody (say we) could not be signified Christ's body. Our reasons: because (as the Margent sheweth) the word Vn∣bloody hath sometime Relation unto the Bread and Wine (both un∣bloody) before Consecration, called in Saint Iames his Liturgy, Gods gifts of the first fruit of the ground: who also reckoneth Hymnes among unbloody Sacrifices: (But Christ's Body is the fruit of the wombe) or else sometime is it referred to the Acts of Celebration, in Supplication, Thanksgiving, and Worship of God (all unbloody) naming that Areasonable and unbloody Service, which they had termed an unbloody Sacrifice, as Lindan your Parisian Doctor hath truly observed. Which Chrysostome also stiled Spirituall (marke you) , Service, or Worship. Was ever Christ called , who is himselfe rather the person to be worshipped? Secondly, Reasonable, could this point out Christ's Body in the sence of the objected Fathers? suffer Chrysostome to resolve us. Chrysost. Hom. 11. Quid est rationabile obsequium? quod per animam, quod secundùm Spiritum offerrur: quicquid non indige corpore, quicquid non indiget instrumentis, neque locis, in quibus ipse quidem est Pontifex, ut mansue∣tudo, patientia, &c. Sacrificium laudis, justitiae, spiritus contribulai. Reasonable Service (saith he) is that which is performed with the minde, without Bodily helpe. Thirdly, The vnbloody Sacrifice is called Spirituall (as you heare) how shall this be properly applyed to the Body of Christ? You will say, not in it's naturall Essence, but in the manner of being Invi∣sible,
Impalpable, and the like. But we demand; the same head of a mans Body, is it more Spirituall in the darke than in the light? Lastly, all these termes in these Liturgies of Vnbloody Sacrifice, Reasonable Service, and Spirituall, are spoken before Consecration, when the Body of Christ, even in your owne Faith, as yet can have no being in the Eucharist; and therefore cannot be the Vnbloody Sacrifice here meant by you. Will you have the full substance of all these Reasons? The word, Vnbloody, whether it point out Bread and Wine, or the Act of outward worship in this celebration, cal∣led a Reasonable Service, and Spirituall Sacrifice, it must betoken a thing void of Blood, which no Christian Professor dare attribute to the Body of Christ. We proceed. Eusebius saith indeed, . Euseb. Caesar. l. 4. de vita Constant. c. 45. de Euth. Ali sacras literas interpretātur: Alii , & mysts consecra∣tionibus diuinum nu∣men placabant, & supplices preces pro communi pace offe∣rebant. Et Demonst. lib. 1. cap. 6. Sacrifi∣cium mundum. We offer an unbloody Sacrifice; but what he meant thereby, he doth not expresse, whether the Signes of Bread & Wine, which he elsewhere with others (as you have heard) called Sacrifices: or whether, as Basil and Chrysostome have done, he un∣derstood together the publike Service in celebrating the Memory of Christ's Death. This then concludeth not for an Existence of the Body of Christ, as of the Vnbloody Subject herein. But whereas furthermore you may observe that Eusebius (objected) calleth Non per cruores, sed per quas actiones summo Deo offeren∣das. After, there ol∣loneth an Oration of Constant ne, Ad San∣ctorum coetum. Tale Sacrificium peragi∣tur, vacuum langui∣ne, & ab omni vio∣len iâ. As ob. Dadus Dctor Paris. transta∣teth it. Godly Actions a pure Sacrifice, and opposeth this against Bloody Sacrifices; and also termeth Againe, Demonst. Evang. lib. 1. cap. 10. Has rursus [] i. e. materiae expertia Sacrificia, in∣telligentiâ praeditas hostias, Prophetica nunciant oracula? Immola Deo Sacrifi∣cium laudis—Hym∣nos & sanctas Orati∣ones celebrantes. Holy Prayers [] that is, without Materiall Substance, as he did the Celebration of the Sacrament [,] that is, Vnbloody: These shew that Eusebius meant a Sa∣crifice void of Blood; which neither the word of God will permit us; nor your Councell of Trent will suffer you to impute to the Body of Christ, and therefore must needs wound your Roman Ob∣lation of Body and Blood to the very heart. Nazianzene (objected) is as directly opposite to your Masse, as East is to West, and will strike the matter dead, calling it Nazianz. Invect. 1. adversus Iulian. ante med. [] i. e. Ve ab incruento Sacrificio manus elueret, per quod nos Christo, ip∣siusque passionibus, & divinitate communi∣camus. [Marke, In∣cruentum, per quod, is distinguished from, Christo, therefore was not Christ the Incruentum, objected by the Rhemists Annot. in Luc. 22. 19.] The unbloody Sacrifice, whereby (saith he) we communicate with Christ: Flatly differencing the unbloody Sacrifice, whereby, from Christ him∣selfe, with whom the Faithfull doe communicate in this Sacrament. Ambrose (objected) prayeth to God, Ambros. lib. 4. de Sacram. cap. 6. Sacerdos dicit, Ergò memores gloriosssimae ejus passionis, offerimus Tibi immaculatam hanc Hostiam incru∣entam, & hunc panem sanctum, & hanc oblationem salutis aeternae. To accept of this imma∣culate, and unbloody Hoast, which are the very words of your Ro∣man Suseipias in sublimi Ali tuo, per manus Angelorum, sicut accipere dignatus s munera Abel, &c.] To be expounded, as Bellarmine doth almost the same words in the Romane Masse. Masse, and which your Cardinall seeketh to justifie by S. Am∣brose. But this he cannot doe, except their meaning be both the same. Let then your Cardinall but tell us the meaning of the Canon of your Masse, and you will soone apprehend the Iudge∣ment of Saint Ambrose. In our Masse (saith your Accipiendo Sacrificium pro re, quae sacrificatur, negari non debet panem & vi∣num aliquo modo in Missa offerri, ac proinde pertinere ad rem, quae sacrificatur. Nam cùm antè Consecratio∣nem dicimus [Suscipe, Pater, hanc immaculatam Hostiam] certè Pronomen, Hanc, demonstrat ad sensum id quod manibus tenemus, id autem panis est. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 27. §. Respondeo ut. [Because the Cardinall doth often in this and other Chapters justifie the Romane terme of Masse, by the like in Ambrose.] Cardinall) it
is said, Receive, holy Father, this immaculate▪ Hoast; where the Pronoune This (saith he) doth demo astrate Bread and Wine, because spoken before Consecration. So he. And the Body and Blood of Christ (you know) are not Bread and Wine. Let Athanasius put Perod to this Section, who saith that Athanes. Melchi∣zedech dedit Abraha∣mo vinum meracum addito panis () frusto—hic typus fuit offerendi Sacrificium [] meruentum san∣ oblationem. Hist. de Melchizedeth. ad si∣nem. Tom. 2. Melchizedech) in giving read and Wine, was the first Type of an unbloody Sacrifice. But Melchi∣zedech's was Vnbloody, negatively, having no Blood at all in it. So was never the Body of Christ since his Resurrection, according to our Christian Beleefe. CHALLENGE. WHat a faire peece of service (doe you thinke) have these Objecters done, for the patronizing of your Romane Sa∣crifice, out of the Sentences of Ancient Fathers? whilest they, alleaging their words, citing their Bookes, and quoting their Chapters, have so handled the matter, as if they had meant, by prevaricating in their owne Cause, to betray it: seeing that it is apparant, that they have delivered unto us the worship, in stead of the thing worshipped, out of the Councell of Ephesus, Basil, Chry∣sostome, and Eusebius: Next by the word, Vnbloody, being spoken before Consecration (and therefore concerneth not the Vnbloody Body of Christ) they have obtruded the thing, Distinguished from Christ, instead of Christ, in the Testimony of Nazianzene. But especiaily, because in the [Doe but examine the places againe, and you shall finde Basil to have spoken of Service before Consecration? Chrysost. Of Blood  Wine, before Conse∣cration: Eusebius in one place is inter preted (by your owne Doctor and Translator) to have spoken of a Sacrifice void of Blood; Na∣zianzene speaketh of something in the Eucha∣rist, differing from Christ: to whom you may joyne Athanasius.] most, of the Sentences, the word, Vn∣bloody, must needs be taken negatively for want, or absence of of Blood: and so you may bid your Corporall Presence adiu▪ All which may be strong Arguments unto us, both of the deplorable Consciences of your Doctors, and of the desperatenesse of your Cause. Other Testimonies, wherein there is mention of Christ's Body and Blood, come now to be discussed. A Confirmation of the former Demonstration, from the use of the word, Vnbloody, in the objected Sentences, wherein the Fathers make mention of the Body and Blood of Christ. SECT. X. THis Objection seemeth to be of better moment than the for∣mer: but only seemeth. Clemens Bishop of Rome, the first of that name, calleth (indeed) the Eucharisticall Celebration Clemens Rom. Const. lib. 6. cap. 2. Pro Sa∣crifieio cuento, Ra∣tionale & incruen∣tum; ac illud mysti∣cum Sactificium cor∣poris & sanguinis Christ, quod insym∣bolum mor ejus c lib. ∣Const. cap. 26. Adhuc agimus Tibi gratias, Pater nostr, pro pretioso corpore & san cuj Aty∣pa celebramus, ut mortem ejus denuntiaremus, per ipsum enim Tibl glori. Athen.  unbloody Sacrifice of the Body and Blood of Christ. In which sen∣tence the Vnbloody Sacrifice is plainly distinguished from the Bo∣dy and Blood, whereof it is a Sacrifice; even as both the Act▪ and Service of Commemoration have beene oftentimes above, and are hereafter called of the Fathers a Sacrifice, in respect of the Object
thereof, which is the Body and Blood of Christ on the Crosse. This is manifest by two especiall Reasons; the first, because that which he calleth Vnbloody, he termeth also a Reasonable Service. Secondly, Clemens calleth the same Vnbloody Sacrifice the Signe and Type of Christ's Body and Blood, thereby distinguishing them from that Body and Blood whereof they are but Types. You will then aske, what is this Body and Blood, whereof they are said to be Types? Yea marry, This being known will set all straight. And Clemens telleth you, that it is his Precious Body, and his Blood shed, which (properly taken) all Christians professe to be Proper to his Body crucified, and Blood shed on the Crosse, for the proper object of our Typicall Remembrance, as we have formerly proved, and you your selves confessed already.

The manner of our Celebrating the memory of Christ's death, he calleth a Spirituall Sacrifice, and an Vnbloody worship; wherein, against the Iewish Sacrifice, he op∣poseth Spirituall against Corporall, as he doth Vnbloody against Bloody. But by, Spirituall, he meant that which wanteth a Body. Therefore by, Vnbloody, he meant that which was properly void of Blood. So farre was Cyril from signifying thereby the Vnbloody Body of Christ, as the subject matter in the Eucharist. As for the Body and Blood of Christ it selfe, which hee calleth Propitiation, Cyril expoundeth himselfe to meane (for so he nameth it) Christ slaine for our sinnes, which still wee say, and you cannot deny, is only the Object of our whole spirituall service of Remembrance and Commemoration. Both these former Witnesses have delivered their Testimonies, as spoken under a forme of Prayer, whereunto whether You or Protestants may more justly say Amen, judge you. The eighth Demonstration of the no-Proper Sacrifice of the Masse; Because the Ancient Fathers called the Eucharist a Bloody Sacrifice, which all you will confesse to be Vn∣properly spoken. SECT. XI. TAke but unto you your owne Allegations (set downe in the Salmeron. Tom. 9. Tract. 29. pag. 225. He∣sychius lib. 2. cap. 8. in Levit. Dicit Chri∣stum cum coenaret se∣ipsu occidisse.

Margent) of the Sentences of Antiquit, and you shall finde how the Ancient Fathers doubted not to say that Christ suf∣fereth, is slaine, slayeth himselfe, suffereth often in this Sacrament: and that His Passion and bloody Sacrifice is offered herein. Sayings of the highest Accent, as you see, and of no fewer nor meaner Fathers than these, Alexander, & Gregory both Popes, Chrysostome, Cyprian, Hierome, Cyril of Ierusalem, Hesychius, Pascatius. What
thinke you of such sayings? Can Christ be said properly to be Dead in this Sacrament? Quis unquàm Catholicus dixit Christum rursùs mo∣r? Rbera Ies. Com. in Heb. 10. num. 25. Never any Catholike said so (saith your Iesuit Ribera.) What then could be the meaning of such words? If you should be ignorant, your Cardinall Alan would teach you, and he would have you Observandum est Christum icet modo impassibili existat in Sacramento, tamen dici à Pat ibus mor∣talem, imò mortuum & passm in Sacra∣mento, eatenus qui∣dem, quatenus ex modo Consecratio∣nis, ipsaque vi signi∣ficationis Sacramen∣talis mors, & passio Domini commemo∣rantur atque reprae∣sentantur. Alan. Card. lib. 1. de Euch. cap. 38. sub finem. Observe what he saith: Christ is said by the Fathers to suffer (saith he) and to die in this Sacrament only so farre as his Death and Passion is commemorated and represented here∣in. And so speaketh also your Roman Gloss de Consecrat. Dist. 2. Quid sir. Hoc est, ejus Mors reprae∣sentatur. Glosse. What now hindreth but that whensoever we heare the same Fathers affirming that the same Body and Blood of Christ are Sa∣crificed in the Eucharist, we understand them in the same impro∣priety of speech, that they meant onely Representatively? especi∣ally when as we see your other grand Cardinall comming some∣what home towards us, and to confesse as followeth; Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 25. §. Re∣spondeo si, &c. Si Catholici dicerent in Sacrificio Missae verè Christum mori, ar∣gumentum Calvini haberet aliquid viriū: sed cum dicunt om∣nes eum non mori, nisi in Sacramento & signo repraesentante mortem ejus, quam aliquando obiir, tan∣tùm abest, ut Missa obliteret Christi mor∣tem, ut potiùs efficiat ut nunquam oblite∣retur. If Catho∣likes should say that Christ doth truly die in this Sacrament, this Ar∣gument might be of some force: but they say he dieth not; but in a Sa∣crament and Signe representing. So he; which yet alas is too little a Crevase for so great a Doctor to creepe out at. First, because there is as well a Figurative, as there is a literall Truth; for, If I should say of Easter day (said See above, chap. 5. Sect. 3. Augustine) it is the day of Christ's Resurre∣ction, I should not lie, and yet it is but the Anniversary day, betoke∣ning the other. When Christ said of one part of this Sacrament, [This Cup is the new Testament in my Blood] he spake by a double figure, said your Iesuit Booke 2. chap. 2. Sect. 4. Salmeron, yet truly. Secondly Christ, who is Truth it selfe, in saying of Bread, This is my Body, or Flesh, spake a Truth, as you all professe; and was it not likewise a Truth, when he called his Flesh Bread? yea, and also Io. 6. The true Bread. Thirdly, the Fathers, as they said that Christ is dead, & suffereth (as you now object) in this Sacrament in a Mysterie: so have They also said of his Body, in respect of the Eucharist, It is sacrificed in an Ambrose, August. above, Chap. 5. Sect. 5. Image, in a Sacrament, or Mysterie, according to that their generall Qualification, saying, It is the same Sacrifice which Christ offered, or Above, Chap. 5. Sect. 6. Rather a Remembrance thereof. And lastly, the Fathers, who named Baptisme a Sacrifice as well as the Eucharist▪ doubted not to stretch Baptisme up to as high a note as they have done the Eucharist, saying, Chryst. in Epist. ad Heb. Hom. 16. Baptismus est passio Christi. Baptisme is the passion of Christ: and Ambros. de Pnitent. lib. 2. cap. 1. In Baptismo crucifigimus in nobis filium Dei. In Baptisme we crucifie Christ. To signifie, that the Body of Christ is the Represented Object, and not the Re∣presentative Subject of this Sacrament.
An Elucidation of the Premises, by a Similitude of a Stage-play, manifesting how the same Vnproper Sacrifice might further∣more have beene called both Bloody and Vnbloody, by Antient Fathers. SECT. XII. A Similitude, for explanation sake, would be had; give us leave to borrow one from the Stage-play, for manifesting a Truth, as well as Boke 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 6. and Booke 6. Chap. 5. Sect. 7. you have done another from thence, for palli∣ating a Falshood. You may recognize with us that Tragicall end of the Emperour Mauritius, by the command of one Phocas, (once his slave) that grand Patrone of the Popedome, by privi∣leging the Church of Rome, to be the Head of all Churches, as divers of your owne Historians doe relate. But to the point. By the commandment of this Phocas (as you See Baren. Anno 02. &c. know) were slaine two of Mauritius his sonnes, three daughters, and his wife, and all these before his owne eyes, and at last the Emperour Mauri∣tius himselfe was also murthered. Were now this dolefull Spectacle acted on a Stage, might not any Spectator say (at the horrid sight thereof) This is a bloody Tragedie, namely, in respect of the Object represented herein? And might he not also say as truly, This is an Vnbloody Tragedie? to wit, in respect of the representative Subject, Action, & Commemora∣tion it selfe, wherein there is not shed any one drop of mans Blood? And from the same Evidence it will be easie to perceive, that the Greeke Fathers used to terme the Eucharist [] and the Latines Tremendum, that is, a Terrible and Dreadfull Sacrifice, (namely) for the Semblance-sake, and Analogie it hath with Christ's Death: even as one would call the Act, representing the cruell Butchering of the Emperour Mauritius, an horrible and lamentable Spectacle. This is a cleare glasse, wherein any may dis∣cerne the open visage of Truth, from the fained Vizard of Error. The ninth Demonstration, Because Antient Fathers likewise called the Sacrament of Baptisme a Sacrifice, for the Representa∣tion-sake which it hath of Christ's Death; which is Argumentum à paribus. SECT. XIII. WE shall not urge the Antecedent of this Argument, taken from Baptisme, before that we have made knowne the force of the Consequence thereof. First one of your Cardinalls thus, Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 15. Si Pa∣tres existimaunt Eu∣charistiam solùm sse Sacrament, & non etiam Sacrifici, nul∣la esset causa cur ali∣ter loquerētur de Eu∣charistia, quàm de Baptismo. Nusquam autem Patres Baptismum vocant Sacrificium, nec dicunt▪ Baptizare esse Sacrificare, vel immolare. Quo modo igitur possible est Patres in modo lquendi nobiscum; in sententia cum Adversariis conve∣nie? §. Hic igitur. Rusùs, Baptismus est Sacramentum Repraesentationis mortis Christi, Rom. 6. Et tamen nulli veterum baptismum Sacrificium Deo oblatum unquam appellaverunt: non igitur sola repraesentatio causa esse pouit, cur actio coenae Sacrificium appellaretur. Ibid. §. Tert. bapt. If the Fathers had held the Eucharist onely a Sacrament, and
not also a Sacrifice, there had beene no cause why they should not have called Baptisme a Sacrifice, it being a Representation of Christ's death: But the Fathers doe no where call Baptisme a Sacrifice. So he. Ano∣ther Cardinall thus, Card. Alan. Patres ausos esse nomine Sacrificii—quis pos∣sit cum Haereticis vel tenuiter suspicari, cum hoc solum eo no∣mine appllent, nec alteri ferè Sacramen∣to unquam tribuunt? Lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 14. Who can so much as suspect that the Fathers spake abusively, in calling the Eucharist a Sacrifice, seeing this is the only Sacrament, which they call a Sacrifice, and no other. Next, take your learned'st Iesuit with you, who would be loth to come behind any in vehemency and boldnesse, thus; Suarez Ies. In mutis Conc. vocatur hoc Sacrificium in∣cruentum—Solum est observandum, pro∣pter Haeeticos, qui hoc etiam ad meta∣phoram detorquenr nomen, Sacrificium. Sanctos Patres nun∣quam vocâsse Mini∣sterium Baptismi, aut alterius Sacramenti nomine Sacrificii, cum tamen Sacrificiū Mtaphoricè sumptū in eo conveniet. Cum ergo Eucharistiam simpliciter & absolu∣tissimè Sacrificium vocant, signum est os propriè de Sacri∣ficio loqui. Tom. 3. Disp. 74. Sect. 2. p. 952. Antient Fathers never called Baptisme or the Ministry thereof a Sacrifice; albeit they might have so called it Metaphorically: which we note (saith he) be∣cause of the Heretikes, who pervert the speeches of the Fathers, as if they had called the Eucharist a Sacrifice Metaphorically, and impro∣perly. So they, to omit M. Fisher, or one. Others. Now then if there be any sap or sense in these your Objectors, it is as much as if they had rea∣soned against us thus; If you Heretikes (for so they call Prote∣stants) could sew that the Antient Fathers did any where name the Sacrament of Baptisme a Sacrifice, which we confesse to be on∣ly a Representation of Christ's death, then should we need no other Reason to perswade us that the Fathers called the Sacrament of the Eucharist a Sacrifice also Improperly, only because it represen∣teth the Body and Blood of Christ Sacrificed on the Crossè. Thus for the Consequence, confessed by your chiefest Advocates. The Assumption lyeth upon us to prove, to wit, that the Fa∣thers called Baptisme a Sacrifice, even from the words of the Apo∣stle, Heb. 10. 20. where, speaking of Baptisme; he saith; To them that sinne voluntarily there remaineth no Sacrifice for sinne. Saint Augustine testifieth of the Doctors of the Church Catholike, be∣fore his time, that H. b. 10 26. [Vo∣luntariè peccntibus non relinquitur Sa∣crificiū pro peccato] Qui diligentiùs per∣tiactant hunc locum Apostoli, intelligunt de Holocausto Do∣minicae passionis, quod eo tempore of∣fert quique pro pec∣catis suis, quo ejus∣dem passionis fide baptizatus: Vt sit sensus, [Non relin∣quitur Sacrificium pro peccaris] hoc est, non potest denuò baptizando purgari. August. Tom. 4. Expos. ad Rom. Col. 1185, 1186, 1187. They, who more diligently handled this Text, understood it of the Sacrifice of Christ's Passion, which every one then offereth, when he is baptized into the faith of Christ. So that holy Father, who is a Witnesse without all Exception; yet if, peradventure, we should need any testimony out of your owne Schooles, the witnesse of your Canus may be sufficient, confes∣sing and saving, Melchir Canus. Quaeris quid Causae pleris{que} Antiquorum fuerit, ut Baptismum Hostiam appellaverint, ideoque dixerint non superesse Hostiam pro peccato? (Heb. 10.) quia Baptismus repeti non potest—Et quia per Baptismum applicatur nobis Hostia crcis. Hinc illi Baptisma translatitiè Hostiam nuncuparunt. Loc. Theol. lib. 12. cap. 12. pag. 424. That most of the Fathers by Sacrifice in this place understood Baptisme, which they so called Metaphorically, because by it the Sacrifice of the rosse is applied unto us. So he. Is not this enough for the understanding of the Dialect, and of the speech of Antient Fathers, both in calling Baptisme a Sacrifice, and of the Reason thereof, to wit, for Representation sake onely; and Conse∣quently, that the Body and Blood of Christ are not the representing Subject, but the represented Object of his Sacrifice? What bet∣ter satisfaction can the greatest Adversary desire, than to be (as now your Disputers are) answered according to their owne De∣mands?
The tenth Demonstration: Because the Fathers called the Eucharist a Sacrifice, in respect of divers such Acts as are excluded by the Romish Doctors, out of the Definition of a Proper Sacrifice. SECT. XIV. THE Acts excluded by your Cardinall out of the number of Proper Sacrifices, are Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2. §. Sed omissa. Omne Sacri∣ficium est oblatio, sed non omnis oblatio Sacrificium, hoc fit cùm rs oblata consu∣mitur. Oblations, or Offerings of any thing thing that is not Consecrated by the Priest, such as is the Offerings of Bread and Wine by the People, before it be Consecrated. Next Bellarm. Opera virtutum non sunt propriè dicta Sacrifi∣cia. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2. §. Haec. Non quae in sola actione consistant, ut Psal∣modia, genuflexio, & opus quodlibet ad honorem Dei factum. Ib. §. Secundum. Non quae in sola oblatione fita, ut aurum, argen∣tum, &c. Ibid. §. Se∣cundò. Non decimae aut primitiae. §. Sed in. Nec Patres appellant Sacrificium, id quod solum est figura, & commemoratio Sa∣crificii. §. Tertiò. Non pia voluntas, quia in∣visibilis. §. Secundò. Non Eleemosynae, quia non soli Deo oblatae §. Tertiò. Nul∣la reverentia externa, ut genuflexiones, pre∣ces, quia actiones transeuntes. §. Sexto. Passiones Martyrum, & alia omnia bona opera, largo modo—non autem propriè & in rigore, Sacrificia dici possunt. Ibid. cap. 3. §. Resp. Martyrum. All workes of Vertue are unproperly called Sacrifices. All workes which consist in Action, being transient, as bowing, singing of Psalmes, or the sole Commemoration of the Sacrifice of the Crosse: together with all such Acts performed to God, which otherwise are yeel∣ded to man, as the Gesture of Vncovering the head in Gods service, Bowing the knee, and all outward signes of Reverence, yea and all inward and invisible Acts of man in his will and understanding. All these spirituall Acts are esteemed by him to be unproperly called Sacrifices. But that all these kindes of Acts, so farre forth as they are exercised in the holy worship of God, are called Sacrifices by the Ancient Fathers, can never be denyed by any that ever was acquainted with their Writings. Now our Demonstration is this, that most of these Acts, which are here confessed to be Vnproper Sacrifices, being used in the Ce∣lebration of the Supper of our Lord, occasioned the Fathers to call the Eucharist it selfe a Sacrifice; and therefore they meant thereby no Proper Sacrifice. As first (by your owne Cassand. Liturg. cap. 22. Ordo celebrandi Missam, secundùm Romanos, celebrante Pontifice, extractus ex variis libellis—Ibid. cap. 27. Populus dat Elcemosynas suas, i. e. panem & vinum, tàm masculi quàm foeminae. Ibid. De veteri ritu oblationis panis & vini, Ien. lib. 4. cap. 32. Primitias creaturarum offerentes—Hanc oblationem Ecclesia sola pura offert Fabricatori, offerens cum gratiarum actione. Ibid. In expositione ordinis. R∣mani, exscriptis Greg. Papae. Oblationes fidelium fuisse tantùm panem & vinum—Et Collectae in usum Paupe∣rum, veltestitutionem Ecclesiarum, opportuno tempore, non inter solennia Missarum,—quae populi dona∣ria, non certè Sacrificia—Sacrificium autem, ficut Isidorus, dictum quasi sacrum factum, quià prece mystica consecratur. Cassand. ibid. Non ignoramus veteres Theologes appellâsse Eucharistiam Sacrificium laudis. Malde∣nas. lib. de 7. Sacram. Tom. 1. part. 3. §. Praeter haec. pag. 322. Confession) that the Fathers called The oblations of Bread and Wine, made by the people, before Consecration, Sacrifices; the Almes, and Collections for the poore Sacrifices; Our Praises and Thanksgiving to God (where∣of the Eucharist hath it's name) Sacrifice: and that many other Circumstantiall Acts are called Sacrifices, even the Sole Act of our Commemoration, as will appeare in our last Examination concer∣ning the Doctrine of Protestants.
Our Eleventh Demonstration; because the Relatives of Sacrifice, which are Altar and Priest, objected as properly taken, are used Vnproperly of Antient Fathers. SECT. XV. YOur Cardinall his Objection is this; that Priest, Altar, and Sacrifice are Relatives, and have mutuall and unseparable De∣pendance one of each other. So he, and truly. But you ought to take with you a necessary Caution, observed by the same Bellarm.—Sunt Relata, ità ut Sacri∣ficium propriè  sacerdotio propriè dicto: & Sacrificio impropriè dicto im∣propriè dictum sacer∣dotium respondeant. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2. §. Quintum. Car∣dinall, that An unproper Sacrifice cannot infer a proper Priest-hood: nor an unproper Priest-hood a proper Sacrifice, &c. otherwise, your Iesuit can tell you of a Maldonat. Ies. Ser∣pens aeneus fuit Sa∣crificium commemo∣rativum futuri Sacri∣ficii Christi, sed ta∣men non habuit al∣tare. Lib. de 7. Sa∣cram. Tom. 1. de Euch. §. Quintum genus. Sacrifice without an Altar, and your Abulens. in Ios. 22. Altare hoc non fue∣rat ad Sacrificium of∣ferendum. Quaest. 9. Bi∣shop can point you out an Altar without a Sacrifice. Now to take one of these improperly, and the other properly, were as wilde Sophistrie, as from a woodden leg to infer a Body of Flesh. Now what if we shall say of this point of Appellations, that It was not so from the beginning? Hereunto we claime but your owne com∣mon Confessions, viz. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 17. §. Ne∣que.—Ne{que} obstat quod Ministri Eccle∣siastici non diceban∣tur Sacerdotes, aut utebantur nominibus Templi, Sacrificii, Al∣taris, & similibus, quia tempore Apostolorū, vigebat Sacerdorium Judaicum, ideo absti∣nebant ab iisdem vo∣cibus, ne viderentur cosdem illos ritus in∣novare. That the Apostles did willingly abstaine from the words of Sacrifice, Priest, and Altar. So your Cardinall, and Eodem modo Du∣rantus de Ritibus, lib.  cap. 1. num. 7. Durantus, the great Advocates for your Romane Masse: whereby they have condemned not only other your Romish Di∣sputers, who See above, Chap. 3. Sect. 8. have sought a proofe of a proper Sacrifice in your Masse from the word Altar, used by the Apostle Paul, Heb. 13. but also themselves, who from Saint Luke, Act. 3. [] See above, Chap. 2. Sect. 1. concluded a proper Sacrifice. As if the Apostles had both ab∣stained and not abstained from the words of Priest and Sacrifice. But the Apostles did indeed forbeare such termes in their spee∣ches, concerning Christian worship, whereof these your forena∣med Disputers can give us a Reason, See the former Te∣stimonie at (d.) Least that (say they) the Iew∣ish Priest-hood being as yet in force, Christians might seeme, by using Iewish Termes, to innovate Iewish rites. Which is enough to shew, you are perswaded they abstained from the use of these words for some reason. Yet that this could not be the Reason, you may be sufficiently instructed in the word, Baptisme, this being as fully Iewish, as was either the word Priest, Altar, or Temple: and yet used of the Apostle without danger of Innovation of Iewish man∣ner of Baptismes: yea, and if the Apostles had thought the Altar, Priest, Sacrifices, to be essentiall parts of Christian Religion, they neither would nor ought to have concealed the words and names, least thereby they might have seemed to have abhorred the pro∣per Characters of our Christian Profession. We descend to the Fathers. It is not unknowne unto you, how the Fathers delighted themselves, in all their Treatises, with Iewish Ceremoniall Termes, onely by Allegoricall allusions, as they did with the word Synagogue, applying it to any Christian assembly; as Arke to the Church; Holocaust, to Mortification; Levite, to Deacons▪ Incense, to Prayers and Praises; and the
word Pascha to the day of the Resurrection of Christ. But if any should say, that these Fathers used any of these words in a proper signification, he should wrong both the common sense of these Fathers, and his owne Conscience. It were superfluous to urge many Instances, where one will serve. The word Altar, applyed to the Table of the Lord (which anciently stood in the Euseb. Hist. lib. 10. cap. 4. Sanctuario hoc modo absoluto, Alta∣rique tanquàm San∣cto Sanctorum in medio Sanctuarii si∣to; ne à plebe eò pos∣sit accedi, cancellis ex ligno fabrifactus circumclusit. Coccius Tom. 2. Tract. de Altari, in vita Antonii. Altare à multitudine cir∣cumdatum. Chrysost. de visione Angelorum, lib. 6. de Sacerdotio.— & Doxys. Hierarch. Eccles. cap. 3. . [These Testimonies verifie the same Assertion of Dt. Fulke against Greg. Martin, cap. 17. The Table stood so, that men might stand round about it.] Middest of the Chancell, so that they might compasse it round) was farre more rarely called  of the Greekes, or Altare of the Latines, than , and Mensa, that is, Table; which they would not have done, if Altar had carried in it the true and absolute proper∣ty of an Altar: no, but they used therein the like liberty, as they used to doe in Aug. quast. super Exod. lib. 2. cap. 9. Al∣tare est populus Dei. Lib. 1. de Serm. in mon∣ie. Altare in interiore Dei templo, i. e. fides. Lib. 10. de Civitat. Dei, cap. 4. Ejus est Altare cor nostrum. And other Fathers ordinarily. applying the name Altar to Gods people, and to a Christian man's Faith and Heart. Will you suffer us to come home to you? The Father Gregory Nazianzen, for his soundnesse of Iudgement surnamed the Di∣vine, comparing this Inferiour Altar, and Sacrifice on earth, with the Body of Christ seated in Heaven, saith that the Sacrifices, which he offereth in his Contemplation at the Altar in Heaven, are Nazian. Orat. 28.—Esto, ego pellor ab Altari in Ecclesia: at novi aliud Altare mentis & contemplationis in coelo, ibi adstabo, & Deo offerani Sacrificia, quae sunt tanto accep∣tiora, quàm ea quae offerimus ad Altare, quantò pretiosior est veritas quàm umbra. More acceptable than the Sacrifices, which are offered at the Altar below, as much as Truth is more excellent than the Shadow. So he. Therefore (say we) the Sacrifice of Christ his Body and Blood are subjectively in Heaven, but objectively here in the Eucharist; here Representative only, as in a shadow, but in Heaven presentative∣ly, in his bodily presence. So vainly your Disputers hitherto (whilst that we required Materials) have objected against us bare words, phrases, and very shadowes. Lastly, Cyril of Alexandria Cyril Alex. cont. Iulian. lib. 9. (Iulian. Ob.) Judaei sacrificant,—vos autem invento novo Sacrificio—quarè non sacrificatis?—illud commune nobiscum habent, etiam Templa, Altaria, &c. (Resp. Cyril. multò post.) Vitae honestas, & ad me∣liora propensio est Sacrificium fragrantissimum—Et Paulus hortatur nos exhibere corpora nostra Sa∣crificium sanctum, rationalem cultum nostrum Deo.—Igitur etsi Judaei sacrificarent, ut in umbris praecepta implerent, nos tamen larâ viâ cuntes, ad id quod rectum est veniemus, nempè spiritualem & immortalem cultum proficientes. (Iulian.) Mosi dicitur, septem diebus azymis vescemini: vobis parum est abstulisse. (Cyril. Resp.) Im∣pletur Lex à nobis in Azymis, maximè fide justificatis in Spiritu, mentalemque cultum praeponentibus tali modo.—Undè scribit. D. Paulus, ut diem agamus in Azymis synceritatis & veritatis. (Rursus Iulian. ibid. lib. 10.) Offerre Sacra in Altari, & sacrificare cavetis. (Resp. Cyril.) Adnibemus Sacrificia spiritualia, sc. & mentalia: nam illi ex sanguine offerebant boves, & oves,—Et ex fructibus similam, eleas, &c. nos tamen tam crasso ministe∣rio relicto tenue & subtile, at spirituale perficimus: offerimus enim in odorem suavitatis fidem, spem, charitatem, justitiam, laudes. Sacrificium enim secundùm naturam incorporeum decet Deum. (Iulian.) Et Cain obtulit Sa∣crificium de fructibus terrae: Abel de carnalibus. (Cyril. Resp.) Offerimus meloddam quàm illi—Sacri∣ficamus enim mentalitèr & spiritualitèr virtutum fragrantias. (Rsus Iulian. Ob.) Non circumcidimini, non Azy∣ma, non Pascha servatis. Non possumus, inquiunt, (viz. Christiani:) pro nobis enim sen el immolatus est Chri∣stus, & prohibuit Azyma—non Abraham imitantes Altaria erigitis Deo, nec sacrificatoria aedificatis. (Resp. Cyrill.) Circumcisionem habemus Spiritus—In Azymis spiritualia quae habemus. (Et ad Pascha Resp.) Affulsit veritas, Immolatus est pro nobis Christus Agnus verus. made an Answer to the Objecti∣ons then published by Iulian the Apostate against the Truth of Christian Religion. By this conflict betweene these two wits, as it were by the clashing of a Stone and Steele together, such a flash of lightning will appeare, as may sufficiently illuminate every Reader, for the understanding of the judgement of Anti∣quity
thorowout the whole Clause; concerning Bodily Sacrifice. The Apostate objecteth (See the Margent) as an exception against Christians that they are not Circumcised▪ that they use no Azymes, nor keepe the Passeover of the Iewes: albeit, Gain, Abel, and Abraham before the Law, and the Israelites under the Law, and Heathenish Grecians, alwaies without that Law, offered Sa∣crifices unto God. But they (saith Iulian, writing of Christians) erect no Altars unto God, offer no such Sacrifices as were of old, nor invent any new, but say that Christ was once offered for them. This Objection (you see) is pertinent to our Cause in hand, and as consonant will the Answer of the holy Patriarch Cyril be; who to the other points held it Satisfaction enough to say (see againe the Marginals) That we Christians have the spirituall Circumcision of the heart: That we observe the Spirituall Azymes of Syncerity and Truth: And as for the Passeover, Christ our Passeover was offe∣red up, namely upon the Crosse (for so is it answerable to the words objected by Iulian.) And to the Objection of not erecting Altars, Cyril saith not a word. But what for the point of Sacrifice? Hearken (we pray you) Although (saith he) the Iewes Sacrificed to fulfill God's precepts in shadowes, yet we doing that which is right, (meaning the Truth op∣posite to Shadowes) performe a spirituall, and mentall worship, as namely, Honesty, and an holy Conversation. And againe, The Iewes offered in Sacrifice Bulls and Sheepe, first fruits of the Earth, Cakes, and Frankincense: but wee offer that which is spirituall, to wit, Faith, Hope, Charity, and Praises; because an unbodily Sacrifice is fit for God. And yet againe, We Sacrifice to God spiritually, and mentally, the perfumes of vertues. This is the Summe of Saint Cyril his Answer, void of all mention of any Offering of the Body of Christ, as either Corporally present in the Eucharist to be Sacri∣ficed by the Priest, or yet of any Corporall Touch thereof (by eating) with the Bodies of Communicants; no nor any intimation of any Proper Sacrifice professed by Christians. Here will be no place for your Answer, to tell us that the Que∣stion was of Bloody, and not of Vnbloody Sacrifices: No, for Cyril in his Answer handleth as well the unbloody Sacrifice of Cain, as the bloody Oblation of Abel; and expresseth as fully the un∣bloody Sacrifice of Cakes and Frankincense, as he doth the Bloody of Sheepe, and Oxen. Neverthelesse, we should confute our selves, by objecting this Testimony, seeing that the Custome of the Primitive Church being then professedly not to reveale the Mystery of the Sacra∣ment of Baptisme, or of the Eucharist, either to Infidels or Cate∣chumenists, and therefore this silence of Cyril, in not so much as mentioning the Sacrifice of the Masse, might seeme to have beene purposely done, to conceale it from both Iulian, the Patron of Heathenish worship, and all Infidels: So indeed we should have
thought, but that then Iulian and Cyril both would as readily confute us; Iulian, because he himselfe had beene more than a Catechumenist in the Church of Christ, even (as namely Gregory Nazienzene witnesseth) once Greg. Nazian. O∣rat. 3. advers. Iulian. (De Gallo & Iulian.) Quinetiam in Cle∣rum seipsos ascripse∣runt, ut divinos quo∣que libros plebi lecti∣tarent: non minus id sibi amplum & hono∣rificum existimantes quàm aliud quidvis, &c. A Reader of Scriptures to the peo∣ple, not thinking it any Derogation unto him so to doe; therefore was he not ignorant of the then Christian Doctrine, concerning the Eucharist. And (which is a point as observable) when he ob∣jecteth against Christians want of Sacrifices, by and by, as if Chri∣stians had nothing to say for themselves, but that Christ gave up himselfe once; he expresseth this their Answer, as that which hee held not to be sufficient. And Cyril also would controll us, who in his whole Answer (opposing Spirituall to Corporall) defen∣deth no Sacrifice at all among Christians, but that which he cal∣leth Spirituall and mentall; as for example, Godly Conversation, Faith, Hope, Charity, Praises, &c. All which are S hereafter, Chap. 4. Sect. 3. excluded out of your Definition of Proper Sacrifice. The Case then is plaine. If that the now Romish Doctrine of a Proper Bodily Sacrifice of Christ's Body, offered up in the hands of the Priest, by an Elevation, and after in Consummating the same by eating it with his mouth, which you call a Sacrificing Act, had beene Catholike learning in that Age, then assuredly could neither Iulian have challenged Christians for no Sacrifice, nor Cy∣ril have defended them, by confessing indeed no Sacrifice among Christians, but only Spirituall and Mentall. CHAP. VI. Our third Examination, which concerneth your Professi∣on of the Romish Masse, by your Romish Principles. The State of the Question. WELL have you discerned of the two-fold accep∣tion of a Proper Sacrifice, which (as Bellarm. Sacrifi∣cium Missae accipitur propriè pro re, quae sacrificatur: & etiam accipitur propriè pro actione sacrificandi. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 27. §. Resp. ut. you say) Is sometime taken for the thing sacrificed, and also for the proper sacrificing Act. So your Cardinall: and indeed, both these are necessary in a proper Sacrifice, yet neither of these can possibly be found in your pre∣tended Sacrifice of your Romish Masse. That the Thing, pretended to be Sacrificed, is not properly in the Romane Masse. SECT. I. THe things, which your Romish Beleefe professeth to be Sa∣crificed in your Masse, is the Body and Blood of Christ, cor∣porally
extant therein, as the proper Subject thereof. But that there is no Corporall existence of Christ's Body in the Eucharist, was the Conclusion of our second, third, and fourth Bookes. And that the same Body and Blood of Christ is not the proper subject matter of the Sacrifice, used in your Masse, is our Conclusion tho∣row out this whole Booke. Of both which you may have a Synop∣sis and generall view in the last Booke. Thus of the thing Sacri∣ficed, now that which followeth, concerning your Romish Sacri∣ficing Act, is a point briefly expedited by two Propositions. I. That no Act now used in the Romane Masse can truly bee called a proper Sacrificing Act: proved by your owne Principles. SECT. II. WHatsoever Sacrificing Act your Advocates have held, as Proper to a Sacrifice; and assumed, as belonging to the Sacrifice of your Masse, have each one beene See above, Chap. 1. Sect. 5. Confuted by Do∣ctors of your owne Church, of singular estimation; and rejected, as utterly insufficient to prove any proper Sacrificing Act in the Institution of Christ: to wit, not Elevation, not Fraction, not Ob∣lation, not Consecration, and lastly, not Consumption of the Eucha∣rist by the mouth of the Priest: Non licet actum agere, said one, and Non libet, say we. But now are we to discusse such Properties as are yet awanting in your Romish Execution. II. That that which is properly a Sacrificing Act, is wanting in the Romane Masse; proved by your owne Principles. SECT. III. THree properties are required of you, as necessary to a pro∣perly Sacrificing Act, the first is, that the Action be exerci∣sed upon a thing Conc. Trid. Chri∣stus tradebat visibile Sacramentum sub specie panis & vini. Sess. 22. & Bellar. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 27. §. Secundo. Visible. Secondly, that the thing sacrificed be of Septimò, ritu mystico consecratur: nam debet res illa, quae Deo offertur, ex profanâ fieri sacra. Idem significat Sacrificare, quod sacrum facere. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2. Prophane, made sacred by the Act of Consecration. Thirdly, that the Act be a Bellarm. Octavò, transmutatur, quid ad verum Sacrificium requiritur, ut id, quod offertur Deo, planè destruatur, i. e. it mutetur, ut desinat esse id qod antè erat, In quo differt à simplici oblatione, quae interdum mystico ritu elevabatur coram Deo, sed non destruebatur, nisi quando verè sacrificabatur. Ratio duplex, 1. b significationem mortis Christi. 2. ad protestationem subjectionis nostrae coràm Deo—Ideò requiritur, ut non solum usus, sed etiam substantia consumatur.—Sacrificium requirit Consumptionem. Pater, , est à , mactare. Matth. 22. Altilia diunt  occisa, , i. e. Exhalario, in quo differt ab oblatione; Item  dicitur à , consumo. Probatur ex Scriptura, ubi omnia Sacrificia destruenda erant, si viventia, per occisio∣nem; si inanimata solida, per combustionem; si liquida, per effusionem. Ex inanimis solidis per immolationes, sic dictas à mola, vel molendo, quamvis vox, Immolare, pro sacrificare sumatur. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2. per totum. Et idem ibid. cap. 4. §. Nunc. Destructive Act, whereby the thing offered be truly destroyed, and cease to be in substance that which it was. Ac∣cording to your owne objected words, , and , signifying a Consumption; and therein answerable to the Sacrifices of the old Law, all which suffered Destruction; things living by slaughter,
things without life, if solid, by burning; if liquid, by powring out, and shedding, &c. So you in Thesi, wee descend to the Hypothesis. But before we enter into this Disquisition, we shall desire you to take unto you the spirits of reasonable men, whilest we reason the matter with you in few words. First, it cannot be called Pro∣perly Visible, which is not Visible in it selfe. But the Body of Christ, which you call the thing sacrificed, is not Visible in it selfe, but only (as your Councell of Conc. Trid. ad Bellarm. above cited, §. 3. at a. Trent hath taught) In the forme of Bread; and then, how invisible it is, only blinde men can be ignorant. Nor will we thinke All, among you, to be so blinde, seeing that we heare one (and that a Iesuite) acknowledging his eye-sight, and plainly, without Parables, saying, that Salmeron. Chri∣stus cruentus, & in∣cruentus, non diffe∣runt, sed quod ille vi∣sibilis, hic invisibilis. Tom. 9. Tract. 29. §. Jam do. Christ in the Eucharist is invisible. So he. Therefore the first Property of a proper Sa∣crificing Subject is wanting in Roman Masse. Secondly, we will not judge any of you so blasphemous, as to say, that the Body of Christ, by your Consecration, is of a Profane thing made sacred, which we are sure your Ancient Romish Schoole did deny; which concluded that Aquinas. Béne∣dictio sacerdotalis fertur super terminum à quo, non super ter∣minum ad quem, i. e. super corpus Christi. In 1. Cor. 10. It is not Christ that is made sa∣cred, by benediction of the Priest, but that which the Priest first taketh in his hands to blesse. And so your Act of Consecration, by defect of the second property, is no proper Sacrificing Act of the Body and Blood of Christ. Thirdly, it will be as incredible in your owne Iudgements, that the Body of Christ should be properly Destroyed. We say, in your owne Iudgements, who therefore are constrained to say, Bellarm. Corpus Christi per consecra∣tionem accepit for∣mam cibi, & ad co∣mestionem & destru∣ctionem ordinatur: & licet nullam laesionem patiatur in se, neque amittit suum esse na∣turale sed amitrit Sa∣cramentale Esse, & proinde desinit esse realiter in altari, & de∣finit esse cibus sensi∣bilis. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 27. §. Tertiò. That the Body of Christ indeed suffereth not herein any naturall Destru∣ction, but onely Sacramentall, that is, Metaphoricall. Ergo, your Romish Masse is destitute of the proper Sacrificing Act of De∣struction. And againe, whereas the word Immolation is taken of Lombardus cum quaeritat quid Sacer∣dos gerit fit dicendū Sacrificium aut Im∣molatio, accipit no∣men. Immolationis pro occisione, respon∣det autem ectssi∣mè, Christum seml tantùm immolatum, i. e. occisum su∣isse, non autem im∣molari, i. e. occidi in Sacramento & re∣praesentatione. Rursus paulò sup. §. Ad hanc. Cruenta Immolatio semel tantùm verè & propriè facta est, nunc autem propriè, sed per Repraesentatio∣nem. Lib. 4. Dist. 12. §. Post haec. Lombard for being Slaine, or suffering by Death; It was most tru∣ly said by him (saith your Cardinall) that Christ is not immolated, meaning not slaine, but only in Representation. Well then, the State of the Question, as your Cardinall him∣selfe hath set it downe, is (seeing that every Proper Sacrifice requi∣reth a Proper Destruction, and, if it be a living Sacrifice, a Destructi∣on by death) Whether Christ bee properly Sacrificed, or no. Marke, we pray you, your Cardinal's Resolution. His bloody Sa∣crifice was but once truly and properly done, but now it is properly done but by Representation. O Vertigo! For, that which is but once onely properly offered, can never be said to be againe properly offe∣red; and that which is a Bloody Oblation, by your owne learning, cannot be Vnbloody. And as great an Intoxication is to be seene in your Disputers, in respect of the other part of the Sacrament touching the Cup: For your Cardinall Alan defendeth a Reall Destruction in this
manner; Alanus de Eucha∣rist. lib. 2. cap. 13. In carns & sanguinis se∣paratione (undè pro∣priè in animalibus ractatio) consistit vis hujus mysterii, ut in eo solo cernatur di∣vinae mortis reprae∣sentatio—sequitur Christum esse prae∣sentem modò immo∣latio—quod fundi∣tur in remissione pee∣catorum: ego per modū Victimae prae∣sens est, imò Christus hîc praesens induit eum modum, quem habuit ut se offerens in Sacrificio Ciucis. (Aliquantò post haec) Propter concomitantiam de qua superius diximus in seipso non mori∣tur. In creatures living (saith he) the thing sacrificed must be slaine, and in this slaying by the separation of blood from the Body doth consist all force and virtue of this Mystery, because Christ is here∣in, after the manner of Sacrifice, taking upon him the manner of Sa∣crificing, which he had in offering himselfe upon the Crosse, by sepa∣ration of his Blood. So he. All which doth inferre a Reall and Pro∣per separation and effusion of Blood; yet immediatly after stan∣deth he to the Defence of Concomitancy, which teacheth an Vnion of Body and Blood together, in as full a manner as it was in Christ his most perfect estate. But Blood Separated, and Vnited, are as  contrary as can be. How much better would it beseeme you to confesse plainly and truly with your Costerus, that Costerus Christian. In stitutionum, lib. 1. cap. 10. Christus in cruce solus scipsum obtulit per veram sanguinis effusionem & mortem: hîc per Sacerdotem, tanquain ministrum, se offert sine Sanguinis Effusione & morte, sed per utriusque repraesentationem. Christ is not offered here with effusion of Blood, but by a representation thereof. CHALLENGE. A Syllogisme will quit the Businesse; as for Example. Every proper Sacrifice is properly Visible, of Prophane is made Sacred, and properly suffereth Destruction. (This is your owne Proposition in each part.) But the Body of Christ, in the Eucharist, is neither properly Visi∣ble, nor properly of Prophane made Sacred, nor suffereth any proper Destruction. (This is also your owne Assumption.) Therefore the Body of Christ, in this Sacrament, is not a proper Sacrifice, nor properly Sacrificed. This (except men have lost their braines) must needs be every mans Conclusion. And that so much the rather, because it cannot be sufficient, that Christ's Body be present in the Eucharist, to make it a Sacrifice, without some Sa∣crificing Act. A Sheepe is no Sacrifice whilst it remaineth in the fold, nor can every Action serve the turne, except it be a destru∣ctive Act: for the Sheepe doth not become therefore a Sacrifice because it is shorne, nor yet can any destructive Act be held Sacri∣ficing, which is not prescribed by Divine Authority; which onely can ordaine a Sacrifice, as hath beene confessed. But no such divine ordinance hath hitherto beene proved. Is it not then a miserable case which you are in, to suffer your selves to be deceived by such Mountebankes, who pretend to di∣rect mens Consciences in the Mysteries of Christian Faith, and particularly concerning this high point of Proper Sacrifice? and in the end give no other satisfaction than by meere Riddles of a Vi∣sible, not Visible, Consecrated, not Consecrated, Destroyed, and not Destroyed, with Blood separated, and not separated from the Body; and each one spoken of the same Body of Christ. Our last point concerning a proper Sacrifice followeth.
CHAP. VII. Our Fourth Examination is of the Doctrine of PROTE∣STANTS, in the point of Sacrifice. IN discussion whereof, we are to consider first the Acts, which are incident unto the Celebration of this Sacrament: and then the Object thereof which is the true and reall Body of Christ, as it was Sacrificed upon the Crosse. In respect of the Acts we say, I. That Spirituall Sacrifices, albeit Vnproper, are in one respect more true, and doe farre excell all merely Corporall Sacrifices according to Scripture. SECT. I. WHen Christ called himselfe the True Vine, the True light, the True Bread; in respect of the naturall Vine, Light, and Bread; He taught us to distinguish betweene a Truth of Excel∣lency, and a Truth of propriety, by their different Effects. That which hath the naturall property of Bread (although Manna) pre∣serveth but the temporall life, for Iohn 6. They are Manna, and died: But the Bread of Excellency, which is Christ's Body, preserveth to Ibid. Immortalitie. It is a good Observation, which your Canus hath, that Canus. Quià per Sacrificia legis exter∣na res quaedā spiritu∣ales potiores praefig∣nabantur, has omni∣nò res Sacrificia, ho∣locausta, hostias sa∣crae literae appellant: ut mactationes bru∣torum animalium fi∣gurae erant mortifica∣tionis. Loc. Theol. lib. 12. cap. 12. §. In se∣cundo. Many spirituall things are called Sacrifices, in Scrip∣ture, because they were prefigured by the outward bodily Sacrifices of the Lambe: as the killing of Beasts were signes of mortification, which is a killing of sinne. So he. And the Thing prefigured (you know) is alwaies held more excellent than the figure thereof. First, the Sacrifice of Contrition, Psal. 51. 17. The Sacrifice of God is a Contrite heart. Secondly, of Righteousnesse, by Mortifi∣cation. Psal. 4. 5. Offer the Sacrifice of Righteousnesse. And Rom. 12. 1. Present your Bodies a living Sacrifice, holy and acceptable un∣to God, which is your reasonable Service. Thirdly, the Sacrifice of Prayer and Praise, Hosea 14. 2. We will render the Calves of our lips. Fourthly, of Almes-workes, Heb. 13. 16. With such Sacri∣fices God is well pleased. Fifthly, Sacrifice of Preaching, Rom. 15. 16. That I ministring the Gospell, that the offering up of the Gentiles might be acceptable, being sanctified by the holy Ghost. Sixthly, the Sacrifice of Martyrdome, Phil. 2. 17. Yea, and if I be offered up upon the Sacrifice and Service of your faith, &c. Next we say.
II. That all these Spirituall Acts, although improperly called Sa∣crifices, yet are they more excellent than all merely Corpo∣porall and proper Sacrifices; in the Iudgement of Ancient Fathers. SECT. II. VPon this Contemplation Ancient Fathers have breathed out many divine Ejaculations, for the expressing of the ex∣cellent Prerogatives of Spirituall Sacrifices, in respect of Corpo∣rall. Of the Sacrifice of Contrition, thus: Non terrenis, sed spiritualibus est Deo litandum. Tertull. ad∣versus Iud. eos. Gods wrath is to be ap∣peased with Spirituall Sacrifices. And Erant tum Sacri∣ficia pro delicto, quae nunc sunt Sacrificia poenitentiae de deli∣cto. Ambros. lib. 3. E∣pist. 28. They were then Sacrifices for sinne, which are now Sacrifices of Repentance for sinne. And Spiritus contri∣bulatus.—Ostendit Deus, se velle Sacri∣ficium, non trucidati pecoris, sed contriti pectoris. Aug. de Ci∣vit. Dei. lib. 10. cap. 5. God sheweth he will not have the Sacrifice of a slaine beast, but of a contrite breast. Of the Sacrifice of Righteousnesse thus, Mundo moriens, ipse est Sacrificium. Idem. He that dieth to the world is for himselfe a Sacrifice. And Tunc corpora pro corporibus; nunc non corpora, sed vi∣tia corporis perimen∣da. Arnob. cnt. Genes. Then were creatures slaine to cleanse mens bodies: but now are men to mortifie their vices: , &c. Isid. Pelus lib. 3. Epist. 75. Every one being made a Priest over his owne body, to over-rule vi∣ces. And Illi offerebant o∣ves & boves: nos tàm craffo praeteriro Sa∣crifici subtile offeri∣mus, virtutes omni∣genas: Sacrificium enim minimè carna∣le, secundùm naturam incorpoream, decet Deum. Ambros. [The same which hee hath translated word for word out of Cyril. Alex. cont. Iulian. See above, towards the end of Chap. 5.] They offered those grosse bodies of sheepe: but we the more subtile and pure of vertues, because unbloody things best agree with God. And Chrysst. in Gen. Hom. 60. . This is a new and admirable Sacrifice. And Peusiota. lib. 3. Epist. 75. . The best Sacrifice is to have a pure minde, and a chaste Body. Of the spirituall Sacrifice of Prayer and Praises unto God, thus; Prae∣ces & Gratiarum actiones factae Deo, . Iustin. Dial. cum Tryphone Iudaeo. And another upon that Psal. 68. of David [Canticum laudis plus placet Deo quam novella] observeth in the Hebrew an elegant Allusion, as if it had beene said, Deomagis placet Schir, quàm Schior, id est Canti∣cum, quàm vitulus. Bellarm. ibid. These are most perfect and onely Sacrifices acceptable to God. Of Preaching the word of God thus, Gladio verbi mactans vitia. Hieron. & rursus in Psal. 26. Hostia jubilatio∣nis, hostia praedicationis. We stay vices with the sword of the word. And of The Function Evangelicall, Chrysost. in Psal. 95. Munus Evangelicum Sacrificium mundum & immaculatum. It is a pure Sacrifice, and immaculate. And Sacrificium praedicationis omnibus aromatibus praestantius. Aug. A Sacrifice sweeter than all Spices. Of Almes∣workes thus,  dicunt, vel quòd eâ Deus prae Sacrificiis placere sibi testatur: haec sancta vestis aromata Sanctorum est. Chrysost. These God testifieth to be more pleasant unto him, than all the Sacrifices. And Vbi scriptum est, [Mi∣sericordiam magis volo quàm Sacrificium] nihil aliud quàm Sacrificium Sacrificio praelatum intelligi oportet: quoniam quod ab hominibus appellatur Sacrificium, fignum est veri Sacrificii. August. lib. 10. de Civitat. cap. 5. This is a true Sacrifice, whereof the other Sacrifices are but Signes. Of Martyrdome thus, Nos templum Dei sumus omnes, cor nostrum akare Dei, cruentas victimas ca dimus, quandò usque ad san∣guinem pro veritate certamus. August. ibid. cap. 4. We are God's Temple, our hearts his Altars: we then offer up our bloody Sacrifice, when we contend for the truth with our blood. In briefe, Verum Sacrificium est omne opus quod agitur, ut Deo in sancta societate haereamus: relatumque ad illum finem, ut beati esse possimus. Idem. lib. 10. de Civit. cap. 6. Every good worke done, to the end that we may enjoy God, is a true Sacrifice. Hi∣therto of our Proposition, by the Determination of holy Fathers: In the next place we say, for the Assumption,
III. That Protestants professe in their Celebration divers Sacrifices of chiefe Excellency. SECT. III. COrporall and Spirituall Sacrifices are by you distinguished, calling the first, Proper, and the other, Improper; but the spi∣rituall excelleth by infinite Degrees, as you have heard. In which kinde, Protestants, in their Celebration, professe foure sorts of Sacrifices. For proofe hereof, we may instance in our Church of In the Englsh Li∣turgie. England, most happily reformed and established. First, the Sacrifice of Mortification in Act, and of Martyrdome in Vow, saying, We offer unto thee, O Lord, our selves, our soules, and bodies, to be an holy, lively, and reasonable Sacrifice unto thee. Next, a Sacrifice Eucharisticall, saying, We desire thy fatherly goodnesse mercifully to accept of our Sacrifice of Praise and Thanksgiving. And why may we not, with the Scripture, call this a Sacrifice? seeing that your Bishop Iansenius held it for an Argument of proving Christ to have offered a Sacrifice, even Iansen. Christum in coena Sacrificium obtulisse, primum quidem satis est signi∣ficatum, cùm dicitur Gratias egisse: Gra∣tiarum enim actio est quoddam Sacrificiū, à qua Christi actione Sacramentum corpo∣ris & sanguinis Do∣mini nomen illud ab initio Ecclesia acce∣pit. Conord. cap. 131. Because he gave Thanks: giving of Thankes being a kinde of Sacrifice. So he. Thirdly, a Sa∣crifice Latreuticall, that is, of Divine worship, saying, And al∣though we be unworthy to offer up any Sacrifice, yet we beseech thee to accept of our bounden duty and service, &c. This performance of our Bounden Service is that which See above, Chap. 3. Sect. 5. Ancient Fathers called an Vnbloody Sacrifice. Nor is our Church of England alone in this Profession. This Truth we refer unto the Report of your Bellarm. Melan∣cthon Eucharistiam Sacrificium esse vult,—& Calvinus non solum  esse vult, sed etiam  & . Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2. §. Ac primum, & § Expendamus. Cardinall, and of Canus. Lutherani in Apologia Augusta∣na perperam Sacrifi∣cium definiebant esse opus à nobis Deo redditum, ut eum ho∣nore afficiamus. Loc. Theolog. lib. 12. cap. 12. §. Quibus rebus. Bel larm. Melancthon, di∣cit, Missam dici posse Sacrificium, quatenùs sumptio Eucharistiae fieri potest ad laudem Dei, sicut coetera bona opera. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2. §. Ac primum. Et Calvinus dicit, Sacrificium generaliter acceptum complectitur quic∣quid Deo offertur. Ibid. §. Expendamus. Kemnitius dicit, Sacrificium à Patribus dici Oblationem, Immolatio∣nem, & Sacrificium, quia est commemoratio & repraesentatio veri Sacrifici Christi. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 15. §. Aker modus. Ca∣nus, by whom you may understand the agreement betweene them, whom you name Lutherans, in their Augustane Confession, and of Calvin; by acknowledging not some one Act, but the whole worke of this Celebration (according to the Institution of Christ) both in Communication, Commemoration, and Representation of his Death, with Praise and Thanksgiving, to be a Sacrifice Eucharisti∣call: And also (to use the words of Calvin) Latreuticall, and Se∣basticall, that is, a Sacrifice of Worship and Veneration, which eve∣ry Christian may and must professe, who hath either eyes in his head, or faith in his heart: the Celebration of this Sacrament, in Remembrance of his absolute Sacrifice of our Redemption, being the Service of all Services that we can performe to God. Now wherein, and in what respect we may furthermore be said to offer to God a Sacrifice propitiatory, improperly, will after appeare when we consider Christ's Body as the Object herein.
That Protestants in their Commemoration offer up the same Body and Blood of Christ, which was Sacrificed on the Crosse, as the Object of Remembrance, and most absolute Sacrifice of our Redemption. SECT. IV. NOw we are come to the last, most true, and necessary point: which is the Body and Blood, as the Object of our Commemo∣ration. Still, still doe you urge the saying of Fathers, where they affirme that we offer unto God The same Body and Blood of Christ, on this Altar, even the same which was sacrificed on the Crosse; which therefore you interpret as being the same subject matter of our Commemoration, As is a King acting himselfe upon a Stage, as hath beene See above, Chap. 5. Sect. 7. shewen. We as instantly, and more truly, proclaime that we offer (Com∣memoratively) the same, undoubtedly the very same Body and Blood of Christ his All sufficient Sacrifice on the Crosse, although not as the subject of his proper Sacrifice, but yet as the only ade∣quate Object of our Commemoration; as when the same murther of the Emperour Mauritius is represented in a Stage-play in some manner of Resemblance: wherein we cannot possibly erre, having Truth it selfe for our Guide, who said, Doe this in remembrance of me, namely, of the same [Mee] meaning Christ as crucified on the Crosse, as the Apostle commenteth, saying, Hereby you shew the Lords Death till he come, even the Same Body, as the Same Death; whereunto beare all the Fathers witnesse, thorowout this Treatise. Whereby it will be easie for us to discerne the subject Sacrifice of Christ from ours, his being the Reall Sacrifice on the Crosse, ours only the Sacramentall Representation, Commemoration, and Application thereof. CHAP. VIII. Of the Second Principall part of this Controversie, which concerneth the Romish Sacrifice, is as it is called Pro∣perly Propitiatory. THis part is divi∣ded into an 1. Explication of that which you call Propitiatory. 2. Application thereof, for Remission of Sinnes.
The State of the Question of Propitiatory, what it is. SECT. I. THe whole Difference standeth upon this, whether the sub∣ject matter of our Representation in the hands of the Priest be properly a Propitiatory Sacrifice, or no. Now Propitiatory is ei∣ther that which pacifieth the wrath of God, and pleaseth him by it's owne virtue and efficacy, which (as all confesse) is only the Sacrifice of Christ in his owne selfe; or else a thing is said to be Propitiatory and pleasing to God, by God's gracious acceptance and indulgence. The Romish professe the Sacrifice of their Masse to be such, in the proper Virtue of that which the Priest handleth. For the Tridentine faith, concerning your Propitiatory Sacrifice, is this, viz. Synod. Trident. Sacrificium verè pro∣pitiatorium—Hu∣jus oblatione placatur Deus, gratiam & donū poenitentiae conce∣dens dimittit pecca∣ta, una enim eadem∣que hostia est, idem nam offerens Sacer∣dotum ministerio, qui seipsum in cruce ob∣tulit. Sess. 22. cap. 2. It is that whereby God being pacified doth pardon sinnes. And least that there might be any ambiguity, how it doth paci∣fie God, whether by his gracious Acceptance, or the Efficacie of offe∣ring, your generall Romane Catechisme authorized both by your Councell of Trent, and the then Pope Pius the fourth, for the dire∣ction of your whole Church, instructeth you all, concerning your Sacrifice of the Masse, that Catechis. Rom. (jussu Cns. Trident. & Pii Quarti Pont. editus.) Vt Sacrificium est, non solum merendi, sed & satisfaciendi quo{que} efficaciam ha∣bet. De Luth. num. 55. Osorius Ies. Conc. Tom. 4. de Missae Sacrificio in Psalm. 4. [Sacrificate Sacrificium.] Vnicum hoc Sacrificium est Sacrificium laudis, gratiarum actionis, expiatoriū & satisfa∣ctorium pro peccatis, & impetratorium pro vivis & defunctis. Ità tradit Conc. Tri. As it is a Sacrifice, it hath an Efficacy and Virtue, not onely of merit, but also of satisfaction. So they, as truly setting downe the true nature of a Propitiatory Sa∣crifice, as they doe falsly assume and apply it unto the Sacrifice of your Masse; which Protestants abhor and impugne as a Doctrine most Sacrilegious; and only grant the Celebration to be Propi∣tiatory (Improperly) by God's Complacency and favourable accep∣tance, wherewith he vouchsafeth to admit of the holy Actions and Affections of his faithfull. Triall of all this is to be made by Scriptures, Fathers, by your owne Romish Principles, and by the Doctrine of Protestants. In the Interim, be it knowne that our Church of England, in her 31. Article, faith of your Propitiatory Sacrifice of the Masse, as it is taught by you, that it is A Blasphemous Fable, and Dangerous Deceit. That the Romish Propitiatory Sacrifice hath no foundation in the Institution of Christ. SECT. II. YOur onely Objection is, that Christ, in the words of his first Institution, said, Take, this is the new Testament in my Blood, shed for you and for many, for the Remission of sinnes. Heare your Cardinall, Bellarm. Secun∣dum Argumentum su∣mitur ex his verbis Institutionis, quae a∣pertissimè docent Christum obtulisse in coena pro peccatis Apostolorum. Lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 2. §. Se∣cundum. These words doe most evidently teach, that Christ now in his Supper offered up his Blood for the sinnes of his Apostles. So he. But if this his Exposition of Christ's words be most evident, a∣las! what a number of other blinde Guides, of great estimation
among you, hath your Church favoured, pampered, privileged, and authorized, who could see nothing in the words of Christ, but the flat contrary? (namely) that they were spoken in the Pre∣sent Tense (Tropically) for the future, not that it was then shed, but that it was to be shed on the Crosse immediatly after; among whom have See above, Chap. 1. Sect. 2. beene reckoned Gregory de Valentia, Salmeron, Barradas, three prime Iesuits, your Bishop Iansenius, yea and the Author of your Vulgar Translation. And that you may the better discerne, how hard the foreheads of your Cardinall, of your Rhemists, of Mr. Breerley, and of such others are, who have made that Objection, you have beene like∣wise advertized, that in the very tenor of your owne Romish Masse it selfe, the word is expresly [In the fore-cited place. Effundetur] It shall be shed: We say in the Tenor of your Romish Masse, published by the Autho∣rity of Pope Pius the fifth, repeated by every one of your selves (you being Romish Priests) and accordingly beleeved of all the Professors of your Romish Religion. Which Interpretation was furthermore confirmed by See above, Chap. 1. Sect. 3. Fathers, and by Scripture (in the pla∣ces objected) and by a Reason taken from your owne Confession, granting that Christ his Blood was not really shed in his last Supper. This is that which we had to oppose unto that your Cardinal's Most evident Argument, as Sun-shine to Moone-light. That many things are said to pacifie and please God, which are not properly Propitiatorie, by their owne Virtue, according to Scriptures and your owne Confessions. SECT. III. IN Scripture, our Mortification of the flesh is called a Sacrifice well-pleasing to God. Rom. 12. 1. Almes, Workes of Charity, are likewise called Sacrifices, wherewith God is delighted, Heb. 13. 16. Comforting, and cherishing the Ministers of God, is called A Sacrifice acceptable, and well pleasing to God, Phil. 4. 18. So the Scripture. And that Spirituall Sacrifices are more pleasing unto God, than all the Hecatombs of Corporals could be, is a Confession, which we will take from the quill of Valentia the Iesuite, saying that Valent. Omne's actiones  rectè propi Deum ali∣quâ ratione censeri debent. Lib. 2. de Miss, cap. 5. Idem. Pe ratione Precibus pro∣pi vis in Scrip∣tura tribuitur, quate∣rius beneficia divina ex misericor Dei, per illas impetraus. Ibid. All right and just Actions may be said, in some sort, to be Propiti∣atory, and to pacifie God. As likewise of Prayer; Scripture (saith he) attributeth a Propitiatory force unto Prayers, so farre forth as we obtaine many Blessings of God, through his mercy, by them. So he. Which confirmeth our former Distinction of Propitiatory, by the mercifull Acceptation of God, distinct from your Propitiatory, which is of meritorious Satisfaction by its owne virtue: which mere man must let alone for ever. Thus of our Examination from Scripture.
The Doctrine of Ancient Fathers, concerning a Propitiatory Sacrifice. SECT. IV. ALbeit our Premises in the former part of this Controversie touching Sacrifice, and proving both by Scripture and an∣cient Fathers, that the Eucharist is not properly a Sacrifice, might give a Supersedeas to all your further contending by their Autho∣rity, for Defence of a Sacrifice properly propitiatory; because that which is not properly a Sacrifice, can no more be a Sacrifice pro∣perly Propitiatory, than that which is not properly a stone can be properly called a Mil-stone: Notwithstanding, we would be loth to be indebted unto you for an Answer to your objected Fathers, in this point also. The Objections, which you use and urge, are of two kinds: some, wherein there is no mention of the Body and Blood of Christ at all; and the other sort such, wherein they both are named and expressed. CHAP. IX. That the objected Testimonies of Ancient Fathers might well be understood to call the Celebration of the Eucharist A Propitiatory Sacrifice, in respect of divers Spiritu∣all Acts therein, without any Conceit of a Proper Vir∣tue of Propititiation it selfe. SECT. I. A Propitiatory in God's mercifull acceptance we de∣fend, but not in Equivalency of valour and Vir∣tue in it selfe. First, as it is an Act commanded by Christ, in which sence your Iesuit See above, Chap. 8. Sect. 3. Valentia saith, that Every right Act is in a sort Propitiatory. Secondly, as it is a godly Act, whereby we doe affiance our soule August. See above, Chap. 5. Sect. 2. to God, Every good worke, which is done that we may adhere unto Chrysost. Ibid. God, is a True Sacrifice. Thirdly, as it is an Act serving peculiar∣ly to Gods worship, for Religiousnesse is that (said Chrysostome) wherewith God testifieth himselfe to be well pleased. Fourthly, as it is an Act of Commemoration and Representation of that only pro∣perly Propitiatory Sacrifice of Christ upon the Crosse, wee must grant to your Cardinall, that Commemoration alone hath not any Propitious Efficacy in it selfe: But yet by the Propitiatory Sacrifice of Christ, resembled thereby, God vouchsafeth to be Propitious unto us; in which respect Origen. in Levit. Hm. 13. Siredeas ad illum que Deus pro∣posuit Propitiatorem per fidem, & fi respi∣cias ad illam comme∣morationem, de qua dicit Dominus, Hoc facite in commemo∣rationem mei; ista est sola commemoratio, quae propitium facit hominibus Deum. Origen exhorting Christians to resort
unto Christ, whom God hath made a Propitiation through faith in his blood, and also to reflect upon the Commemoration which was com∣manded by Christ, saying, Doc this in remembrance of mee: This (saith Origen) is the onely Commemoration which maketh God propitious. If any would say, how then shall we not make Commemoration to be Propitiatory in it selfe? We answer, as a man holding in his hand a pretious Iewell, which is inclosed in a Ring of gold, and putting it on his finger to preserve him from a Convulsion, the Preservative Virtue is not attributed to the Ring, but to the Iew∣ell; and yet we say, the Ring is the onely meanes to us, which maketh the finger capable of that Virtue. So say we, Christ his owne Sacrifice, which was the onely precious subject matter of our Redemption, is made now, by our Remembring, the Object of our Commemoration, and Application of it, for our Remission and Iustification. Nor is Origen alone in this, but all they (who were See Cha. 5. Sect. 11. many) whom you have heard saying that Christs Death and Passion, yea his Bloody Body is offered herein. Your owne Iesuite Salmeron is witnesse unto us (for the Councell of Ephesus, Eusebius, and Saint Augustine) that Salmeron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 31. 9. Postre∣mò supeest. pag. 238. Quidam Patres judi∣cant inprimis hac hostia expiari pecca∣ta, quòd cruentum memoret Sacrificiū. Hanc dicendi ratio∣nem sequitur Concil. Ephes. in Ep. ad Ne∣storem. Euseb. in De∣monst. Evang. lib. 1. cap. 10. August. in Psal. 75. They declared us to have expiation of our sins by this Sacrifice, because the bloody Sacrifice of Christ is remembred and commemorated herein. That we say nothing of our Supplications and Prayers, by which through the same Virtue of Christ's Propitiation, we obtaine par∣don and Remission of sinnes (whether for Quicke and Dead, be∣longeth not to this Dispute, because whether so or so, they are but Supplications still) together with many other saying Blessings from God. Nor of the Act of Thanksgiving, (from which this Sacrament is called the Eucharist) because this is the destinate end of our Celebration, and therefore of all our spirituall Sacri∣fices most acceptable unto God, for which cause See above, Chap. 8. Sect. 2. Iustine Martyr called it, by the way of Excellency, , that is, The onely gratefull Sacrifices. Lastly, in respect of our Applica∣tion it selfe, whereof in the next Section. That the Ancient Fathers called it a Propitiatory Sacrifice Obje∣ctively, for the Application of the Properly Propitiatory Sacrifice of the Crosse, made of the faithfull in Celebration of the Memory thereof. SECT. II. WHen it was asked why the Ancient Fathers called Bap∣tisme a Sacrifice, it was answered, See above, Chap. 5. Sect. 13. at the letter (c). Because the Sacrifice of Christ's Death was applied unto us thereby. Yet that Death, truly and onely properly propitious, is but onely objectively offered in Baptisme. The same may be said of the Eucharist, whereof
your owne great Schoole-man, and Bishop Canus. Satis est ut verè & propriè sit Sa∣crificium, quòd mors Christi ita nunc ad peccati remissionem applicetur, ac si nunc ipse Christus morere∣tur, id quod Scripto∣rum veterum testi∣moniis confirmatur.—August. Semel immolatus in seipso Christus, & tamen quotidiè immolatur in Sacramento. Pa∣schatius: Quotidiè Christus mysticè pro nobis immolatur, & passio ejus in myste∣rio traditur. Et Cy∣rillus in Conc. Ephes. Athanas. ad Antioch. Theophyl. in Hebr. cap. 10. Greg. demum Nazian. (ut coeteros omittam) hanc incru∣entam Immolatinē vocant. Lc. theol. lib. 12. cap. 12. §. Illud. pag. 422. Canus saith, that It is sufficient that the Eucharist be called a proper and true Sacrifice, because the Death of Christ is applyed thereby, as if he were now dead. Marke, As if he were now dead, which can be but Objectively only, and which (as you all know) is not your Priestly Sacrifice. As for the Ancient Fathers, who in their objected Testimo∣nies talked of Christ Cyrill. Mysag. 5. Christum mactatum offerimus, ut Deum propitium reddamus. Ob. per Bellarm. lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 2. Greg. Nyssen. orat. 1. de Resur. & Theophyl. in Matth. Dicunt mactationem esse in hac oblatione, &c. Suffering, being slaine, and dying in the Eu∣charist; We Protestants subscribe to their Iudgements with a full faith, in acknowledgement that Christ's Death, the proper worke of our Propitiation, is the only Object of our Remembrance and faith: which sayings of the Fathers (saith your Salmeron. Quod benignè interpretandum—nimirùm, mactationem antiquam Christi in cruce inveniri, non novam & realem ab e distinctam. Si in coena mactatus erat, quomodo ad nonam horam diei usque sequentis vixit? absurda haec sunt, & aliena à veritate. Tom. 9. Tract. 31. §. Quartò. Iesuit) must be understood Sacramentally, to signifie the reall slaughter of Christ offe∣red by him upon the Crosse. So he. Which againe proveth our Conclusion, that they understood a Propitiatory Sacrifice onely Objectively in the Eucharist. We will end with the objected Te∣stimony of Ambrose, thus, Ambros. Hîc imago, veritas in coelestibus, nunc Chri∣stus offertur, sed offertur quasi homo, quasi recipiens passionem. Ofert se ipse, quasi Sacerdos, ut peccata nostra dimittat, hîc in imagine, ibi in veritate ubi apud Patrem. Lib. 1. de offic. cap. 48. Here is an Image offered [Quasi, that is] as it were a man, as it were suffering a Passion, offering himselfe as it were a Priest, that he may forgive our sinnes. And of his now be∣ing See above, Chap. 3. Sect. 8. at the letter (c). elsewhere he saith, The truth is in Heaven, there is He in truth with the Father. So he. Whereby is confuted your Con∣clusion of a Subjective Body of Christ present herein, from [Quasi homo offertur:] for this any one may perceive to be but a Quasi Argument for a Corporall presence, and to make fully for our Di∣stinction and Defence thereby. Enough of the Iudgement of Antiquity. Our third Examination followeth. CHAP. X. Of the pretended Romish Propitiatory Sacrifice, confu∣ted by Romish Principles, as destitute of foure Proper∣ties of Propitiation. THE first is the Imperfection of the Sacrificer. The next, the no-proper Destruction of the thing sacrificed. The third, the Vnbloodinesse of the same. And the last, the but-finite Virtue and value, which you attri∣bute unto it.
I. Confutation, from the confessed Imperfection of the Sacrifice. SECT. I. FIrst the Reason, why you account your Propitiatory Sacrifice to be but of finite Virtue, is Bellar. Ratio 2. quare Sacriciū Cru∣cis sit tanti valoris, hoc autem finiti, su∣mitur ex parte offe∣rentis: nam Sacrifi∣cio Crucis ipse offe∣rens est filius Dei per se; at in Sacrificio Miss est ipse offe∣rens per Ministrum—Illa actio immedi∣atè producta à divino supposito, ipsa ab hu∣mano. Lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 4. Because it is not immediatly offe∣red up by Christ himselfe, as that was of the Crosse; but by his Mi∣nister. And the Reason of this, you say, is, Salmeron. Ies. Modò Christus in Eucharistia personā induit re oblatae: & quamvis Christus of∣ferat per Sacerdotes, ut Administros ejus, tamen virtus & causa universalis pro ratio∣ne causae secundariae operatur. Sacerdos igitur ejus nomine induit personam offe∣rentis. Tom. 9. Tract. 33. pag. 266. de Missis privatis. Because the Vniver∣sall Cause worketh according to the limitation of the second Causes. So you. Vnderstanding, by Sacrifice, not the Object of your Re∣membrance, which is the Body of Christ, as crucified; but the subject matter, in the hand of the Priest. From whence this Con∣sequence must issue, whether you will or no, (namely) that Per∣fection of the Sacrifice being a necessary property of a true Propi∣tiatory Virtue and efficacy in prevailing with God for man, it is impossible for any of your Priests (because All are imperfect) to offer up properly a Propitiatory Sacrifice unto God. None may hereupon oppose unto us the Propitiatory Sacrifices under the Law, because they also were twice imperfect; once in respect of the Sacrificer, who was but a mere man: and secondly, in respect of the matter of Sacrifice it selfe, which was some un∣reasonable beast, and had no Virtue of Propitiation in it selfe, for remission either of guilt, or of the eternall punishment of sinne, as hath beene See above, Chap. 5 Sect. 4. Confessed; and therefore not properly Propitia∣tory, but fiuratively; only as Types of the Sacrifice of Christ. II. Confutation from the Romish Definition of a Propitiatory Sacrifice. SECT. II. SEcondly, in your Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 2. See above, Chap. 5. Sect. 3. Romish definition, it is required that the Thing propitiatorily sacrificed suffer a Reall Destruction, (so that it cease to be in the substance thereof) and a Bodily Consump∣tion. Notwithstanding you are absolutely free from the Blasphe∣my, to say that Christ his Body doth in the Eucharist suffer pro∣perly a reall Destruction. Ergo, say we, by your owne Principle there cannot be herein a Sacrifice properly Propitiatory. III. Confutation from the Apostle's Position, against the Vnbloodinesse thereof. SECT. III. THe Apostles Position is this, that Without the shedding of Blood there is no Remission, Heb. 9. 22. Your Romish As∣sumption is; The Sacrifice of the Romish Masse is unbloody. Our Conclusion necessarily followeth, which is this; Ergo, say we,
your Masse-Sacrifice cannot be properly Propitiatory. Your Car∣dinall, in Answering first that the Loquitur Aposto∣lus de Sacrificis ve∣teris Legis,—Po∣test etiam absolutè & generatim accipi, quod quotiescunque fit remissio, fit sangui∣nis effusio: sed non nisi virtute effusionis sive nunc facta, sive post futura. Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 25. §. Ad illud. Apostle spake this of the Sacri∣fice of the old Law, onely standeth twice convicted of a foule Ter∣giversation; first, by the Apostles Explication of himselfe, who although he spake from the observation of the old Testament, Heb. 9. 22. yet doth he apply it to the state of the new Testament, in the same Chapter, vers 13, 14. But much more by his owne Conscience, who having spent some Chapters, in proving that the Sacrifices of the Law were Types of the Sacrifice in the Masse, doth now deny that this Proposition of [No Remission of sinnes without shedding of Blood] is to be applyed to the Eucharist. He is glad therefore to adde a second Answer, given by your Maldo∣donate, who finding no security in the former Refuge, betaketh himselfe to another, saying that Si accommode∣mus ad Evangelium, dicendum est, pecca∣ta nunc remitti, non propter praesentem effusionem, sed per praeteritam. Maldon. Ies. lib. de 7. Sacram. Tract. de Euch. imme∣diatè antè exitum Tom. 1. Remission of sinnes is not now for any present effusion of Blood, but for that effusion which had beene. Which Answer (if we may so interpret it) is a plaine Prevarica∣tion. The Reason may be this; first, because there was never Bloody Sacrifice (Christ on the Crosse excepted, which only was of infinite virtue, as well to times past, as to come) but it was alwaies actually by the effusion of Blood at the time of Sacrificing. These kinds of so ordinary Doubtings and Turnings, which your Disputers use, as men in a maze, doe plainly Demonstrate either their irresolute Iudgements, or else their dissolute Consciences; and in either of both their desperate Cause. We have not done yet, but give you further to understand, that as you could finde no proper Sacrificing Act, to make your Masse properly a Sacrifice, so neither can ye shew any propitiating Act, to make it properly a Sacrifice propitiatory. This we prove out of your Councell of Colen, which Si respicimus corpus Christi, quod continetur in Euch. quis negat esse pro∣pitiatorium, non ra∣tione oblationis, quā Sacerdos facit, sed ra∣tione Oblationis fa∣ctae in cruce? Conc. Provinc. Colon. de Mis∣sa, fol. 105. And a little after. Non propitia∣orium, ratione Sa∣crificii, quod est situm in actione Sacerdotis, seu Missae communi∣cantium, aut Eccle∣siae: sed ratione Sa∣crificii, quod in cruce oblatum. Concludeth, that your Masse-Sa∣crifice cannot be called Propitiatory in respect of any Act of Oblation of the Priest, or accommodation of the Communicants, or yet of the Church: but onely of the Oblation once made by Christ himselfe on the Crosse. Which oblation how absent it is, who seeth not, that is present with himselfe? Thus were those Divines driven to an Objective Act of Oblation. IV. Confutation from the Romish Disvaluation of that which they call Christ's Sacrifice. SECT. IV. THe last is in respect of the value, for Christ's Sacrifice on the Crosse you doe Christianly esteeme to have beene of Mirum non est, si cùm Christus infi∣nitus extitit, ejus ho∣stia fuit infiniti meriti & satisfactionis. Sal∣meron. Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 33. pag. 265, 266. Infinite merit and Satisfaction, because it was offered by himselfe: and that otherwise Erat infiniti valoris: nec enim aliter potuit compensari injuria Deo facta. Ribera Ies. in Heb. 10. num. 19. He could not have made Satisfaction to an Infi∣nite and Divine Majestie. So you. But of the Sacrifice of the
Masse, what? The common opinion of our Church (saith your Valor Sacrificii Missae est finitus. Haec est communis senten∣tia Theologorum: in quo distinguitur à Sacrificio Crucis—quod infinitae virtutis erat, & nunquàm re∣petitur. Bellarm. lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 4. §. Quarta Pop. [And yet it is knowen that Card. Cajetane, Cnus, and Scotus were of a contrary opinion.] To this last testimony of Ballarmine adde also Salmeron. Ies. Tom. 5. Tract. 33. §. Tertiò. Car∣dinall) is that it is but of finite value. So he. Notwithstanding it be impossible for any thing of finite virtue to have power in it selfe of remission of an infinite guilt against an infinite Ma∣jesty. CHALLENGE. A More palpable betraying therefore of a Cause there cannot be, than (as you have hitherto done) by defending Positi∣ons repugnant to your owne Definition, and by obtruding things as proper, which are void of all due Properties. This being all one, as if you, in the Case of Miracles, would deliver unto us a Iannes and Iambres, instead of Moses; in Art, Sophistrie for Lo∣gique; in Commerce , that is, adulterate Coine for cur∣rent; and in warlike stratagems, instead of a naturall, a Trojane Horse. Oh what a misery it is to reason with such unreasonable (to speake mildly) men! Thus much of your Romish Sacrifice, according to your owne Explanations thereof. CHAP. XI. Of the Romish Application of their Sacrifice. The State of the Question. THat the Eucharist was ordained of Christ, for the Application of remission of sinnes Sacra∣mentally to all Communicants, is the profession of all Protestants. That the Sacrifice of Christ's Crosse is therein offered up Objectively, by Commemoration and Supplication, for all Con∣ditions of men, hath an universall Consent among them, with∣out Exception. But that any substantiall Body, as subjectively contained in the Masse, can be the Sacrifice of applying the me∣rits of Christ for remission of sinnes, (which is your Conc. Trid. Ut vi∣sibile Sacrificium—quo cruenti Sacrificii virtus in remissionem peccatorum applica∣retur. Sess. 22. cap. 1. Tridentine faith) hath beene hitherto impugned and infringed thorowout our whole former Dispute. Furthermore our present Opposition is threefold: first, concerning the sinnes that are said to be remit∣ted. Secondly, touching the parties, who have Remission. Third∣ly, in regard of your Priests, by whom Application of Remission of sinne is made.
I. That the Church of Rome is not yet resolved of the Extent of the Virtue of her Sacrifice of the Masse, for remission of sinnes or Punishment. SECT. I. NEver can there be any true Application of the Passion of Christ for remission of sinnes (say we) which is not absolute, but onely partiall. Your Iesuit Ribera Ies. Quo∣niam quotidiè pecca∣mus, quotidiè vitu∣tem passionis Christi participamus, quod Conc. Trid. docuit, quo cruentum illud, semel in cruce pera∣gendum, repraesenta∣retur, atque salutaris ejus virtus in remissi∣onem peccatorum eo∣rum, quae quotidiè à nobis committuntur, applicaretur. Et hoc Catholicis quidem hominibus manife∣stissimum est, Haere∣tici negare non pos∣sunt, quoniam Scrip∣turae verbis apertissi∣mè comprobatur de virtute passionis, ad omnia peccata tol∣lenda. Rom. 3. & 5. Apoc. 1. 1. Joh. 2. Com. in Heb. 1. 10. num. 16. Ribera seemeth to come on round∣ly towards us, and friendly to joyne hands with us in this point of Application of an absolute Remission of sinnes, pretending that this was Decreed in the Councell of Trent, as indeed it seemeth to have beene, and that from the Authority of Scripture; and he ad∣deth, that Protestants (whom he is pleased to grace with the name of See the last Testi∣mony. Heretikes) doe not deny this manifest Truth. So he. Doe you marke? a Truth, a manifest Truth, a Truth said to be confirmed by your last Councell, and a Truth consented unto by the Heretikes, as being a manifest Truth. Who would not now looke for a Truth universally professed in your Church without all exception? But behold (even since that Councell of Trent) your greatly approved Melchior Canus steppeth forth with a peremptory Contradiction, saying, that to hold Opinio prima. Omnes culpas mor∣tales, & omnia pecca∣ta (post Baptismum commissa) per Sacrificium Altaris—sic vult Catharinus—Haec opinio non vera, nisi omnes Theologi fallantur. Ca loc. theol. lib. 12. pag. 432, 433. All mortall sinnes to be remitted by the Application of the Sacri∣fice in the Masse, is false, except all Divines be deceived. So he, speaking of the Divines of the Romish Church. Your Iesuit Valentia noteth, among you, another sort of Do∣ctors, maintaining that your Masse-Application serveth onely for Valet. Ies. Itaque sunt, qui censeant hoc Sacrificium valere tantùm ad relaxationem poenarum, quarum culpa prius condonata fuit. Lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 5. §. Itaque sunt. pag. 542. Remittuntur venialia. Costerus Christien. iustitut. lib. 1. cap. 8. Remission of such temporall punishment, the guilt whereof was for∣merly pardoned. So he. CHALLENGE. IF any shall but recollect the Contradictions of your owne Do∣ctors, thorowout out all these former points of Controversie already handled, he will thinke himselfe to be among the people called Andabatae, who first blind-folding themselves fell a buf∣feting one another, not knowing whom they hitt; therefore wee leave them in their broiles, and our selves will consult with An∣tiquity.
That the Ancient Fathers never taught any Application of Christ's Passion, but that which is for a Plenary Remission of sinnes. SECT. II. CArdinall Alan. Card. Pro iis peccatis, pro qui∣bus Christus mortuus est. Lib. 2. de Euchar. cap. 35. [Wherein hee bringeth the Testimo∣nies of Chrysostome, Cyprian, Theophy∣lact, and Origen, ex∣pounding them of all sinnes, adding also;] Ego verò nunquam invenio hujus Sacri∣ficii usum à Patribus ad pauciora restringi peccata, quàm ipsa immolatio crucis. Ibid. pag. 626. Alan hath put into our hands a consent of some Fathers, for proofe of an Application for remission of all sinnes, for which Christ died. The Fathers, whom he produ∣ceth, are these, Chrysostome, Theophylact, Cyprian, and Origen. If these will not suffice, you may take unto you these Calix—sive medicamentum & holocaustum ad sanandas infirmitates, & purgandas iniquitates. Cypr. de coena Domini. Vt cum Deo acceptum fuerit peccata dimittantur. August. de Civit. lib. 20. cap. 25. Omnis nocumenti est reparatio, omnis sortis purgatio. Daasc. lib. 4. defide, cap. 14. Omne crimen. Jul. Papa apud Gratian. de Consecratione. Dist. 2. Vt peccata nostra dimittat. Ambros. lib. 1. de Offic. cap. 48. [There might be added Justine Martyr, Dial. cum Tryphone, Chrysost. Hom. 13. in Ephes. Orig. Hom. 13. in Levit. besides the Liturgies of Basil, and others that are extant.] other, Iulius Pope of Rome, Iustin Martyr, Augustine, Cyril, and Basil. Doe you require any more? What needeth it? seeing that the same Cardinall further saith, There is found no Father to the contrary. Thus much of the Application, which is to be made by this Sacra∣ment, the next is, For whom. That the Romish Vse of a singular Application of the Sacrifice of the Masse to Non-Communicants, because of their present Attendance, is repugnant to the Doctrine of Antiquity. SECT. III. THE Greeke and Latine Churches anciently made up the whole Catholike Church. The Greeke pronounced an , that is, Be-gone, to all Non-Communicants: the Latine Church also ordained, that the Deacon should proclaime all Not-Commu∣nicants to Depart. From which Custome afterwards the word Masse had it's Orginall; namely from the words, [Ite, missa est] as See above, Book 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 9. hath beene confessed. But now the Case is so altered, that if any Non-Communicant being present shall in Devotion apply himselfe to your Romish Masse, your Canon Missa (De Applicatione)—& omnium Circumstan∣stantium, quorum tibi fides cognita est, & nota devotio, pro qui∣bus Tibi offerimus, &c. Canon of the Masse pro∣uideth that Application of your Sacrifice be made unto him for Remission of sinnes. And that, as your Iesuit teacheth, Hinc Suarez Ies. Quia oblatio hujus Sacrificii est fructuosa ex opere operato: ergò rationi consen∣taneum est, ut omnes, qui ad illam verè concurrunt, vel per proprium actum, se concursum moralem participent hujusmodi fructum talis oblationis. I 3. Thom. qu. 83. Art. 1. Disp. 79. §. 8. The fruit of the Sacrifice [Ex opere operato] redoundeth unto him; and not this only, but also to be Costerus Christian. Institutionum, lib. 1. cap. 8. de sacro Missae officio quotidiè audiendo. Quotquot adsunt & dign arant, spiritualiter corpore Domini reficiuntur per o Sacerdotis. Spiritually refreshed by the mouth of the Priest. Be you therefore intreated to lend your Attention, but for an Instant of time, and then tell us whether we speake Reason unto
you, or no. All Antiquity Catholike (as hath beene generally Booke 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 9. confessed by your selves) never admitted to that part of the Masse, which you call a Sacrifice, any but such as were prepared to Communicate, in receiving the Sacrament, but shut all others out of Doores; which, we say, they neither would nor could law∣fully have done, if they had beene of your now Romish faith, to beleeve that it is a Sacrifice Propitiatory for all such as devontly attend to behold it. For, wheresoever there was a Sacrifice of Ex∣piation among the Iewes, under the Law, all persons had li∣berty to partake thereof. We thinke that this Argument stick∣eth fast in the Bowels of this Cause. That the Romish Church lesseneth the due estimation of Christ's Passion, in her Applying of it to others, for the increasing of falsly-devised and unjust Gaine in behalfe of the Priest; without all warrant of Antiquity. SECT. IV. HItherto we have expected some Reasons, which might move your Church so to lessen the proportion of Christ's Passion, in the Application thereof for remission either of sinnes or pu∣nishments. And now at length your Iesuit Salmeron commeth to resolve us, saying, Salmeron Ies. Si hoc esset infiniti valo∣ris, & celebrata esset Missa pro redemptio∣ne omnium animarū, quae in Expiatorio carcere continentur, totum evacuaret Pur∣gatorium: quod non est credendum, quia frustrà tot Missae pro uo defuncto celebra∣rentur. Tom. 9. Tract. 33. pag. 268. De Missis privatis. If the Sacrifice of Christ's Body and Blood were of infinite value, then one Masse being said for all the soules in the Dungeon of Purgatory would evacuate and empty the whole place, and then should it be in vaine to say many Masses for one soule. So he. We may not so farre digresse, as to enter into this Con∣troversie of Purgatory, because we are to finish that which wee have now in hand. Else were it easie to shew, that the infinite gaine, which your Alchemists worke out of your forge of Purga∣tory-fire, hath occasioned this Heterodoxe and gracelesse Do∣ctrine of disannulling the infinite efficacy of Christ's Blood: which is so utterly forlorne of all approbation from Antiquity, that your Disputers have not alleaged so much as one Iota, out of any Fa∣ther, for warrant thereof. Next, in the Sacrifice of your Masse, there is (say Valent. Ies. Quae∣dam portio remissio∣nis competit Sacer∣doti ministranti, quae∣dam ei, cui Sacerdos vult peculiari inten∣tione applicare—Quae intentio non tantùm valet pro pluribus, ac si pro uno solo celebretur.

So you. Very well, but by what Law came your Priests to this peculiar power of dispensing a Portion for their owne advantage? Cardinall Alan.

to answer for you, and we are attentive to heare what he saith; There is not either any Scripture (saith he) or Father shewing any such thing for such a manner of esteeming the fruit of Christ's Sa∣crifice. So he. In the third place, whiles we are in this speculation, we heare one of you putting this Case. If the Priest shall receive a stipend of Peter, upon Condition that he shall apply his Memento and Intention upon the soule of Iohn, departed this life, and he not∣withstanding doth apply it unto the good of the soule of Paul, whether now the Priests Memento should worke for the good of the soule of Iohn, according to the Priest's Obligation upon the Condition made with Peter, or else for the good of the soule of Paul, according to the Priest's immediate Intention.

WHereas it is now evident, that your Romish Masse serveth so well for your no small gaine, by appropriating of a Priestly portion to be dispensed for some one or other soule for money, as it were the Cookes fee, and that but onely for the paines of a Spiri∣tuall Intention; yea, though it be to the Injury of the Purchaser: It can be no marvell, that we heare so often, and as loud shouts for your magnifying of the Romane Masse, as ever Demetrius, and his fellow Crafts-mates made for Diana, the Goddesse of the E∣phesians. It remaineth, that we deliver unto you a Synopsis of the Abomi∣nations of your Romish Sacrifice, which we have reserved to be discovered in the eighth Booke. We hasten to the last Exami∣nation, which is of Protestants.
CHAP. XII. That the Protestants, in their Celebration, offer to God a Spirituall Sacrifice, which is Propitiatory, by way of Complacency. SECT. I. CAll but to minde our former See above, Chap. 1. Distinction of a double kinde of Propitiousnesse; one of Complacency, and Acceptation, and the other of Merit, and Equiva∣lency; and joyne hereunto your owne definition of Propitiousnesse by way of gracious acceptance, when you confesse that Every religious Act, whereby man in devo∣tion adhereth intirely unto God, in acknowledgement of his Sove∣raignty, mercy, and bounty, is propitious unto God. Now then, Pro∣testants celebrating the Eucharist with Faith in the Sonne of God, and offering up to God the Commemoration of his death, and man's Redemption thereby (a worke farre exceeding in worth the Creation, if it so were, of a thousand Thousand worlds) and thereby powring out their whole spirit of Thankfulnesse unto God (in which respect this Sacrament hath obtained a more singular name than any other, to be called Eucharistia, that is, A Giving of Thankes, and that most worthily, for as much as the end and efficacy of Christ's Passion is no lesse than our Redempti∣on from the eternall paines of hell, and purchase of our everla∣sting salvation:) All these (I say) and other Duties of holy devo∣tion being performed not according to Mans Invention, as yours; but to that direct, and expresse Prescript, and ordinance of Christ himselfe [Doe this,] It is not possible, but that their whole com∣plementall Act of Celebration must needs be through Gods fa∣vour propitious, and well-pleasing in his sight. Take unto you our last Proposition, concerning the second kinde of Propitiousnesse. That the Protestants may more truly be said to offer to God a meritoriously Propitiatory Sacrifice for Remission of Sinne than the Romish doe. SECT. II. BEfore we resolve any thing, we are willing to heare your Car∣dinals Determination. The Death of Christ (saith Bellarm. lib. 1. de Missa, cap. 3. Mora Christi est Sacrificiū propriè dictum, & perfectiffimum. he) is a proper, and most perfect Sacrifice. So he, most Christianly: But after noting the Profession of Protestants, to hold that the same Most perfect Sacrifice of Christ upon the Crosse is the only proper Sa∣crifice of Christian Religion, he denieth this, because (saith he)
Bellarm. ibid. cap. 20. §. Probatur. Sub∣lato Sacrificio Mis∣sae, nullum restat in Ecclesia Sacrificium propriè dictum. Nam si ullum esset, id esset Sacrificium Crucis, illud enim unum Ad∣versarii assignant u∣nicum esse Christia∣nae religionis Sacrifi∣cium. At hoc com∣mune omnibus veris religionibus, sed se∣mel peractum manet, quoad effectum, & virtutem. This is common to all true Religions, and being but once done, ceaseth to be any more, but onely in the virtue and efficacy thereof. And all this he doth for establishing of another properly Propitiatory Sa∣crifice of the Romish Masse, by the hands of the Priest. But we, beleeving that That Sacrifice of Christ's death was but once offered as (according to our other distinction) the only subje∣ctive, meritorious, and properly Propitiatory Sacrifice, therefore it ceaseth to be so any more; but yet is still objectively perpetuall in the Church of God, as the object of our Remembrance of his Death, Representatively and Commemoratively, both in our Acts of Celebration, and in our Prayers and Praises offered up to God in the true apprehension of the Efficacy and Virtue thereof. In which respect (as Christian Beleefe professeth) Christ is called Apoc. 5. 12. The Lambe saine from the beginning of the world: so is he the same still, and ever will be untill the end thereof; for which Cause our Celebration is called of the Apostle A shewing of the Lord's Death till he come. So that as by the Bodily Eye, beholding the Iohn 3. Serpent on a pole in the Wildernesse, they that were stung with the dead∣ly poison of fiery Serpents were healed: even so All, who by Faith, the Eye of the soule, behold the Sonne of God lift upon the Crosse, shall not perish, but have everlasting life. But what is that Propitiousnesse of the Sacrifice of Christ's Body (will you say) which you Protestants will be said to offer more truly to God, than that we Romanists doe, and wherein doth the dif∣ference consist? Be you as willing to heare as to aske, and then know, that first although the whole Act of our Celebration, in Commemoration of Christ's Death, as proceeding from us, be a Sacrifice propitious, as other holy Acts of Devotion, only by God's Complacency and Acceptance; Yet the object of our Commemora∣tion being the Death and Passion of Christ, in his Body and Blood, is to us, by the efficacy thereof, a truly and properly propiatory Sa∣crifice, and Satisfaction, for a perfect remission of all sinnes. Thus concerning Protestants. As for you, if we consider your owne out∣ward Acts of Celebration, (where in Ten Circumstances we finde Ten Transgressions of the Institution of Christ, and therefore pro∣vocatory to stir up Gods displeasure) we thinke not that it can be Propitiatory so much as by way of God's Acceptance. Next, when we dive into the mystery of your Masse, to seeke out the subject matter of your Sacrifice in the hands of your Priest, which according to the faith of your Church is called a Proper propitiatory Sacrifice in it selfe; it hath beene found (besides our proofes from Scriptures, and your owne Principles) by See a Synops hereof, Booke 8. Ten Demonstrations out of Ancient Fathers to be Sacramentall Bread and Wine, and not the Body and Blood of Christ. Wherefore the Subject of your Sacrifice can be no more properly (that is, Satis∣factorily) in it selfe Propitiatory, than naturall Bread can be Christ. Lastly, in examining the End of the Propitiation by the Masse,
We perceive your Doctors in suspense among themselves, whe∣ther you be capable of Propitiation for Remission of sinnes, or else of Temporall Punishments due to such Sinners; or if of Sinnes, whether of mortall sinnes, or else of venall sinnes onely: to wit, such as you thinke may be washed away by your owne Holy-water sprinckle. Marke now, we pray you, these three: First, what you offer, namely not to Christ, but his Sacrament. Secondly, by what Acts of Celebration, to wit, most whereof are not Acts of Obe∣dience, but of Transgression. Thirdly, to what End, viz. not for a Faithfull, but for a doubtfull; not for an absolute, but for a par∣tiall Remission, and that also you know not whether of sinnes, or of punishments: and then must you necessarily acknowledge the happinesse of our Protestants profession, concerning the Ce∣lebration of the Eucharist, in comparison of your Ro∣mish. How much more, when you shall see discovered the Idolatry thereof, which is our next Taske.
THE SEVENTH BOOKE; Concerning the last Romish Consequence, derived from the depraved sence of the words of Christ, [THIS IS MY BODY;] which is your Divine Adoration of the Sacrament; contrary to these other words of Christ, [IN REMEMBRANCE OF MEE] CHAP. I. WEE have hitherto passed thorow many dangerous and pernicious Gulfes of Romish Doctrines, which our instant haste will not suffer us to looke backe upon, by any repeti∣tion of them. But now are wee en∣tring upon Asphaltites, or Mare mortuum, even the Dead Sea of Ro∣mish Idolatrie; whereinto all their superstitious and sacrilegious Do∣ctrines doe emptie themselves: which, how detestable it is, we had rather prove, than prejudge. The State of the Question, concerning Adoration of the Sacrament. SECT. I. IN the thirteenth Session of your Councell of Trent, wee finde a Decree commanding thus, Concil. Trid. Cul∣tum Latriae, qui vero Deo debetur, in ve∣neratione huic Sa∣cramento exhibeant. Sess. 13. cap. 5. Let the same divine honour, that is due to the true God, be giuen to this Sacrament.

In 3. Thom. q. 79. Disput. 65. §. 1, & 2. To adore with an absolute divine worship the whole visible Sa∣crament of Christ, in the formes of bread and wine, as your Iesuit expoundeth it; A worship (saith he) far exceeding that which is

Romane Missall, to elevate the Consecrated Hoast, and to propound it to the people to be adored; and adoring it themselves in thrice striking their breast, to say, O Lambe of God that takest away the sinnes of the world have mercy upon us. So you. But what doe they, whom you call Sacramentaries, judge of this kinde of worship, can you tell? Bellarm. Omnes Idololatriam appel∣lant hujusmodi ado∣rationem. lib. 4. de Euch. cap. 29. §. Porrò. All of them (saith your Cardinall) call it Idolatry. But they, whom you call Lutherans, are they not of the same Iudgement? say, Greg. Valent. Lu∣therani nos Idolola∣tras vocant, seu (ut ipsi nugari solent) Artolatras. Lib. 1. de Idololat. cap. 3. §. Sed. They call us (be∣cause of this worship) Artolaters, that is, Bread-worshippers and Idolaters, saith your Iesuit. As for our Church of England, She accordingly saith, that The Sacrament of the Lords Supper was not reserved, carried about, lifted up, or worshipped. Our Method must now be to treat first of Christs Instituti∣on, or Masse; next of the Profession of Antient Fathers; then of your Romish Masse in it selfe; and lastly wee shall returne againe to our owne home, to demonstrate the happie Securitie, which our Church hath in her manner of worship. So that these contradictorie Propositions, This Sacrament is to be ado∣red with divine worship, and, Is not to be adored with divine wor∣ship, being the two different scales of this Controversie, the one will preponderate the other, according to the weight of Arguments, which shall be put into either of them. Of the Institution of Christ; shewing that there was therein neither Precept for this Adoration of the Sacra∣ment, nor Practice thereof. SECT. II. NO outward Adoration of the Sacrament was practised of the Disciples of Christ (say we) at the Institution thereof, which you confesse with us; and take upon you to give a rea∣son thereof, to wit, that Coster. Ies. Nec o∣pus erat ut genu∣flexo significationem novam honoris da∣rent, sumentes corpus dominicū, quià cun∣dem habebant piae∣sentem, & corpus suum porrigentem, quem mente semper colebant. Enchir. de Euch. Tit. Adoratio, Answering this Obje∣ction: Apostoli in ul∣tima coena hoc Sacra∣mentum non adora∣bant. There was no need that the Apostles should use any outward signification of honour to the Sacrament, be∣cause they had then Christ present and visible before them. So your Iesuite, which contradicteth your owne Objection, of there∣fore adoring Christ in receiving the Sacrament, because then he Sec hereafter, Chap. 7. Sect. 2. Commeth under the roofe of your mouthes; for the neerer our approach is to any Majestie, the greater useth to be our out∣ward humiliation. But well; no Practice of outward Adora∣tion by the Apostles at that time can appeare, much lesse have you any Evidence of any Precept for it. If there had beene in the words of Christ, or in the volume of the new Testament any syllable thereof, your Cardinall would not have roved so farre, as to Deuteronomie in the old Testament, to fetch his only defence out of these words of God, Bellarm. lib. 4. de Euch. cap. 29. Scriptum est Deut. 6. Dominum tuum adorabis, &c. §. His praemissis. Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God; (supposing that the Bread which is worshipped
is indeed the Sonne of God:) which is, as it were, mere Can∣ting, being the basest kinde of Reasoning that can be, and is therefore called of Logitians, A begging of the point in Question. We contrarily adhere to the Institution of Christ in all points necessarie, and essentiall thereunto, and knowing that the A∣postle promised to deliver 1. Cor. 11. Whatsoever hee had received of the Lord, concerning this Sacrament (which you hold to be the principall part of your Romish Religion) wee are perswaded that he in expressing the other Commands of Christ, touching Consecration, Administration, and Communication of this Sacra∣ment, never taught that your Article of divine Adoration, whereof hee gave not so much as the least intimation. The A∣postolicall times faile you. We shall try if the next, called the Primitive Age, can any whit advantage your Cause, which is our second Station. CHAP. II. Of the Doctrine of Antiquity, concerning the Adora∣tion of the Eucharist. SECT. I. THE Iudgement of Antiquity is objected by you, and the same is opposed by us against you. Let both be put to the Triall; First, by answering of your Objections out of the Fa∣thers against us: and then by opposing their direct Testimonies against you. Your Obje∣ctions are partly Verball, and partly Practicall; the Verball are of three kinds, two whereof are specified in the next Pro∣position. That neither the objected manner of Invitation to come with feare, nor of Association of Angels, spoken of by the Fa∣thers, imply any Divine Adoration of the Eucharist. SECT. II. OVt of Chrysost. in Mom. ad Cor. 24. Cum hor∣rore accedamus ad Deum. Ob. Harding &c. Iem Bellarm. lib. 2. d Euch. cap. 22. Citati locis quibusdam Chrysostomi, ad hae Adversarii neque respondent, neque respondere possint: Si enim Angeli ad altare astant capitibus inclinatis, & cum horrore ac tremore vix audent intueri, prop∣ter splendorem inde emicantem, quis negare potest aliud ibi esse quam panem? Et si Angeli adorant, quis homi∣nes reprehendere potest si adorent? Paulo superius ex Hon. 4. . ad Coriath Accedimus ad agnum illum jacentem, & peccata mundi tollenem deprecantes: ubi apertissimè dielt vocari agnum jacentem, &c. Et Hom. ad Ephes. 3. Hostiam quam Angeli cum tremore suscipiunt. Chrysostome is objected his Exhortation, that Chri∣stians in their approach to this Sacrament, Doe come with
horror, feare, and reverence. Next, is their talking of the Angels, being present at this Celebration, holding downe their heads, and not daring to behold the excellency of the splendor, &c. and to depre∣cate the Lambe lying on the Altar. These seeme to your Cardinall to be such invincible Testimonies, to prove the Adoration of Christ as Corporally present, that he is bold to say, They never hitherto were answered, nor yet possibly can be. So he; taking all Chrysostomes words in a literall sence; whom notwithstanding your owne See above, Bke 5. Chap. 5. Sect. 3. in the Challenge. Se∣nensis hath made to be the most Hyperbolizing Preacher of all the Fathers: and therefore hath given unto all Divines a speciall Caution against his Rhetoricke, in the point of this Sacrament, lest we understand him literally. Of which kinds you may have some Instances out of the very places Objected, where Chrysost. Orat. in Philogon. . Idem paulò superius. Chryso∣stome saith indeed, That we see that Lambe lying on the Altar. And said he not also, even in the same Oration, We see here Christ lying in the Manger, wrapped in his clouts; a dreadfull and admirable spectacle? So he. But (say) doe you see herein either Cratch or Clothes? or can you talke of Christ's lying on this Altar, who teach that, as he is in this Sacrament, hee hath no locall Site, Posture, or Position at all? It is also true of the Angels, he said [] they stand in dread, and the sight is fearefull. And he saith no lesse of the festivall day of Christ's Nativity, that It is most venerable, and terrible, and the very Metropolis of all others. Yet doth not this argue any Corporall Presence of Christ, in respect of the day. This answer, taken from Chrysostome, may satisfie for Chrysostome. We grant furthermore to your Bellarm. lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 15. §. Quin∣to—Omnes Graeci Patres passim vocant terribile Sacrificium, & horroris plenum. Cardinall, That all the Greeke Fathers call the Eucharist terrible, and full of dread. But what? As therefore implying a Corporall presence of Christ, and Divine Ado∣ration thereupon? This is your Cardinall's scope; but to prove him an ill marke-man, take unto you an answer from your selves, See above, Booke 5. Chap. 2. Sect. 4. who teach with the Apostle, that All prophane commers to this Sa∣crament make themselves guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ; in which respect we doe acknowledge it to be Dreadfull indeed, espe∣cially to the wicked: but yet making no more for a Corporall pre∣sence, than the contempt of Baptisme, whereby a man maketh himselfe obnoxious to God's iudgements, (as See above, Booke 5. Chap. 2 Sect. 7. Augustine hath compared them) can infer the same. Another answer you may re∣ceive from Ancient Fathers, who, together with the Eucharist, have See above, Booke 6. Chap. 5. Sect. 8. called the reading of Scriptures Terrible; and so were the Canons of Baptisme called Terrible, even by Ibidem. Chrysostome him∣selfe. As for your objected assistance of Angels, at the Celebration of the Eucharist, it is no such a Prerogative, but that the Prayers of the faithfull, and Baptisme will plead for the same honour: your Durandus granting of the first, that Durand. Angeli adsunt semper nobis orantibus. Lib. 7. c. 12. The Angels of God are pre∣sent with us in our prayers; and for the second, Divine Nazianzene teacheth that Nazianz. . Orat. 40. de Baptisme. The Angels are present at Baptisme, and doe magnifie,
or honour it with their presence, and observance: notwithstanding none of you ever defended either Corporall presence of Christ in the Sacrament of Baptisme, or yet any Adoration of the conse∣crated Element of water therein. If these two may not serve, take unto you this saying of Augustine, spoken of persons baptized, August. de meritis & de remiss. lib. 11. cap. 18. de baptizatis; Illi cum timore ad medi∣cum Christum por∣tantur. They (saith he) with feare are brought unto Christ their Physician, that is (for so he expoundeth himselfe) unto the Sacrament of eter∣nall Salvation. Which one saying of so Oxthodox a Father doth instruct us how to interpret all your objected Testimonies; to with, that Whosoever come to the receiving of the Sacrament of Christ, they ought to come with feare, as if they were in the presence of Christ. And thus is your unanswerable Objection an∣swered, so that this your Cable-rope being untwisted is become no better than loose tow. Now to your third Objection. That the most earnestly-objected Phrase [] and Adoration, used of the Fathers, doth not necessarily inferre any Divine Worship of the Eucharist. SECT. III. WEE finde not your Disputers more pressing and urgent in any Argument, than in objecting the word, Reverence, Honour, and especially Adoration, for proofe that Divine Honour is due to the Eucharist, as to Christ himselfe, whensoever they finde the use of that Phrase applyed by Antiquity unto this Sa∣crament. Our answer is first in Generall; That the words Reve∣rence, Honour, and Adoration, simply in themselves, without the adjunct and Additament, Divine, cannot conclude the Divine worship proper to God. To this purpose we desire you not to hearken unto us, but to heare your selves speake. M. Breerly. Pon-Pontificales vestas, & calices coeperunt esse honorandi, Sacra∣menti causâ. Liturg. Tract. 2. §. . Sub. 2. The Ponti∣ficall Vestments, Chalices, and the like, are to be honoured, say you, but how? with divine Honour? you will not say it; nor will you hold that ancient Bede worthy of Divine Worship, albeit you en∣title him Venerable, in a Religious respect. Yea (under the degree of divine worship) we our selves yeeld as much to the Eucharist as August. Epist. 164. Baptisme Christi ubi∣que veneramur. Augustine did to Baptisme, when he said, We reverence Bap∣tisme wheresoever it is. Accordingly of the word Adoration your Cardinall and other Iesuits are bold to say, that Ribera Ies. in Apoc. 19. Item Viegas Ies. in eundem locum. Nec nos moveat verbum hoc [Adorare] cum vulga∣tum sit hoc creaturis tribui, ut Loth cum vidisset Angelos su∣exit, & adoravit eo pronus in terram. 3. Reg. 1. Inclinaba se & adorabat Bershe∣ba Regem prona in terram. Rectè igitur Johannes adoravit Angclum laeta nunci∣; Cur Angelus recusavit, Greg. Hom. 8. in Evang. Angelos antè adventum Christi adoratos, post assump∣ humanitatem adorationem recusasse. Eodem modo Glossa, Hugo, Rupertus, & alii nonnulli, &c. S Suarez T. 1. Dsp. 54. & Bellarm. Hieronymus non ignorabat Adorationis multa genera, & alium soli Deo, aliam rebu deberi sacris. Apol. cap. 1. §. Primum. [And he reckoneth A oration of Reliques, Tombes of Martyrs, &c. It is sometimes used also in Scriptures for an honour common to creatures, as to Angels, to Kings, to Mar∣tyrs, and to their Tombs. And although your Disputers should conceale this Truth, yet would the Fathers themselves informe us in what a Latitude they used the same word Adoration. Among
the Latine Fathers, one, who knew the propriety of that Language as well as any, viz. Tertullian, saying, Adoro plenitu∣dinem Scripturarum. Adversus Hermog. post medium. pag. 350. I adore the plenitude of Scriptures; and Gregory Nazianzene, among the Greeke, for his excellency in divine knowledge surnamed the Divine (and therefore may not be thought to apply words belonging to Divine (c) Greg. Nazianz. . Orat. 40. Worship preposterously or improperly) instructed the partty bap∣tized to say thus to the Devill, Fall downe [] and wor∣ship me. Thus much in Generall. Let us proceed, You to your particular Objections; and We to our Answers. 1. Ob. Ambrose saith, that Ambros. lib. 3. de Spir. sanct. cap. 12. Ira∣ctans illum locum Psal. 98. [Adorate Scabel∣lum pedum ejus.] Per Scabellum terra in∣telligitur, per terram autem cao Christi, quam hodiè quoque in mysteriis adora∣mus: & quam Apo∣stoli in Domino Iesu adoraverunt. Ob. 1. per Bell. Apol. cap. 8. pag. 107. Hic locus nullam admittit solu∣tionem. Item lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 14. We adore in these my∣steries the flesh of Christ, as the foot stoole of his Deity. You call this an Argument infallible: nay (say we) but false, because Ambrose doth not say, that we adore the Sacrament, (which is the point in Question) but that in our mysticall Celebration of the memory of Christ his Passion, we are to adore his humanity, namely as it is hypostatically united to the person of his God-head, which all Christians professe as well as you, yea even in Baptisme also. 2. Ob. Aug. in Psalm. 98. Nemo illam carnem manducat, nisi prius adoraverit. Ob. Bell. Alius locus insignis. Lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 24. §. Alius. None (saith Augustine) doth eat the flesh of Christ before he adore it. A Testimony which seemeth to you Notable: but which we judge to be indeed not able at all to prove the Divine Adoration of the Sacrament, even in the Iudgement of Saint Augustine, who hath every-where distinguished betweene the Sacrament and Christ's Flesh, as betweene Bread and Christ's Body, as hath beene often demonstrated. His meaning therefore is no more but this, that whosoever shall communicate of this Sacrament, the Sym∣bole of Christ, must first be a true Christian, beleeving that Christ is not onely man, but God also, and adore him accordingly with Divine honour, as well before and without the Sacrament, as at the receiving thereof. Even as Athanas. contra Mced. Dil. 1. pag. 265. . Athanasius spake of Baptisme, saying that The Catechumenists did first adore the Father, Sonne, and Holy Ghost, before that they were to be baptized in their names. And is there any of your Priests so unchristian, as not to adore Christ, before he come to the Communion? A plaine Case. Will you have any more? The places alleaged out of Saint Augustine, by you, are like Bellerophons Letters to confute you; for lest Saint Augustines Reader might mis-construe the meaning of Christ's words, by perverting them to a Corporall and Orall ea∣ting of his Flesh, Aug. in Psal. 98. Non hoc corpus, quod videtis mandu∣caturi estis—spiri∣tualiter intellectum viviicavit. Saint Augustine addeth (bringing Christ spea∣king to the Iewes, concerning the eating of his flesh) You are not to eat this flesh, which you see: he saith not, You are not to see the flesh which you shall not eat, (which is your Romish Iug∣gling.) But thus, You are not to eat the flesh which you see, namely that, which then was visible when Christ was in the world. This one Testimony of Augustine may satisfie for the present, untill another shall be delivered fom him, absolutely See hereafter, Chap. 4. Sect. 2. confuting your Tridentine Faith of the Divine worship of the Host, to prove it Ido∣latrous.
Theodoret seemeth unto you to come off roundly, saying Theod. Dial. 2. Sig∣na mystica post san∣ctificationem manent in priore substantiâ, figurâ, & orâ, sicut pius: Intelliguntur autem ea, quae facta sunt, & creduntur: & [] ado∣rantur. Ob. Bell. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 27. §. Sed apertissimè—asserit praesentiam Domini in Euch. quia pnis consecratus est verè id quod intelligitur, Creditur, & Adora∣tur. That Symbols and Signes are beleeved and adored, whereby he most evi∣dently teacheth the presence of Christ's flesh (as saith your Cardi∣nall:) even so, as commonly he useth to doe in alleaging of other Testimonies, both unconscionably against his knowledge, and unluckily against his Cause. For with what Conscience can he urge the word Adoration here, as most evidently noting a Divine worship of the Sacrament, seeing that he hath before confessed the same word, Adore, to be used of the Fathers sometimes for worship communicable to Angels, and Saints, and to their Tombs? yea, and when as also Theodoret (which proveth your Cardinal's Ob∣jection lucklesse) doth expresly say, that The substance of bread remaineth, meaning absolutely the proper substance of Bread (as hath beene See this discussed to the full, Booke 3. copiously proved) whereunto no Divine worship can be lawfully given, not only in the Faith of all other Catho∣like Fathers; but even in the beleefe of the Roman Church at this day? And although the Symbols, and Signes (as you fancy) were meere Accidents, yet dare not you your selves say that they are to be properly adored with Divine Worship. Hitherto have we insisted upon the words objected out of the Fathers, by you, with more eagenesse, than either with good Iudgement or Conscience. Your next Objections are taken from the Acts, whereunto we addresse our Answers. CHAP. III. That no objected Act out of the Fathers, for proofe of an Invocation by Divine Adoration of the Eucharist, is conscionably alleaged; not the first, which is their pre∣scribed Concealment of this Mystery. SECT. I. ACTS insisted upon by you, for proofe of Adoration, are these; The Fathers injoyning a Concealment of this Mystery from some others: their Elevation of the Host after Consecration: their Cautelousnesse in ad∣ministring it, without letting any part thereof fall to the ground: their Bodily Gesture in token of Humiliation; and their pretended Invocating on it. We acknowledge (that we may begin with the first) how strictly the Ancient Fathers generally prescri∣bed to others, (which they observed themselves) that this My∣stery should be kept secret from all persons, who were not ini∣tiated by Baptisme, and incorporated thereby into the visible
Church of Christ, were they Infidels or Catechumenists (that is) un∣baptized Christians. Vpon this our Confession, as the Base, hear∣ken what a discant your Doctors can chant, saying as followeth; Bellarm. lib. 2. de Eucl. cap. 2. citat Au∣gustin. Serm. 10. de ver∣bis Apost. viz. Quòd corpus dixit escam, & sanguinem potū, Sa∣cramentum fidelium agnoscunt fideles—Et hanc phrasin [nó∣runt fideles] habet in lois infinitis: at pro∣fectò non est fidelibus tantùm notum, quòd corpus Christi fide percipatur. Idem ob∣jicit Cladi de Sanctis ante lib. de Lituriis Patrum. Rurs Bellar.  sup. cap. 15. At cet∣tè nulla reddi potest causa, cu Eucharisti∣am ne videri quidem permitterent Infide∣libus, vel etiam Cate∣chumenis, si nihil est nisi signum. The Fathers said of this mystery of the Eucharist that only [Fideles norunt] the faithfull know it: and therefore we must be perswaded they understood a Corporall Presence of Christ herein; and con∣sequently a Divine Adoration due unto it. Master Breerly swelleth big, in amplifying this Objection; take a briefe of the whole. The Fathers professing to write more circumspectly of this Sacrament, so as not daring to explaine it, as Theodoret, Origen, Augustine, Chrysostome; this were causlesse, if the Fathers had thought Christ's words figurative; nor had it beene more necessary in this than in Bap∣tisme, had the Fathers acknowledged no other presence in this, than in Baptisme, &c. So he. Well then, by your owne judgement, if it may be found that the Fathers observed alike Circumspection in the manner of uttering, and Cautelousnesse in concealing the Sacrament of Baptisme from Infidels, and Catechumenists; then must you confesse that this your Argument maketh no more for proofe of a Corporall Presence in the Eucharist, as you would have it, than in Baptisme, where you confesse it is not. And now behold the Fathers are as precise in conclealing the Mystery of Baptisme, from all Persons unbapti∣zed, even in as expresse termes as was spoken of in the Eucharist; Chrysostome saying, (against such Persons) Chrysost. in Gal. 4. Non natura, sed Dei, promissio Sacramen∣tum fecit: sic ena∣scentia nostra natura quidem nulla est, c∣terum verbum Dei, . The faithfull know this. And againe, entring into a discourse of Baptisme, he prefaceth saying; And againe in 1. Cor. Hom. 40. about to ntreat of the words of S. Paul, [Quid facient ii, qui baptizantur pro mortuis? [. I would indeed speake this plainly, but I dare not, because of them that are not initiated, or Baptized. And Dionysius, the sup∣posed Areopagite, Dionys. Hierarch. cap. 2. . Let none that is not a perfect Christian be admitted to the sight of the signes of Baptisme: even as the Councell Conc. Arausican. 1. Catechumeni non sunt ad Baptismum admittendi. Can. 19. Arau∣sicanum also decreed. Which Cautions are long since antiquated by disuse in Churches Christian, because all are now baptized that come to behold this Sacrament. If hereupon any Protestant shall infer a Corporall presence of Christ in Baptisme, and conse∣quently an Adoration of Christ in the same Sacrament, you your selves (we know) would but hisse at him, in detestation of his Con∣sequence, as judging it Idolatrous. But doe you aske, why then the Fathers did teach Christians not to speake of these Mysteries in the hearing of the Catechume∣nists? Saint Augustine himselfe (whom your Cardinall hath brought in for defence of Corporall presence) will resolve us, and wit∣nesse against him, telling him, that the reason was not the subli∣mity of the matter, as though they could not apprehend it, but because Aug. Tom. 9. Tract. 96. in Ioh. Quid si eis fidelium Sacramenta non producuntur, non ideò fit, quod ea ferre non possent, sed ut ab iis tantò arden∣tis concupiscantur, quantò honorabilius eis occultantur. [Spea∣king of the Catechume∣nists.] The more honourably the Sacraments are concealed (spea∣king in generall) the more ardently they would be coveted and desi∣red. As for their not revealing them unto Infidels, the reason is evident; Infidelity is a mocker, and they meant to preserve Christ's Sacrament from contempt. Thus your most specious Objection
serveth for nothing more than to prove your Disputers to be won∣derfully precipitant in their Arguing. That the objected Elevation, or lifting up of the Host, and preserving of it from falling, are no Arguments of Adoration. SECT. II. SEcondly, the Elevation of the Hoast over the head of the Priest is your ordinary Objection, for proofe of a Divine Adoration; al∣though you have Suarez. See above, Booke 6. Chap. 1. Sect. . at (a). confessed, that this was not of prime Antiqui∣ty. But supposing Elevation to have beene so ancient, yet was it not to the end it should be adored, no more than was the Booke of the Gospell, in the Roman Church, when it was (according to the Rite then) Durant. de Ritib lib. 2. cap. 23. num. 7.  ordine Romano Diaconus osculan E∣vangelium, levat in manus codicem, & partem ejus in dextro humero ponens, vadi ad Ambonem. Lift up by the hands of the Deacon, and carried on hi right shoulder. What else will you say of the Priest's Elevation? you would perswade (in the Ida d Ritib. lib. 2. cap. 40. in Psal. 7. In capite montium: hoc est (ait Rabbi Jo∣nathan) Sacrificium in capitibu Sacerdo∣tum. Durand. Rational. lib. 4. cap. 42. num. 54. Elevatur, ut populu congressu consecra∣tionem factam esse, & Christum super Alta∣re venisse reverentèr prosternatur in ter∣ram, & illum ore ado∣ret. Et Durant. quo su∣prà. Adorationis ergò Eucharistiam in al∣tum attolli, Durandus & Ivo asserunt, Proba∣bile est. Margent) by some, that the Priest lifting the Host over his head, was prophesied of by the Psal∣mist; And, that the Rite of holding the Host up was chiefly that the people knowing it to be now consecrated, should understand that Christ is on the Altar, whom they are to Adore by falling downe on the ground. Whereof albeit some of you speake more confident∣ly, yet the most principall searcher into Antiquity dae say no more, than only This is probable. We contrarily conceive, that that Rabbinish interpretation can be no good ground to rest upon, which See above, Booke 3. hath bin rejected by Bel∣larmine, as being Idle and Frivolous. 2. That the Ceremony of Elevation (as hath See above, Booke 6. Chap. 6. Sect. 5. beene confessed) was neither instituted by Christ, nor yet alwaies in use in Christ's Church. 3. That the same Elevation, albeit used after Consecration, doth not so much as Pro∣bably prove it was for Adoration-sake, because it was as well in use in your lifting up of the Host before Consecration; as your obje∣cted Missalls published by Claudius Sainctes à Parisian Dr. Before Consecration, in the Mis∣sall of S. Iames, Attol∣lens: In the Masse of Basil, Exaans pane. Missal's of Saint Iames, and Basil doe manifest. Lastly, that where Elevation was practised after Consecration, the objected Authors confute your Assertion, for in Chrysostome it is read, After Consecration, in the Masse of Chryso∣stome, Modicum ∣tollens Sacerdos, dicit Sancta sanctis. That the Priest did take a portion out of the dish, and held it up but a little: this is not lifting it over the Head, or very high, as your reason for Adoration would require. And in your objected Saint In Dionys. Areopag. relating the forme of their Masse, objected by Duran de iti. lib. 2. cap. 40. Mysteria, quae ante laudaverat Sacerdos, venerandis opera signis in conspectum agi, divi∣naque mucr reverentèr ostenden, ad Sacram Communionem convertitur. [Wherein there is no one word of▪ Venerandis, or Reverentèr, but this.] ,  , &c. Dionys. Areopag. cap. 3. Denis there is no more, but that The sacred celebrated Symbols were brought into light, which after Consecration he termeth Vncovered Bread▪ divided of the Priest into many parts. Bread (we say) broken after Consecration; which is the break-necke of your whole Defence. Your third Objection is the diligent Caution given by Anci∣ent
Fathers, to take heed▪ Terll. in lib. de Cor milit. Calicis at panis aliquid in terram discuti, anxiè patimur. Ob. by Mr. Breerly, Liturg. Tract. 2. Sect. 8. Subd. 4. pag. 216. And out of Ori∣gen. Hom. 5. in Levit. Take heed no little crumme fall to the ground. Tract. 4. Sect. 6. And Pius Bishop of Rome ordained that ye consecrated Bread and Wine falling to the ground should be left to the Sacrificer, and the rest remai∣ning should be burnt with fire unto ases. So great a Reve∣rence was then pre∣scribed. Ibid. Tract. 2. Sect. 8. Subd. 4. Lest that any Crum should fall to the ground, and if any little part thereof should fall, it should be left to the Priest, and the Remainder of the Sacrament after the Masse (say you) should be burnt to ashes, and the ashes laid up. So you. Pha∣roah his Butler and aker, we are sure, would have beene loth to miscarry in spilling, or letting fall any part of their carriage, when they were to present their service unto their King; much more carefully ought every Christian, in executing his sacred Function, to observe the Lawes of Decorum. Marke we, by the way, Master Breerly durst not call the part falling any thing but a Part, not A part of Christ's Body, that were Impious, not a part of Accidents that were absurd: what meaneth this childish Fa∣bling trow we, but that if they should speake out, they should betray their Cause, in calling that little part a part of Bread, as your objected Dionysius spake? And when all is said, we heare no proofe of Divine Adoration of the Hoast. But we leave you to take your Answer from your Cardinall, who hath told you that See above, Booke 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 10. in Answer to the second Pretence. Casuall spilling of the Cup is no sinne. Only we must againe insist in the former Observation, to wit, the frequent speeches of the Fathers, telling us of Crums, Frag∣ments, little parts of this Sacrament; and of Burning them into ashes, after the Celebration ended. Now answer us, in good sad∣nesse; was it ever heard of, we say not of ancient Fathers, but of any professing Christianity, were they Catholikes or Heretikes, who would not have judged it most execrable for any to say, or thinke that A crum, or little part of Christ's body falleth? or that by a dash of the Cup, the blood of our Lord is spilt? or that the Pri∣mitive Fathers, in the Remainder of the Sacrament, Burned their Saviour? Yet these must they both have thought, and said, if (as you speake of Eating, Swallowing, feeding Corporally of Christ's Body, the Body of Christ were the proper Subject of these acciden∣tall Events. That the Objection taken from any Gesture, used in the daies of Antiquity, doth not prove a Divine Adoration of the Eucharist. SECT. III. GEsture is one of the points, which you object, as more ob∣servable than the former, but how? Because Chrysostome will have the Communicant take it with Chrysost. in Liturg. Postà fimiliter Sa∣cerdos sit sanctu pan, inato ca∣pit ante sacrā men∣s oran. Inclining hit head downe be∣fore the holy Table. Cyril, by Cyril. Hierosol. My∣sg. 5. Accede ad ca∣lice anguinis illius pro [.] Bowing after the manner of Ado∣ring. You will be still like your selves, insisting upon Heteroge∣nies, and Arguments which conclude not ad idem. For first, the Examples objected speake not of Bowing downe to the Sacrament, but of our Bowing downe our heads to the ground, in signification of our Vnworthinesse; which may be done in Adoring Christ
with a [Sursum corda] that is, Lifting up our hearts to Christ above. And this may become every Christian to use, and may be done without divine Adoration of the thing before us. Nay and that no Gesture, either standing, sitting, or kneeling, is necessary for such an Adoration, your greatest Advocate doth shew out of Antiquitie, and affirmeth this as a Point (as Espncaes. Nec disputatio super Ado∣randi gestu, cum de Adorationis substan∣tia inter omnes sem∣per convenrit, ac etiamnum convenit, stantes aut edentes, proni aut supini, ere∣cti aut geniculati Christum in Euchari∣stia praesentissimum adoremus, per se non refert—cum A∣doratio non tam in externo cult, quàm intimo mentis affectu cernitur. Lib. 2. de A∣dorat. cap. 16. initio. he saith) agreed on by all; adding that Divine Adoration consisteth not in the outward. Gesture, but in the Intention of the minde. For indeed, there is no one kinde of outward Gesture, which (as you have con∣fessed) is not also communicable to man: so that although that were true, which is set downe in the Rubricke of The Latine is, In∣clinantes Altari: but nce I finde it in the Greeke (before Conse∣cration) ; and so thrice the lke. Ater Consecration; . And againe; . [Behinde the Table bowing downe his head.] And againe, . Chrysostomes Liturgie, that the Ministers did use to Incline their Bodies to the Al∣tar, yet none can be so simple, to thinke that they did yeeld divine honour unto an Altar. Nay, your owne great Master of Ceremo∣nies Durant. Peractâ thurificatione, Sacer∣cerdos levitèr incur∣vesit ante Altare—dùm autem inclina Sacerdos, humilita∣tem Christi significat.—Sacerdos re∣flexus ad Altare, cùm paratur Consecratio▪ Lib. 2. de Ritib. cap. 25. Durantus hath observed the like Bowing downe of the Priest in the preparation of this Sacrament, even Before consecration; and one of your Iesuits reporteth your objected Vasquez Ies. Grae∣ca Ecclesia ntò Con∣secrationem reveren∣er adorat, etiam i non sit ibi Christus. D Adorat. lib. 2. cap. 11. [Falsly commenting that this was Divine ho∣nour, and just.] Greeke Church at this day to Adore the Bread and Wine unconsecrated, albeit they beleeve no Presence of Christ herein. This being knowne, how can you in any credibility conclude, as you have done, a Corporall presence of Christ in this Sacrament after Consecration, from a Reverence which hath beene yeelded to the same Sacrament, before it was consecrated? In which consi∣deration your Disputers stand so much the more condemnable, because, whereas they shew some Examples of a Bodily Incli∣ning to the Sacrament, done before Consecration, yet after Conse∣cration they have not produced any one. But what newes now? We blush, in your behalfe, to repeat the Instance which you have out of your Legends, of a Mr. Breerly Liturg. Tract. 2. §. 9. Subd. 3. [out of Bellarm. and Bellarm. out of Antoninus]—When (not unlike to the reproofe which God miraculously gave to Balaam by the speech of an Asse) a bruit-beast for our instruction did prostrate himselfe in reverence be∣fore the blessed Sacrament. Brute Beast prostrating it selfe before the Host, and doing Reverence unto it. We would have concealed this, but that you seeme to glory herein, as being for your Instruction, like to the reproofe given miracu∣lously to Balaam by his Asse. Well might this Legend have become that latter time of darknesse, wherein it was first hatched, but not these cleare daies, wherein your mysteries of Delusions have beene so often revealed, and when all Christians almost in all Countries have taken knowledge of an BA HORST rding to his Masters owne Relation. Horse taught by Art to kneele to any person at his Masters command; and once in France, when, by the Suggestion and Instigation of Romish Priests, his Master was called into question for Sorcery, he for vindication of his credit with them, commanded his horse to kneele before a Crucifix, and thereby freed himselfe from suspition of Diabolicall familiarity, according to the Principles of their owne superstition. And for any one to conclude this to have been
God's miraculous worke in that Horse, (as the other was in that Asse) would seeme to be the Reason of an unreasonable man; be∣cause all Miracles alwaies exceed all power both of Art, and Na∣ture; else were they no Miracles at all. Thus to your fourth Ob∣jection from outward Acts, we passe on to Examples. That no Example of Invocation, objected out of Antiquity, can infer the Divine Honour of the Sacrament, as is pretended. SECT. IV. YOur Instances are Three; the principall in Gorgonia, the Si∣ster of Gregory Nazianzen, in whose Oration, at her fune∣rall, we finde that Greg. Nazianz. Orat. 11. de Gorgonia. Sror Gorgonia ad∣verâ copori valu∣dine laborabat—rtque prodigiosum mori genus, quod nc Medicoru arte, nec parentum lachry∣mis, nec publicis pre∣cibus sanari potuit: desperatis omnibus aliis auxiliis intem∣pestâ nocte captat ad Altare cum fide procit, cumque qui super isto honora∣tur ingenti clamore invocns, cum caput um pari cum ca∣more Altari admovis∣se, & dinde ho pharmaco (i. e. Lry∣, ut exp E Cretensis) perfudisset, & si quid uspiam [] Antitypo∣rum precio Corpo∣ris & Sanguiis ma∣nu recondiderat, id  admiscuis∣se (ô rem admiran∣daml) atim se mor∣o liberatam sentit. She having beene troubled with a prodigious dis∣ease, after that neither the Art of Physicke, nor teares of her Parents, nor the publike Prayers of the Church could procure her any health; went and cast her selfe downe at the Altar, invocating Christ, who is honoured on the Altar, saying that she would not remove her head from the Altar, untill she had received her health: when (Oh admi∣rable event!) she was presently freed from her disease. This is the Story set downe by Gregory Nazianzene. Hence your Cardinall concludeth, that Gorgonia invocated the Sacrament, as being the very Body and Blood of Christ, and calleth this An hor and stinging Argument; and so indeed it may be named, yet onely in respect of them, whose consciences are scorched, or stung with their owne guiltinesse of inforcing, and injuring the story, as will now appeare. For first, why should we thinke that she invocated the Sacra∣ment? Because (saith your Bellarm. Procum∣ben ante Altare co∣ram venerabili Sa∣cramento—Quid autem super altare colatur, dubium esse non potest, cum ihil ibi ponatur nisi panis & vinum, mutand in corpus & sanginem Christi—Petrū Martyre valdè uit pupugitque hic locus. Lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 14. Cardinall) she prostrated her selfe at the Altar, before the Sacrament; which words [Before the Sacra∣ment] are of his owne coyning, and no part of the Story. His next reason; Because she is said to have invocated him, who is honou∣red on the Altar. As though every Christian praying at the Table of the Lord, to Christ, may not be justly said to Invocate him, who is used to be Honoured by the Priest, celebrating the memory of Christ thereon. Nay, and were it granted, that the Sacramentall Symbols had beene then on on the Altar, yet would it not follow, that she invocated the Sacrament, as betokening a Corporall pre∣sence of Christ (as your Disputers have fancied) no more, than if the said godly woman upon the same occasion presenting her selfe at the sacred Font, wherein she had beene baptized, could be thought to have invocated the water therein; because shee was said to have invocated him, who is honoured in the Administration of Baptisme. And furthermore it is certaine, that the Remainders of the Sacrament in those daies were kept in their Pastophorium,
a Steve, Booke 1. Chap. 1. Sect. 10. As further also appeareth in the Liturgie of Pope nt; Accipant Daco reliquias, & portent in Paopho∣ria (Doubless, rom the Alar to a plae remote.) Test Pamel Tom. 1. Mssal. Parum atin. pag. 118. place severed from the Altar, especially at this time of her being there, which was in the Night, as the Story speaketh. O! but she was cured of her disease at the Altar. And so were other miraculous Cures wrought also at the Font of Se above, Booke 4. Chap. 2 Sect. 5. Baptisme But, for a Conclusion, we shall willingly admit of Gregory Nazi∣anzene to be Vmpier betweene us. He, in relating the Story, saith of the Sacrament of the Eucharist, (See the Above at the let∣ter (a). Margent above) that If she had at that time of her invocating held the Antitypes (or Symbols) of the Body and Blood of Christ in her hands, they had beene mingled with her teares. So he, calling the consecrated Sacrament Antitypes, or Signes of Christ's Body: thereby signifying, that the Sacrament is not the Body and Blood of Christ, as hath beene Booke 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 6. pro∣ved unto you at large out of Nazianzene, and other Greeke Fa∣thers. Whereas if indeed he had meant that the Body and Blood of Christ had beene there corporally present, as that which was Invocated; then now (if ever) it had concerned this holy Father to have expresly delivered his supposition thus, viz. If the Body and Blood of Christ had beene then held in her hands, her teares had beene mingled with them, viz. Body and Blood; and not (as he said) with the Antitypes, or Signes of his Body and Blood. Thus is your hot and stinging Reason become chilly, cold, and altogether dronish. Your second Instance is in Dionysius▪ the Areopagite, who wri∣ting of the Sacrament Bllarm. Dionys. Arop. Hier. cap. 3. part. 3. O divinissi∣mum & sacrosanctum Sacramentum, obdu∣cta ibi significantium signorum operimen∣ta aperi, &c. Lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 3. Item ipsum invocat Sacra∣mentum, & petit ab ipso, quae à solo Deo rectè peti possunt. And Durant. de Rtib. lib. 2. cap. 11. And in∣deed who not? said, O most divine Sacrament, reveale unto us the mystery of thy signes, &c. which in the eares of your Disputers ringeth a flatt Invocation of the Sacrament. Contrari∣wise we confidently affirme, that your Teachers have taken a fi∣gure Prosopopoeia for Invocation; like men who take Moon-shine for Day-light, as we shall manifest by Examples, Confessions, yea and the very Instance of Dionysius himselfe. Prosopopoeia then is a figure, when one calleth upon that which hath no sence, as if it had sence; as when in Scripture the Pro∣phet said, Heare ô Heavens, and hearken ô Earth, Isa. 1. In like manner, among the Ancient Fathers, one called upon his owne Church Anastasia, whence he was to depart, and saying thus, Nazianz. Orat. 32. . Oh Anastasia, which hast restored our Doctrine, when it was despi∣sed! Others of the Element of Baptisme, thus: Oh water that hath washed our Saviour, and deserved to be a Sacrament! or thus, Ambros. in Luc. lib. 10. cap. 22. O aqua, u aspersum sanguine (Christum) lvisti, Sacramentum Christi esse meruisti, &c. Oh water which once purged the world! or thus, Optat. lib. 6. cont. Parmen. O aqua, quae & purum eceras or∣bem, & terram lavisti. Oh divine Lavacre, &c. Nay, you your selves can sing, and chant it to the Crosse, O salve Crux, pes unica! auge piis justiam, &c. Est Prosopopoeia. Vasquez Jes. lib. 2. de Adorat. Disp. 9. cap. 4. pag. 445. O Crosse our only hope, &c. and in expounding the same, allow no more than a Prosopopoeia and figurative speech, lest that otherwise your Invocation may be judged Idolatrous. And where∣as in another Romish Anthem it is sung of the Eucharist, Oh holy Feast! This saying (saith another O sacrum convi∣vium! quod omni Sa∣cramento convenit. Tolet. Jes. Instruct. Sa∣cerd lib. 2. cap. 15 p. 366. Iesuite) agreeth to every Sa∣crament. Thus have you heard both from Fathers, and from your selves the like Tenor of Invocation; Oh Church! Oh Water! Oh Crosse! Oh Feast! nothing differing from Dionysius his Oh Di∣vine
Sacrament! yet each one without any proper Invocation at all. And that you may further understand, that this Dionysius his OH! is as in voyce, so in sence the same which we judge it to be, what better Interpreter can you require of this Greek Author Dio∣nysius, than was his Greeke Scholiast Pachumeres? who hath given his Iudgement of this very speech directly, saying that Pachym. in locum Dionys. . Ex O∣rat. in obitum Gorgon. It was spo∣ken as of a thing having life, and that fitly, as did Nazienzene (saith he) when he said of the Feast of Easter; O great and holy Feast! &c. And how should this be otherwise? seeing Dionysius, at the wri∣ting hereof, was not in any Church, or place where the Eucharist was celebrated, but privately contemplating in his minde upon this holy Mystery. The due consideration of these your former so frivolous, and so false Objections provoketh us to cry out, saying, Oh Sophistry, Sophistry! when wilt thou cease to delude the soules of men? In which manner of speech, notwithstanding, we doe not Invocate, but rather detest, and abominate your Romish So∣phistry. And lest any of you should stumble upon the Attribute, which Dionysius giveth to the Eucharist, in calling it a Divine Sa∣crament, as if it should imply a Corporall Presence therein, read but one Chapter of the same Author, and he will teach you to say as much of many other things, wherein you will not beleeve any Corporall Existence of Christ we are sure: for there he equally nameth the place of Celebration, See above, Booke 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 13. Divine Altar; the Sacra∣mentall Signes, Divine Symbols; the Minister, Divine Priest; the Communicants, Divine People; yea and (which may muzzell every Opponent) the matter of this Sacrament, Divine Bread. In the third place is objected this saying of Basil; When the Bread is shewne, what holy Father hath left in writing the words of Invocation? Thus that Father, whence your Father Bellarmine thus; Basil. lib. de Spir. sancto, cap. 27. Verba Invocationis, cùm o∣stenditur, quis San∣ctorum in scripto no∣bis reliquit?] Hunc habemus morem ve∣teris Ecclesiae, ut post consecrationē often∣deretur populo Eu∣charistia, quod nunc fieri videmus, & con∣ceptis verbis invoca∣retur. Ob. Bellar. lib. 2. de Euch. cap. 15. §. Al∣terum. And Durant. de Ritib. lib. 2. cap. 11. Planè ab ipsis Eccle∣siae incunabulis post Consecrationem Eu∣charistiam in altum tollere, Dionys. & Ba∣sil. de Spiritu Sancto, cap. 27, &c. Hence know we the Custome of the ancient Church, namely, that the Eucharist is shewne to the people after Consecration: And that Then (as we see now done among us) it was Invocated upon, even plainly after Consecration, saith your Durantus also, and indeed al∣most who not? But doe you first, if you please, admire the wit of your Cardinall in so framing his Consequence, and after abhor his will to decive you, when you have done: for he applyeth the words spoken by Basil of an Invocation before Consecration, (when as yet, by your owne Doctrine, Christ is not present) as spoken of an Invocation of the Eucharist after Consecration, for proofe of a Corporall Presence of Christ therein, and the Divine Adoration thereof, as will most evidently appeare. For first it is not un∣knowne to you, that the Greeke Church differeth from your Ro∣man in the forme of Consecration at this day, they consecrating in words of prayer, and Invocation, and you in the repetition of Christs words [This is my Body] wherein there is Proved above, Booke 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 3. in the Challenge. no Invocati∣on at all. And Basil was of the Greeke Church. Secondly, your
Archlep. Caesariens∣seu Christoph. de Capite sontium, Tract. var. Sacerdos invocando Deum panem conse∣cravit: Hanc alii, ut Tertulianus, Iren. Justin. Gratiarum a∣ctionem hujusmodi Invocationē seu be∣nedictionem vocant. p. 34 Alicu Theodo∣retus, Basil. Cyril. Hierosol. Iren. Dama∣scen. Theoph. Alex. vocant Eucharistiae formam , In∣vocationem. Ibid. pag. 33. And bee alleageth your Lindanus for a Suffragator in this point. Archbishop of Cesarea, for proofe that Invocation by prayers was a forme of Consecration used primitively in the Greeke Church, citeth the two most ancient Fathers, Tertullian and Irenaeus; and of the Greeke he alleageth Iustine, Cyril, Damas∣cen, Theophilus Alex. yea, and (by your leave) Basil himselfe too: and that Basil was an Orthodox Greeke Father you will not deny. Thirdly therefore (to come home unto you) we shall be di∣rected by the objected words of Basil himselfe, appealing here∣in to your owne consciences. For your Lindanus was, in the estimation of your Church, the strongest Champion in his time for your Roman Cause; he, to prove that the forme of Conse∣cration of the Eucharist standeth not in any prescribed words in the Gospell, but in words of Invocation by prayer (as See Booke . Cha. 2. hath beene confirmed by a Torrent of Ancient Fathers) saith, Paulus non tra∣didit formam Conse∣crationis, quod Basi∣lius ità illustrat, ut sano capiti nihil ad haec sit ullo modo re∣quirendum amplius, cap. 42. de Spi. san∣cto; Verba, dùm o∣stenditur pani (in∣quit) & poculum be∣nedictionis quis San∣ctorum nobis reliquit? Lindan. Pap. lib. 4. cap. 41. That the same is illustrated by these words of Basil, saying, What Fa∣ther hath left unto us in writing the words of Invocation, when the Bread is shewne unto us? adding, That no man of sound Braines can require any more, for the clearing of the point concerning the forme of Consecration. So then, Invocation was an Invocation by Pray∣er unto God, for the Consecration of the Bread set before them, and not an Invocation of Adoration unto the Eucharist, as alrea∣dy consecrated; which your Cardinall unconscionably (we will not say, unlearnedly) hath enforced. Looke upon the Text againe, for your better satisfaction; It speaketh expresly of an Invocation, when Bread is shewne: but you deny that Bread is Invocated upon, untill after Consecration. And Basil demanding [What Father before us hath left in writing the words of Invocation?] is in true and genuine sence, as if he had expresly said, what Father before us hath left in writing the words of Invocating God by Prayer of Consecration of Bread, to make it a Sacrament? as both the Testimonies of Fathers above confessed manifest, and your objected Greeke Missals doe ratifie unto us. For, in the Liturgie ascribed to Saint Liturg. Iac. [San∣cte Domine, &c.] Iames the Apostle, the Consecration is by Invocating and praying thus, Holy Lord who dwellest in holiest, &c. The Li∣turgie of Liturg. Chrysost. [Adhuc offerimus—mitte Spiritum, &c. Chrysostome invocateth by praying; We beseech thee, O Lord, to send thy Spirit upon these Gifts prepared before us, &c. The Liturgie under the name of Liturg. Basil. [R∣spice Domine.] Basil consecrateth by this Invocation, when the Priest lifteth up the Bread, Looke downe, O Lord Iesu our God, from thy holy habitation, and vouchsafe, &c. All these therefore were (according to the Example of Christ) Invocations, that is, Prayers of Consecrating the Sacrament; and therefore could not be Invocations and Adorations of the same Sacrament. And as for any expresse or prescribed forme or pray∣er to be used of All, well might Basil say, Who hath set it downe in writing? that is, It was never delivered either in Scripture,
or in the Bookes of any Author of former Antiquity; and this is that which is testified in your owne Decret. part. 1. C. 11. Ecclesiastico∣rum. Aug. ex Basilio; Quae scripta nobis, quibus verbis sit Con∣secratio, commenda∣vit? Bookes of Augustine, out of Basil, saying that No writing hath delivered in what words the forme of Consecration was made. Now then, guesse you what was in the braines of your Dis∣puters, in objecting this Testimony of Basil, contrary to the evident Sence; and accordingly judge of the weaknesse of your Cause, which hath no better supports than such fond, false, and ridiculous Objections to relye upon. Such as is also that your Origenes dixit, Domine, non sum dignus, &c. Ergò vel vult adorari & invo∣cari panem, vel Chri∣stum ipsum hîc con∣tineri. Bellaram. lib. 2. de Luch. cap. 8. §. Al∣terum. Cardinall his objecting the words of Origen, con∣cerning the receiving of this Sacrament, saying, Lord I am not worthy thou shouldest come under the roofe of my mouth: which hath beene confuted, as unworthy the See above, Booke 5. Chap. 5. Sect. 3. mention in this case. If you would have some Examples of Adoring Christ with divine worship, in the Mystery of the Eucharist, by celebrating the manner of his death, (as Hierom may be said to have ado∣red at Ierusalem, Christ in his Crach; or as every Christian doth in the Mystery of Baptisme) we could store you with multi∣tudes: but of Adoring the Eucharist, with a proper Invocation of Christ himselfe therein, we have not as yet received from you any one. CHAP. IV. That the Divine Adoration of the Sacrament is thrice Repugnant to the Iudgement of Antiquity. First by their Silence. SECT. I. YOV are not to require of us, that we produce the expresse Sentences of ancient Fathers, condem∣ning the Ascribing of Divine honour to the Sacra∣ment; seeing that this Romish Doctrine was neither in Opinion nor Practice in their times. It ought to satisfie you, that your owne most zealous, indefa∣tigable, subtill, and skilfull Miners, digging and searching in∣to all the Volumes of Antiquity, which have beene extant in the Christian world for the space of six or seven hundred yeares after Christ, yet have not beene able to extract from them any proofe of a Divine honour, as due to this Sacrament, either in expresse words, or practice; insomuch that you are enforced to obtrude onely such Sentences, and Acts, which equally extend to the honouring of the Sacrament of Baptisme,
and other sacred things, whereunto (even according to your owne Romish Profession) Divine honour cannot be attributed without grosse Idolatry: and never ther the lesse have your Dispu∣ters not spared to call such their Objections Cleare Arguments, piercing, and unsoluble. We therefore make bold hereupon to knocke at the Consistory dore of the conscience of every man, indued with any small glimpse of Reason, and to entreat him, for Christ's sake, whose Cause it is, to judge betweene Rome and Vs, after he hath heard the case, which standeth thus; Divine Adoration of the Host is held to be, in the Romish Profession, the principall practique part of Christian Religion. Next, the ancient Fathers of the Church were the faithfull Re∣gisters of Catholike Truth, in all necessary points of Christian Faith, and Divine Worship. They in their writings manifoldly in∣structed their Readers by Exhortations, Admonitions, Perswasions, & Precepts how they are to demeane themselves in the receiving of this Sacrament; not omitting any Act, whereby to set forth the true Dignity, and Reverence belonging unto it; many of the same Holy Fathers sealing that their Christian Profession with their Blood. It is now referred to the Iudgement of every man, whether it can fall within his capacity to thinke it Credible, that those Fathers, if they had beene of the now Romish Faith, would not have expresly delivered, concerning the due Worship of this Sacrament, this one word consisting but of two Syllables [viz. Divine] for direction to all Posterity, to adore the Sacra∣ment with divine honour, even as it is taught in the Church of Rome at this day: and to have confirmed the same by some Pra∣ctise, not of one or other private man or woman, but by their pub∣like forme of Prayer, and Invocation in their soleme Masses; or else to confesse, that Antiquity never fancied any Divine Adora∣tion of the Eucharist. Yet two words more. You presse the point of the Invocation of the Sacrament more urgently and vehemently than any other: and we indeed beleeve that the ancient Fathers (if they had held, according to the now Romane Church, a Corporall presence of Christ) would never have celebrated any Masse without an ex∣presse Invocation of him, as in your now-Roman Masse we finde it done, saying, O Lambe of God, &c. or some other like forme. Yet know now that your owne learned Pamelius hath published two large Tomes of all the Masses in the Latine Church, from Pope Clemens downe to Pope Gregory (containing the compasse of six hundred yeares) we say, Latine Missals above forty in num∣ber; in all which, upon our once reading, we presume to say that there is not one such tenour of Invocation at all. This our first Reason, taken from so universall a silence of ancient Fathers, in a case of so necessary a moment, may be (we thinke) satisfactory in
it selfe to any man of ordinary Reason. Our second Objection out of the Fathers followeth. That the Ancient Fathers gain-said the Corporall presence of Christ in this Sacrament, and Adoration thereof, by their Preface, in their presenting the Host, saying, Lift up your Hearts. SECT. II. IT was the generall Preface of Antiquity, used in the Celebra∣tion of this Sacrament, for the Minister to say, [Lift up your Hearts,] and the People to Answer, [We lift them up unto the Lord.] This [Sursum Cord] Calvin. Instit. lib. 2. cap. 17. §. 36. Nec a∣liâ causâ in antiqua Ecclesia fuisse institu∣tum, ut antè myster∣orum celebrationem diceretur, [Sursum corda.] Calvin hath objected against you; and your Cardinall confessing that This Preface In omnibus Li∣turgiis Graecis Jaco∣bi, Basilii, Chrysost. Et omnibus Latinis habetur id, quod eti∣am hoc tempore nos facimus, Bellarm. lib. . de Euch. cap. 14. §. Re∣spondeo si. was in use in all Liturgies of Antiquity, as well Greeke as Latine, and continued in the Church of Rome unto this day; Then answereth that Respondeo [Sur∣ùm corda] non sig∣nificare eevationem ad ocum corporalem, sed elevationem à re∣bus terrenis & curis hujus vitae, ad Deum & res aeternas. Non respondetur, Habe∣mus ad firmamentū, sed [Habemus ad Do∣minum.] Et certè qui Christum quaerebant in praesepi, in templo, in sepulchro, Sursum corda habebant, quià illum quaerebant, qui est super omnia Deus benedictus in secula.—Et fieri potest ut qui terram intue∣tur, cor deorsum—Sic qui in Eucharistia Christum quaerunt & venerantur, cor sur∣sùm habent, si de ipso Christo, non de ne∣gotiis hujus vitae in∣terim cogitent. Bellarm. Ibid. He that seeketh Christ, in the Eucharist and worshippeth him, if he thinke of Christ, and not of the Cares of earthly things, he hath his heart above. So he. As though the word [Above] meant, as the Object, the person of Christ in the Eucharist, and not his place of Resi∣dence in the highest Heavens; contrary to the word in the Greeke Liturg. Grac. [] Liturgies, which is [] Above, wherein the Church alludeth to that [] of the Apostle, Colos. 3. 1. Seeke the things that are above, where Christ is at the right hand of God, as your owne Monet ergo Sacerdos popu∣lum [Sursùm] i. e. super sepum elevarcoda ad Dominum, juxtà exhortationem Apostoli, Col. 3. Quae sursùm sunt quaerite, non quae super terram. Durand. Ratn. lib. 4. cap. 33. Du∣randus, the Expositor of the Romish Masse, doth acknowledge. Saint Augustine saying, Aug. in Psal. 148. [Laudate Dominum in excelsis.] Primò de clo dicit, posteà de trris, laudaur enim Deus, quifecit coelum & terram. Nos adhoc in imo sumus, sed cum cogitamus quomodò illic laudetúr Deus, oribi habeamus: & non sin causa audimus [Sur∣sùm corda.] It is not without Cause, that it is said, Lift up your heares; He sheweth the Cause to be, that wee, who are here at the Bottome, might (according to that of the Psalmist) Praise God in the highest. This, one would thinke, is plaine enough, but that is much more, which we have already proved out of the Fathers, by their Antithesis, and Opposition etweene the Altar on Earth, and the other in Heaven; where we have heard Se aboe, Boke 6. Chap. 3. Sect. 8, &c. Chrysostome distingui∣shing them that fasten their thoughts upon this Below, from Them that seeke Christ in Heaven, as he doth Choughs from Eagles. Ambrose, as they that behold the Image, from them that contem∣plate upon the Trah. Ibid. Nazianzene, as they that looke upon the Signes, from them that see the Things. And the Councell of Booke 4. Chap. 10. Sect. 1. Nice, as they that stoope downe, from them that looke up aloft. And we may not forget the Observation which Booke 5. Athanasius made of Christ in his discourse of Eating his flesh, and drinking his Blood:
purposely making mention of his Ascension into Heaven, there∣by to draw their thoughts from earthly Imaginations, and to consider him as being in Heaven. Cyril of Hierusalem is a Father whom you have often solicited to speake for your Cause in other Cases, but all in vaine; shall we hearken to him in this? He interpreting these words [Lift up your Hearts,] will not have it onely to signifie a sequestring of your thoughts from earthly Cares to spirituall and heavenly (which you say was the meaning of the Councell of Nice, as if that Lif∣ting up their hearts had beene only an exercising of their thoughts upon that in the hands of the Priest, or on the Altar beneath,) No, but he saith that it is Cyril. Hier. Ctech. Mystag. 5. Ob hanc causam lamat Sa∣cerdos [] quià opotet sursùm habere cor, , & non ad terrena negotia deprimere; Paulò post, 19. . To have our hearts in Heaven with God the lover of man-kinde: even as did also Aug. in Psal. 85. Certè rectè admoner, ut Sursùm corda ha∣beant: audiant igitur & faciant, levent ad coelum▪ quod malè est in terra: ibi enim non putrescit cor, si leve∣tur ad Deum. Teste Pamel. Tom. 1. Missal. in Missa Aug. Hippo∣ens. pag. 527. S. Augustine interpret this Admonition to be A lifting up of hearts to Heaven. Whom as you have See above, Booke 6. Chap. 3. Sect. 8. heard leaving our Eucharisticall Sacrifice on this Altar, so would hee have us to seeke or our Priest in Heaven; namely, as Origen more expresly said, Not on earth, but in Hea∣ven: accordingly Oecumenius, placing the Host and Sacrifice where Christ's Invisible Temple is, even in Heaven. Will you suffer one, whom the world knoweth to have beene as excellently versed in Antiquity as any other, to determine this point? He will come home unto you; Tempore veteris Ecclesiae Romanae populus non cursita∣bat ad videndum id quod Sacerdos osten∣dit, sed prostratis humi corporibus, ani∣mis in coelum erectis, gratias agebant Redemptori. Eras. lib. de amab. Eccles. Concord. In the time of the Ancient Church of Rome (saith he) the people did not runne hither and thi∣ther to behold that which the Priest doth shew, bu prostrating their Bodies on the ground, they lift up their minds to Heaven, giving thankes to their Redeemer. So he. Thus may we justly appeale, as in all other Causes of moment, so in this, from this degene∣rate Church of Rome to the sincere Church of Rome, in the primitive times; like as one is reported to have appealed from Ce∣sar sleeping to Cesar waking. Our difference then can be no other than was that betweene Mary and Stephen, noted by Ambrose, Ambros. in Luc. cap. 24. Maria, quae quaerebat Christum in terra, tangere non potuit: Stephanus tetigit, qui quaesivit in coelo. Mary, because she sought to touch Christ on earth, could not; but Stephen touched him, who sought him in Heaven. A third Argument followeth. That the Ancient Fathers condemned the Romish worship by their Descriptions of Divine Adoration. SECT. III. ALL Divine Adoration of a meere Creature is Idolatry; hereunto accord these sayings of August. Tom. 2. Epist. 44. ad Maxim. Christianis Catholi∣cis nihil ut nume a∣doratur, quod condi∣tum est à Deo. Idem Tom. 8. n Psal 98. Timeo terram adorare, ne me dmnt qui fecit coelum & terram. Nazianz. Orat. 31. Ei . Antiquity: No Catholike Christian doth worship, as a Divine Power, that which is created of God. Orthus, I feare to worship Earth, lest he condemne me, who
created both Heaven and Earth. Or thus, If I should worship a Crea∣ture, I could not be named a Christian. It were a tedious super∣fluity, in a matter so universally confessed by yourselves, and all Christians, to use Witnesses unnecessarily. We adde the As∣sumption. But the Romish Adoration of the Sacrament is an at∣tributing of Divine Honour to a meere Creature, Bread. For that it is still Bread, you shall finde to have beene the Doctrine of Pri∣mitive Fathers, if you shall but have the patience to stay untill we deliver unto you a See Booke 8. Chap. 1. Sect. 3. Synopsis of their Catholike Iudgement here∣in; after that we have duly examined your Romish Doctrine by your owne Principles, which is the next point. CHAP. V. An Examination of Romish Adoration of the Sacrament in the Masse, to prove it Idolatrous, by discussing your owne Principles. The State of the Question. IDolatry, by the Distinction of your Iesuites, is ei∣ther Materiall, or Formall. The Materiall you call that, when the Worshipper adoreth some∣thing in stead of God, in a wrong perswasion that it is God; otherwise you judge the wor∣ship to be a formall Idolatry. Now because ma∣ny of your seduced Romanists are perswaded that your Romish worship, in your Masse, cannot be subject either to Materiall or Formall Idolatry, it concerneth us in Conscience, both for the honour of God, and safety of all that feare God, to prove both. Wee begin at that which you confesse to be a Materiall Idolatry. That the Romish Adoration of the Host in the hand of the Priest, is necessarily a Materiall Idolatrie, by reason of many hun∣dred confessed Defects: whereof Seven concerne the Matter of the Sacrament. SECT. I. IT is a point unquestionable among you, that if the thing, in the hand of the Priest, be not duly Consecrated, then the matter Adored is but a meere Creature; and your Adoration must needs be, at the least, a materiall Idolatry. The Seven defects, set downe
in your Romane Missal. Rom. pag. 31. Ubi debita ma∣teria deficit, non con∣ficitur Sacramentum—Si non sit panis triticcus, vel fi alio∣qui corruptus. Et pag. 32. Si vinum sit fa∣ctum acetum, vel pe∣nitùs putidum, vel de uvis acerbis & non maturis expressum, vel admixtum aquae, ut sit corruptum, non conficitur Sacramentum. Missall, and by your Dico, species consecratae perfect misceri possunt cum liquore specie distincto, & tum non manet ub eis sanguis Christi. Ità Thomas. Teste Suar. Ies. in 3. Thom. Disp. 67. §. 4. §. Dico. Et Du∣rand. Si plus apponatur aquae quàm vini, erit irritum Sacramentum. Lib. 4. cap. 42. Iesuite, are these; First, If the Bread be not of Wheat; or secondly, Be corrupt; or thirdly, the Wine be turned Vinegar; or fourthly, of sowre; or fifthly, un∣ripe Grapes; or sixthly, be stinking, or imperfectly mixt with any liquor of any other kinde, the Consecration is void: so that neither Body or Blood of Christ can be there present; seventhly, yea, and if there be more Water than Wine. So you. All which Defects how ea∣sily they may happen, beyond the understanding of every Con∣secrating Priest, let Bakers and Vintners judge. That there are Six other Missal. Rom. in Can. Missae. Sex modis contingere potest formae variatio (nimi∣rùm) per Additionem, detractionem, alicu∣jus vocis mutatio∣nem, vel si una pona∣tur loco alterius, cor∣ruptionem vocis ali∣cujs, detrahendo vel mutando syllabam a∣liquam, transpositio∣nem, i. e. ordini di∣ctionū variationem, ac deinde per inter∣ruptionem, ut pro∣nuntiando unam par∣tem formae, ac quie∣scendo per aliquod spatium, velloqudo aliquid impertinens. Minima variatio de∣struit integritatem substantialm, si per∣at sensus. Bellar. lib. 1. de Sacram. in Gen. c. 21. §. Secunda Prop—Sacramenta rata non sunt, si dum confe∣runtur unum tantùm verbum, quod ad sub∣stantiam pertiner, o∣mittatur: imò si uni∣u syllabae omissio sensum verborū mu∣taverit, at corrupe∣rit, collatum Sacra∣mentum non valet: ut si Sacerdos dixerit, Hoc est Cor meum, pro [Corpus meum.] Azor. Ies. Instit. Moral. Tom. 1. lib. 5. cap. 28. §. Animadvert.—[Hoc est, &c.] Si quis diminueret aliquid, aut immutaret de forma Consecrationis, vel aliquid addat, quod significationem mutaret, non conficeret Sacra∣mentum. Missal. Rom. pag. 33. Haec sunt necessaria necessitate Sacramenti, quibus sublatis, tolliur Sacramentum, ut nimirùm non peccet Sacerdos corrumpendo verba Consecrationis. Item Alan. de Sacram. n Gen. cap. 21. confessed Defect's, incident to either Ele∣ment in the Eucharist, which may hinder the Consecration; and necessarily infer an Idolatrous Adora∣tion, in respect of the forme of Consecrating. SECT. II. AS thus; If the Priest faile in Pronunciation of these words [Hoc est corpus meum:] or in these, Hic est calix sanguinis mei: novi, & aeterni Testamenti: mysterium fidei: qui pro vobis, & pro multis effundetur in remissionem peccatorum. Which your Ro∣mane Missall, and Doctors say may happen, in either of both, six manner of waies: first, by Addition; or secondly, by Omissi∣on; thirdly, by Mutation, and Change of any one Syllable, which may alter the sence of the speech; fourthly, by Interruption of voice, and by too long pausing in uttering of the words; fifthly, by Corruption of any word; sixthly, by some Interposition of words betweene, which are impertinent. Each one of these faults, (say you) concerning either Element, doth so disannull the Consecra∣tion, that The thing Adored is still but Bread and Wine, and there∣fore the worship thereof must be a materiall Idolatry. So you. And how easie it is for the Priest (that we may use your owne Examples) to say, Hoc est Cor meum; or, Hoc est Cor-pus; or, Me∣um corpus est; or, Hic Erit Calix; or, as the Tale goeth of a Priest, who (having many Hosts before him to be Consecrated, lest he might erre in his Grammar, in using the singular number for the plurall) Consecrated in these words, Agrippa. Sicut nattatur de Sacrificulo, sivè verum, sive fabula sit, qui cùm plures haberet Hostias,  Gram∣maticam omitteret, in haec verba consecravit, Haec sunt corpora mea. Devani. Scient. cap. 3. Haec sunt corpora mea; These are my Bodies: we say for the possibility of these and the like Lapses (be∣side this last from the want of wit) the manifold infirmities of
man's speech, either upon Amazement, or Temulency, or Te∣merity and negligence, or imperfection of a Stammering tongue, can give you a shrewd guesse. That there are Foure other confessed kinde of Defects, in respect of the Priest's Intention, whereby the Consecration being hindred, the Romish Adoration must needs be materially Idolatrous. SECT. III. AS for Example, first, Bellarm. Si Sa∣cerdos ingit se conse∣crare, cum non conse∣crat, Christus abest.—Nisi intentio Mi∣nistri sit saltem virtu∣alis, animo faciendi quod facit Ecclesia, non est Consecratio. De Sacram. in Gen. cap. 27. Si quis non inten∣dit conicere, nisi de∣lusoriè aliquid agere. Missal. Rom. pag. 33.—Vel ex oblivio∣, cum hostia aliqua lateat, cùm non in∣tendit consecrare nisi quas videt. Vel si habes coram se undecim hostias, & intendet consecrare decem, non de∣terminan quas decem intendit, non consecrat, quia requiritur Itentio. Missal. ibid. If the Priest in Consecrating (saith your Cardinall) have no intention to consecrate at all; or (to speake from your Romish Missall it selfe) secondly, If his virtuall Intention in consecrating be not to doe a the Church doth; or thirdly, If he should consecrate but in mockery; or fourthly, He having more Hosts before him, than he is ware of; if he intend to Consecrate fewer than there is before him, and yet not knowing which of them all to omit. Of the Easines of all these Defects, the possibility of retchlesnesse, of infidelity, of mockery, and of obliviousnesse in some Priests may sufficiently prognosticate; each of which in∣ferreth a confessed Materiall Idolatry. That there are Six other Defects able to frustrate the Consecration, by reason of the person of the Priest himselfe, as being incompetent for want of due Baptisme. SECT. IV. FOr first you have a Decret. lib. 13. Tit. 43. C. 3. Veniens ad gradum Sacerdotii, camperit tande quod non fit baptizats, ri∣tè fecimus ipsum baptizari. Case of one being a Priest, who had not beene baptized; and next concerning Defects of Baptisme, you resolve (as before of pronunciation of the forme of the Eucharist) Bellarm.—Vel una litera. De Sacram. in Gen. cap. 25. §. Se∣cunda Prop.—Haec sunt necesaria neces∣sitate Sacramenti, ut nimrùm non peccet Sacerdos corrum∣pendo verba Conse∣crationis: ut in Bap∣tismo si quis dicat, Baptizo te in nomine Matris, &c. Ala. ard. de Sacram, in Gen. cap. 21. And A∣zorius, See above, Sect. 2. lit. (c). that if in pronunciation of the words of Baptisme [Baptizo te in nomine Patris, Filii, & Spiritus Sancti] the Minister (whether man or woman) shall vary one word, which may corrupt the true sence of the words, although but in one Syllable, or Letter, be it either by adding, removing, changing, or by any of the six Defects (already spoken of) as in saying, Ego te baptizo in nomine Patriae, &c. or the like, then the whole Consecration is of no effect. The possibility of womens erring, in their Ministery of Baptisme, Car∣dinall Pole may seeme to teach in that his Article, whereof it is inquired, M. Fox his Acts and Mm. pag. 1969. Whether Parsons, Vicars, and Curates be diligent in tea∣ching women to Baptize Children after the manner of the Church. Take with you another Case, supposed by your selves, the Cos Philiarch. de offic. Sherd. Tom. 1. lib. 1. C. 14. Potest dari casus, sicut audivi datum esse, quòd ilius alicujus nobilis sit à levatrice baptizarus aquâ rosaceâ, quiâ est silius nobilis, &c. Au∣thor
delivereth it at length, the briefe is this: The woman bapti∣zeth an Infant, because it as the Childe of a noble man, in Rose-water, the Baptisme is void; the Childe is afterwards ordained a Bishop, and hee is after that sent by the Pope into divers parts of the world, and by him innumerable Priests are ordained; after the death of the Bishop, the case is made knowne, but who they were that had beene ordained cannot possibly be knowne, whose Or∣dinations are all invalid, and their ministery and Consecrations of no effect. What remedy now in this Case? None (saith the Au∣thor) at all, except there be a Privilege in the Pope to constitute all them Priests, who had beene so irregularly ordained, only by his word, Dicendo sint Sacerdotes, saying, Be they all Priests. So he, who notwithstanding had rather thinke the Case could not possibly happen, than to trust to this Remedy. How-ever it might be in this one, the possibility of the other Six Defects neither man nor woman can deny, every one concluding a Materiall Idolatry. That there are manifold confessed possible Defects, disabling the person of the Priest to consecrate, in respect of his no-due Ordination; whereby is occasio∣ned a Materiall Idolatry. SECT. V. YOV have furthermore See the prceding Sect. in the Margent. confessed, that, for want of due Or∣dination of the Priest, the Sacrament remaineth in his former nature only of Bread, and Wine; as if he be an Incruder, and not ordained at all: or else of the forme of Ordination, viz. [Accipe potestatem offerendi Sacrificium: Et Accipe Spiritum Sanctum, quorum peccata remiseris, remissa, &c.] As if it hath beene corrup∣ted, by missing so much as one Syllable, or letter, by Addition, Detraction, or any of the six Errors before rehearsed; as Accipe Spiritu Sancto, for Spiritum Sanctum; or, Accipe potestatem feren∣di Sacrificium, for Offerendi; or the like. That there are many hundred confessed Defects, which may nullisic the Consecration, to make the Romish Adoration Idolatrous, in respect of Insufficiencies, which might be incident unto the Prae-ordainers of that Priest, who∣soever he be, that now consecrateth; for causing a Materiall Idolatry. SECT. VI. IF the Si deicit od Sacerdotalis in confi∣ciente, non consicitur Sacramentum, Missal, Rom. pag. 31. Bishop that ordained this Priest, which now consecrateth, were not a true Priest himselfe, truly ordained, or duly baptized; or else the next Bishop before him, or yet any one in the same line
of Ordainers, untill you come to Saint Peter, for the space now of a thousand six hundred yeares, whereof your Iesuit saith; Multae sunt cau∣sae propter quas non potest accidere, ut Christus non sit prae∣ens: ut i Sacerdos non sit baptizatus, vel non sit ritè ordi∣natus, quod pendet ex multis aliis Causis, quibus er in infini∣tum progredi possu∣mus; ut ex parte ma∣teriae saepè accidit de∣fectus. Suarez Ies. in 3. Thom. qu. 79. Art. 8. Disp. 65. §. 2. The Defect of Ordination is seene in many Cases, wherein, Progredi possu∣mus fere in Infinition (that is) we may proceed almost infinitely. So he. Thinking belike that if we should in this number of yeares allow unto every Bishop ordaining the continuance of twenty yeares Bishop upward to Saint Peter, the number of them all would amount to fourescore Bishops; among whom if any one were an Intruder, or Vnordained, then this Priest faileth in his Priest-hood. Now of these kinds your Plena sunt illa tempora Ordinatio∣nibus Paparum, Ex∣ordinationibus, Su∣perordinationibus. Ba∣ron. An. 908. num. 3. & Ann. 897. num. 6, & 8. & Ann. 900. num. 6 Platina in vita Ioh. 10. sol. 146. & in vita Sergii 3. sol. 148. Historians afford us Exam∣ples of your Popes, some dissolving the Ordinations of their Pre∣decessors, even to the cutting off of one Platina in via Stph. 6. de Frmoso; Abscissis duobus dex∣trae illius digitis, po∣tiimum eis, quibus Sacerdotes in Conse∣cratione utuntur. Popes fingers, wherewith he had used to consecrate. Yet is not this all, for unto these are to be added the other De∣fects, to wit, want of Baptisme, whether for want of due Intenti∣on, being three; or undue Pronunciation, being six; or the Errors either of Intention or Pronunciation in Ordination, all which make eighteene: and these being multiplied by fourescore (which is the number of Bishop-ordainers from this Bishop to Saint Peter) the totall (we suppose) will amount unto a Thousand possible De∣fects, each one whereof, if it happen, doth quite frustrate and annull the Consecration of this Priest, whosoever he be, that now saith Masse; and leaveth to the people nothing but the substance of the Creatures of Bread and Wine to be Adored in stead of Christ Iesus, the Sonne of God. And yet in this Summe are not recko∣ned the foresaid Defects concerning the Matter, or Forme of Con∣secration, or of the Priests Intention therein, or else of his possible Intrusion into this Function of Consecrating of this one Priest, now supposed to be ordained; every Defect being of force in it selfe to infer necessarily a Materiall Idolatry in your Romish Masse. Now rather than you shall call these our Instances odious or malicious, you must accuse your owne Romish Church, because we have alleaged no Testimony, but out of your owne publike Romish Missall, Cardinal's, Iesuites, and other Authors privileged in your Church. We are now in the high point of Christian Re∣ligion, even the principall part of God's Royalty, Divine Adora∣tion, not to be trifled withall. Therefore now, if ever, shew your selves conscionable Divines, by freeing your Romish Masse from a Formall Idolatry in these forenam'd Respects, concerning your confessed Materiall Idolatry; and doe it by some grounds of Truth, or else abandon your Profession as most damnably Idolatrous.
CHAP. VI. That the Romish Masse-worship is a Formall Idolatry, notwithstanding any Pretence that by your Romish Do∣ctors hath beene made to the Contrary. The State of the Question. SECT. I. VPon this occasion, ôh! how your Summists, Theo∣logues, and Casuists doe bestirre themselves for the vindicating of your Church from the guilt of formall Idolatry? The Briefe of your Defence is this: Bellarm. Vbi deest vera Consecratio, nullum est periculum in co, qui bonâ fide Sacramentum adorat, adoratio enim potis∣simum ex intentione pendet; quarè sicut is, qui panem non con∣secratum injuiâ aff∣ceret, putans conse∣cratum esse, gravissi∣mè peccâsset in Chri∣stum: sic etiam con∣tra qui panem eun∣dem adorat, quòd certo credat non esse panem, sed Christū, is propriè & formali∣ter Christum adorat, non panem.

Although (say they, in the Margent) there be no true Consecration, by reason of divers Defects, yet in him who up∣on a Morall certainty, with a sincere minde and good intention, doth adore Bread, it is but Materiall, and no Formall Idolatry, so that he have an habituall condition, as being so disposed in his minde, not to give a divine honour unto it, if he knew it to be but Bread. As for Example; He that giveth an Almes to a Rich man, being probably perswaded that he is not rich, the Act proceedeth from a pious Inten∣tion. And, As it was no sinne in Iacob to lie with Leah, because he thought her to be his wife; so in this case it is no formall Idolatry to worship Bread, being morally perswaded that it is Christ. Thus they. Your Pretences then are three; Morall Certainty, Good Intent, and (at least) Habituall Condition. But alas! all this is but sow∣ing Fig-leaves together, which will never be able to cover your foule shame of grosse Idolatry. To begin first with that which you call Morall Certainty.
That the Pretence of Morall Certainty of worshipping of Bread, instead of Christ, cannot free the Romish Church from Formall Idolatry. SECT. II. OVR Confutation is grounded upon divers impregnable Reasons, one whereof is taken from the Iealouzie of God in his worship; the second from the Faith required in a true wor∣shipper; the third from the nature of an Oath; and the last from the Vncertainty of that which you call Morall Certainty. First then, although Morall and Conjecturall perswasions might excuse men's Actions in divers Cases, yet in an Object of Divine Worship it is utterly condemnable, even because of the Iealousie of the Almighty, who expresseth himselfe to be a Iea∣lous God, Exod. 20. signifying, as Ego sum Deus tus fortis Zeloes, Exod 20 5.] Dicitur Deus Zelôes, id est, zelum tenens: zelus autem est amor pr∣vatus, nolens habere consortium in amato. Et ic viri dicuntur habere zelum de ux∣oribus suis, quia vo∣lunt quòd uxoes suae solos illos ament, & solis illis copulentur. Sic etiam Deus vole∣bat quòd Judaei um solum coerent, & um ut Deum cogno∣scerent: & quandò alius coleretur  De∣us, dolebat, tanquàm i vir videat uxor suam amantem alium virum. Et icut cùm muer alteri quàm viro suo copulatur, fornicari dicitur: ità qui alterum quàm ve∣rum Deum colebat, fornicari dicebatur in Scriptura cum Diis alienis. Abulens. in Exod. 20. pag. 273. col 2. you know, that He will not in∣dure any confort in his worship; his Motto being this, I am, and there is no Other: even as in the Case of mortall Majesty, when as a subject, building upon a morall Certainty onely, shall questi∣on the Title and Right of his Soveraigne established in his Throne, he becommeth guilty of High Treason. Secondly, all Divine Worship must be performed with a Divine Faith, which is an Infallible perswasion of the God-head of that which we honour as God, as it is written: He that commeth to God, must beleeve that God is, Heb. 11. 6. and againe, You must aske in faith, nothing doubting, Iac. 1. because this is the nature of Faith, as the Apostle describeth it; Faith is the Hypostais of things not seene, Heb. 11. That is, (to take your Grae ci optimè interpretantur Hypo∣stasin per substanti∣am, quià fides efficit ut ea, quae credit, non mnùs crta habea∣mus, quàm si subsiste∣rent. Ribera Ies. Co Heb▪ 11. pag. 514. owne Comment) Faith maketh those things, which are beleeved, no lesse certaine than if they did subsist, whereby we are taught both the nature and neces∣sity of Faith in Divine Worship. But Morall and Conjecturall Cer∣tainty is not Hypostasis, which implith an Infallibility of Truth, but an Hypothesis, and supposition of that which may be other∣wise, and hath in it nothing but Vncertainty at all; of which more Chap. 9. Sect. 4. hereafter. Thirdly, God himselfe commandeth his people by his Pro∣phet, saving, Thou shalt worship me, and (in Sepagints. Greeke, ) shalt sweare by my Name. Swearing then is an Adoration, by Invocating of God; and his owne peculiar Prerogative. Hear∣ken now. By this Law of God, none may sweare by any thing, as God, which he dare not sweare is God: But your Ro∣mish Professors, in your Masse, Invocate this Sacrament thus, Sacerdos inclinatus Sacramento, junctis manibus, & ter pectus percutiens, dicit, Agnus Dei, qui ollis pec∣cata mundi, misrre nobis. Et rursus, Agnus Dei, &c. Mssal. Rom. pag. 24. Rursus. Inclinato capite versus Sa∣cramentum, dicit intelligibili voce, Da nobis pacem: Erursus secrete, Domine Jesu Christe, &c. Missal. Rom ibid. O Lambe of God, which takest away the sinnes of the world, have mercy upon us. And what Romish Professor is there who swea∣reth not by the Masse (meaning the Consecrated Host) as by
Christ himselfe? Notwithstanding, no one of your Romish Priests (by reason of the manifold Defects incident thereunto, as you have heard) durst eversweare that this, which is now Consecrated by him on the Altar, is not substantially Bread, or that it is the Body of Christ. It must therefore follow, that your Adoration ha∣ving no better Certainty, than (as you have confessed) to adore it with an [if it be Christ,] is a faithlesse profanation of the name of the Sonne of God, and of his worship. This point, concerning Faith in every Worshipper, will be confessed Thorow-out the 7. Chapter. afterwards. In the last place (that we may ruinate the very foundation of your Excuse) your Pretence of Morall Certainty commeth to be examined, which you have exemplified by one giving an Almes to a poore man, who peradventure hath no need; and of Iacobs lying ignorantly with her that was not his wife. These, say we, are Ca∣ses farre different from this which we have in hand, because God's Almoner (you know) is not bound to enquire of a man, whom he seeth to appeare to be miserable and poore, whether he be a Counterfeit or no; for Charity is not suspicious, saith the Apostle Saint Paul. Iacob, indeed, was bound to know onely his owne wife, but if he had had any probable or Morall Cause of doubt, would that holy Patriarke (thinke you) have beene so deluded, or over-reached a second, and a third time, to defile his Body by an unchaste Bed? But the Causes of your Doubtings are set forth and numbred by Threes, Sixes, Twenties, Hundreds, untill you come to a Thousand, and (as your Iesuite hath said) Almost in∣finite Defects. For indeed if there be (as appeareth) a Thousand hazards in every Masse of any one Priest, then in two Priests, as many more, and so forward; so that if one should heare in his time the Masses of Ten, and Twenty Priests, what multitudes of thou∣sands of Defects would the reckoning make? But we need say no more, than hath already beene confessed of Almost infinite, and (consequently) as many Doubts of an Idolatrous worship; wherein there cannot be so much Morall Certainty, as that, in any one ge∣neration of men from Christ's time, each one of that off-spring hath beene chastly borne, whereunto what Christian is there that dare be sworne? CHALLENGE. COnsider (we beseech you, for God's Cause, for we are now in the Cause of God) whether our God, who will be knowne to be transcendently Iealous of his owne Honour, would ever or∣daine such a worship of a Sacrament, whereby men must needs be still more obnoxious to that, which you call a Materiall Idola∣try, by many hundred-fold, than possibly any can be to any mate∣riall Parricide, or materiall Murther, or materiall Adultery, or any other hainous and materiall Transgression, that can be named
under the Sunne. Thus much of your first Pretence for this pre∣sent, untill we come to receive the See Chap. 7. tho∣rowout. Confessions of your owne Do∣ctors in this very point. That the Second Romish Pretence, which is of a Good Intent, cannot free your Adoration of the Host from Formall Idolatry. SECT. III. LET us heare your Cardinall; Bellarm. Sicut is, qui panem non con∣secratum injuriâ affi∣ceret, &c. See above, Sect. 1. (a). Honour (saith he) dependeth upon the Intention, so that as he, who should contemptuously abuse the unconsecrated Bread, thinking it to be Conserated, should grievously offend Christ; contrariwise he, who certainly beleeving the Bread to be Christ's Body, shall Adore the same, doth principally and formally Adore Christ, and not the Bread. So he, even with the same Sophistry, from only such a seeming Contrariety, wherewith you use to plead for Merits: (to wit) if evill works deserve damna∣tion, then good workes deserve eternall life. But will you be plea∣sed to heare the same Cardinall speake in earnest, from the Prin∣ciples of true Logicke? Mala intentio vi∣tiat opus: sed perpe∣ram inde colligitur opera mala ex inten∣tione bona justificari. Nam opus bonum na∣scitur ex integra cau∣sâ, malum autem ex quovis defectu oriri potest. Bellarm. de a∣miss. Grat. lib. 2. cap. 4. §. Primum enim. Although an evill Intention doth vitiate and corrupt an Act otherwise good, yet it followeth not that a good intent should justifie an evill Act, because no Act is good, except all the Causes thereof be good; but any Act is evill upon any one Defect. So he; which his Conclusion is held as universally true in all Schooles, whether Christian, or Heathen, as any point of Mora∣lity can be. Wherefore it followeth not, that because a man doth something to the Contempt of Christ, in abusing that which he thinketh to be Christ, that therefore the honour, which he doth to that, which he falsely beleeveth to be Christ, should be an Adoration of Christ: as all Heathenish Idolatry, in worshipping stocks and stones, in an opinion of adoring the true God, doe wit∣nesse to the world, as your owne Chap. 7, and 8. Confessions will confirme. CHALLENGE. DOE you not perceive what a patched Cloake of Sophistry your Cardinall cast upon your Good Intent, in your Adora∣tion, to cover the filthinesse thereof, if it might be? and how by another Position he rent the same in peeces, when he had done? Againe, you stand thus farre, furthermore, condemnable in your selves in this point, whilest as you seeke to free your Adoration from Idolatry, by Pretence of a Good Intent; and notwithstanding hold a Good Intention not to be sufficient thereunto, except it be qualified and formed with an habituall Condition, which is your Third and last Pretence; as fond and false as either of the former.
That the Third Romish Pretence of an Habituall Condition, in the Worshipper, excuseth him not from formall Idolatry; proved first by Scripture. SECT. IV. HAbituall Condition you have interpreted to stand thus; See above, Sect. 1. at the letter (a) ad ∣nem. If he that chanceth to worship onely Bread be in that Act so dis∣posed in himselfe, that he would not worship the same Bread, as Christ, if he knew it were but Bread, and not Christ; and by this you teach, that the Act (which you call a materiall Idolatry) is made not onely excusable but (your owne Ibid. words) honest and com∣mendable also. So you. What execrable Doctrine is this that we heare? which cannot be justifiable except you will justifie the Murtherers of the members of Christ; and of Christ himselfe? First, of the members of Christ, we reade of one Saul, afterwards Paul, breathing out threatnings, and slanders against them, Act. 9. 1. and persecuting the Church, 1 Cor. 15. and Galath. 1. and drawing both men and women to Death, Act. 22. 4. And all this, not maliciously, but (as you heare himselfe say) Ignorantly, 1. Tim. 1. 13. and with a good Conscience, Act. 23. 1. and in zeale, Phil. 3. 6. A fairer expression of a Good Intent, in a wicked practice, cannot be, than this was: and as much may be said for his Habi∣tuall Condition, namely, that if he had then (as afterwards) knowne Christ to have beene the Lord of life, and those murthered Christians, to have beene his mysticall members, he would rather have exposed himselfe to Martyrdome, than to have martyred those Saints of God. This Consequence directly appeareth, first by his Answer, in his miraculous Conversion, saying, Acts 9. 5. Who are thou, Lord? next by his detestation of his fact, 1. Cor. 15. 9. I am unworthy to be called an Apostle, because I persecuted the Church, &c. then by his Acknowledgement of God's especiall mercy, 2. Tim. . . But God had mercy on me. Afterwards by his labour for winning soules to the Faith: I have laboured more abundantly than they all. And lastly, in that he was one of those Actors, of whom Christ himselfe foretold, saying, Ioh. 16. 2. They shall draw you before Iudgement seats, and when they shall persecute you, they will thinke that they doe God good service. Which also plainly argueth, that their and his perswasion of so doing proceeded from a Morall Certainty. From these Members let us ascend to our Head, Christ the Lord of Glory; what thinke you of the Iewes? of whom Saint Peter said, You have murthered the Prince of life, Act. 3. 15. But did they this Voluntarily, and Knowingly, as understanding him to have beene the Reder of the world, and indeed the Prince of life? they did not, for the same Apostle testifieth in their be∣halfe, saying, I know you did it ignorantly, as did also your Rulers, Act. 3. 17. If this be not sufficient, heare the voice of the person
that was slaine, Christ himselfe, who did so farre acquit them, saying, They know not what they doe, Luk. 23. 34. Ignorantly then in a Conjecturall Certainty, but yet with Good Intent; of whom Saint Paul witnesseth in these words, I beare them wit∣nesse that they have the Zeale of God, but not according to know∣ledge, Rom. 10. But what for habituall Condition? were they not bent in their owne mindes (if they had understood what Christ was) to have abhorred that so heinous a guilt of the death of the Sonne of God? questionles, for so saith the Apostle: If they had knowne, they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory, 1. Cor. 2. 8. We Conclude, seeing these Iewes, notwithstanding their Morall Certainty, (being seduced by their Priests) or else their Good Intent of doing God good service therein; or yet their habituall Condition, not to have crucified Christ, if they had truly knowen him, were neverthelesse by S. Peter condemned, yea and of them∣selves, as formall and verily Murtherers of Christ; then (ô you Romish worshippers of the Hoast) must it necessarily follow that in your Masses you are equally all formally Idolaters, notwithstan∣ding any of the same three Pretences to the contrary. Wherefore, as Salomon speaketh of an Adulterous woman; Prov. 30. 20. She eateth, and wipeth her month, saying, I have done no wicked∣nesse; so may we say of Idolatrous Worshippers, and their Pro∣ctours: for what else are these your three Romish Pretences, but like such mouth-wipers? or as Anodyna, and stupifying Medicines, which take away the Sence of the diseased person, but doe not cure the disease? So doe you delude miserable people with false Pretences, lest they, discerning the grossenesse and ouglinesse of your Idolatry, might abhor that worship, and abandon your Ro∣mish worshippers. That the former Romish Pretences have no warrant from Antiquity. SECT. V. THe number of Ancient Fathers, whose workes are yet ex∣tant (who liv'd within Six and Seven hundred yeares after Christ) are recorded to have beene about 200. out of whose mo∣numents of Christian learning your chiefest Disputers could ne∣ver hitherto produce any one that justified your Romish worship, by so much as in distinguishing of Materiall and formall Idolatry; nor yet by qualifying any Idolatry under pretence of either Morall Certainty, or Good Intent, or yet Habituall Condition; and there∣fore must we judge that they never gave Assent to this your Sor∣cery. For we may not be so injurious to the memory of so many, so famously learned, and Catholike Doctors of the Church of Christ, that they could not; or of persons so holy, and zealous of Gods honour, and of mens Salvation, that they would not satisfie
mens Consciences, to free them out of thus many and miserable perplexities, wherewith your now Romish Profession of Adora∣tion of the Host is so Confessed above, Chap. 5. Sect. 6. by your Iesuite Suarez. Almost infinitly intangled. CHAP. VII. That the Romish Adoration, notwithstanding your former Pretences, is formally Idolatrous; proved by foure Grounds of Romish Profession. The first is your Definition of Idolatry. SECT. I. DIvine honour (Honor est testi∣moninm excellentiae, quod continetur ver∣bo vel facto, quae de excellentia alicujus convenientem existi∣mationem illi gignit. Sic honor divinus est quicquid verboruns aut officiorum omni∣nò accommodatum est ad gignendam existimationem hu∣jusmodi, quae in divi∣nam majestatem pro∣priè conveniat. Hoc duplici modo, 1. ut opus sit nturâ suâ ità praeclarum, ut quis illud naturali lumine rationis solum Deum tali ho∣noe dignum esse judicet, quale est Sacrificium. Alterum, ut tale sit intentione ejus, qui vult de persons, quam honorat, talem existimationem excitare, quae in divinam majestatem conveniat, licet honor iste alioqui indiffe∣ren sit. Greg. Valent. lib. 2. de Idol. cap. 3. saith your Iesuit Valentia) is whatso∣ever word or outward office that a man doth per∣forme, whereby he doth intend to beget in others such an estimation of God, unto that which he honou∣reth, which is proper unto the Majestie of God. So that Idolatry is an Error in the understanding (saith your Iesuit Est Idololatria divini cultus ergfalsum Deum exhibitio: colere enim pro Deo eum, qui non est Deus, aut ipsum laudando, aut e aliquo modo prosternendo, Idololatrare est.—Idololatria (quae est falsa Adoratio) non est nisi erro in intellectu, quo dignum honore judicamus Deum falsum, cui Idololatrase prosternit. Tolet. Ies. Instit. Sacerd. lib. 4. cap. 24. §. Est igitur. Tolet) in yeelding divine worship to that which is not God, whether by praising, invocating, sacrificing, or prostrating our selves to that which is not God. In a word, Idolatry comprehendeth all religi∣ous superstition (saith your Iesuit Idololatria comprehendit om∣nem superstitiosam religionem, quâ quaelibet res colitur pro Deo, Lorinus Ies. in Acts 17. 16. Lorinus) in worshipping of any thing as God, which is not God. So they, most Theologically and truly. CHALLENGE. NOw apply you these points of your Distinction unto your Host, in the hand of the Priest, which by your owne Con∣fessions may possibly be, and by our proofes cannot possibly but be (after Consecration) Bread still, whereunto notwithstanding he prostrateth himselfe, sweareth by, and invocateth upon, as being in it selfe the person of Christ; the Priest himselfe saying, Nos visibili Sa∣cramento invisibilo corpus Christi prae∣sens, adeoque Chri∣stumcipsum invoca∣mus, & quasi divinum quoddam adoramus, & quavivum quid∣dam ratiorrabile allo∣quimur, rogamus [O salutaris Hostia, &c.] Espenc. lib. 5. de Ado∣ras. cap. 8. fol. 185. & ibid. lib. 2. cap. 9. fol. 25. O holy Host, &c. O Lambe of God, &c. whereby also, according to your Definition of Idolatry, you your selves doe seeke to professe, and thereby to beget in others an opinion of a God-head in the Sacra∣ment, as whereunto Divine honour doth properly belong. How then can you free your selves from the Crime of formall Idolatry,
by pretence of Ignorance, and error of true knowledge of the thing falsely adored, seeing that Idolatry (as you your selves have also defined) is an Error and Ignorance in the judgement of the worship∣per? This were as if one, defining a disease to be a Distempera∣ture of Humours, should notwithstanding therefore deny a man to be sicke, because his humours are distempered. II. That Romish Worship is proved to be formally Idolatrous, by Consequence taken from a Romish Principle, concerning Coadoration, or joynt-worship of Christ with Bread. SECT. II. COadoration is when any thing is worshipped joyntly with God in a Divine Worship, which worship by the Law of God (which saith, Thou shalt have no other Gods but me) is perfectly Idolatry, by your owne Idololatria est, non solùm cum ado∣ratur Idolum, relicto Deo, sed etiam cùm adoratur Idolum si∣mul cum Deo. Exod. 20. [Deos aureos, & Deos argenteos non facietis mecum.] Bel∣larm. lib. 2. de Imag. cap. 24. §. Praetereà. Confessions; and, for feare of this kinde of Idolatry, your Claudius Sainctes Ne Idololatria coitteretur, air, (nempè Claudius Sain∣ctes) cum Christo in Eucharistia debeatur summ{us} divinus{que} cul∣tus, non est eo Adora∣tionis genere colen∣dum sensibile conti∣nens, quo contentus Iesus. Teste Vasquez Ies. de Adorat. lib. 2. Disp. 8. cap. 11. pag. 389. taught that The signes in the Eucharist are not to be adored with the same honour as Christ is. And that therefore Panis substantiam, post Consecrationem, abesse probatur, quià si unà cum Domini substantia panis sub eis∣dem Accidentibus contineretur, periculum eet nē populus simpliciter adoraret panem. Bellarm. lib. 3. de Euch. cap. 22. initio. Et Alanus lib. 1. de Euch. cap. 34. Non posse, ait, in Eucharistiae duplicem existere substantiam, quià Ecclesia esset in summo periculo Idolalatriae, &c. Ratio est, quià cùm adoramus id quod delitescit sub speciebus panis, si esset ib adoraremus. Salmeron Ies. Tom. 9. Tract. 16. pag. 109. Contendit Claudius Sainctes ex unitate Adorationis absentiam substantiae panis colligere: Etenim si duplex maneret substantia in Sacramento, una pa∣nis, altera Christi, non posset citrà Idololatriam unica adoratio in urram{que} referri. Vasquez Ies. quo sup. Bread is not to be adored in the Sacrament with Christ's Body, least that the People, being not able to distinguish the Body of Christ from Bread, should fall into Idolatry. And the person communicating orally (as you say) the Body of Christ, now in his mouth, is not to be adored Regularly, but why? Sa∣cramenta haec in sumente homine, quià quandiù in eo Sacramentaliter sun incertum est, nec regulariter, c ordinarie solent adorari.—Praeceptor meus D. Joh. Benedictus, magnum Dominicani ordinis ornamentum, docuit, majua esse Idololatriae periculū, si Christus adoraretur in homine, quià homo est subjectum rationis capa (honor est autem praemium virtutis) signa verò sacra non propter se, sed propter res, quas figurant & exhibent, sunt veneranda, in iis tantum periculi non inest, quàm i homines peculiari hoc honore propter sumptum sacra∣mentaliter, & sic aliquandiù Christum in eis habitantem prosequeremur. Sic eniur homines paulatim Deos esse putaremus.  de Euch. lib. 1. cap. 6. fol. 14. Be∣cause (say you) man being capable of honour, it might fall out, by lit∣tle and little, that he should be honoured as God. So your owne Ie∣suits and Others. Yet (not to doe you wrong) in this Contempla∣tion Christ, by reason of the Hypostaticall Vnion of his God-head (being no meere Creature) is wholly excepted: whom we are taught by the Fathers of a Generall Conc. Ephes. Tom. 1. C. 12. §. Pari. Neque hominem cum verbo adorandum dicimus, sed unum eudemque, nè illud cùm verbo aliquam divisionis imaginationem meriti objiciat. Et Tom. 4. C. 26.—Adoratione verò non seor Deum, nec seorsim hominem, sed unum Christum. Councell to adore, not in both his distinct natures, but whole Christ.
CHALLENGE. WEE suppose that there is not any of your owne Romish Sect, albeit most superstitious, who would worship with Divine Worship either the Signes, or the Appearance of flesh, or the Priest, whiles the Sacrament is in his mouth, without at least a Morall Perswasion, viz. that he may so doe; nor without a Good in∣tent, viz. that it is well done; nor without habituall Condition, viz. not to doe so, if he knew they were but Signes, Apparance of flesh, or hee meerely a Priest. If therefore there be any Idola∣try, in adoring any of these things with Christ, then certainly much rather (which is your Case) is it Idolatry to worship with Divine Honour, Bread, it being without Christ. III. That the Romish Worship is proved to be formally Ido∣latrous in your Masse, by a Consequence from Romish Doctrine, touching Canonization of Saints. SECT. III.

Mar∣ginals) you shall finde that the Common opinion of your Church directeth you to thinke, that your Church cannot erre in this function, and that all Christians are bound to beleeve the same; but how? upon a Morall and Conjecturall perswasion onely? No, upon a Divine and infallible Certitude, and why? Because (say they) if one Saint may be doubted of, then might also the Cano∣nization of others be called into Question, so that it would be dange∣rous to worship any Saint, lest that we should worship a dead and a rotten, instead of a lively member of Christ: which were an Error pernicious, seeing that every lye, figment, and falshood in religious worship must needs be abominable unto God. So your Arch-bi¦shop, with others. You will aske, what maketh all this to the Question in hand? give us leave to tell you.

Cumigitur ibi non exstat Christus, sed creatura pro Christo invenitur, cui exhibetur Latria, atqudeò Idololatria est. Idololatrae enim etiam hâc er∣rant ratione, qui coelum (puta) aut aliquid aliud adorabunt, putantes se ibi adorare Deum, quem aimam Mundi dicebant, juxta Varronis Theologiam. Non igitur excusantur ab Idololatria, quòd arbitrarentur se unum Deu colere, sicut verè erat unus Deus: sed quod illum ibi adoraant, ubi non erat o modo, quo esse existimabant. Ibid. pag. 134, 135. deduceth a necessity of an infallible assurance of the Canonization of every Saint, from the Infallibility which ought to be had concerning the Conse∣cration of the Eucharist, Thus; If the Worshipper may be deceived in adoring the Host, by mistaking Bread for the Body of Christ, then should it be I dolatry (saith he) as well in the Heathen, who adored Heaven in stead of God. So he. Doe you marke? as well Idolatry, as that of the Heathen; whom neither Morall Certainty, nor Good Intent, or habituall Condition could ever free from a formall Idolatry. Our Argument, from your owne Confessions, will be this. Whosoever may be mistaken, in adoring Bread in stead of Christ's Body, may therein be held as Formall an Idolater as any Heathen. (This is your Bishops Proposition.) The Assumption. But any man may manifoldly be deceived, in taking Bread for Christ's Body. (Which hath beene your generall Confession.) Our Conclusion must be; Therefore any of you may be a Formall Idolater. IV. That the Romish Worship is proved to be a Formall Ido∣latry, by the Consequence used from the Conse∣cration of your Popes. SECT. IV. SAlmeron, a Iesuite of prime note in your Church, endevou∣reth to Fides divina est, quâ credimus Iesum, cadem credimus hun esse Paulum Quar∣tum Pontificem, &c.—Non tantum hu∣man â fide, cui subesse possit falsum. Salme∣ron. Ies. in Epist. Pauli part. 3. Disp. 2. pag. 183, 184. Aloqui eam a∣dorare formidarem. pag. 185. prove that all men are bound to beleeve the new Pope, whensoever he is consecrated, to be the true Pope, not only with a Morall or Humane Assurance, but with a Divine and in∣fallible faith; as were the Iewes bound to beleeve Christ Iesus, at his comming, to be the true Messias: that is (saith he) with a faith that cannot possibly be deceived. We have nothing to doe with your Iesuits Position in this place, concerning the Infallibity of Beleefe of the Consecration, and Election of your Popes, which we have else where proved to be a See the Grand Ro∣mish Imposture, &c. Grosse Imposture. But we are to argue from his Supposition, as for Example.

Vtergò. grounded his Assertion of an Infallible faith due to be had, touching the Consecration of your Popes, up∣on a Supposition; and his Conclusion upon the like infallible Be∣liefe, which men ought to have concerning the Consecration of the Eucharist, wherein (saith he) if there should be any Vncer∣tainty, so that our faith should depend upon the Intention of the Priest, in like manner might every one doubt, whether he may adore the Sa∣crament, as being not truly consecrated; as also make doubt of the Priest himselfe, as being not rightly ordained. So he; who therefore in all these requireth a faith infallible. All these forecited Confes∣sions of your owne Divines, as first concerning your Definition of Idolatry, next in the point of Coadoration of the Creature, toge∣ther with the Creator. Thirdly, in your Beleefe of the anonization of Saints; and lastly, in the Consecration of the Pope, which are but humane Institutions, doe enforce much more a necessity of Infallibility, in every Adoration instituted by God. Now among all the Schismes of Anti-Popes, sometimes of two, sometimes of three at once, and that for forty or fifty yeares space together, if any one of those Popes, in his time, had heard any Papist saying to him: you may not be offended, although I hold your Adversary (as for example Vrbane) to be the true Pope, and yeeld to him all Fealtie and Obedience, for I doe this to a Good Intent, in a Morall Certainty, that he is truly elected Pope; and in an habituall Condition, not to acknowledge him, if I knew him not to be Pope, wherein if I erre, it is but a Materiall Dis∣loyalty; would not the Pope, notwithstanding all these Preten∣ses, judge this man to be formally an Anti-Papist, and pierce him with his Thunder-bolt of Anathema, as Popes have often dealt with Cardinals, Princes, and Emperours in like Case? yet what is this Glo-wormes slimy shine to the glory of Divine Majesty?
CHAP. VIII. Of the Romish manner of Adoration, in Comparison with the Heathen. That the Romish Adoration; by your former Pretences, justifieth the vilest kinde of Idolatry among the Heathen. SECT. I. THere is a double kinde of Worship, the one is Di∣rect, and terminate, which pitcheth immediatly upon the Creature, without Relation to the Creator, whereof your Cardinall Alan hath re∣solved, saying; Dicimus ad ple∣nam resolutionem, cùm cultus termina∣tur ad ipsas creatu∣ras, Idololatriam esse injustam. Alan. de Sa∣cram. in Gen. cap. 23. The terminating and fixing of Divine Honour upon any Creature, is a notorious Idolatry. The second kinde is Relative Honour, having Relation to Christ; whereof your Cardinall Bellarmine hath determined, saying, Latria est cultus Deo proprius, nec per se deferendus imagini, ratione Re∣lationis, Bellarm. lib. 2. de Imag. cap. 24 §. Tertio.—Hic cultus, si exhibetur imagini propter se, est vera Idololatria. Ib. §. Di∣cet.—Si idem cul∣tus exhibetur imagi∣ni propter aliud, ut aequè colatur creatu∣ra atque Deus, certè est Idololatria: nam Idololatria est non solùm cum adoratur Idolum, relicto Deo, sed ctiam cùm adora∣tur simul cum Deo. Ibid. . Praetereà.—Imagini non conve∣nit cultus internus verus Latriae, nec externus proprius, qualis est Sacrificium. Ibid. §. Quarta.—Qui colebant imaginem Chri∣sti divinis honoribus, inter Haereticos numerantur ab Epiphanio, Augustino, & Damasceno. Atque isti cùm Christum colerent, sine dubio imaginem ejus propter ipsum colebant: non igitur imagines licet divinis honori∣bus colere, i. e. cultu latriae, etiamsi quis dicat, id esse facere propter Deum, vel Christum, non propter Imagines. Ibid. §. Sexta ratio. Haec Bellarminus. When [Latria] or divine worship is given to an Image, be∣cause of the Relation it hath to Christ, this is Idolatry, although it be given for Christ, or God, whether it be internall or else externall, as Sacrifice. So he. This we say, first to put you in minde of Sunt benè multi, qui imagines colunt, non ut signa—sed magis eis fidunt quàm Christo. Polydor. Virgil. Invent. lib. 6. cap. 13. Very many of your Romish People, who adore Images Idolatrously; which although you would cloake, yet the Complaints and out∣cries of your owne Romish Manifestius est, quàm ut verbis explicari possit, cultum nimiùm invaluisse, ità ut ad summam Paganorū adorationem nil à nostris reliqui fit factum. Cassander Con∣sult. Art 21. Dici non potest, quana superstitio, ne dicam Idololatria alatur apud rudem plebem. Agrippa de vanit. cap. 57. Superstitiones in populo, dùm Imaginibus exhibent Latriae cultum. Gerson. de probat. Spir. lit. x. Authors will not suffer it to be con∣cealed, One of them saying, that this your worship is more mani∣fest than can be denied; even immediatly and terminately given by your people to the thing it-selfe, which they see and adore, and which all Christian learning teacheth to be Heathenish, in an high Degree. And also note infinite numbers of your Worshippers, who adore Idolatrously, in the same manner of Relation, that which is here condemned by your Cardinall. But to the point, your owne Iesuites Fu∣erunt ex Ethnicis, qui simulachra adorabant, quià ea animata esse credebant divinis spiritibus. Greg. Valent. lib. 1. de Idol. cap. 2. pag. 690. Idololatria quintuplex apud Gentiles: 1. Adoratio ipsorum simulachrorum materilium, vel Daemoniorum illis affixorum. 2. Aliarum Creaturarum, ut Coeli, Teriae, &c. 3. Hominum mortuorum▪ 4. Mundi, tanquàm animati. 5. Substantiarum immaterialium, etiam perse, ut Daemoniorum, sive malorum An∣gelorum. Lerin. Ies. Conc. in Act. 17. 20. Quatuor ob causas movebantur Ethnici credee Idôla esse Deos: 1. quià sic edocti à Pontificibus suis. 2. quià videnatur totus mundùs id credere. 3. quià operâ Diaboli Idola loqueban∣tur, & movebantur. 4. quià humana forma praediti essent. Bellarm. lib. 2. de Imag. cap. 13. §. Quartum. report that some Heathen
Idolaters did worship Idols, beleeving that They were inspired with a Divine Spirit; next that they had foure kinde of perswasions for this their Beleefe, to wit, the Instructions of their Paganish Priests, the Example of the whole world in their times, the power of Devils, speaking in the Images; and lastly, the humane shape, which was presented unto them: neverthelesse so, that they sometimes ho∣noured not the things themselves, but the Spirit which they thought them possessed withall. Will you permit us to compare this with that which you have called but your See above. Materiall Ido∣latry? To this end, we are to try whether there hath beene any Pretence for justifying your Romish, which might not as truly ex∣cuse and warrant that Heathenish Worship; which notwithstan∣ding no Christian will deny to have beene most Formally, and properly Idolatrous. Your Morall, and Conjecturall Certainty would be compared in the first place. This the Heathens might pretend by the Rea∣sons, by you already confessed, to wit, the Prescriptions of their Priests, their Idols speaking, and the Example of almost the whole vast world adoring them. Secondly, you please your selves with your Good Intent, that, in worshipping the Bread, you thinke to adore Christ; and the Pagans (which also the whole world of Idola∣ters professed of themselves, and you your selves have confessed of them) in their most Formall Idolatry, were perswaded they wor∣shipped a True God. Thirdly, you rely upon an Habituall Condition, namely, that although the thing which you adore, be Bread, yet your inward Resolution is not to give Divine Honour unto it, if you knew it were but Bread, and not Christ. But inquire you now into your owne Bibles, and you shall finde that the Heathen were not inferiour unto you in this Modification also; for in the History of Bel and the Dragon it is read, that the King of Babel, and other Babylonians worshipped Bel with Divine Honour, thinking it to live, untill such time as Daniel had discovered it to be but an Idoll: and no sooner had the King perceived the Delusion, but presently commanded it should be demolished. The Case then is plaine. He, and they, who abhorred, and utterly destroyed that Idol, as soone as they knew it not to be God, were therefore, before that, habitually in their hearts resolved not to honour it, if they could have beene perswaded it had not beene a God. In such just Equipage doe these your Romish, and those Heathenish walke together, that from these your owne Premisses, you may take your Conclusion out of the mouth of your owne Arch-Bishop, whom you have heard affirme, that If in the worship of this Sacrament (saith he) we may be deceived, in mistaking Bread, instead of Christ▪ then in this worship as madly Idolatrous as was that (*) See above, Chap. 7. Sect. 2. at (a). of the Heathen. So he. Which sheweth your Cause and theirs, in these Respects, to be all one. We proceed a step further.
That the Romish Worship of that, which may possibly be Bread, may seeme to be in one respect worse than almost the worst of the Pagans. SECT. II. ALthough the very title of this Section may seeme unto you fully odious, yet let Truth (in what apparrell soever it shall appeare) be gracious unto you. Costerus is a Iesuite much pri∣vileged by your Church, who doubted not to airme, that Talis error est, quo in orbe terrarum nunqum vel visus, vel auditus fuit—tolerabilior enim est error eorum, qui pro Deo colunt statuam uream, aut alterius materiae imaginem, quomodò Gentiles snos Deos venera∣bantur, vel pannum rubrum in hastam e∣levatum, quod narra∣tur de Lappis, vel viva animalia, ut quon∣dàm Aegyptii; quam eorum qui frustum panis. Coster. Jes. En∣chirid. de Sacram. Eu∣charist. cap. 8. §. De∣cimo. If Christ be not in this Sacrament, but Bread only, the Error (saith he) is more intolerable than was the Error of the Heathen, in worship∣ping either a golden Statue, or a Red Clout. So he. What reason he had to speake so broad Language, we referre to your Inquisitors, to question him for it. But what Cause we have for the confir∣ming our Title of this Section, we shall not forbeare to impart unto you. It is the profession of your Church to Adore Bread in the Eucharist with Divine Worship, notwithstanding whatsoever Vncertainty of the presence of Christ therein, by reason of (as your Iesuite Suarez See above, Chap. 6. Sect. 6. speakes) almost infinite Defects, which may possibly happen to cause the same. Contrariwise the Heathen Idolaters, touching the things which they worshipped, See in the former Section at (d). Crede∣bant (said your Iesuite) They beleeved them certainly to have beene Gods. For although some Heathen would sometime make some doubt of a [] or, ] what, or who the God was, whom they did adore, as they that said, Sive tu Deus es, sive tu Dea es; Whether thou e God or Goddesse; And the Athenians had an Act. 17. 23. Altar , To an unknowne God, yet hardly shall you ever finde any Exam∣ple of the Heathen, doubting [] Whether it were a God, which they worshipped as God; those of Calecute, and such like Devillish Nations excepted, who are said knowingly to have Adored De∣vils, but (as some people sometime doe homage to Tyrannous V∣surpers, knowing them not to be their lawfull Soveraignes) only Nceant, for feare of hurt. So abominable is your Masse worship, being both contrary to expresse Scripture, which exacteth of every man Heb. 11. 6. That commeth to God that he must beleeve, what? [] If he be? no, but [] That he is God; and also against the light of grace in all Christians, before the darknesse of Popery began; yea and against the light of nature in the very Pagans. For although you doe but seeme to symbolize with them in that one part of Idolatry, thus described by the Prophet, Esay 44. 15, &c. He taketh wood, burneth it, maketh Bread, and of a part thereof maketh a God, and falling downe before it, prayeth, Deliver me, for thou art my God: (Like as is the taking a lumpe of Dough, baking it, and with part of it to feed our Bodies, of ano∣ther part to make a God, worship it, and invocate upon it, ac∣cording to your owne vulgar Rimes: Non est Panis, sed est Deus,
Homo liberator meus: fit cibus expane, caro Deus exelemento: Qui me creavit sine me, creatur mediante me) yet notwithstanding doe you farre exceed them, by adoring only in an Habituall Conditi∣on, If the thing be God, which you worship; Therefore shall they be your Iudges. CHAP. IX. Our Examination of the Reverence professed by Prote∣stants, and the Security of their Profession therein; First, defining and distinguishing the Properties of Reverence. SECT. I. REverence is a due Respect had unto things or persons, according to the good qualities that is in them. This is either inward, or outward. The in∣ward is that our Estimation of them, according to their Conditions and Properties: the outward is our open Expression of our said estimation, whether by words or Acts. First of the inward estimation, whether Naturall, Poli∣tique, Religious, or Divine. Children (for Example sake) are taught by Scripture to honour their Parents, Wives their Husbands, Husbands their Wives, Subjects their Soveraignes, People their Pa∣stors; And all, above all, to honour God. Our outward Manifesta∣tion of these, be it either in word, or deed, or Gesture, is to be discerned and distinguished by the Inward, as the honour to Pa∣rents to be called Naturall; of Subjects to Governours, Politique; of People to their Pastors, Religious; of All to God, Divine, which is transcendently Religious, and Spirituall. And the Outward is common to each Degree; three only outward Acts excepted, Sa∣crificing, Vowing unto, and Swearing by: Homages appropriated to the Majestie of God; Sacrifice to betoken his Soveraignty; Vowing to testifie his Providence; and Swearing for the acknow∣ledging of his Wisdome in discerning, Iustice in condemning, and Omnipotencie in revenging all Perjury, be it never so secret. That the Reverence used by Protestants, in receiving this Sacrament, is Christianly Religious. SECT. II. THeir Inward is their religious Estimation of this Sacrament, in accounting the Consecrated Elements to be in themselves Symboles and Signes of the precious Body and Blood of Christ, a Memoriall of his death, which is the price of Mans Redemption, and to the faithfull a Token of their spirituall Vnion, with all the
Members of Christ; and by the incôrporation of them, in their flesh, a Pledge of their Resurrection unto life. Secondly their outward Application, for testifying their inward estimation, consisteth not essentially in any one peculiar Gesture in it selfe, as you will Conc. Carthag. 6. Can. 20. Quoniam sunt quidam, qui dic Dominico flectunt genua in diebus Pen∣tecostes: placuit san∣ctae & magnae Syno∣do cunctos—stantes Deum orare debere. Durant. de Ri∣us, lib. 3. cap. 2. num. 21. Hoc ipsum diebus quinquaginta à Pa∣scha usque ad Pente∣costen observari con∣suetū veteres Patres testantur. Ratio ex Ambrosio Serm. 21. de Pentecoste, quià Resurrectionem Do∣mini celebremus: & ut Hieron. Proem. in Epist. ad Ephes. Non flectimus genua, non curvamur in terra, sed cum Domino sur∣gentes ad alta sustol∣limus. confesse from Antiquity, whether it be in Standing, Bowing, Kneeling, or the like; even because the Gestures of Vncovering, Bowing, and Kneeling, are outward behaviours com∣municable to other persons beside God, according to their naturall, morall, politique, and religious respects. Howbeit, any of these outward Gestures, which carry in them a greater respect of Reve∣rence, may be injoyned by the Church (wherunto obedience is due) according to the just occasions inducing thereunto. And where there is no such necessarie occasion, there the publique observation of the Rites of Communicating, commanded by Christ in his first Institution, performed (namely) by supplications, and praises, is a plaine profession of Reverence; and more especially that Invita∣tion, used in all Churches Christian, of the Priest to the People, Lift up your hearts; and their answerable Conclamation, Wee lift them up unto the Lord. It will be objected by Some, who pretend to have some Patro∣nage from Calvin, that Kneeling at the receiving of the Communion is Vnlawfull. Every such One is to be intreated to be better ac∣quainted with Calvin, where, speaking of the Reverence of knee∣ling, he saith, Calvin. Institut. lib. 4. §. 37. Jam verò longius prolapsi sunt (viz. Papistae) ritus enim excogitârunt prosùs extraneos, in hoc, ut signum divinis honoribus afficiant. At Christo (inquiunt) hanc Venerationem deferimus. Primùm si in coena hoc fieret, dicerem eam esse a∣dorationem legitimā quae non in signo re∣fidet, sed ad Christum in coelo sedentem di∣rigitur. It is lawfull, if it be directed not to the signe, but to Christ himselfe in Heaven; which is the resolute profession of our English Church, in the use of this Gesture. But to returne unto you, who thinke it no Reverence, which is not given by Divine Adoration of this Sacrament, wee aske, Doe not you use the Sa∣crament of Baptisme Reverently? you doe, yet doe you not adore the water with that [] which you yeeld unto the Eucharist. All this notwithstanding, Calvin his estimation of this Sacra∣ment seemeth but profane to many of you: but the reason is, you would rather condemne him, than judge him, lest that his Do∣ctrine, if it come to examination, might condemne you. For al∣beit he abhorre your Divine Adoration of the Host, yet doth he al∣so Calv. defens. Sanct. Doctr. advers. Westphal. Sive utilitas nostra spectetur, sive digni∣tas & reverentia, quam Sacramento deferri par est. pag. 25. Rursus; Profani, quia sacrae communicatio∣nis pignus, quod re∣verenter suscipere decebat,—non mi∣rum si corporis & sanguinis Christi rei censeantur. Ibid. p. 39. condemne every Profane man, who shall partake thereof in the state of Impenitency, To be guilty of the Body and Blood of Christ. Your next Question will be, after this our Discoverie of the mani∣fold Perplexities, wherein you, by your Romish Doctrine, are so miserably plunged, how Protestants can avoid, in many of them, the like Intanglements.
That Protestants, in their Profession and Practice, stand secure from the first two Romish Perplexities, in respect of Preparation of the Elements, and undue Pronunciation of the words of Consecration. SECT. III. OVr Church commandeth that the best Bread and Wine be provided for this best of Banquets, the Supper of our ord; yet doth it beleeve, that Christ the Ordainer thereof will not de∣prive the soules of his guests of their desired spirituall Blessings, for the negligence of his steward, in being defective to provide the Materiall Elements, if so be that there be therein (according to Christ his Institution) the substance of Bread and Wine. As for Pro∣nuntiation, you know, Protestants make their Celebration in a tongue knowen unto all the people communicating, and in a loud voice, according to the universall Practice of the Church of Christ in primitive times, as See above, Booke 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 6, 7. hath beene confessed. So that the Peoples eares may be their owne witnesses, whether the words of Conse∣cration, either by Prayer, or together with the forme of Repetition of the words of Institution, be truly delivered: which freeth them from your Romish perplexity of not knowing whether the Priest have truly Consecrated, by his muttering of the words in an unau∣dible voice. The Protestants Security, in respect of the third Romish Perplexity, of Adoring in a Morall Certainty. SECT. IV. OVr Profession is to adore Christ with an infallible faith, and not with a conjecturall Credulity, or Probability, as we are taught by the holy Scripture, the Canonicall foundation of Chri∣stian faith; defining Faith to be an Heb. 11. 1. Evidence of things not seene; namely, a more infallible apprehension of the minde, than any perception of sight can be; a faith required of every one, which shall approach in supplication to God: Heb. 11. 6. Hee that commeth to God must beleeve that God is. Infallible faith then must vsher Prayer, yea and preaching also any fundamentall doctrine of beleefe, as it is written, Psal. 116. 10. & 2. Cor. 4. 13. I beleeved, therefore I spake: yea, without divine Faith, it is impossible to use any religious Invocation: Rom. 10. 14. How shall they invocate on whom they have not beleeved? So incredible and faith∣lesse is your Romish Conjecturall Faith of your worshipping, and Invocating Christ on the Earthly Altar, whereas (according to our Christian Creed of his sitting at the right hand of God in Hea∣ven) we, because faithfully, doe See the Consent of Fathers above, Chap. 4. Sect. 2. Catholikely, and comfortably adore him, where he infallibly is upon his Throne of Majestie in Heaven.

Mirum est oli Ecclesiam, in controversia Novatianorum & Dona∣tistarum, asserentium Baptismum ab Haereticis collatum nullum esse, d debita illa intentione Ministri niil dispu∣tâsse. Ergo satis est publica Actio, nisi Minister contra protestetur, aut aliquo modo vitie formam Sacramenti. Sufficit eatenus publicus Actus, ut Notarius publicum conficiens Instrumentum, nec potest intentione sua inter∣nâ, licet derisoriè agat, illud validum reddere. Pro hac sententia stant multi Patres. Aug. lib. 1. cont. literas Pe∣tilian. oppugnans illud Donatistarum. Conscientia dantis abluit conscientiam accipientis. Salmeron Ies. in Epist. Pauli Disp. 2. pag. 186. Iesuite Salmeron, to the contrarie; grounded upon sound Rea∣sons, (among others, this) that this Perplexity, and doubt, whe∣ther the Priest hath a Due intention in consecrating, worketh to the tormenting of mens Consciences, injurie to Gods exceeding bountie and goodnesse, contrary to the Iudgement of Antiquity; and in speciall, against that of S. Augustine; Saepèmihi ignotaest Conscientia aliena, sed semper certus sum de divina misericordia. And lastly, because of the Affinity, which it hath with the heresie of the Donatists. So hee. All which turneth to the condemnation of your Doctrine (tea∣ching a necessary Priestly Intention) of Novelty, Impiety, and relish of Heresie. We adde to this that saying of the Apostle, Phisip. 1. 18. If the word be preached, whether of envie, and vaine glory, or of good will, I rejoyce, and will rejoyce: which proveth that the evill Intention of the Messenger cannot impeach the Benefit of the message of Sal∣vation, and embassage of God. Now there is the like Reason of the word visible (which is the Sacrament) as there is of the Audi∣ble. Take unto you a Similitude, in the marginall Testimony of your Iesuite Salmeron, of a Notary publique making a true Instru∣ment, according to the forme of Court, in the time when hee was distracted in his wits; neverthelesse the same Instrument is of use, and for the benefit of the partie who hath it, not through the In∣tention of the Scribe, but by the will of the Ordainer, and willing∣nesse and consent of the Receiver.
Our fifth Security from your Romish Perplexity, touching Ordination. SECT. VI. TO passe over matters not controverted betweene us, whether the Minister that consecrateth this Sacrament ought to be consecrated by Ecclesiasticall Ordination to this Function (a mat∣ter agreed upon on both sides) the only question is, if hee that mi∣nistreth happen to be an Intruder, and no consecrated Minister, whether this his Defect doe so nullifie his Consecration of the Eu∣charist, that it becommeth altogether unprofitable to the devout Communicant. Your Church in this case sendeth you to inquire after the Godfathers, Godmothers, Priest, or Midwife that bapti∣zeth, to know whether he have beene rightly baptized; and this not satisfying, she will have you seeke forth the Bishop, by whom he was ordained, and so to the Ordainer of that Bishop, and so to spurre further, and further, untill you come to S. Peter, to see whether each of these were rightly consecrated a Priest, and then to search into so many Church-bookes, to know the Baptisme of each one, without which the Act of this Priest now consecrating is frustrate, and your Adoration Idolatrous. Contrari-wise we, in such an indeprehensible Case, wherein the Actor or Act hath no apparent Defect, are no way scrupulous, knowing that things doe worke Ad modum Recipientis: as you have heard in the Example of preaching the word of God, were it by Iudas; or if you will a transformed Devill, yet the seed being Gods, it may be fruitfull, (whatsoever the Seed-man be) if the ground that receiveth it be capable. Therefore here might wee take occasion to compare the Ordination Romish and English; and to shew ours, so farre as it consenteth with yours, to be the same; and wherein it differeth to be farre more justifiable than yours can be: if it were lawfull, upon so long travelling, to transgresse by wandring into by-paths. Our Securitie from the Romish Perplexity of Habituall Condition. SECT. VII. HAbituall or virtuall Condition (as it is conceived by your Pro∣fessours) standeth thus; I adore this which is in the hands of the Priest, as Christ, if it be Christ; being otherwise not willing so to doe, if it be not Christ. What my Masters, Iffs, and Ands in divine worship? These can be no better in your Church, than leakes in a ship, threatning a certaine perishing, if they be not stopped; which hitherto none of your best Artificers were ever able to doe.
For as touching your profane Lecturer Suarez Ies. Sim∣pliciter adorand us est Christus in Euchari∣stia, & aliud exigere ex iis esset superstiti∣osum, & vanis scrupu∣lis, & superstitionibus expositum: neque enim est consenta∣neum ibi trepidae, ubi non est vel proba∣bilis ratio timendi, sed potiùs periculum nè dubitatione devo∣tio animi minuatur. Tom. 3. qu. 79. Art. 8. Disp. 65. Sect. 2. Suarez, labouring to per∣swade you to Adore Christ in the Eucharist simply without all scru∣pulizing, saying, It is not fit to feare where no feare is; when as hee himselfe (as you have heard) hath told us that there are possibly in∣cident See above, Chap. 5. Sect. 6. at (a). Almost Infinite Defects, and consequently as many Causes of Doubting, which may disannull the whole Act of Consecration: there needeth no other Confutation, than this, of his owne shame∣lesse Contradiction, which (as you may see) is palpably grosse. So impossible it is for any of you to allay the detestable stench of plaine Idolatry. Certainly, if S. Augustine had heard that a Wor∣ship of Latria (which he every-where teacheth to be proper to God) were performed to Bread and Wine, as the matter of Divine Ado∣ration, he neither would, nor could have said, in defence thereof, as he did of the Celebation of the Eucharist in his owne time, viz. Aug. Cont. Faust. Mab. lib. 20. cap. 21. Nos à Cerere & Li∣bero Paganorum Diis longè absumus. We are farre from your Paganish worshipping of Ceres and Bacchus. But as for us Protestants, we professe no Divine Worship of God, but with a Divine, that is, an Infallible Faith, that it is God, whom we worship; who will not be worshipped, but in spirit and truth. What furthermore we have to say against your Romish Masse, will be discovered in the Booke following.
THE EIGHTH BOOKE, Of the Additionalls: by a Summary Discovery of the many-fold Abhominations of the Romish Masse; and of the Iniquities of the Defenders thereof. THese may be distinguished into Principals, which are Three, the Romish Superstitiousnesse, Sacrilegious∣nesse, and Idolatrousnesse of your Masse: and Acces∣saries, which are These; Obstinacies, manifold Over∣tures of Perjuries, Mixture of many ancient Heresies in the De∣fenders thereof. CHAP. I. Of the peremptory Superstitiousnesse of the Romish Masse, in a Synopsis. SECT. I. MAny words shall not need for this first point. Superstition is described by the Apostle, in this one word, Coloss. . , that is, Man's will-worship; as it is opposite to the wor∣ship revealed by the will of God. What the will of Christ is, concer∣ning the Celebration of the Sacra∣ment of his Body, and Blood, wee have learned by his last will and Te∣stament, expressely charging his Church, and saying, [DOE THIS:] pointing out thereby such proper Acts, which concerned either the Administring or the Participating of the same holy Sacra∣ment. But now commeth in Mans's will-worship, ordained in the Church of Rome; as flatly contradictory to the same Command of Christ, by Ten notorious Transgressions, as if it had beene in di∣rect Termes countermanded thus, [Doe not This] (as hath beene Booke 1. thorow∣out. proved:) notwithstanding the former direct Injunction of Christ, or conformable Observation of the holy Apostles, or Consent,
and Custome of the Church Catholique; and that without respect had to the due Honour of God, in his worship; or Comfort, and Edification of his People. And then is Superstition most bewitching, when it is disguised under the feigned vizard of false Pretences (which have beene ma∣ny) devised by the new Church of Rome, in an opinion of her owne wisdome, to the befooling and vilifying of the Antient Cathólique Church of Christ: which never esteemed the same Reasons rea∣sonable enough, for making any Alteration; but (notwithstan∣ding such imaginations) precisely observed the Precept, and Or∣dinance of Christ. But that, which exceedeth all height of Superstition, is, when upon the will-worship of man are stamped counterfeit Seales of forged Miracles, as if they had beene authorized by the immedi∣ate hand of God; whereof your Legendaries have obtruded upon their Readers Booke 4. Chap. 2. and 3. Thirteene Examples, to wit, of Fictitious Appari∣tions of visible Flesh, and Blood of Christ, in the Eucharist: which ma∣keth your Superstition Blasphemous, as if God should be brought in for the justifying of Falshood; a Sinne abhorred by holy Iob, say∣ing to his Adversaries, Iob 13. 4, & 7. You are Forgers of Lies: will you speake deceitfully for God? And furthermore how Sacrilegious, and Ido∣latrous your Romish Superstition is, you may behold in the Secti∣ons following. Of the Sacrilegiousnesse of the Romish Masse, and Defence thereof, in the point of Sacrifice; comprized in this Synopsis. SECT. II. SAcrilege is whatsoever Violation of any sacred Person, Place, or Thing. Now omitting to speake of your Dismembring the Eucharist, by administring it but in One kinde (which your Pope Booke 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 7. in the Challenge. Gelasius condemned for Grand Sacrilege) or of the like points for∣merly discovered, we shall insist only in your Churches Doctrine of Sacrifice, wherein your Sacrifice is found to be grossely Sacrile∣gious in the Tractate of the Sixth Booke. I. By Creating a new Sacrifice, as Proper, and thereby assu∣ming to her selfe that Booke 6. Chap. 1. Sect. 5. Excellencie of Prerogative, which is proper to Christ alone the high Priest, and Bishop of our Soules (namely) the power of ordaining Sacraments; or (if need were) Sacrifices in his Church. Which Guiltinesse we may call a Counterfeiting of the Seale of Christ. II. By making this Sacrifice, in her pretence, Christian; but but indeed Booke 6. Chap. 5. Sect. 1. Earthly, and Iewish. III. By dignifying it with a Divine property of Ibid. Chap. 10. Meritorious, and Satisfactorie Propitiation. IV. By professing another properly Satisfactorie and Ibid. and after, &c. Propi∣tiatory
Sacrifice, for Remission of sinnes, besides that which Christ offered upon the Crosse. As if after one hath paid the Debts of many at once, upon condition that such of those Debters should be discharged, whosever submissively acknowledging those Debts to be due, should also professe the favour of their Redeemer; It cannot but be extreme folly for any to thinke, that the money once paid should be tendred, and offered againe, as often as One or Other of the Debters should make such an acknowledgement, the Surety having once sufficiently satisfied for all. So Christ having once for all satisfied the justice of God, by the price of his blood, in the behalfe of all penitent Sinners, who in Contrition of heart and a living Faith apprehend the Truth of that his Redemp∣tion; it cannot but be both injurious to the justice of God, and to the merit of Christ, that the same satisfactory Sacrifice, as it were a new payment, ought againe, by way of Satisfaction, be personally performed and tendred unto God. V. By detracting from the absolute Function of Christ his Ibid. Chap. 3. Sect. . Priesthood now eminent, and permanent before God in Heaven; and thereupon stupifying the mindes of Communicants, and (as it were) pinioning their thoughts, by teaching them so to gaze, and meditate on the matter in the hands of the Priest, that they cannot (as becommeth Spirituall Eagles) soare alost, and contem∣plate upon the Body of Christ, where it's infallible Residence is, in that his heavenly Kingdome. VI. By transforming (as much as they can) the Sacrament, ordained for Christians to eat with their owne mouthes, into a Ibid. Theatricall Sacrifice, wherein to be fed with the mouth of the Priest. VII. By abasing the true value of Christ his Blood, infinitely exceeding all valuation, in making it but Ibid. Chap. 10. Sect. 4. finite; whereas Christ being , God and Man in one person, every propitiatory worke of his must needs be , and therefore of an infinite price, and power. VIII. By denying the Effect of his Ibid. Chap. 11. Propiiation for Sinne to be plenary, in the Application thereof. IX. There hath beene noted (by the way) the Portion appro∣priated to the Priest, out of your Sacrifice, and to be applyed to some particular Soule for money: being an Invention, as hath beene confessed, voyd of all Ibid. Chap. . Sect. 4. Warrant, either by Scripture, or by Antient Tradition. To say nothing of your fine Art of cheating mens Soules by Priestly Fraud; whereof, as also of the Rest, wee have discoursed at Booke 6. ▪ ut. large.
A New Instance, for proofe of Romish Sacrilegiousnesse, in the Prayer set downe in the Liturgie of their Masse. SECT. III. IN your Missall, after Consecration, it is prayed thus: Missal. Rom. Of∣ferimus Majestati tuae, Domine, Imma∣culatam Hostiam san∣ctum panem viae ae∣ternae, & Calicem sa∣lutis perperuae—su∣pra quae propitro vul∣tu respicere digneris, sicut dignatus es mu∣nera justi pueri tui Abel. And in the next place. Jube hae per∣ferri per manus sancti Angeli in sublime Al∣tare tuum coeleste. Wee offer unto thy Majesty, O Lord, this immaculate Host, this holy Bread of eternall life, this Cup of everlasting salvation, upon which vouchsafe to looke with a propitious and favourable Countenance, as thou didst accept the gifts of thy holy servant Abel, and command these to be caried up into thy celestiall Altar, &c. So the Canon of your Masse. Some Protestants, in their zeale to the glory of Christ, impute unto you hereupon a Sacrilegious Profanenesse, whilest you beleeving That Host, and That Cup to be the very Body, and Blood of Christ, and a Propitiatory Sacrifice in it selfe, yet doe so pray God to be propitious unto it, and to accept it, as hee did the Sacrifice of Abel; yeelding thereby no more estimation to Christ, than to a vile sheepe, which was offered by Abel. At the hearing of this, your Cardinall (See the Bellarm. lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 24. Facilis est respensio: Non petimus pro Christi reconciliatione apud Patrem, sed pro no∣stra infirmitate: etsi enim oblatio conse∣crata ex parte rei, quae offertur, & ex parte Christi princi∣palis offerentis sem∣per Deo placebat, ta∣men ex parte Mini∣stri & populiastantis, qui simul etiam offe∣runt, fieri potest ut non placeat—Paulò . Comparatio non est inter Sacrificium nostrum, & Sacrificiū Abelis, sed tantùm ratione fidei, & devo∣tionis offerentium, ut nimirum tanta fide offerant, quantâ Abel—quod Sacrificium Abelis non habetet in se, quod Deo pla∣cere, cumque placare possit, quare dicitur Heb. 11. per fidem ob∣tulit Abel Deo Sacri∣ficium melius—Ratio. Gen. 4. Respe∣ Deus a Abel, & Sacrificium. Post. . Porrò.—Deferri Sacrificium per ma∣nus Angeli nihil aliud est, quam intercessi∣one Angeli commendari Deo nostrum obsequium, & cultum. So also Suarez Tem. 3. Disp. 83. Art. 4. Jube hae, i. e. oa nostra. Et Salmeron es. Tom. 9. Tract. 32. sub. finem. Margent) 1. Prefaceth, 2. Answereth, 3. Illustrateth, 4. Reasoneth. First of his Preface. The Answer (saith he) is easie. As if that Objection, which seemeth to us a huge logg in your way, were so little an ob∣stacle, that any might skip over it. But have you never seene men, in trusting too much to their nimblenesse, to over-reach them∣selves in their leape, stumble, fall, and breake their limbes? Sembably he in his Answer (which is the second point,) The meaning of our Church (saith he) is not to pray for Christs reconciliá∣tion, who was alwayes well pleasing to God, but in respect of the infir∣mity of the Priest, and people, that the offering may be accepted from them. So he. But whatsoever the meaning of the Priest in his praying is, sure we are this cannot be the meaning of the Prayer; for the matter prayed for is set downe to be Holy Bread of life, and Cup of Salvation, which you interpret to be substantially the Body and Blood of Christ in the Sacrament; and the tenour of prayer expressely is, [Vpon which Lord looke propitiously] wee say, upon which, not upon whom; which point is confirmed in that which followeth. Thirdly therefore he illustrateth. The Comparison (saith he) is not absolutely betweene the Sacrifice of Abel, and of Christ, but in respect of the faith and devotion of the Priest, and people, that they with like faith may offer, as Abel did. But this piece of Answer is that, which is called in Musicke Discantus contra punctum, for the prayer is directly: Looke downe propitiously upon these, as thou didst upon the gifts of Abel. The Comparison then is distinctly be∣tweene the Gifts, and not betweene the Givers. Yea but not abso∣lutely
so meant (saith he:) be it so, yet if it be so meant but in part, that Christ, who is Propitiation it selfe, shall be prayed for to be propitiously, and favourably looked upon by God, the prayer is Sacri∣legious in an high degree. Fourthly his Reason. It is knowen (saith he) that the Sacrifices of sheepe and Oxen had nothing in themselves, whereby to pacifie, or please God, the Scripture saying, that Abel offered a better Sacrifice than Cain. And againe, God had respect to Abel, and to his Gifts. So he. Which is the very Reason that perswadeth Protestants to call that your Prayer most Sacrilegious, because whereas the Gifts of Abel were but Sheepe, &c. you, notwithstanding, compare them with the offering up of Christ, saying, As thou didst the Gifts of Abel. For although it be true, that the Gift of Abel was accepted for the faith of the Giver, and not the Giver for his Gift; yet if you shall apply this to the point in Question, then your Gift (in your Opinion) being Christ, and your Givers but simply men, (whom you have called Priest, & People) it must follow that Christ is accepted for the faith of the Priest, and People; and not the Priest and People for Christ, which maketh your Prayer far more abominably Sacrilegious. And not much lesse is that which fol∣loweth, praying God to command his Angell to cary (if the Gift be He) Christ into heaven; contrary to the Article of our Catho∣lique Faith, which teacheth us to beleeve his perpetuall Residence in heaven, at the right hand of the Father. Hee answereth: Bellarm. sup. It is not meant, that God would command his Angell to cary Christs Body, but our prayers and desires, by their intercession unto God for us. So he. Which is as truly a false Glosse, as the former; for, in the Te∣nour of your Masse, the Subject of your prayer is [Holy Bread of life, and Cup of salvation.] The prayer is plainly thus▪ Vpon which, O Lord, looke propitiously: and immediately after, Command [These] to be caried by thy Angell. Marke, [These] viz. That Bread of life, and Cup of salvation, even that, which you call, The Body, and Blood of Christ, as corporally Present: which maketh your prayer to be Sacrilegious still, and your Expositors (that we may so say) miserably Ridiculous. That the former Romish Prayer, as it was Antient, doth in the (then) true meaning thereof condemne the now Romish Church of the former Sacrilegious Innovation. SECT. IV. FOR to thinke that it should be prayed, that God would be propitious to Christ, were an Execrable opinion, even in the Iudgement of our Adversaries themselves; who for avoi∣dance thereof have obtruded an Exposition, as farre differing from the Text, as doth This from That, or Christ from the Priest, as you have heard. But whither will hee now? Your Cardinall telleth
you, that the words of your Romish Canon are antient, such as are found in the Bellarm. lib. 2. de Missa, cap. 24. Super quae propitio, &c. ha∣bentur apud Ambro∣sium post consecrati∣onem. Lib. 4. de Sa∣cram. cap. 6. Rss Bellar. ibid. Haec ver∣ba posita sunt post consecrationem apud Ambrosium lib. 4. de Sacram. cap, 6. in Li∣turgs Jacobi, Cle∣mentis, Basilii, Chry∣sostomi. Missalls of S. Iames, of Clement Pope of Rome, of Basil, of Chrysostome, and of Ambrose. You will hold it requi∣site that wee consult with these Liturgies, set out by your selves, for the better understanding of the Tenour of your Romish Masse. The Principall Quaere will be, whether Antiquity in her Liturgies, by praying to God for a propitious Acceptation, and admittance into his celestiall Altar, meant (as your Cardinall answered) Propitious∣nesse towards Priest, and People, in respect of their faith, and devo∣tion; and not towards the Things offered distinctly in themselves. In the pretended Liturgie of S. Liturgia Iacobi an∣tè Consecratienem. Di∣aconus. Oremus pro sanctificatis tremen∣dis donis—ut Do∣minus acceptis is in super-coelese spiritu∣ale Altate suum in o∣dorem suavitatis mit∣tat nobis divinam gratiam. Tum Sacer∣dos. Deus, ac Pater Domini Dei, & Ser∣vatoris—qui tibi oblata munera fru∣gum oblationes acce∣pisti in odorem suavi∣tatis—sanctifica animas nostras. Post Sacerdos consecras ver∣ba Consecrationis adhi∣bet: Sancte qui in san∣ctis requiscis—suscipe hymnum in∣corruptum in sanctis & incruentis Sacrifi∣ciis tuis. Iames (before Consecration) the prayer to God is, To accept the Gifts into his celestiall Altar; even the Gifts, which he called The fruits of the earth. And then after, for the Parties, as well Priest, as People, To sanctifie their soules. In the Liturgie of Liturgia Basilii an∣tè Consecrationem. Pon∣tifex—Suscipe nos, ut simus digni offerre rationabile illud abs{que} sanguine Sacrificium—& vide super ser∣vitutem nostram t suscepisti munera Abel, sic ex manibus nostris suscipe ista ex benignitate tuâ. Et rursus Diac. Prooblatis, sancti∣ficatis, & honorificentissimis muneribus Deum postulemus, ut qui accepit ea in sancto & supercoelesti Altari suo in odorem suavitatis, emittat gratiam & spiritum nobis, &c. Pst, sequitur Consratis. Potifex: Respice Domine Iesu. Et post Consecrationem; Gratias agimus. Basil (before Consecration) it is prayed to God, that the Receiving the Gifts into his celestiall Altar, would also (concerning the Parties) send his Grae, and Spirit upon them. And no lesse plainly Pope Clement. Constitut. lib. . cap. 16. called, Constitutio Jacobi, a∣pud Binium. Tu, qui Abelis Sacrificium suscepisti—And after, Pro omnibus tibi gloria, &c. cap. 17. Benignè aspicere digeris super haec dona propoita in conspectu tuo—& complaceas tibi in eis, in honorem Christi, & mittas spiritum super hoc Sacrificium, testem passionum ejus—ut ostendas hun panem corpus ejus, &c. Po Consecrationem, cap. 19. Etiam rogemus Deum, per Christum suum, pro munere oblato Domino, ut Deus, qui bonus est, suscipiat illud pe Medistorem Christ in coelee Altare suum in odorem suavitatis pro hâc Ec∣clesiâ, &c. Clemens teaching (before Conse∣cration) to pray God, who received the Gifts of Abel gratiously, to behold these Gifts propounded to the honour of his Sonne Christ; ex∣pressely differenceth this Sacrifice done, in honour of Christ, from Christ himselfe, who is honoured thereby. And after Consecration to Beseech God through Christ to accept the Gift offered to him, and to take it into his Celestiall Altar; where the prayer to God is not to accept of Christ, but of the Gift for Christ's sake, and to the honour of Christ, in whom God is Propitious unto us: wee say againe, the Gift for Christ, and not Christ for the Gift, (what can be more plaine against all Corporall Presence of Christ in the Sacrament?) and to receive it into his Celestiall Altar, but how? by intercession of Angells? No, but expressely thus: By Christ the Mediatour. In the Liturgie of Missa Chrysostomi antè Consecrationem. Adhuc oferimus tibi rationabile, & incruentum hoc obse∣quium, Deposcimus ut mittas Spiritum sanctum super nos, & super apposita muneta. Sequitur Consecratio. Fac Panem istum preciosum Corps, &c. Post Consecrationem. Adhuc offerimus tibi rationabile hoc obsequium pro fi∣deliter dormientibus, &c. Post. Dominum deprecemur, ut qui sscepit ea in sancto & coelesti Altari suo, mittat nobis propterea gratiam, & donum Spiritus Sancti. Chrysostome (before Consecration) God is prayed unto, and supplicated thus: We beseech thee to send thy Spirit upon us, and upon the Gifts set before us. Even as As. de Sacram. lib. 4. cap. 6. post Consecrationem. Offe∣rimus tibi hunc Panem anctum,  Calicem, & petimus ut hanc Oblationem suscipias in sublimi Altari tuo per manus Angelorum, sicu acipere dignatus es munera pucri tui Abel, &c. Ambrose explaineth his Supplication (after Conse∣cration)
for God, To accept this Oblation, namely that, which hee called Holy Bread, and Cup. If therefore these former Formes may interpret your Romane Li∣turgie, as it was Antient, the prayer therein to God, desiring him to be Propitious, must have relation to the things above specified called Holy Bread of life, and Cup of Salvation, as distinguished from Priest, and People. Wherefore your Romane Missalls being so Antient in this one point, in praying God (after Consecration) to be Propitious to that, which is called the Bread of life eternall, and Cup of everlasting salvation; lest it might carry a Sacrilegious Sence, to wit, that the Body of Christ is here the proper Subject of the Eucharist, and consequently to need a Propitiation to God, by virtue of mens prayers (thereby greatly derogating from the meri∣torious Satisfaction of Christ:) you ought to reduce this your Ro∣mane Canon to the Orthodox meaning of Antient Liturgies above mentioned; and to understand it Sacramentally only, (namely) our Objective Representation, Commemoration, and Application thereof by us, which is our Act of Celebration. To the former vast heape of Sacrilegious Positions, and Practi∣ces, wee may adde your other many vile, and impious Booke 5. thorow∣out. Indigni∣ties offered to the all-glorious Sonne of God, in making his sacred Body, in your owne opinions, obnoxious to the Imprisoning in Boxes, Tearing with mens Teeth, Devouring, Vomiting it by the Communicants, and the Transmittance into your guts, together with the Eating, and Feeding thereupon by Dogs, Mice, Wormes, and (which transcendeth, if it may be, all your other Absurdities) to be deprived of all naturall power of Motion, Sence, and Vnderstan∣ding. O Abominable! Abominable! A Synopsis of the Idolatrousnesse of the Romish Masse, and Defence thereof; by many Evidences from Antiquity. SECT. V. OVR first Argument is against the foundation thereof, which is your Interpretation of the Article [HOC] by denying it to have Relation to Bread; contrary to the verdict of an Inquest of Antient Fathers, shewing that the same pointeth out Bread, as you have Booke 2. Chap. 1. Sect. 6. heard; whereby the monstrous Conception of Tran∣substantiation is strangled in the very wombe. Insomuch that sometimes they expressely Ibid. interpret it thus; Christs Body, and Blood, that is, (say they) The Bread, and Wine: Item, Hee gave the name of the Signe to the thing signified. Item, Bread the Signe of his Body: And lastly, Bread is called Christs Body, because it signifieth his Body. Secondly (in the point of Transubstantiation it selfe) they calling
the Eucharist (which you dare not) Booke 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 5. & 11. & Sect. 14. in Chryso. and by Cyprian his Confutation of the Aquarii, ibid. Sect. 5. & Booke 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 3. Bread, and Booke 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 5. Wine, after Con∣secration, and naming them Ibid. Sect. 13. Earthly materialls, and Matter of Bread, and also (as you have heard out of the Antient Liturgies) Above in this Booke Chap. 1. Sect. 4. Fruits of the Earth; and yet more plainly, by way of Periphrasis, describing them to consist of Booke 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 6. Divers graines, and Divers grapes. After, by approving the Suffrage and judgement of our Booke 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 8, 9, &c. Senses, in discerning all Sensible things; and in speciall the Eucharist it selfe; and at length affirming, that there remaineth therein the Booke 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 11. Substance of Bread, and Wine, which are the Subject matter of your Divine Adoration. All which are other Three Demonstra∣tions of their meanings; every singular point being avouched by the Suffrages of Antiquity. Thirdly against your Faith, concerning the manner of Corporall Presence of Christ in the Eucharist; because so farre were the Fa∣thers from beleeving that the Body of Christ could be in Booke 4. thorow∣out. divers places (as you say in Millions) at one time, that by this pro∣perty of Being in many places at once, they have discerned Angells to be Finite Spirits, and not God. They have distinguished the Godhead of Christ from his Manhood; and they have proved the Holy Ghost to be God, and no Creature by the same Reason. Than which Three Arguments none can be more Convincent. Where∣unto you may adde the Fathers speeches, contradicting your Dreame of a Body whole in every part, in whatsoever space, or place: by judging it Impossible; and also concluding Christ his Ascension into Heaven, to argue his Absenc from Earth; all which have Ibid. Chap. 7. Sect. 6. and Booke 5. Chap. 3. thorowout. been discussed from point to point. Our Fourth Generall Argument is, that whereas your Corporall Presence must needs inferre Corporall Eating thereof by the Com∣municants, notwithstanding you have heard the contrary Sen∣tences of Antient Fathers, against Booke 5. thorow∣out. Tearing, and Swallowing of Christ's Body, and Bodily Egestion: next concerning the Eaters, that only the Godly faithfull are partakers thereof; insomuch that even the Godly under the old Testament did eat the same. Then, of the Remainders of the Consecrated Hosts, that they were Booke 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 10. Eaten (by the ordinance of the Church) by Schoole-boyes, and sometimes Burnt in the fire: besides they called them Booke 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 11. and Booke 7. Chap. 3. Sect. 2. Bits, and Fragments of Bread broken, (after Consecration) and diminished: and lastly in respect of the End of Eating, Booke 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 11. They held the thing present to be a pledge of Christ's Body absent, and also Booke 5. Chap. 5. Sect. 3. allowed such a Touch of his Body by Faith, that whosoever so toucheth him is Sanctified. Which Observations, concerning our Fourth Generall Argument, doe minister unto us five particular Reasons, which make our De∣fence to be Impregnable. Fifthly, forasmuch as you teach the Subject matter of the Eu∣charist to be the Body of Christ, as a proper Sacrifice propitiatory; wee, upon due inquisition into the doctrine of Antiquity, have Booke 6. Chap. 3. Sect. 2. thorowout, and else-where. found the Antient Fathers 1. Noting that, which they called
Sacrifice herein, to be Bread, and Wine, saying thereupon that Melchizedech in that his Bread and Wine offered the Body and Blood of Christ. 2. Such a Subject, which being taken in great Quantity doth Booke 4. Chap. 10. Sect. 1. nourish and satiate mans Bodily Nature. 3. Such as needeth prayer to God, that it may be In this Booke 8. Chap. 1. Sect. 3. Acceptable to God, as was the Sacrifice of Abels sheepe. 4. Sonaming it an Vnblody Sa∣crifice, as meaning thereby Booke 6. thorow∣out, more especially Chap. 5. Sect. 9, & 10. void of Blood, which cannot agree to the Body of Christ now risen from death. 5. So qualifying their other Exuberances, and Excesse of speech (wherein they named it The same Sacrifice of Christ once offered) by an , corre∣cting it thus; Booke 6. Chap. 5. Sect. 6. A Sacrifice, or rather a Memoriall thereof. 6. By pla∣cing the Sacrifice of Christ his Body, as now Presentative only in Heaven; and the thing offered on Earth but a Signe. 7. In all your objected Testimonies, for proofe of the same Body of Christ in the Eucharist, which suffered on the Crosse, they understood the same as the Booke 6. Chap. 5. Sect. 1, 2, 3, 4, &c. Object of our Remembrance, and not as the Subject of Offe∣ring, which make up so many Arguments moe. 8. By paralleling In this Booke, Ch 2. Sect. 2, & 3. Baptisme with the Eucharist, in like tenour of speech, from point to point. 9. By praying God to be Above in this Book Chap. 1. Sect. 3. Propitious to that which is offered. Sixthly, upon the same Doctrine of Corporall Presence you have erected and fastened the roofe of all your Building, which is, Di∣vine Adoration of the Host: yet notwithstanding have you not beene able, by the testimonies of any ancient Father, to free your selves from Formall Idolatry, by any of your Booke 7. thorow∣out. Pretences (devised for your excuse) either of Good Intent, Morall Certainty, or of Ha∣bituall Condition: especially seeing that the Fathers (by that their universall Invitation, [Lift up your Hearts] abstracted still the thoughts of the Communicants from contemplating of any Sub∣ject present here Below, that they might be drawen to the medita∣tion of the Body of Christ, as it is in Heaven. Lastly, in your owne Romish Masse, praying (after Consecra∣tion) God to be propitious to the thing offered, as to Abel's Sacrifice, which was but a sacrificed Sheepe. Compute all these Particulars, and you shall finde about six∣teene Arguments, to prove you to be absolutely Idolaters. Wee having thus revealed these Three Principall, and Fundamentall Abominations, doe now proceed to their Concomitants and Conse∣quences, which are Mixtures of Heresie in many, Overture of Per∣jury in some, and Obstinacie in all. We begin at the last.
CHAP. II. Of the stupendious Obstinacie of the Romish Disputers, made palpable by their owne Contradictions; and of the De∣fence thereof, as being Contradictory in it selfe. SECT. I. ALL your Disputers shew themselves in no∣thing more zealous, than in maintenance of your Romish Masse, which they contend for by objecting Scriptures, Fathers, & Reasons: notwithstanding their Expositions of Scrip∣tures, their Inferences out of the Fathers, their devised Reasons, and almost all their Confutations are confuted, rejected, & con∣tradicted by their owne fellowes, as the Sections thorowout this whole Tractate doth plainly demonstrate. We cannot therefore otherwise judge, but that as Prejudice is the chiefe Director, so Obstinacie is the greatest Supporter of your Cause. How much more when the Defence it selfe is found to consist upon mere Contradictories, whereof you may take a Taste out of your Doctrine of Corporall Presence, and of a proper Sacrifice. In the first, by obtruding on mens Consciences a Beleefe (upon due Consequence) of a Body of Christ Borne, and not Borne of the Virgin Mary; One, and not One; Finite, and not Finite; Divisible, and not Divisible; Perfect, and not Perfect; and also Glorious, and not Glorious, as hath beene Booke 4. thorow∣out. proved in each point. 2. In a point of properly Sacrificing of Christ's Body, your Musicke stands upon the same kinde of Discords, of See Booke 6. tho∣rowout. Teaching a Body Broken, and not Broken; a matter visible, not visible; of Blood shed, and not shed; and of a suffering Destruction, and not suffering Destruction. Evident Arguments of Obstinacie one would thinke, and yet behold a plainer, if it may be. One Example, in stead of many, of a stupendious Obstinacie, in ur∣ging the Iudgement of Antiquity, for Defence of your Ro∣mish Masse, in the chiefest parts thereof; proved by instancing only in their like Sayings concerning Baptisme. SECT. II. THree chiefe Iesuites, besides others, have beene (as you may Booke 6. Chap. 5. Sect. 13. remember) extremely urgent, and important with Prote∣stants
to shew, if they could, the like Phrases of the Fathers in Baptisme, as were used of them concerning the Eucharist, in the question of Sacrifice: as if the just paralleling of these Two might be a Satisfaction unto themselves, concerning that one point. Wee are to deale more liberally with them, and whereas they assume unto themselves the suffrages of Antiquity, 1. For a Literall Exposition of Christ's words [This is my Body:] 2. For a Change of Bread by Transubstantiation into his Body: 3. For a Cor∣porall Presence of the same Body in the Sacrament: 4. For a Bodily Vnion with our Bodies: 5. For a Proper Sacrifice of the Eucharist: And lastly for a Divine Adoration thereof, wee answer them from the Fathers, in their like sayings concerning Baptisme thorowout every particular. A Synopsis of the Speeches of Fathers, objected in the Defence of the Masse-points, and paralleled (and consequently satisfied) by the like Equivalent speeches of the Fathers touching Baptisme. SECT. III. THe two Proper Sacraments, as the two Seales of the new Testament, Baptisme and the Eucharist, use to goe in equipage in the writings of Antiquity. The Parallel doth consist in these two; your Objections, in urging the Fathers Phrases, and wresting them to your Romish Literall Sence, concerning the Eucharist: and our Solutions, by the equivalent Termes of the same Fathers given unto Baptisme, and thereby instructing us of their Sacramen∣tall and Figurative Interpretation. OB. 1. The Fathers, say you, called the Eucharist an Booke 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 6. (in the first Challenge.) Antitype, because an Antitype is not every Signe, but that which differeth almost nothing from the Truth. Ergò the word Antitype doth not prove a fi∣gurative Sence. And againe they call Bread Booke 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 9. The Body of Christ. SOL. The Fathers accordingly call Baptisme Cyrillu Hieros. my∣ag. Catech. 2. . The Antitype of Christ's Passion. And againe they observe that S. Paul calleth it a Booke 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 9. Buriall. Ergo neither of both make for a Literall Sence. OB. 2. You contend by the Fathers to prove a Corporall Change of Bread into Christ's Body, because they say of it, after Consecra∣tion, Booke 3. Chap. 4. Sect. 3. It is not now Common Bread. Booke 3. Chap. 4. Sect. 3. Nor are wee to consider it as Bare Bread, yea, Ibid. Sect. 5. no sensible thing is delivered herein: Ibid. Sect. 2. And it is changed by Divine Omnipotencie into another nature. Ergo they meant a Corporall Presence of Christ. SOL. Your Consequence is lame, and out of joynt in every part, because the Fathers, speaking of Baptisme, have said as much, to wit, Booke 3. Chap. 4. Sect. 3. We are not to behold this as common Water; Booke 3. Chap. 4. Sect. 3. Nor is it simple Water: Ibid. Sect. 8. Nor to be discerned with our eyes, but with our mindes: Ibid. Sect. 5. Wherein no Sensible thing is given; seeing the Ibid. Sect. 2. Water by benediction
is made a Divine Laver; working miraculous effects: whereby the party baptized is made a Ibid. new Creature, and his Body made the Ibid. Sect. 7. Flesh of Christ crucified. OB. 3. You labour to prove a Corporall Presence out of the Fathers, where they say; Booke 4. Christ is herein (without mention of Presence:) and where they adde saying, Booke 3. Chap. 4. Sect. 6. Thinke not it is the Priest, but Christ that reacheth it unto hee. SOL. As though such Phrases of the Fathers were still Literally meant, or that you are ignorant of their like sayings, in behalfe of Baptisme: viz. Booke 4. Chap. 1. Sect. 2. Wee have Christ Present at the Sacrament of Baptisme; where Booke 3. Chap. 4. Sect. 6. Not the Minister, but God holdeth the head of the party baptized. OB. 4. To evince a Corporall Participation of Christ, in commu∣nicating of the Eucharist, and consequently the Bodily Presence, are alleaged the speeches of the Fathers, of our Booke 5. Chap. 5. Sect. 3. Touching Christ's Body, and Booke 5. thorow∣out. Eating Christ's flesh, of Ibid. Naturall union with his Body, and that the Eucharist is our Ibid. Chap. 8. Sect 3. Viaticum, and Pledge of our Resur∣rection; whereunto is added that Ibid. Chap. 2. Sect. 4. Contemptuous Communicants doe more injury to Christ, than they that denied him: Booke 5. Chap. 3. Sect. 1. Eating and drinking their owne judgement. SOL. And what of Baptisme? concerning Touching; the Fa∣thers teach that wee Booke 5. Chap. 5. Sect. 3. Take hold of the feet of Christ: concerning Eating, that the partie Baptized may be said to Hieronymus ad E∣di. Nos in baptis∣mo, sanguine & Cor∣pore Christi vesci∣mur. Eat the Flesh of Christ, in respect of the thing it selfe: concerning Vnion with Christ, they adde Booke 5. Chap. 8. Sect. 3. We are hereby One with him, not only by assent of will, but even naturally; and Ibid. Incorporate in him, Ibid. made thereby bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh: Even Ibid. The flesh of Christ crucified. Concerning the Effect, they hold that Ibid. Baptisme is our Viaticum, and the Earnest of our Resurrection, and salvation: whereunto is ad∣ded out of the Apostle, concerning the Contemners of their vow of Baptisme, that Ibid. Chap. 2. Sect. 4. They crucifie unto themselves the Sonne of God. Booke 5. Chap. 3. Sect. 4. And he that receiveth Baptisme unworthily, is guilty of judgement. OB. 5. To beget an opinion of the proper Sacrifice of the Eucharist, and consequently a Corpor all Presence of Christ herein, you insist upon such Phrases of the Fathers as call it a Booke 6. thorowout. Sacrifice, still exacting of Protestants to shew, if ever any Father said as much of Baptisme, to name it a Sacrifice; or the Celebration thereof Ibid. Chap. 5. Sect. 13. The Immolation of Christ. SOL. And you have beene plentifully satisfied, in both, out of the Testimonies of Antiquity, often calling Baptisme a Ibid. Sacrifice, and sometimes also the Passion of Christ. OB. 6. Your last and worst Contention is in Defence of a Divine Adoration of the Eucharist, and consequently a Corporall Presence of Christ in the same, as from the judgement of Antient Fathers, by manifold Arguments, wherein you may be pleased (for Brevity sake) to let your Ob. for the Eucharist, and our Sol. for Baptisme wrastle, and grapple together. Your first Ob. is taken
from their Reverend Silence, for they instruct Communtcants not to speake of the Eucharist before Catechumenists, or Insidels, say∣ing, Booke 7. Chap. 3. Sect. 4. The faithfull know it; pretending that the like Circumspe∣ction cannot be shewed of Baptisme. Sol. Even as upon the same Consideration they forbid speech of Baptisme, expressely saying: Ibid. The faithfull know it; and Ibid. Inhibiting All, except the Baptized, to see it. A second Note of Reverence is taken from the Efects. Ob. Booke 4. Chap. 2. Sect. 2. Miracles were wrought by the Eucharist, and at it. Sol. Ibid. Sect. 5. They shew miracles wrought about Baptisme also. A Third Ob. is groun∣ded upon Reverence done by Angells, because they are said to be Booke 7. Chap. 2. Sect. 2. Present, and attendant at the Celebration of the Eucharist, Sol. Namely, as they are likewise said to be Ibid. Present at Baptisme, and to honour it, with their Presence. A fourth Ob. (o come to the Com∣municants themselves) ariseth from danger of Contempt, even Booke 5. Chap. 2. Sect. 7. Such, as to eat and drinke judgement to themselves. Sol. Ibid. So they, who receive Baptisme unworthily, receive their owne judgement. A Fifth Ob. is (for danger begetteth Dread) from feare, where with they are moved to approach to the Eucharist, which therefore the Fathers call a Booke 7. Chap. 2. Sect. 1. Dreadfull Sacrament, and causing horrour. Sol. To wit, as they call the words of Baptisime Booke 6. Chap. 5. Sect. 8. Terrible, and it's Canons Dreadfull, Booke 7. Chap. 2. Sect. 2. whereunto the Baptized are brought with feare. Ob. 6. But none (say the Fathers) Ibid. Sect. 3. Communicateth of the Eucharist, be∣fore he Adore. And, Ibid. They first adore Christ (say they, speaking of men of yeares) who are to be Baptized in his name. Ob. 7. But the Fathers tell us Booke 7. Chap. 2. Sect. 3. They reverence the Eucharist. Sol. True: even as they say, Ibid. We reverence Baptisme, wheresoever it is. Ob. 8. Lastly they use a forme of Invocation upon the Eucharist, thus: Ibid. Chap. 3. Sect. 4. Ob Di∣vine Sacrament, reveale unto us, &c. Sol. They doe so, but in the same figurative manner of speech, called Prosopapoeia, wherein they as well use the same forme concerning Baptisme, as thus: Ibid. Ob Wa∣ter! which hast washed our Saviour, when hee was imbr blood, &c. CHALLENGE. SO many Testimonies of Fathers, so mainly insisted upon by vour Doctors, for warrant of such Erroneous, Superstitious, Sa∣crilegious, and Idolatrous Romish Doctrines, and each one not more vehemently objected, in the Question concerning the Eucharist, than easily retorted, and confuted, by instancing in Baptisme; what greater Evidence can any desire to be made of a wifull Ob∣stinacy (that we say not madnes) than this of your Disputers appea∣reth to be? how much more, if we should point at the other mani∣fold Instances, which we have prosecuted at large thorowout this whole Volume, wherein their Vnconscionablenesse hath beene manifested in all passages to the Conscience of every indifferent
Reader. Yet were this their Guilt not so hainous, it such their Obstinacie were not infected with some contagion of Perjury. A Synopsis of manifold Overtures of Perjuries, in Defence of the Romish Masse. SECT. IV. EVery Perjury presupposeth an Oath; which you have in the Bulla Pii Quarti super forma Juramenti—Profiteor omnia declarata in Concilio Tridentino, & hanc esse fidem veram Ca∣tholicam, extra quam nemo salvus esse po∣test. Bull of Pope Pius IV. imposed upon every Ecclesiasticke, subject to the Sea of Rome, for the ratifying of the Beleefe of the many new Romish Articles contained therein, as True, Catholique, and without which none can be saved. The due proofe that the same Oath, almost in each new Article, maketh the Swearer obnoxious to Perjury, is a Subject which would require a full Treatise; for the which we are not altogether unprovided. But we are to con∣fine our selves to the Observations promised in our former Dis∣course, in foure speciall points. I. Overture of Perjury is in Swearing unto that, which it called The Vulgar Latine Translation. THis is decreed in the Councell of Synod. Trid. Sess. 4. Decretum de Editio∣ne statuit, ut haec vul∣gata editio, quae tot saeculorum usu appro∣bata in Ecclesia in publicis. lectionibus, disputationibus, & expositionibus pro Authentica habeatur, ut nemo illam rejice∣re quovis praetextu audeat—statuit & decrevit ut haec vetus editio quàm emenda∣tissimè imprimatur. Trent to be Authenticall, and not to be rejected upon any Pretence whatsoever. Where∣unto (together with all other Decrees, and Declarations of the same Councell) you are sworne by the forme of Oath set downe in the foresaid Bull of the Pope. The same Vulgar Translation, pro∣fessed by you to be Authenticall, and that (as you expound it) it is Sacrobosc. Defens. Decreti Trid. part. 2. cap. 4.

Nullo modo audiendi sunt it, qui; post Concilium Tridentinum, contendunt, Editionem Vulgatam aliquibus in locis, quod ad ipsam sententiam ; Qui  raeti, & Hci Codices, siquidem diffide∣ant à nostra, sunt per eam cornigendi. Valen∣tia, who thinke that Oath to be violated, if the Vulgar Latine be rejected at all, as lesse true than the Originalls. And your Spanish Inquisitors finding urged, in one of your Romish Doctors, the Rule of Hierome; and Augustine, which is, that no Translation La∣tine, or other be further allowed than as it agreeth with the Origi∣nalls, they faire and cleanly wipe it out, saying that Index. Expurgius Hi a nomen Martinz.—Quam∣vis haec, quae Hieronymus, & Augustinus docuerunt, vera sunt, tamen post Concilii Tridentini Decretum, non licet Vulgatae Latinae. Testimonia quovi ,  in ipsius Concilii Decreto constitutum est. fol. 145. Although that, which Hierome and Augustine taught, be true; yet now since the Councell of Trent it is not lawfull to reject the same Transla∣tion upon any pretence whatsoever. So they. And so farre unsatis∣fied are your Doctors, in taking this Oath. We are furthermore not destitute of matter for a large Consu∣tation (first) of your assuming S. Hierome as the Author of your Vulgar Latine Translation; to manifest that it is no more the Translation of Hierome, or yet of any one Author, than the divers cloathes of a mans body from head to foot, can be called the worke of one singular work-man. Secondly, concerning the Authority thereof, you professe it to be Authenticall (that is, as you have defined) Conformable to the Originall Hebrew and Greeke: although it may be as easily pro∣ved, not to be that Antient Vulgar, which had continued (as the Decree speaketh) from divers ages, than the Ship of Theseus, which after some ages had beene so thorowly battered and pierced, that at last the keele and bottome thereof did only remaine, which could be called the Same. But passing by all further Dispute, wee shall referre you to the judgement of the Patrones of the former Rule (so insolently contemned by the Spanish Inquisitors, as you have heard) by one Instance, which may be sufficient in it selfe for triall of the Case now in hand. The Text of Scripture is Ephes. 1. 14. in the Latine Transla∣tion (even in that, which is set forth by Pope Clem. Octarus—In  — accuratissimè mendis pur∣gatus. Clement, as The
most accurate Edition) thus: Ephes. 1. 14. Lat. Vulg. Spiritu figna∣ti promissionis, quae est pignus haeredita∣tis. Graecè, : in quem locum Hiero∣nym. Pignus Latinus interpres pro Arrha∣bone posuit: Arrha∣bo futurae emptionis quasi quoddam testi∣monium, & obliga∣mentum datur: Pig∣nus verò pro mutuâ pecuniâ ponitur, & cùm illa reddita fue∣rit, reddenti debitum pignus à Creditore. Aug. Serm. de visime Dei, om. 10. pag. 1687. Accipis Codicem ab amico, cui das pig∣nus, cum reddideris quod accepisti, ille, cui reddis, habebit, tu pignus accipies, non enim habebit ambas res: sed quando pre∣tium paras dare pro care, quam tenes bo∣nae fidei contractu; de ipso pretio das ali∣quid, & exit Arrha, non pignus, quod sit complendum, non quod sit auferendum. Sed si Deus charitatem dar, tanquam pignus per spiritum suum, cum eam rem ipsam reddiderit. quâ promissâ pignus dedit, auferendum est à nobis Pignus? Absit! Sed quod dedit, hoc implebit: ideo meliùs Arrha, quàm Pignus—hoc enim implebitur, cum Arrha data est. You are sealed with the spirit of promise, which is the Pledge of your inheritance. But in the Greeke it is: You are sealed with the spirit of promise, which is the Earnest of your inheritance. The Question is, whether of these is to be pre∣ferred; and Hierome, and Augustine are ready to resolve you here∣in, both of them correcting the Vulgar Translation in the word Pledge, and one of them giving an Absitl against this Sence of it. The Reason of both is, because he that giveth a Pledge taketh it a∣gaine, when the Thing for which it was pledged, is received. But he that giveth an Earnest, will have it continue with him, to whom it was given. And so God assuring his Chosen, by his Spi∣rit, doth for their greater Confidence give it as an Earnest, and not as a Pledge. So they. Thereby advancing Gods gracious love, to∣wards man, and man's faith in God's love. Here will be no cor∣ner of Pretence, that this being an Errour of Print, and not of Doctrine, may be rejected by you without Prejudice to your Oath; no, for Errour of Print ariseth from some affinity of words, (as where these words; This is a sound reason, being delivered to the print, was returned from the Presse thus; This is a fond reason.) But betweene Pignus, and Arrhabo, there is no more Symphony than betweene an Horse, and a Saddle. Nor will it availe you to say that the Originall Greeke was corrupted, for it is the same Greeke word, which Hierome himselfe, (who as you know used the perfectest Greeke Text) doth here avow to be True. II. Overture of Perjury in your Disputers is in swearing to the Romish Expositions of Scripture. THe Tenour of the Oath, in this respect, is: Bulla eadem. Sa∣cram Scripturam ad∣mitto juxta eum fen∣sum, quem Tenuit, & Tenet Mater Ecclesia—extra quam nemo salvus, &c. I admit the sa∣cred Scriptures in that Sense, which the Mother Church hath held, and doth hold. By [Mother Church] understanding the Church of Rome, as without which there is no salvation; which is expressed in the same Oath, as another Article therein, and which else-where we have proved to be a GRAND IMPOSTVRE, in a full Tractate, from the Doctrine of the Apostles, of Generall Councells, of severall Catholique Churches, and from such Primitive Fathers, whose memories are at this day registred in the Romish Calender of Saints. How then can the Oath for this point be ta∣ken without danger of Perjury? But to come to the Article, con∣cerning the Expositions of Scriptures According to the sence of the Church of Rome, which would thereby be thought to Hold no Sence of Scripture now, which she had not Held in more Antient Times. We, for Triall hereof; shall for this present seeke after no
other Instances, than such as in this Treatise have been discussed, and for brevity-sake single, out of many, but only Three; A first is in that Scripture Ioh. 6. Except you eat the flesh of the Sonne of man, you cannot have life. The word [Except] was extended unto Infants in the dayes of Pope Innocent the First, continuing (as hath beene Booke 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 11. confessed) six hundred yeares together, when the Church of Rome thereupon Held it necessary for Infants to receive the Eucharist. Contrarily the now Romane Church Holdeth it Inexpedient to administer the Eucha∣rist unto Infants, as you have heard. Secondly, Luc. 22. Take, Eat, &c. Your Church of Rome, in the dayes of Pope Nicolas, in a Councell at Rome, Held, that by the word, Eate, was meant an Booke 5. Chap. 4. Sect. 2. Eating, by Tearing the Body of Christ sensually with men's teeth, in a Literall sence. Which your now Romane Church (if we may beleeve your Iesuites) doth not Hold, as hath appeared. Thirdly the Tenour of the Institution of Christ, concerning the Cup, was Held in the dayes of Pope Booke 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 13. Gelasius to be peremptory, for the administration thereof, to prove that the Eucharist ought to be administred in both kindes to all Communicants, and judging the dismembring of them a Grand Sacrilege, as you have heard: whereas now your Romish Church Holdeth it not only lawfull, but also religious to withhold the Cup from all, but only consecra∣ting Priests. Vpon these (omitting other Scriptures, which you your selves may observe at your best leasure) we conclude. You therefore in taking that Oath, swearing to admit all Interpretati∣ons of Scripture, both which the Church of Rome once Held, and now Holdeth; the Proverbe must needs be verified upon you, viz. You hold a Wolfe by the eare: which howsoever you Hold, you are sure to be Oath-bit, either in Holding TENVIT, by TENET, or in Holding TENET, by TENVIT. III. Overture of Perjury in your Disputers, is in swearing to the pretended Consent of Fathers, in their Expositions of Scriptures. HEare your Oath. Bulla ad. Nec Scripturam ullam, ni∣si juxtà unanimem Consensum Patrum interpretabor. Neither will I ever interpret any Scripture, but according to the unanimous consent of Fathers. Here the word [Fathers] cannot betoken Bishops and Fathers assembled in a Councell, where the major part of voices conclude the lesse; for Councell never writ Commentaries upon Scriptures, but from Scriptures collect their Conclusions. And although the word [Vnanimous] doth literally signifie the universall Consent (which would inferre an Impossibility, because that all Fathers have not expounded any one Scripture, and very few All) yet that you may know we presse not too violently upon you, we shall be con∣tent to take this word Morally, with this Diminution, For the
most part; and hereupon make bold to averre, that your Iuror by this Oath is sworne to a flat Falsity, because you cannot deny but that the Fathers, in their Expositions, dissent among themselves, sometimes a Greater part from the lesse; insomuch that you your selves are at difference among your selves, which part to side with: Valent. Ies. Anal. lb. 8. cap. 8. Patet no∣bis via urgendi unum aut alrerum Docto∣rem authoritate reli∣quorum. With the greater (saith Valentia,) nay but sometime with the Canus lo. theol. lib. 7. cap. 3. num. 8. Plurium Sanctorum authoritas, reliquis li∣cet paucioribus re∣clamantibus, firma Argumenta sufficere, & praestare non valet. Lesser, (saith Canus.) Can you dreame of an Vnanimity in Dispa∣rity? Sometime there is a Non-Constat, what is the Iudgement of the Fathers in some points, which you call matter of Faith. What then? Valent. quo supra. Quod si per Senten∣tiam Doctorum ali∣qua fidei controver∣sia non satis commo∣dè componi posset, co quòd de corum consensu non satis constaret, sua tunc constet Autoritas Pō∣tifici, ut consult is aliis ad definiendum regu∣li, de quibus est di∣ctm, Ecclesiae pro∣ponat, quid sit senti∣endum. Then (saith your Iesuite) the Authority of the Pope is to take place, who being guided by other rules may propound what is the Sence. Behold here the very ground of that, which we call Popery, which is devising and obtruding upon the Church of Christ new Articles of Faith unknowen (for ought you know) to Ancient Fathers. And is it possible to finde an Vnanimity of Consent in an Individuall Vnity, or rather a Nullity? for what else is an igno∣rance, what the Sence of the Fathers is, whether so, or so? Next, that it may appeare that this Article, touching the Vna∣nimous Consent of Fathers, is a meere Ostentation and gullery, and no better than that Challenge made by the wise man of Athens of all the Ships that entred into the Road, to be his owne: as if you should say, All the Fathers doe patronize your Romish Cause. We shall give you one or two Examples, among your Iesuites, as patternes of the Disposition of others in neglecting, sleighting, and rejecting the more Generall Consent of Fathers in their Ex∣positions of Scriptures. One Instance may be given in your Cardi∣nall, who, in his Commentaries upon the Psalmes, dedicated to the then Pope, professeth himselfe to have composed them, Bellarm. Epist. De∣dic. Paulo Quints, an∣tè Comment. in Psal. Psalmorum ego tra∣ctationem magis pro∣priâ meditatione, quā multa librorum lecti∣one composui. Rather by his owne meditation, than by reading of many bookes; whereas he that will seeke for Vnanimous Consent of Fathers, must have a peru∣sall of them all. In the second place hearken unto the Accents of your Iesuite Maldonate, in his rejecting the Expositions of the Fa∣thers, as for Example: Maldon. Ies. in Matth. 20. Existimant Patres filios Zebedaei temerè respondisse, ego vero credo eos verè esse locutos. I∣tem in Matth. 16. 18. Non praevalebunt] Quorum verborum sensus non videtur mihi esse, quem om∣nes praeter Hilarium, quos legisse memini, Authores putant. I∣tem in Matth. 11. 11. Variae sunt Patrum opiniones, sed (ut li∣berè fatear) in nul a carum aquiesco. Item in Matth. 11. 13. Pro∣phetae & lex] Omnes fere veeres ita exponunt, sed non est apta satis interpretatio. Item Matth. 19. 11. Non omnes capiunt, i. e. non omnes capimus: Sic omnes fere veteres exponunt, quibus equidem non assentior. Item in Iob. 6. 62 Sic qui∣dem expono, & licet Expositionis hujus Autorem nullum habeo, hanc tamen magis probo, quam illam Augusti∣ni, caeterarumque alioqui probabilissima quia hoc cum CALVINISTARUM sensu magis pugnat. So indeed said the Fathers, but I beleeve the Contrary. Item, This seemeth not to me to be the Sence of this place, which All, whom I have read, except Hilary, doe thinke. Item, Their opinions are divers, I rest upon none of them All. Item, All Antients almost doe so expound this Text, but this is no fit Interpretation. Item, Thus I expound this Scripture, and albeit I have no Author of this Exposition, yet I doe approve it rather than that of Augustine, or of others, although otherwise most probable, even because it is repugnant to the Sense and Exposition of the Calvinists. So hee, and that usually. (O dura ilia!) With what Stomach could this man swal∣low that O ath?
Salmeron the Iesuite may stand for the third upon that Text Rom. 5. In whom all have sinned, which teacheth the universall Guilt of Originall Sinne of mankinde. What the Sence of the Fathers was from this Text, your Canus will certifie you; Canus loc. Theol. lib. 7. cap. 3. Sancti omnes qui in ejus rei mentionem incidêre, uno ore asseruerunt B. Virginem in origi∣nali peccato concep∣tam fuisse. And then hee reckoneth, adding: Et si nullus contrave∣net it; infirmum ta∣men cx omnium au∣toritate Argumentū. All they (saith he) who have formerly fallen upon this subject matter, have confessed, as it were with one mouth, that the Virgin Mary was con∣ceived in originall sinne, no one contrarying this opinon. So he of the Iudgement of Atiquity, which notwithstanding he durst contra∣dict: but wee returne to your Iesuite, who premising that this Question doth belong to Faith, propoundeth Salmeron Ies. in Rom. 5. Disp 49. In quo omnes peccave∣runt.] Mariam con∣ceptam in originali peccato, esi non si haeresis daninata, nempè tam ad fi∣dem spectat. Item Disp. 51. A qua multitudine Patrum, locum ab autoritate infirmum, &—Pauperis est nu∣merare pecus—Exod. 13. In judicio plurimorum non ac∣quiesces sententiae, ut à vero demas: & multitudinem mul∣titudini opponimus. At Devoti erga D. Virg. Resp. Totam Devotionem ega il∣lam non consistee in Patribus, ut in Ber∣nardo, &c. At Anti∣qui. Resp. Quilibet se∣nex laudator tempo∣ris acti: sed & illud as∣serimus quo juniores, eo perspicaciores Do∣ctores esse. After hee wrangleth, and wresteth some savings of Fathers to his part, In celeber∣rimâ Parisiensium A∣cademiâ nullus in theologia titulo Do∣ctoris dignus habe∣tur, qui non primum jusjurandi religione se adstrinxerit ad hoc Virginis privilegium tuendum. Objections made out of the Fathers, for proofe that the Virgin Mary hath the same Originall defect in her owne naturall Generation, and shapeth Answers full of regret, and reluctancy. For, first, To this Obje∣ction; The Fathers did consen: Hee answereth thus; The Argu∣ment from Authority is infirme. 2. To this; The Fathers were An∣tient: Thus; The younger Divines are more quicke of understanding. 3. To this; The Fathers were many: hee answereth; Hee is but a poore man that can number his Cattell. And againe confronting the Antient Fathers, and preferring novell Divines, he saith; Wee oppose multitude to multitude. 4. But The Fathers were Devout: he answereth; Yet all Devotion towards the Blessed Virgin resteth not in the Fathers. And when one of the Devoutest of them (Ber∣nard by name) is objected, who had said of the point now in Question; Bernard. Epist. 174. Hanc prolis praero∣gativam B. Mariae tribuere non est honorare Virginem, sed honori detrahre. Et Paulò ante—Nunquid pa∣tribus doctiores, aut devotiores sumus? To ascribe the prerogative of the Sonne to the Blessed Virgin is not an honouring, but a dishonouring her: wherein the same holy Bernard appealeth to Antiquity, saying, Are wee either more learned, or more Devout than the Fathers? Your Iesuite answering to him by name, casteth him off with the Rest. Here we see an Oath exacting a Consent to the Vnanimous Ex∣positions of Fathers, & heare notwithstanding as plaine a Dissent of your Iesuites opposition unto Vnanimous Consent of Fathers which is the ordinary guise of your Disputers in their expounding of Scriptures: and yet behold you (forsooth) the native children, and heires of the Doctrine of Antient Fathers. Your Fathers of the Councell of Trent have set it downe for a Canon, whereunto you are also sworne, that the words of Christ his Institution, concer∣ning the giving of his Body, and Blood, Booke 2. Chap. 1. Sect. 1. Have a plaine, and proper signification without Tropes; which notwithstanding, the same words of Christ have beene evinced to be Figurative, not only by the Vnanimous Consent of Booke 2. Chap. 1. Sect. 6. and Chap. 2. Sect. 6, & 7. Antiquity, but also by the expresse Booke 2. Chap. 2. Sect. 4. See also Booke 3. Chap. 3. in the words, [The fruit of the Vine.] Sect. 5. Confessions of your owne Iesuites, in the words [Eate, Breake, Cup, &c.] and wherein your selves have acknowledged divers Tropes. Besides, the whole former Treatise is but a displaying of your unconscionable wresting of the Testimonies of ancient Fa∣thers.
Ponder you these Observations with your selves, and then judge whether your Swearing be not Perjury it selfe. IV. Overture of Perjury, in the Defenders of the Romish Masse, is in respect of the pretended Necessity of their Doctrine. IN the last Clause of the Oath, prescribed in the Bull of Pope Pius IV. you are sworne that every Article therein is the See above in this Sect. 4. initio, at the letter (a). True Catholique Faith, without which none can be saved; among which is the Article already mentioned, swearing to whatsoever was de∣clared in the Councell of Trent; by which Councell your now Ro∣mane Synod. Trident. Sess. 1. Missall, or Masse-booke is approved. Now take a Taste of your Oath in every Epithet. First, [True:] and hereby are you sworne that in the dayes of Pope Innocentius the third, the Admi∣nistration of the Eucharist to Infants was not held necessary; which your owne Authors have Booke 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 11. confessed, and proved to be false. Se∣condly, that the presence of them, who, at the administration of the Eucharist, doe not communicate, is Ibid. Sect. 5. & Sect. 10. Commendable, and held a Doctrine Catholique (that is) antiently Vniversall: which was generally condemned by Ancient Fathers; and, even in the Church of Rome it selfe, abandoned by two Booke 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 9. Popes. Lastly, in the point of Necessity to Salvation; To sweare that whosoever beleeveth not that one may be said to Booke 1. Chap. 2. Sect. 5. Communicate alone, is damned; that whosoever beleeveth not that the Priest in the Masse, being alone, cannot duly say, The Lord be with you, he is damned; or that the See Booke 4. Body of Christ may not be run away with Mice, & be blowen away with the wind, he is damned; and a number other like extreme foolish Crotchets, set downe in your Missalls, which wee willingly omit. The Summe of all these is, that the same your Oath, made to damne others, doth serve chiefly to make the Swearers themselves most damnable. If peradventure any of you shall oppose, saying that none of you within this Kingdome (which never admitted of the Councell of Trent, nor of the Bull of Pope Pius IV.) are yet bound to that Oath, let him know that although this may excuse him from an Actuall Perjury, yet can it not free him from the Habituall, which is, that hee is disposed in himselfe to take it, whensoever it shall be offered unto him in any Kingdome, that doth imbrace and professe the same. Our Last Advertisement followeth.
Of the Mixture of many old Heresies with the former Defence of the Romish Masse. SECT. V. THe more odious the Title of this Section may seeme to be, the more studious ought you to shew your selves in exami∣ning the proofes thereof; that so you may either confute, or con∣fesse them, and accordingly re-assume, or renounce your Romish Defence. Heresie hath a double aspect: One is when it is direct, having the expresse termes of Heresie; the Other is oblique, and by consequence, when the Defence doth inferre, or imply necessarily the same Hereticall Sence, even as it may be said of Treason. For to say that Caesar is not King, is a Treasonable speech Directly, in a plaine Sence; and to say that Tribute money is not due to Cae∣sar, is as Treasonable in the Consequence. Thus much being premi∣sed, we are now to recognize such Errrours, wherein your Dispu∣ters may seeme to have accordance with old Heretiques, which point we shall pursue according to the order of the Bookes. BOOKE I. Wherein your Church is found altering almost the whole forme of Christ his Institution, and the Custome of the Catholique Church, descended from the Apostles; which Pre∣sumption Pope Booke 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 3. Iulius condemned in divers, who sopped the Bread in the Chalice, and squeezed Grapes in the Cup, and so received them: even as did the Ibid. Artoryritae in mingling Bread with Cheese, censured for Heretiques by your Aquinas. In which Comparison your Aberration from Christ's Example is so much greater than theirs, as you are found Guilty in defending Booke 1. thorow-out. Ten Innovations, for one. 2. Your Pope Gelasius condemned the Hereticall Manichees, for thinking it lawfull not to receive the Cup in the Administration of the Eucharist, judging it to be Booke 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 7. Greatly Sacrilegious: notwith∣standing your Ibid. Church authorizeth the same Custome of forbid∣ding the Administration of the Cup to fit Communicants. 3. As Booke 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 10. you pretend Reverence, for withdrawing the Cup; so did the Ibid. Sect. 10. Aquarii forbeare wine, and used only Water, under a pre∣tence of Sobriety. 4. Sometime there may be a Reason to doe a thing, when as yet there is no right, nor Authority for him that doth it: Wee therefore exact of you an Autority for altering the Apostles Cu∣stomes, and Constitutions; and are answered that Booke 1. Chap. 3. Sect. 4. your Church hath Authority over the Apostles Precepts. Iumpe with them, who being asked why they stood not unto the Apostles Traditions,
replyed that Ibid. They were herein above the Apostles, whom there∣fore Irenaeus reckoneth among the Heretikes of his Time. BOOKE II. It is not nothing, which hath beene observed therein (to wit) your Reasoning, why you ought not to interpret the words of Christ [This is my Body] Booke 2. Chap. 3. thorowout. literally; and why you urge his other saying [Except yo eat my flesh] Ibid. for proofe of Bo∣dily Eating; so that your Priest may literally say in your Masse, that The Body of Christ passeth into your bellies and entrils, be∣cause (forsooth) the words of Christ are Booke 2. Chap. 3. Sect. 2. Doctrinall. And have you not heard of one Nicodemus, who hearing Christ teach that every man must be Iohn 3. Borne againe, who shall be partaker of God's Kingdome; and that hee expounding them in a Literall Sence conceited a new Entrance into his Mothers wombe, when as nothing wanted to turne that his Errour into an Heresie, but only Obstinacie? But of the strong and strange Obstinacies of your Disputers, you have received a full See above in this Booke, Chap. 2. Sect. 3. Synopsis. BOOKE III. After followeth your Article of Transubstan∣tiation. I. Your direct profession is indeed to beleeve no Body of Christ, but that which was Borne of the Virgin Mary. But this your Article of Transubstantiation of Bread into Christs Body, ge∣nerally held, according to the proper nature of Transubstantion, to be by Booke 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 2. Production of Christs Body out of the Substance of Bread, it necessarrly inferreth a Body (called, and beleeved to be Christ's) which is not Borne of the Blessed Virgin, as S. Augustine hath plain∣ly Booke 4. Chap. 4. Sect. . taught; diversifying the Bodily thing on the Altar from the Body of Christ borne of the Virgin. Therefore your Defence sym∣bolizeth with the heresie of Apollinaris, who taught a Booke 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 2. Body not Borne of the Virgin Mary. Secondly, you exclude all judgement of Booke 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 9. Senses, in discer∣ning Bread to be tr Bread, as did the Manichaei dice∣bant Christum  esse verum hominem, sed phantasma quod∣dam. Prl. Elech. Haret. Manichees in discerning Christ's Body, which they thereupon held not to have beene a True, but a Phantasticall Body. Tertullian also challengeth the Verity of Sense, in judging of Wine in the Echarist (after Consecration) in confutation of the same Errour in the Mar∣cionies. Thirdly, for Defence of Christ his invisible Bodily Presence, you professe that (after Consecration) Bread is no more the same, but changed into the Body of Christ: which Doctrine in very ex∣presse words was bolted out by an Etychian Heretique, and in∣stantly condemned by Booke 3. Chap. 3. Sect. 12. Theodoret, and as fully abandoned by Pope Gelas. BOOKE IV. Catholique Fathers were in nothing more zea∣lous, Ibid. Sect. 13. than in defending the distinct properties of the two natures of Christ his Deity, and Humanity, against the pernicious here∣sies of the Manichees; Marcionites, Etychians, and Enomians; all of them diversly oppugning the Integrity of Christ's Body,
sometime in direct tearmes, and sometime by irrefragrable Con∣sequences; whether it were by gaine-saying the Finitenesse, or So∣lidity, or else the compleat Perfection thereof: wherein ow farre yee may challenge affinity or kindred with them, be you pleased to examine by this which followeth. 1. The Heretiques, who undermined the property of Christ's Bo∣dily Finitenesse, said that it was in divers places at once, (as is Booke 4. Chap. 4. Sect. 6. & Chap. 5. Sect. 3. & Chap. 6. Sect. 1. con∣fessed) even as your Church doth now attribute unto the same Body of Christ, both in Heaven, and in Earth, yea, and in Millions of distant Altars at the same time; and consequently in all places whatsoever. Now whether this Doctrine of Christ's Bodily Pre∣sence in many places at once was held of the Catholique Fathers for Hereticall, it may best be seene by their Doctrine of the Exi∣stence of Christ's Body in one only place, not only Definitively, but also Circumspectively: both which doe teach an absolute Impossi∣bility of the Existence of the same in divers places at once. And they were as zealous in professing the Article of the manner of Christ's Bodily Being in place, as they are in instructing men of the Article of Christ's Bodily Being, lest that the deniall of it's Bodily manner of being might destroy the nature of his Body. To which end they have concluded it to be absolutely but in one place, some∣time in a Chap. 4. thorowout. Circumspective Finitenesse, thereby distinguishing them from all created Spirits; and sometime by a Definitive Ter∣mination, which they set downe first by Exemplifications, thus: Ibid. Sect. 6. If Christ his Body be on Earth, then it is absent from Heaven; and thus, Being in the Sunne, it could not be in the Moone: Se∣condly, by divers Comparisons, for comparing the Creature with the Creator God, they Ibid. conclude, that The Creature is not God, be∣cause it is determinated in one place; and comparing the humane, and divine Nature of Christ together, they Chap. 4. Sect. . conclude, that they are herein different, because the humane and Bodily Nature of Christ is necessarily included in one place: and latly comparing Creatures with the Holy Ghost, they Chap. 6. Sect. . conclude a difference by the the same Argument, because the Holy Ghost is in many places at once; and all these in confutation of divers Heretiques. A thing so well knowen to your elder Romish Schoole, that it confessed the Doctrine of Existence of a Body in divers places at once (in the judgement of Antiquity) to be Ibid. Hereticall. 2. The property of a Solidity likewise was patronized by An∣tient Fathers, in confutation of Heretiques, by teaching Chap. 7. Sect. 6. Christ's Body to be necessarily Palpable, against their Impalpabilitie: and to have a Thicknesse, against their feigned subtile Body, as the Aire: and furthermore controlling these opinions following (which are also your Crotchets) of a Bodies Chap. 7. Sect. 6. Being whole in the whole space, and in every part thereof; and of Christ's Body Chap. 4. Sect. 9. taking the Right hand, or left, of it selfe.
3. The property of Perfection of the Body of Christ, where∣soever, in the highest Degree of Absolutenesse. This (one would thinke) everie Christian heart should assent unto, at the first hearing; wherefore if that they were judged Heretiques by Antient Fathers, who Prateol. Elnch. res. Tit. Philoponus Alexandrinus.  Sta∣tuit morm re∣surrectionem esse, viz. ratonalium animarū cum corruptibili cor∣pore indissolubilem unionem. taught an Indivisible Vnion of mens soules with their Bodies naturally, still subiect to corruption after the resurrection; who can imagine that the holy Catholique Fa∣thers would otherwise have judged of this your generall Tenet, (viz. to beleeve a Body of Christ, now since his Glorification, which is destitute of all power of naturall motion, sence, appetite, or understanding) otherwise than of a senslesse, and Antichri∣stian Deliration, and Delusion? Yea and that which is your only Reason you alleage, to avoid our Objection of Impossibilities in such cases, (to wit) Booke 4. Chap. 4. Sect. 6. The Omnipotencie of God, the same was the Pretence of Heretiques of old, in the like Assertions, which occasioned the Antient Fathers to terme the Pretence of Omnipo∣tencie, Ibid. Chap. 3. Sect. 2. The Sanctuary of Heretiques: albeit the same Heretiques, (as well as you) intended (as a Father speaketh) to magnifie God thereby; namely, in beleeving the Body of Christ, after his Ascension, to be wholly Spirituall. To which Heretiques the same Father readily answered, (as wee may to you) saying, Chap. 4. Sect. 6. at (b & c). When you will so magnifie Christ, you doe but accuse him of falshood: not that wee doe any whit detract from the Omnipotencie of Christ, (farre be this Spirit of Blasphemy from us!) but that (as you have beene instructed by Antient Fathers) the not attributing an Impossibility to God, in such Cases of Contradiction, is not a di∣minishing, but an ample advancing of the Ibid. Omnipotencie of God. BOOKE V. Your Orall Eating, Gutturall Swallowing, and Inward Digestion (as you have Booke 5. thorowout. taught) of the Body of Christ into your Entrails hath beene proved out of the Fathers to be in each respect sufficiently Capernaiticall, and termed by them a Sence both Chap. 5. Sect. 2. Pernicious, and Flagitious. Besides you have a Con∣futation of the Hereticall Manichees, for their Booke 5. Chap. 6. Sect. 3. Opinion of Fast∣ning Christ to mens guts, and loosing him againe by their belchings: Consonant to your Romish Profession both of Christ's Booke 5. Chap. 7. Sect. 4. Cleaving to the guts of your Communicants, and Booke 5. Chap. 7. Sect. 1. Vomiting it up againe, when you have done. BOOKE VI. This is spent wholly in examining the Romish Doctrine of Masse-Sacrifice, and in proving it to be Sacrilegiousnesse it selfe, as you have seene in a former See above in this Booke, Chap. 1. Sect. 2. Sy∣nopsis. BOOKE VII. This containeth a Discoverie of your Masse-Idolatry, not onely as being equall with the Doctrine of some He∣retiques, but in one respect exceeding the inatuation of the very Booke 7. Chap. 8. Sect. 2. Pagans; besides the Generall Doctrine of the power of
your Priests Chap. 5. Sect. 3. Intention, in consecrating, hath beene yoaked, by your owne Iesuite, with the Heresies of the Chap. 9. Sect. 5. Donatists. When you have beheld your owne faces in these divers Synop∣ses, as it were in so many glasses, we pray to God that the sight of so many and so prodigious Abominations in your Romish Masse may draw you to a just Detestation of it, and bring you to that true worship of God, which is to be performed in Spirit and in Truth, and to the saving of every one of your soules, through his Grace in Christ Iesus. AMEN. ALL GLORY BE ONELY TO GOD.
