To the Most Honourable JAMES Duke, Mar∣quess, and Earl of Ormond, Earl of Ossory, Brecknock, Viscount Thurles, Lord Baron of Arklow and Lanthony, Lord of the Regalities and Liberties of the County of Tipperary, Chan∣cellor of the Vniversity of Dublin, Lord Lieute∣nant General, and General Governour of His Ma∣jesties Kingdom of Ireland, Lord Lieutenant of the County of Somerset, the City and Coun∣ty of Bath and Wells, one of the Lords of His Majesties Most Honourable Privy Councils of His Majesties Kingdoms of England, Scot∣land, and Ireland, Lord Steward of His Ma∣jesties Houshold, Gentleman of His Majesties Bed-Chamber, and Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Garter, his Grace. AS many have written of ho∣nour and true renown, as Diogenes Babylonius, Metrodorus Atheniensis, Plato,
Aristotle, and others. So I read of Hieronimus Osorius Lusitanus, more divinely affected,A Ut novis∣simè, ita e∣loquentissi∣mè omni∣um, quo∣rum libros vidimus. Hicronimus Osorius Lufi∣taenus De Nobilitate Christianâ libros tres scripsit. And Tira∣queb. cap 1. composed three Books De Nobilitate Christianâ . The chief aim of that zealous Au∣thor, being to kindle, and raise a flame in all mens hearts and affe∣ctions, and to make them in love with true and Christian Noble∣ness, which once acquired, as far outshineth all other vertuous ha∣bits, as the beams of the Sun the radiation of the lesser stars. This truth seems to appear in the nature and name of this high quality. For the Nobles rightlyNobili∣tatem quasi Noscibilita∣tem, prae caeteris no∣tam, cla∣ram, illu∣strem, aper∣tam, specta∣bilem, con∣spicuam, vulgatam, atque ho∣minum ser∣mone cele∣bratam. Festus Boni∣peius & No∣nius Mar∣cellus. pre∣sented, ought to be persons of greater wisdom, knowledge, and experience, so the Civilians will
have it. Scire oportet Nobiles, à noscendo dicti, veluti Noscibiles. Noblemen ought to be sharp-sighted, quick and active, ingeni∣ous and judicious. This is taught from the Sacred Dictates of Gods LawDeut. 1.13. which commandeth, That . Septuagint. Ideo Castellio peritos vertit, that wise men, and understanding, known amongst the Tribes, be made Ru∣lers over the people. Some are of opinion, thatNonus Marcellus. Nobilis is used pro noto, as more eminently known. Thus Virgil character'd Aenaeas, that TrojanEt nos aliquod no∣menque de cusque Gessimus. q Aeneid. Prince, as one, whose Name and Renown was great. Some conclude, that he who is Noble is, Vir clarus of great
honour, & fame. Thus the Histo∣rianIdem fecit clari generis, magnaeque dignitatis Vir Fulvi∣. Valerius Maximus. lib. 5. c. 9. describes Fulvius as a Ro∣man famous for his birth and pro∣geny, and of most transcendent di∣gnity. Thus Tully, pleading for Rabirius Posthumus, urgeth in his Oration, that Clarus, & Nobilis vir, He was a famous and Noble VVorthy. Offilius Calanius had the honour to be stiled, Clarus ge∣nere, factisque, And to be in high esteem, both for his birth and breeding, both for his worth in words, & deeds. Thus the Satyrist observed,Clarus genere at∣que opibus vir. Inen. Sat 2. that some Romans were famous, as well for their wealth, as for their birth and kind∣red. The Hebrews distinguished their Nobles and Ignobles by two
words, the one presentingAlbr & laudor qui nomine light and brightness, the other obscuri∣ty and darkness. Solomon (the most glorious of all Kings) approvethlucem accedit. Conti this allusionEccles. 10.17. concluding, Beata terra cujus Rex est Nobilis,. sive fi∣lus Nobilium,à tenebris ac∣cepta meta∣phora ad ob∣scuros & igno∣biles. And ∣raq. de Nobil. cap. 2. Blessed art thou O land, when thy King is the son of Nobles. And in this very sense, the VViseman promiseth, that the diligent man shall stand be∣fore Kings, he shall not stand be∣fore mean men. The original bears it more fully, He shallProv. 22.29. not stand before dark, low, and obscure persons: and from hence it is most probable, that the epi∣thete Illustrious is usually attribu∣ted to Kings, Princes, and Noble
men, because as the light it self, their actions and their passions, their waies, their words, their works, and all their atchievements are more eminent, conspicuous and visible. It was Otho's honour to have the Historians testimony, that Splendidis ortus Majoribus,Aurel. Victor in vi∣ta Othonis. he was descended from splendid Ancestors: and to those additions other adjuncts supervene, as those who are truly noble, have a subli∣mity of spirit, and generosity in their soulsQuis sublime ge∣nus for∣mamque insignis Hetrurci Nesciat. — Stat. lib. Syl. 3. clearly calcin'd and rarified from all sordid faeculency, and Plebeian business. And though Nobility be followed and waited on, with many others, emi∣nent attendants: yet her chiefest
beauty is made up, and the com∣plement atchieved, by vertue and piety; and these two, do not onely civilize rude man, but in some proportion deifie him, and con∣form the rational creature, in some proximity, to his Almighty Cre∣ator.Bald. Panrm. Hence is raised that En∣comium by universal consent and tradition, Omnes consentiunt bonos mores, sive virtutem, esse Nobilita∣ti anteponendam, that a civil and sweet comportment, and a virtu∣ous conversation, far out steppeth Nobility it self. Some others go further in the commendations of vertue, and boldly assert, that ver∣tueFaten∣tur plerum∣qe virtu∣tem dare causam Nobilitati, quoniam ad eam conseren∣dam Prin∣ceps saepius movetur, & moveri debet illius virtutibus cui vult concedere. Bat. Plat. Rag. gives an esse and beeing to Nobility, and that a King or
Prince is chiefly moved, and per∣swaded by her directions and counsel, to confer grace and fa∣vour, honour, trust and power, upon the merits of his subjects, whose virtues have an attractive power: and as the Load-stone hath a secret magnetick influence over Princely affections, and their Royal confidence and inclinati∣ons. It was from this firm founda∣tion whence the Noble (o) Ro∣mans elevated their thoughts,Malo pater tibi sit Thersi∣tes, dum∣modo tu sis Aeacidae si∣milis, Vul∣caniaque arma ca∣pessas, Iu∣ven. Sat. 8. esteeming it no dishonour or dis∣repute, though their birth were as mean as from Thersites: so their forttude and courage, were (at least in some degree) equal to that of Achilles. It was this, and one∣ly
this, that forced the RomansLibera si dentur populo suf∣fragia qis tam perdi∣tus, & du∣bitet Sene∣cam praefer∣re Neroni, Iuven. Sa. 8. to honour a learned, and modest Philosopher, above, and before a puissant Emperor. There is yet an∣other jewel that graceth Nobili∣ty, and outshineth vertue it self, and that is piety, and godliness. This is wisedom which is prefer∣red above scepters and thrones,Wisd. 7.8.25, 26. A pure influence, flowing from the glory of the Almighty, that bright∣ness of the everlasting light, the breath of the power of God; he is truly honourable and most noble, whose soul is embelished and beautified with this grace, which as the VViseman saith, Omnibus nobilibus nobilior est sapientia, is more precious then rubies, and in it
self is more noble and transcen∣dent then all the accesses and en∣dowments of either nature or for∣tune. In the variety of these ma∣nifold reflections, the eyes of many thousands are intentive with admiration, and their ears listen and hearken after your Grace, as a person perfectly No∣ble, and most richly accomplished with the endowments of clear worth and honour. This truth appears confirmed by heaven and earth, by God and man; and as it hath pleased God to commence his blessings to your Grace, by a most noble birth and pious education: so it hath pleased the Lords an∣ointed,K. Char. I. K Char. II. Two Royal Monarchs,
successively to confer their high∣est trust, honour and power of their Imperial Crown, and of their three Kingdoms, into your Graces hands and managery: and as their Majesties trust was im∣mense and great, so your Graces fidelity and loyalty hath been as equally remarkable: for when the torrents and inundations of treason and rebellion did first break forth in this Kingdome, your Grace did use your utmost endeavour, to calm and suppress those superbe and foaming waves: and when they did swell to such a magnitude, as not to be reclaimed by Royal authority; your Grace
(after many dangers & extremities) did chuse rather to endure an exile abroad, then to submit to disloyal subjects at home, Hault & puis∣sant Seigneur (and so the French estimate one rightly Noble, and a great soul) rather to chuse to ad∣venture, to lose lands, liberty, life, and to part with the nearest and dearest relations and concerns, then to hazard the loss of loyalty, or to admit the suspicion of taint∣ing true honour and renown: And as your Graces fidelity to the Crowns, was most conspicuous and impregnable: so; your Graces perseverance and constancy to the truly Catholick and Apostolick
faith, your Graces practice and adherency to your Religion, professed in the Doctrine and Discipline, and to the Liturgy of the Church of England and Ireland, is most admirable and remarkable. Thus whilest in∣terest biassed some to a Papal perswasion, and faction carri∣ed others to a Presbyterian Combination, and a third par∣ty were deluded and trans∣ported with Enthusiasmes, and the Puffes of new Doctrine, and Phanatique distempers; it hath pleased God to keep your heart aright, in the
VVorship and service of his Church, and the true Re∣ligion, now replanted by mi∣raculous and Divine Provi∣dence in this Kingdome, These signal testimonies of in∣comparable worth, cannot but raise your renown above the malignant breath of ei∣ther envie or flattery: (be∣sides others your singular ob∣ligations to me) these encou∣rage me to present to your Graces Patronage and favour, this little spiritual Infant, which desires to be in your
Graces eye, or in your hand, or yet nearer, into your Graces bosome, when you can spare a minute from your great and high employments: The subject is, our Saviour in his birth, his life, his death in his Resurrection and Ascension; and, as in a Chart, or Model in this example, you may see, and measure out much holy ad∣vantage to your soul, in a trice of time, or a short view, which may prove to your future and eternal hap∣piness,
prayed for most de∣voutly by (My LORD) Your GRACES faithful and humble Servant, Edvar dus Clonfert. & Diacens.

SIc olim, vel farre modico, vel exiguo sale, vel salien∣te mica (si nihil adesset ma∣joris pretii) litarunt veteres; ab ipso autem Dei instituto, in usum ac or∣namentum Sanctuarii tam pelles ari∣etum rubicatas, & Ianthinas quam aurum, argentum, hyacinthum, aut
purpurum obtulisse licuit: turtures, ac corumbarum pullos, aeque ac pingues agnos sacras esse victimas; ac è pio pectore, ac innocenti manu, pauperri∣mae viduae, vel inacuta duo in Gazo∣phylacium missa, numeravit, & ob∣servavit Dominus. Quid obstat igi∣tur, quo minus munusculum hoc, vel saltem, ut obsequii sui testimonium, vel ut officii sui argumentum, in gre∣mium matris, (scilicet, Ecclesiae Hi∣bernicae) majori cum confidentia pro∣jiciat filius? In hunc morem, non so∣lum regulis & praeceptis, sed etiam operibus & exemplis, ducuntur et mo∣ventur Christiani; ita ut contra libe∣ros suos, tanquam inscios, & ignaros, aut quod multo calamitosius, in impios, & ingrates, merito conqueretur Ec∣clesia:
si honorem & debitam vene∣randae Matri reverentiam, praestare negligerent: quod genus observantiae, tam in ad versis, quam in prosperis concedendum fateamur, & merito in hodiernum diem majori cum labore, ac vigilantia protegenda est vinea Domini, cum tot immineant pericu∣la, tot hostes turbidi & violenti ap∣pareant effodientes fundamentum pie∣tatis, & circumvallentes undequa∣quc, & radices orthodoxae doctrinae, una cum disciplina stirpitus extirpare conantes. Summo etiam honore, ac omni dignitatis gradu, potius ob∣servanda & tractanda est, quia ami∣ca, sorori Sponsa Christi, filia Regis inter latrones, sacrilegos, haereticos, schismaticos, phanaticos & propha∣nos,

Sic olim perfidia ac adu∣latione Hierobami, ad vitulos aureos itum est; idem vero, magno quodam damno, jam sentit Mater Ecclesia, per dissertores impios, qui apostatas angelos sequuti, ut sectas perditionis introducerent, se â fratribus sepera∣runt: nec hoc solum vulnus & ve∣nenum, sed etiam tanquam inferni tenebris obvoluti & obcaecati, obedi∣entiam erga Ecclesiam, fidelitatem erga Regem, observantiam erga le∣ges,

Exista certe abysso ac voragi∣ne, adoritur sumus iste sulphurcus, quod tanto clamore, et indignantium strepitu, bacchati vociferantur, con∣tra Reges Christianos, contra ortho∣doxos Ecclesiae Episcopos: hinc est, quod civiles Magistratus ordines, ac dispositiones hominum negligunt, et contemnunt: quod Leges, Canones, Sanctiones, Juramenta, Sacramenta, omniaque alia, quae ex conclavi, aut ex suis Conventiculis non prosiliant, aut ex ingenio suo ac phantasia praeipiti, non proveniant; omnino frivola, su∣perstitiosa,
inutilia et inania dijudi∣cant, ac veluti vestigia Anti-Christi, t opra Satanica, determinant. (De∣us Bone) est in medio lucis ex proter∣vitate sua caecutiunt impii, et exinde quot, quantisque malis Domus Dei violari videatur? cum Templum Do∣mini pateat injuriis improborum, qui, ut vulpes astutiones, aut, ut aprisaevi∣entes, exterminarent: Praedonum ma∣nibus, qui sacra diriperent, Propha∣nantium pedibus, qui conculcarent, vel indignissimorum hominum severis censuris et contumeliis, qui (si possent) funditus evecterent, et avaritia, et ambitione elati, non solum sacras pa∣ginas dilacerarent, & Templum, & Sanctuarium Domini diruerent, sed & dulce nomen Iesu, & Cultum Di∣vinum
in Ecclesia Dei jugiter cele∣brandum obliterarent, & extingue∣rent. Aliud etiam & maximum appa∣ret malum, quod sicut Balaamum stultum, ac vanum Ariolum asina, stu∣pidum & iners animal, insaniae red∣arguit: Ita jam modo rude, et indo∣ctum vulgus è Popinis, tabernisque se∣ctoriis, potoriis fabrilibus emersum, sacrorum sibi voluminum explanatio∣nem, mysteriorumque scientiam, arca∣norum perspicientiam sibi (inquam) vindicat. Et non mirandum est, quan∣ta audacia fuperba, ac temeritate, il∣literati turgeant, cum in Ecclesiam Dei, nova partenta, ac non prius audi∣ta paradoxa comportent et evomant; quo scelere et flagitio, nihil gravius,
pestileni iusve dici, aut excogita∣ri possit. At Deo Optimo Ma∣ximo, gratias, qui, post tot tan∣tasque tempestates circumstantes undique, & è maligno spiritu concitatas, navem & arcam su∣am in portum reduxit, nec ibi so∣lum post pericula, & jacturam naufragii in pace collocavit; sed, ut Dominus ipse de Aegyptiaca confusione vineam transtulit. Ita Ecclesiam Hibernicam propria sua manu Deus replintavit; ita Dux itineris fuit: totam terram implet, operuit montes umbra ejus, extendit palmites, usque ad mare, & adusque flumen pre∣pagines ejus. Ac ut Christus
Dominus, Sponsus Ecclesiae est in caelis: ita per spiritum conso∣lantem smper versatur in teris, qui ita operatur: ut Reges, Im∣peratores, & Christiani Princi∣pes, sint Patres et Patricii Ec∣clesiae; nec ii solum, sed etiam Praelati, Antistes, Archi Epi∣scopi, et vencrandi Sacerdotes, Pastores, et Doctores, et Ange∣li Dei, vineae Domini existunt vigiles, et custodes: hoc ipsum annunciat Divus Paulus (Acts 20.27, 28▪) . Ob hanc causam et rationem, sub umbra Clementiae vestrae hi pusilli
admodum conatus, de dictis et fa∣ctis, de vita & morte Redem∣ptoris nostri Domini Iesu Chri∣sti sperant paululum acquiescere; vel sub alis gratiae & favoris vestri foveri, eo tuto ac secure in lucem prodire valeant: & quid ni succedat modesta & humilis ex∣pectatio; cu tam bene nota ve∣stra sit humanitas & paterna pi∣etas, ut non solum sublimiores Ec∣clesiae Hibernicae dignitates Pro∣videntia Dei, & ex intuitu & gratia serenissimi Regis accepistis, sed etiam strenue, et magna cum vigilia ac sedulitate laborastis; et quod multo longe excellentius per singularia, patientiae indefatigabi∣lis,
constantiae immutabilis et in∣victae fidei testimonia, acerbissi∣mos Ecclesiae hostes ac veritatis adversarios superastis: et, Conso∣pitis illorum opprobriis, et colum∣niis, ut multa perpessa mala, ita procul dubio, pro Deo, pro Rege, clesia graviora perpessuri. Postremo, nec mirum sit, quod opusculum hoc, qualecun∣que, ad mutuum refugium Il∣lustrissimi Pro-Regis, et piis∣simorum Praesulum ac patrum occurrat asylum, cum Deus ip∣se vineam suam suo piissimo Regi Carolo Secundo; et Rex ipse, ex intuitu benigno, et gra∣tia

Faxit Deus, ut omnibus haereticorum & schis∣maticorum conceptaculis eversis, redeat Ecclesia Hibernica ad perfectam tranquillitatem quam expetimus: instaurationem quam quaerimus: pacem & concordi∣am quam optamus: & pro constantia, moderatione, indu∣stria, & conatibus vestris, ut Cidares, ac Tiaras inter homi∣nes: ita Sceptra, & Coronas

Amen. 2. Contemplation. IEsus Christ is eminent, and more fa∣mous in his genealogy, descent, and ge∣neration: as man.
2. Observacion.

Amen.
3. Contemplation. THe Angels of heaven, as well as the holy Evangelists on earth, sing and set forth the Birth and Nativity of our blessed Saviour. 3. Observation. CHrist Iesus was born of a pure Virgin, l to purifie the uncleanness of our na∣ture, m that he might be more fitly and fully the Head of his Church, n our Medi∣atour, and our o Advocate. 3. Confirmation. CHristus conceptus est de Spiritu sancto, intra uterum Virginis Matris, quae ita illum salva virginitate edidit, quemadmodum salva virginitate concepit, D. Aug. Ser. de Nativ.

Virgin, for the holy Conception, and happy Brth of our Lord and Saviour Iesus. Amen. 4. Contemplation. THe Evangelists, as exact and faithful Secretaries to the holy Ghost, set forth the truth, with the place, the manner, the time of the Circumcision of Iesus. 4. Observation. CHrist was subject to the Law for us PVer ille Iesus factus est sub lege, ut eos qui sub lege erant, lucrifaceret, D. Amb. in Luc. De Cir∣cumcis. Salvato. Circumcisus est veraciter, non ap∣parenter octavo die, Epiph. advers. Haeres. Haere∣si. 3. and that not onely to the duties, but likewise to the curses and punishments of the Law Sicut mortui sumus cum illo moriente; & consurreximus resurgenti: sic cum eo circumcisi su∣mus, unde nequaquam nunc indigemus carnali cir∣cumcisione, Origen. 14. Hom. in Luc. Pluribus de causis circumcisus est Christus, & primo quidem, ut ostendat carnis veritatem contra Manichaeum: De∣inde, ut pateat quod nequaquam Deitati consubstan∣tiale corpus extiterit, ut fatur Apollinaris, neque cae∣litus detulit illud, ut asserit Valentinus; & ut con∣firmet Circumcisionem quam olim instituerat, ejus ad∣ventui servientem. Quinetiam, ut nulla sit Iudaeis excusatio; nam nisi circumcisus fuisset, objicere pote∣rant, quod non possent circumcisum Christum recipe∣re, Epiph. which we meritted, that he might be as well our Sacrifice as our Priest, to appease his Fathers wrath Circumcisus est Christus, ut nobis obedi∣endi virtutem commendaret exemplo, Bd. in Hom. De Circum. Domini. to acquit us from the malediction of the Law, and so to gain pardon for our rebellions, by his submission and obedience Octavo die consuetum erat carnalem celebrari circumcisionem; octavo enim die resurrexit Christus à mortuis, & insinuavit nobis spiritualem circumcisionem, D. Cyril cap. 7. in Lucam.
4. Doxology. ALL honour and glory be ever devoted and dedicated to Almighty God, our heavenly Father,Luke 2.31. who made his blessed Son to be circumcised, and obedient to the Law for mans salvation; and blessed for ever be the Name of thy holy Child Iesus. Amen. 5. Contemplation. THe Prophet, and Evangelist; the Law, and the Gospel, as they de∣scribe our Saviour in his natures, Divine and Humane; and in his Person, God, and Man: so they present him won∣derfull, and magnifie him in his proper Name and Appellation, Iesus.
5. Observation. IEsus, a Name sent from the King of Hea∣ven, to his beloved Son on Earth, impo∣sed by God the Father, w proclaimed by an Angel, x foretold by the Prophets, y recom∣mended to the blessed Virgin Mary, z en∣joyned to Ioseph a at the mentioning where∣of all knees ought to bow, b and to use ho∣ly reverence. The Name Iesus more pecu∣liarly and properly signifying, and repre∣senting a Saviour, who should eternally save his Church, and preserve his Saints and Servants from the sting of everlasting death, and from the jaws of Satan, and from the torments of hell. 5.

AS the holy Evangelists have presented many admirable truths in the Conce∣ption Genealogy, Nativity, Circum∣cision, and Nomination of our Lord Iesus: so they represent him as equally wonderful by many miraculous circumstances, which accompanied our Saviour in his Infancy, which was proclaimed from God to man, from heaven to earth, in the Heraldry and message of an Angel. 2. Observation. THe Angels, and Archangels of heaven are celestial Embassadors, and glorious Heralds of heaven, c they are Christs Atten∣dants and followers, d his servants and
souldiers, e ministring spirits sent abroad to obey and execute the will and pleasures of Christ Iesus their Lord and Master. 6. Confirmation. Damascen. lib. 2. Luke 2.11, 12, 13.

Amen. 7. Contemplation. AS Christ in his infancy was proclaimed by the Angels: so was he immediately attended by the vigilant & innocent shep∣herds, who went in haste (as the angel di∣rected) to Bethlem, and there they found (f) Mary, and Ioseph, and the (g) Babe lying in a manger. (h) 7. Observation. THe shepherds were witnesses of Christs birth, (f) of his poverty and great humlity, (g) their souls were inflamed with the beams of that glorious
light, that shone round about them, they hearkened to the angels voice, and made haste to Bethlem to finde their Saviour. f 7. Confirmation.

AS our Saviour Iesus was proclaimed, and adored by the Angels, (a) and at∣tended by the shepherds; (b) so was he presented in the Temple, (c) by Ioseph, and his blessed Mother, the Virgin Mary. (d)
8. Observation.

Amen.
9. Contemplation. AS Christ was presented at Hierusalem, in the holy Temple before the Iews: so was he, near Hierusalem, at Bethlem, visitted and adored by the Magi, the Gentiles, that as he was Lord of all, he might appear the Sa∣viour of all, both Iews and Gentiles. 9. Observacion. AT the Birth of Christ, glad tidings were sent from heaven to all Nations, b the Partition-wall was then thrown down, Angels came from heaven to sind, good will towards men on earth, the Gentiles, as well as the Iews were then admitted and received as Gods own people, and they came from far to worship and adore k the Son of God, l the Saviour of all the world. m

Amen. 10. Contemplation. THe Birth of Christ was proclaimed, and celebrated by holy Angels; attend∣ed and admired by vigilant shepherds: Christ was presented in the Temple, and visitted and adored by the Gentiles, but thence by the cruelty and suspition of He∣rod, he was banished and forced to fly to Egypt.
10. Observation. AT the birth of Christ, the Angels ex∣pressed their joy, (n) the shepherds their amazements, (o) the Gentiles their hope, (p) Ioseph and the Blessed Virgin Ma∣ry their faith, their humility, their obedi∣ence, (q) and flying with the Child Iesus to Egypt, for fear of Herods cruelty, (r) they shew and set forth their prudence, their patience, their love and honour that they had for our Blessed Saviour Iesus; for Christ fled for us, that we might flee to him: He fled from Herod, that we might flee from hell; (s) He was banished from Hierusalem, that he might lead us back to Paradise, whence our sins had banished us; and that we might be made sons and Citi∣zens of the heavenly Hierusalem, which is (t) above, which is the mother of us all.

It pleased thee, O Lord, to live and dye, and by active and passive obedience to perfect the great work of mans salvation, to fly to Egypt, and to return to Hierusalem, to suffer on the Cross for poor sinners. Therefore to thee, O Father, with the Son, and the Hol Ghost, be all honour, praise, and thanksgiving, world without end. Amen. 11. Contemplation. AN Angel was sent to admonish Ioseph and the Blessed Virgin of Herods cruel∣ty
towards our Lord and Saviour, com∣manding them to fly with the Childe to E∣gypt. But the Tyrant grew inraged, and spread his persecution with greater vio∣lence, sparing no infants under two years old, and thereby designing probably, the more securely to murder and slay our Savi∣our Iesus. 11. Observation. CHrist the Son of God was threatned with death, (a) tyrannized over & per∣secuted by Herod and bloudy sinners, (b) that his Church might be delivered from the blackest persecutions, and poor Christi∣ans, and all his servants more securely res∣cued from the (c) jaws and torments of sin, the Grave, Death, Satan, and Hell. 11.

AS Christ in his Birth and infancy ama∣zed the world with his humility, his patience, his graces and wonderfull goodness: so in his Childhood and tender years, he expressed his duty and obedience to the will of his heavenly Father, and ob∣servation of the Laws of God, it was from this principle, That Christ went up de∣voutly to Hierusalem to worship, and so to fulfill the Law. 12. Observation. CHrist fulfilled all righteousness, to sup∣ply the empiness of our errors and in∣firmties, (c) and in his younger years pre∣sented
himself a holy pattern and example of humility and obedience, (d) teaching all Christians thereby, to begin early to be de∣vout and reverend in Gods worship and service. (e) His Parents went every year to Hierusalem, at the Feast of the Passover, and when Christ was Twelve years old, he went with them. 12. Confirmation.

The Lord sent his Son to be our Saviour, and the Son for our sakes, and our example, went up yearly to Hierusalem to wait and worship in the holy Temple. Blessed be God the Father, Son, and holy Ghost, for evermore. Amen. 13. Contemplation. AS Christ went yearly up to Hierusalem to worship in the Temple his heavenly Father: so he manifested his filial obedi∣ence to Ioseph, and the Blessed Virgin his
mother in a daily and dutiful submission to their parental orders and directions, exact∣ly observing the first Commandement of promise, Honour thy father and thy mo∣ther, that thy days may be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. 13. Observation. VNdutiful disobedience in children to∣wards parents, (f) is dangerous if not damnable. (g) Therefore Christ offereth himself, as a copy and pattern of obedi∣ence (h) to all the sons and daughters of men, guiding them to that honour and re∣verence that they owe to their parents; for thus (i) the Scriptures record of Christ, that he went down with his parents to Nazareth, and was subject unto them.

To thee there∣fore, O Lord, be ascribed all honour and glory, for ever and ever. Amen. 14. Contemplation. CHrist the eternal word, and wisdome of God the Father, went to Hierusa∣lem, not onely to worship, but like∣wise to manifest his divine graces; and therefore at twelve years of age, he reason∣ed and disputed with the Rabbies and Do∣ctors, hearing them, and posing them, and asking them questions. 14. Observation. THe beams of the Divine Nature began to (l) radiate, and to shine and shew
themselves in Christ, when he was twelve years of age. (m) Then did the rose of Sha∣ron begin to bud, and to set and send forth his blush, fragrancy and beauty, (n) being full of the holy Ghost, (o) his graces did o∣verflow, and at that tender age, the Son of God did dispute, astonish and confound the great Rabbies, and pofound Doctors of the Law. 14.

the proud and haughty. To this glo∣rious Redeemer of all mankind, be given all Dominion and Power throughout all ages. Amen. 15. Contemplation. AS the Infancy and tender yeares of our Saviour did bud and blossom most Divine Graces: so his man∣hood and riper age did send forth rich and rare fruits, and did abound with miracles. And as he was circumcised when he was tender and young: so was he baptized, when he was at full age by S. Iohn in the ri∣ver Iordan. 15. Observation. CHrist was bapized, and by his example and command, he recommended that Sacrament to his Church (p) for ever: the
Iewish Circumcision was then (q) exchan∣ged into the Christians Baptism, which put∣teth us in mind of the Death of Christ, and we are to be washed from our sins in the laver of Regeneration. (r) 15.

Amen. 16. Contemplation. AFter Christ was baptized, and went straight way out of the waters; lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a
Dove, and lighting upon him; and lo, a voice from heaven saying This is my belo∣ved Son in whom I am well pleased. Af∣ter which solemn inauguration, Iesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the Devil. 16. Observation. CHrist was tempted, but first baptized, (t) he was led by the holy Spirit which should (u) ever be our guide and comfort. (w) He was tempted, that he might sup∣port and succour his servants in their tem∣ptations, (x) that he might subdue the tem∣pter, and (y) make his servants more then (z) conquerours. 16.

Amen. 17. Contemplation. SAint Matthw records the sacred story,Mat, 4.2. That Christ fasted fourty dayes and fourty nights, and that afterwards he was an hungred. Saint Luke doth vary the relation,Luke 42. saying, Iesus being full of the ho∣ly Ghost, returned from Iordan, (where he had been baptized) and was led by the Spi∣rit into the wilderness, being fourty dayes tempted of the Devil; and when they were ended, he afterwards hungred.
17. Observation. CHrist fasted forty days, and forty nights, (a) that we might be filled (b) with the joyes of heaven, and with the pleasures at Gods right hand for evermore. (c) As he fasted, so he was tempted (d) forty dayes and nights together, that his servants might be enabled to conquer Satan, (e) and so be free from his temptations for ever. Christ fasted, that the sin of eating in our first Pa∣rents, (f) might be expiated by his absti∣nence, and that by Christs righteousness and obedience, the sons of the first Adam (g) might be readmitted and restored to Pa∣radise. 17.

13. Doxology. ALL honour be ascribed to our Blessed Redeemer, our Saviour Iesus: as for all his goodness, so chiefly that he was plea∣sedIsa 61.1, 2. Luke 4.18.
to go in the virtue of the Spirit, from place to place, to preach the Gospel, to work miracles, and to cure his people from their infirmities, and to dispossess them of Devils, and so to set them in the way to everlasting happiness: to this blessed Re∣deemer be all dominion, praise and thanks∣giving, now for ever. Amen. 19. Contemplation. VVHen Christ had manifested him∣self to be the Son of God by ma∣ny miracles, he called and or∣dained his Twelve Apostles: the sacred Scriptures set forth their names, their num∣ber, their office, their honour and authori∣ty; and the chief end of their vocation was, that they might be with Iesus,Mark 3.14. and that he might send them forth to preach, and to have power to heal sickness, and to cast out Devils.
19. Observation. CHrist, as he hath great honour for God his (p) Father: so hath he great care and tender kindness for the Church our mother; (q) and therefore he chose the Twelve Apostles, that they (r) and their Successors, Bishops and Pastors, might feed the Flock (s) o Christ, and by virtue of his Commission, preach the Gospel to all the wold, (t) baptize all nations, and consecrate and administer the holy Sacra∣ment in a blessed Communion of the body and bloud of Christ in remembrance of (u) Christs Death and Passion. 19.

Now to this bles∣sed Iesus be all honour, power and glory, for ever. Amen. 20. Contemplation. AS Christ went about doing of good, and cose his Apostles, and appoint∣ed their Successors for the honour and service of his Church▪ so all hs works and words intirely aimed at Gods glory, and
mans salvation, and whiles he lived on erh, were tstimonies of his humanity and Divinity, hypostatically united i one Per∣son, seen partly in his Discourses and Ser∣mons, which were either plain and practi∣cal, or alluive and parabolica. 20. Observation. CHrist though he was the natural and e∣ternal (a) Son of God, yet was he plea∣sed to live and converse with te sons of men, (b) flesh of our flesh, and bone of our bones, like unto us in all things, sin onely excepted; and as a King, (c) a Priest, (d) a Prophet, (e) he came from the bosome of hi Fther, to the womb of his moter and thence sprang into the world to rule, to save, to teach his Church.

AMongst mny others, Christ prea∣ched, and taught, and catechizd Nicodemus, a great Ruler in Israel,
but an ignorant Iew, instructing that Rab∣by in the Doctrine of Regeneration and Righteousness by Faith. 21. Observation. CHrist came into the world to call all (d) sinners to Repentance, he came (e) to seek and to save that which was lost: as he called poor Fishermen from their ships, (f) so he reclaimed the great Doctours of the Law from their errors, (g) willing that all men should learn the Doctrine of Repen∣tance, the new Birth, and so be saved by faith in Christ, as Nicodemus was. 21.

the mighty, to instruct the ignorant, to convert the obstinate, and to proclaim salvation to all the world; Now to the blessed Trinity be all glory and praise for ever. Amen. 22. Contemplation. AS Christ preached to Nicodemus, so did he, most graciously, to the wo∣man of Samaria, when he came to a City, which is called Sythar, near to the parcel of ground that Iacob gave to his son Ioseph, now Iacohs well was there. Iesus therefore being wearied with his journey, sate thus on the well, and it was about the sixth hour.John 4., 6. 22. Observation. CHrist was pleased to discourse freely with the (h) woman of Samaria, hum∣bly
to ask her a draught (i) of water, that he might drink, and in recompence of that slender civility, and in great compassion, doth teach her the way to finde the foun∣tain of the (k) water of life, and giveth her to drink living waters, that she might ne∣ver thirst again. Thus our Saviour vouch∣safed to converse with a (l) sinner, a Sa∣maritan; and wisdom it self, to instruct (m) a silly woman, and thereby the Samaritans were converted, and believed on him. 22.

again. To this blessed Iesus be all honour and glory, for ever. Amen. 23. Contemplation. CHrist, as he pleased to teach and talk to single persons: so he preached to the multitudes, that by all means he might woo and win the people to save their souls, to believe the Gospel, and thereby glorifie God his Father, who had sent redemption and salvation into all the world. 23. Observation. OVr Saviour, in his Sermon on the Mount to the multitudes, taught (n) who are blessed, (o) expounded the Law, (p) how to give alms, (q) how to pray, (r) how to fast, (s) how to depend on Gods Providence, (t) discoursed of (u) rash judgement, (w) of false prophets, (x) of

Amen. 24. Contemplation. CHrist preached the gospel to the multi∣tudes, that they might believe, n be saved, but more exact and quently to his Apostles, because they were to be shep∣herds of his Flock, leaders of his people,
pillars of his Church, and Confessors and Martyrs to seal his Truth. Therefore did he more distinctly call them, more com∣pleatly impower them, more precisely name them, and more freely send them to preach the gospel, saying, the Kingdom of God is at hand. 24. Observation. (r) OVr Saviour taught his Apostles what to doe, and what to suffer; (s) how to love him, and how to take up his Cross; (t) how to value the world, and how to respect their lives for Christs sake; (u) tea∣cheth the world how to entertain his Mi∣nisters,, (w) and promisetd great rewards for small kindness to his servants. 24.

Cities, Towns and Villages, where he wrought his miracles, that he might con∣firm his works by his Word. So Saint Mat∣thewMat. 11.1 presents the History of Christs life and actions, (when Iesus had made an end of commanding his Twelve Disciples, he departed thence to preach and to teach in their Cities.) 25.

all diseases, teaching and preaching the glad tydings of the Gospel, in the Cities, Towns and Villages of Iudea. To this everlasting and immortal King, Priest and Prophet, be ascribed all honour and glory for ever. Amen. 26. Contemplation. CHrist, the Lords Anointed Prophet, did shew and set forth many mira∣cles, and preach many Sermons. But he was not so sharp and plain in any, as in that which he preached against the sins of the Scribes and Pharisees, who have Eight several woes denouncedMat. 23. v. 13, 14, 15, 16, 23, 2, 25, 29. against their hy∣pocrisie. 26. Observation. IN this Sermon our Saviour tells and re∣bukes the Pharisees, (e) First for their
pride, then for hypocrisie, (f) for their cun∣ning cruelty, (g) [devouring widows, houses, and for a pretence making long prayers] for their compassing of Sea and Land to make one proselite, (h) for their blindness and ignorance, (i) for their craft and dishonesty, paying petty ythes to the Church, a Mint, Anise, Commin; but o∣mitting weightier matters of the Law, Iudgement, Mercy and Faith, for their ex∣ternal cleanness, (k) and their internal fil∣thiness, for murthering the Prophets, and building and (l) garnishing their tombes; (m) for being as subtile and supple as (n) serpents, and as venemous as vipers. 26.

Let us therefore worship him and his Son Iesus with reverence and godly fear, for e∣ver. Amen. 27. Contemplation. AS God complained to Abraham of So∣dom and Gomorah, because their sinnes
were very grievous,Gen. 1.20. and the Prophet a∣gainst Bethel1 Kings 13.32. and Samaria: so Christ cri∣eth out against the City of Hierusalem for her pride, her cruelty, her disobedience, her irrepentance, and many other horrid sins, and after threatens her with bitter judge∣ments, and utter desolation. 27. Observation. OBstinacy, (o) impenitency, (p) apostacy, (q) cruelty, murder, (r) and kiling of Gods Prophets, are remarkable testimo∣nies of wilfull, incorrigible sinners, and most certain provocations and forerunners of Gods heavy wrath and displeasure, and (s) a wilfull refusal of mercy, hastens and hurries on grievous judgements, and (t) fearful ind gnation. 27.

THe seed, alludes to Gods Word, (x) which sometimes falls by the way-side, then cometh (y) the wicked one,Mat. 13.19. and cat∣cheth it away, that which was sown in his heat, (z) sometimes to stony ground, and then the seed perisheth for want of root, sometimes amongst thorns, (a) that is, cares of the world, and deceitfulness of riches, which choak it; and sometimes the seed falls into good grounds, that is, into the meek ears and humble hearts of belie∣ving and understanding hearers, (b) and they thrive and bring forth fruit, some thir∣ty, some sixty; some an hundred fold.

29. Doxology. LEt the Preachers sow, and the hearers ofMat. 13.23. Gods Word faithfully and hum∣bly receive the pure seed of Gods grace, not in sandy, stony, nor thorny ground, but in a meek heart and humble spirit, that they may chearfully return always the fruits of praise and thanksgiving to Almighty God, through Iesus Christ our Lord. Amen. 30. Contemplation. CHrist put forth another parable of the tares,Mat. 23.4. saying, The kingdom of hea∣ven is like unto a man, which sowed good seed in his field, but whiles men slept his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat, and went his way.
30. Observation. OVr Saviour, and his true servants, sow no seed in Gods Church but pure wheat (c) the word of grace, (d) and truth, (e) peace and holiness, (f) and faith, hope, and charity, (g) and the way and means to everlasting life: but the Devil [the com∣mon enemy of mankind] (h) with all his wicked instruments, Atheists, Hereticks, and Schismaticks, they sow the tares of in∣fidelity, dissention, rebellion, and all kind of mischiefs and wickedness amongst the pure seeds of grace.

30. Doxology. LEt God arise,Psal.  1.3 and let his enemies be scattered. Let them also that hate him flee before him, but let the righteous be glad and rejoyce before God. Let them al∣so be merry and joyful, for he soweth the seeds of grace in his servants hearts, and preserveth them from the Devil, and all their enemies. O sing unto God, and sing praises unto his Name, and rejoyce before him for evermore, and world without end. Amn. Amen. 31. Contemplation IN another parable Christ taught the people, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which is indeed the least of all seeds;Mat. 13.32. but when it is grown, it is the greatest amongst herbs,
and becometh a Tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in it. 31. Observation. MVstard seed is a very small grain, but it groweth quickly both great and fruit∣ful, (k) the branches thereof do spread, (l) and prove lodgings and entertainment for the birds of the air; and thus the pure Word of God, both grows and thrives in all true Believers hearts, whose branches spread as high as heaven, and over all the world, with faith, hope, and charity, (m) and good works of mercy and piety. (n) 31. Confirmation.

31. Doxology. GIve ear, O heavens, and hear, O earth,De. 3.1, 4. ascribe ye greatness unto the Lord, he is the rock, his work is perfct, O God of truth, and without iniquity, just and right is he, his mercies are infinite, his works are wonderful, he can raise a tree from the seed of grace, whose branches shall spread, and
whose top shall reach to heaven, and whose fruit shall never fade or fail.Psal. 1.4 To this Creatour and Preserver of his servants be glory and dominion for ever. Amen. 32. Contemplation. CHrist taught the people in another pa∣rable, That the kingdom of Heaven is like unto leaven,Mat. 13.33. which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened. 32. Observation. THe word of God, as leaven hid in meal, is diffusive and apt to ferment, to sea∣son and swell, to incorporate, (o) and to impart its vertue and nature to the meal and substance, (p) whereinto it is diffused: and a very drop or grain of grace, as a little leaven, is able to season and sanctifie (q) the inward and outward man.
32. Confirmation. SIcut fermentum multam farinam transmutat in suam virtutem; ita & o totum mundum transmutabitis, Chrys. Hom. 47.

32. Doxology. O Praise God in his holiness, praise him in the firmament of his power,Psa. 150.1, . praise him in his noble acts, praise him according to his excellent greatness, for he doth sea∣son the hearts of his servants with the wholesom leaven of his word, and sancti∣fie their souls with the graces of his holy Spirit. Now to the blessed Trinity, Fa∣ther, Son, and holy Ghost, be all honour and glory for ever. Amen. 33. Contemplation. OVr Saviour Iesus taught, That the king∣dom of heaven is like unto treasure,Mat. 13.4. hid in a field, the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy thereof, goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buy∣eth that field.
33. Observation. THe parables of the graine of mustard seed, and of the leaven, hid in three measures of meal, set forth the powerful operation of Gods word. But this (t) of the hid treasure, presents the excellency, the worth and dignity, (u) and the transcen∣dent value and esteem, which all Christians ought to have on Gods holy word. (w) 33. Confirmation. PRaedicatio Evangelii occulta est in mundo, & si non vendideris omnia, non ees eam; & cum gaudio hoc oportet sacere, Chrys. Hom. 48. in Matth. Prov. 2.2, 24.

Amen.
34. Contemplation. CHrist our Saviour sets a second, but higher valuation on the Gospel, say∣ing,Mat. 13.40. the kingdom of Heaven is not onely as treasure hid in a field, but is far a∣bove all precious pearls and jewels, which when the merchant hath found, he sells all that he hath to purchase them. 34. Observation. A Christian, like a merchant, ought to be active and (a) diligent, to laour and travel, to adventure danger, to run risques and hazards, to search and find out, to gain and possess the precious pearl (b) of eternal life.

To him be given all honour and glory world without end. Amen. 35. Contemplation. CHrist preached and said, That the king∣dom of Heaven is like unto a Net,Mat. 13.47. that was cast into the sea, and gathered of every kind, which when it was full, they drew to the shoar, and set down, and ga∣thered
the good into vessels, but cast the bad away. 35. Observation. THe Church of God, (d) as a Net cast into the sea, gathereth some of all kinds, Iews and Gentiles, Greeks and Barbarians, (e) bond and free. There promiscuously good and bad, just and u∣just, (f) Hereticks, Schismaticks, Apo∣states, Atheists, meet together with true Catholicks, and humble-hearted and faith∣ful Christians. But at the end of the world (g) the Angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from amongst the just. (h) 35. Confirmation.

35. Doxology. O Give thanks unto the Lord, for he is gracious, and his mercy endureth for e∣ver,Psal. 107.1, 2, 3. Let them give thanks whom the
Lord hath redeemed and delivered from the hand of the enemy, and gathered them out of the Lands, from the East, and from the West, from the North, and from the South. Oh that men would therefore praise the LordVers. 8. for his goodness, and declare the wonders that he doth for the children of men. To him be all honour and glory for ever. Amen. 36. Contemplation. VVHen Saint Peter came to Christ, and said, Lord, how oft shall my brother sin against me, and I for∣give him, till seven times?Mat. 18.21, 22. Iesus saith un∣to him, not until seven times, but until se∣venty times seven,Mat. 18.23. Therefore is the king∣dom of Heaven like unto a certain King, which would take account of his servants.
36. Observation. CHrist teacheth his Church to exercise the works of mercy and charity, in the parable of a King, (i) forgiving his servant Ten thousand talents, (k) who when he fell down at his feet, and worshipped him, (l) praying for patience, and promising payment, (m) the Lord was moved with compassion, and forgave the debt. But this great Act of charity, requited with unpa∣rallel'd cruelty upon a fellow servant, the merciless Creditor, being a large Debtor to his Lord and King, (n) is justly delivered over to the Tormentors, till he should pay all that was due: so likewise (o) shall my heavenly Father do unto you, if you from your hearts forgive not every one his bro∣ther their trespasses.

To thee therefore, O Lord, Father, Son, and holy Ghost, be all honour and glory for evermore. Amen.
37. Contemplation. CHrist taught his Disciples, in the para∣ble of the sheep, and of the shepherd, telling them,John 10., 11. that he was the door of the sheep-fold, that he was the good shepherd, who laid down his life for his sheep, no man taketh it from me,John 10.8. but I lay it down of my self, I have power to lay it down, and have power to take it a∣gain. 37. Observation. OVr Saviour said to Saint Thomas,John 14.6 I am the way, the truth, and the life. (q) Saint Iohn standing with two of his Disci∣ples, and looking upon Iesus as he walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of God. (r) Christ preaching to his Disciples, tells them, (s) I am the door, (t) I am the good shep∣herd.
That his Church may learn to hear and obey the voice and command of the chief Bishop and shepherd of all mens souls, (u) and that a true shepherd may be known and distinguisht (w) from a sacrile∣gious thief, or timorous lazy hireling. 37.

37. Doxology. O Praise the Lord, for the Lord is my Shepherd;Psal. 23.1.2, 3. therefore can I lack no∣thing. He shall feed me in a green pasture, and lead me forth besides the waters of comfort: he shall convert my soul, and bring me forth in the paths of righteous∣ness, for his Names sake. We are his peo∣ple, and the sheep of his flock. To him therefore, as the chief1 Pet. 2.25. Shepherd, and Bi∣shop of our souls, let us ascribe all praise,
honour and obedience, for evermore. A∣men. 38. Contemplation. CHrist instructed a certain Lawyer, who tempted him, and seemed to be earnest to inherit eternal life, and said, What is written in the Law? how readest thou? and he answering said,Luke 10.27. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and thy neighbour as thy self. Christ replyed, Thou hast answe∣red right, this do, and thou shalt live. But the Lawyer, willing to justifie himself, said unto Iesus, And who is my neighbour? on which occasion Christ presented a parable, saying, A certain man went down from Hierusalem to Iericho, and fell amongst thieves, who did rob and wound the poor traveller.Luke 10.39.
38. Observation. MAny Pharisaical and carnal wits are more full of querks and curiosities, then of any sincere desires of the Truth, of saving grace, (x) or the concerns of eternal life, (y) and pretending to know the Law, will not know who is their neighbour; and many who abound with much know∣ledge, have little or no charity. And there∣fore Christ hath taught his Church a per∣fect Lesson, (z) by the example of the good Samaritan,Luke 10.. condemning and command∣ing the Lawyer out of his ovvn confession, [Go thou and do likevvise.] 38. Confirmation.

To thee, O Lord, be ascribed all praise and power for ever. Amen. 39. Contemplation. CHrist taught the people by the parable of the marriage of the Kings son, saying,Mat. 22.2, 3. The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, who made a marriage for his son, and sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding, and they would not come. 39. Observation. GOd is very gracious, (a) and wooeth sinners to salvation; (b) courts and in∣vites them to the marriage of his Son: (c) but wicked sinners are perverse and obsti∣nate, and do not onely make light of hea∣venly invitations, but scornfully and cruel∣ly (d) intreat his servants and messengers,

CHrist was pleased to preach to the Pub∣licans and sinners, who drew near to hear him; but whiles they heard with reve∣rence, the Pharisees and Scribes murmured and filled with envy, on which occasion our Saviour taughtLuke 15, 4, 8, 11. them in the parables
of the lost sheep, the piece of silver, and the prodigal son. 40. Observation. OVr Lord and Saviour, as he much desi∣reth, so he much rejoyceth at the con∣version of a sinner, (e) as a good shep∣herd who hath found his lost sheep (f) as a poor woman who hath found her lost groat, (g) as a tender-hearted father who hath found his lost prodigal son. 40.

Contemplation. CHrist taught his Disciples how to pray,Luke 1.1, 2 and what to say, both for matter and form, that is, Our Father which art in heaven, &c. and then preach't, and made an Exposition on the Lords Prayer. In the parable of a friend,Luke 11.5 from whom a neigh∣bour importuned at midnight to borrow three loaves of bread, pressing the courtesy
with necessity, for a friend of mine in his journey is come unto me, and I have no∣thing to set before him. 41. Observation. CHrist is our Mediatour and Advocate, (h) full of compassio and mercy, (i) a most chearful friend in the greatest wts and miseries, (k) and supplieth his servants in their most bitter extremities: First, teach∣ing them how to pray, and then speedily granting to (l) them what they pray for, or else providing for them wha is far bet-better. 41.

41. Doxology. I Will magnify thee, O God my King, and I will praise thy namePs. 145.1, 2, 8. for ever and e∣ver, every day will I give thanks unto thee, and praise thy name for ever and ever; the Lord is gracious and merciful, long-suffer∣ing, and of great goodness, he is a Comfor∣ter,
a Father and a Friend to all his children, he will hear and help all who in distress call upon him faithfully. To him be all ho∣nour and glory for evermore. Amen. 42. Contemplation. CHrist in a Sermon taxed the Pharisees, because they were excessively proud and covetous; and though they derided him,Luke 16.3. yet he taught them, saying, [No ser∣vant can serve two masters, ye cannot serve God and Mammon.] and then was plea∣ssd to inlarge his discourse in the parable of the rich man,verse 19 and the beggar Laza∣rus. 42. Observation. MEn, who are lovers of themselves, are (as Saint Paul observes) Tim. .. covetous, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient
to parents, unthankful, unholy, (m) such was the Pharisaical temper, to be a saint (n) in shew, but inwardly a wolf or Devil; or as the merciless Glutton cloathed in purple and fine linen, (o) and fared deliciously eve∣ry day; when a poor beggar is ready (p) to starve for want of bread, sadly complain∣ing at the merciless gates. 42. Confirmation.

his people. Blessed be the name of the Lord from this time forth for evermore. Amen. 43. Contemplation. CHrist spake this parable unto certain which trusted in themselves,Luke 18.11. that they were righteous, and despised others. Two men went up into the Temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, the other a Pub∣lican. 43. Observation. PHarisees and Publicans, (q) holy men and hypocrites, (r) good men and bad come to Church, and meet in the Temple, (s) [the house of Prayer] at their devoti∣ons: but God knoweth the thoughts, and searcheth the hearts of all men, (t) and as he pleaseth to justify and pardon humble
and penitent sinners, (u) so he abasheth and punisheth proud and haughty Hypo∣crites. 43. Confirmation.

43. Doxology. MY soul doth magnify the Lord, and my spirit hath rejoyced in God my Savi∣our, for he hath regardedLu. 1, 46 the lowliness of his servants, and hath pitied penitent Publicans; he scattereth the proud Phari∣sees in the imagination of their hearts, put∣ting down the mighty from their seat. He exalteth the humble and meek. To this im∣mortal and eternal Father be all honor and glory for evermore. Amen. 44. Contemplation. CHrist said,Mat. 20.1. The Kingdom of Heaven is like unto a man that is an houshold∣er,
who went out early in the morning to hire labourers into his Vineyard, and when he had agreed with the labourers for a peny a day, he sent them into his Vine∣yard. 44. Observation. CHrist is (Pater-familias) the great Hous∣holder of all the world, his Church (w) is his Vineyard, all men ought to be labourers, and not idle (x) loyterers in Gods Vineyard, (y) every true labour∣er shall certainly receive his wages. (z) And God doth promise, as he did to Abra∣ham,Glen, 15.2. to all his faithful servants, to be their exceeding great reward. 44. Confirmation.

44. Doxology. THou, O Lord, hast brought a vine out of Egypt, thou hast cast out the heathenPsal. 80.8, 9, 10. (with Atheists, Hereticks and Schisma∣ticks) and planted it, thou madest room for it, and when it had taken root, it filled the land, the hills were coveredMater Ecclesia, with the
shadow of it, and the boughs thereof were like the goodly Cedar-trees, she stretched forth her branches unto the sea, and her boughs unto the river. Thou, O Lord, hast a tender care of the Vineyard that thy right hand hath planted. To thee therefore be given all praise and thanksgiving for ever∣more. Amen. 45. Contemplation. AT the conversion of Zaccheus,Luke 19.10, 11, Christ proclaimed publickly, The Son of man is come to seek & to save that which is lost; and he added and spake a parable, and said, The Kingdom of God should im∣mediately appear, he said therefore, A cer∣tain Nobleman went into a far Countrey for to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return, and he called his ten servants, and delivered them ten pounds, and said unto them, Occupy till I come.
45. Observation. THe Church of God is his Treasure-house, the Word and Sacraments (b) his Treasure, all his servants are his Trea∣surers, (c) their duty is to improve their trust, to give an accompt of their time (d) and talents. Idleness, as it is the daughter of sloth, so it is the mother of shame and forrow. (e) God giveth the light of his grace to man, and man must let that light so shine, (f) that he may glorify his Father which is in heaven. 45. Confirmation.

45. Doxology. O Give thanks unto the Lord,Psa. 105.1, 2, 3. and call upon his name; tell the people what
things he hath done. O let your songs be of him, and praise him, and let your talking be of his wondrous works, for he inrich∣eth his servants with the treasure of his grace, and will fill their hearts with the glory of his Majesty. To him be given praise and thanksgiving for ever. Amen. 46. Contemplation. CHrist said, The Kingdom of heaven is likened to ten Virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the Bridegroom,Mat. 25.1.2, 3. and five of them were wise, and five of them were foolish. The foolish took their lamps, and take no oyle in them. But the wise take oyle in their ves∣sels with their lamps.
46. Observation. SOme Christians are diligent and wise, (f) others are negligent and foolish, (g) all who have lamps in their hands, have not oyl in their lamps; (h) a sleepy security in sin may shut the doors, (i) and endanger the loss of heaven, and separate foolish sin∣ners from the presence of the Bridegroom for ever.

For our Saviour Iesus is fairer then the sons of men, full of grace are his lips. God hath blessed him for ever, and he hath blessed his Spouse the Church, and made her all-glorious within. The Virgin are her fellows, and bear her company.
Therefore let us praise the Lord with joy and gladness, and worship his holy name for evermore. Amen. 47. Contemplation. OVr Lord Iesus in another parable said, that the kingdom of heaven is as a man travelling into a far Countrey, who called to him his own servants, and delivered un∣to them his goods; and to on he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, to every man according to his several ability, and straight way took his jour∣ney. 47. Observation. GOd, as a good and gracious Master, (l) calleth his servants to imployment, trusteth them with the Treasures of his grace and mercy, (m) allotting to every one a talent and proportion suitable to his abi∣lity,
(n) expecting an improvement when he cometh to reckon, and then (o) the Lord rewardeth the faithful and slothful servants according to their works. 47. Confirmation.

To him therefore, with the Father, and the Holy Ghost, be all ho∣nour and glory for ever. Amen. 48. Contemplation. AS Christ was exceeding gracious in his practical and parabolical Sermons: so was he most wonderful in his works and miracles. First, turningJohn 2.11, 1. water into wine
at a marriage at Cana in Galile, and the mo∣ther of Iesus was there, and Iesus and his Disciples were called to the marriage. 48. Observation. CHrists Sermons did inform and instruct (p) the people, but his miracles did convert them to believe, confirm them in the truth, (q) and did amaze and confound his greatest adversaries. (r) Christ, by his miracles did manifest his Fathers glory, (s) and declare to all the world his own Di∣vine Power, (t) that he was the Sonne of God. (v) 48. Confirmation.

O my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever. Amen. 49. Contemplation. AS Christ turned water into wine at the marriage in Cana: soMat. 21.12. when he came to Hierusalem, he went into the Temple of God, and cast out all them that sold and bought in the Temple, and overthrew the tables of the Money-changers, and the seats of them that sold Doves, and said, It is written, My house shall be called the house of Prayer, but ye haveMat. 21.13. made it a den of thieves.
49. Observation. SAcriledge, (w) profaness, (x) buying and selling, (y) are abominable sins and presumptious, especially in Gods House, (z) which offences Christ our Savi∣our, in great zeal and most holy passion, did detest and correct. Churches are (a) pla∣ces devoted by some pious Founder, conse∣crated for Gods-worship, and pious uses, (b) and therefore to be (c) frequented ever, and imployed with holy respects, (d) and Divine reverence.

to amaze and allure, to convince and to convert, and to confirm and com∣fort the people in the grace of faith and sal∣vation of their souls. 50. Observation. CHrist was as well the Physitian of the body, as of the soul; (f) he cured Jairus daughter, (g) the ten Iepers, (h) the Centu∣rions servant, (i) Saint Peters mother-in-law, (k) the possessed with devils, (l) Mal∣chus ear smote off by Saint Peters sword, (m) made the blind to see, (n) the lame to walk, (o) the deaf to heat, (p) Christ raised the dead to life, (q) cured all diseases and infirmities, (r) the withered hand, (s) the man sick of the palsie, (t) the poor impo∣tent creature, who had been diseased eight and thirty years, who sate at the poole of Bethesda, (t) the woman who had been troubled twelve years with a bloudy issue, (w) the man who had the dropsie, (u) at

51. Observation. CHrist was transfigured, (b) that his A∣postles might behold the splendor of his Divine Majesty, and see on earth a glimpse and beam of eternal glory. He was transfigured in his body, that (c) we might be transformed in our minds, and for ever honour and admire him, as the brightness of his Fathers glory, and the express image of his person. 51.

51. Doxology. O Lord our Governour,Psal. 8.1.4.5. how excellent is thy Name through all the world, thou hast set thy glory above the heavens, What is man that thou art mindful of him, or the son of man that thou visitest him? Thou hast been, O Lord, transfigured in thy body, that sinners might be transform∣ed to grace in their souls. Thou hast crow∣ned thy servants with glory and worship. To thee therefore, O Father, Son, and ho∣ly
Ghost be all honour and glory for ever. Amen. 52. Contemplation. AS Christ our Saviour was glorious at his transfiguration on the Mount; so was he magnanimous and couragious in the GardenIoh. 18.3. over the brook Cedron. For when Iudas, with a band of men and offi∣cers from the chief Priestes and Pharisees, came thither with lanthorns, and torches, and weapons, Christ went to them, and said, Whom seek ye? They answering, Ie∣sus of Nazareth. Iesus saith unto them, I am he, at which words, (as if they had been thunder-struck) they went backward and fell to the ground. 52. Observation. THe presence of our Saviour was terri∣ble (e) as a flash of lightning in the eies,
and his voice as a crack of thunder in the ears of the guilty officers and souldiers, who came to apprehend the Lord of life. When Christ spake, (f) their hands were feeble, (g) their feet failed, their hearts fainted, they went backward and fell to the ground. (h) 52. Confirmation.

53. Doxology. I Will always give thanks unto the Lord, his praise shall ever be in my mouth,Psal. 34.1, 2, 3. my soul shall make her boast of the Lord, the humble shall hear thereof and be glad. O prase the Lord with me, and let us mag∣nifie his name together; for as he is thunder and terrour to all his enemies, so is he the oy and comfort of all his servants, he is wisedom, righteousness, and salvation to all who call upon him faithfully. To him be given all honour and praise for ever∣more. Amen.
53. Contemplation. AS Christ with his presence, and a word from his mouth, did terrify the blou∣dy Traytor Iudas, and the savage officers and souldiers: so did he in his Doctrine most sharply rebuke and reprehend the ScribesMat. 23.33. and Pharises for their hypocrisie, cruelty, and covetousness, telling them plainly, that they were serpents, a generati∣on of vipers, and how could they escape the damnation of hell? 52. Observation. CHrist taught his Apostles and Disci∣ples (i) neither to fear the faces, (k) nor flatter the ears of mortal men; (l) the prophets were commanded to tell Iu∣dah and Israel of their sins, the Apostles di∣rected not to fear those who are only able
to kill the body. (m) It is the Preachers du∣ty to declaim against sins, to call (n) the people to repentance, and to amendment of life, and as our Saviour, rebuking the Scribes and Pharisees, to decry the sinnes of hypocrisie, pride, cruelty, covetousness, oppression, and all other impieties and ini∣quities. 53. Confirmation.

53. Doxology. O Praise the Lord who dwelleth in Si∣on,Psal. 9.11. shew the people of his doings; for he is a God of truth, sharply rebuking sins, that he might save the sinners souls. He openeth our wounds, that he may pour in the wine and oyl of his comfort and
mercy, and so heal our infirmities. There∣forePsal 9.1. will I give thanks unto thee, O Lord, with my whole heart, and praise thy name for ever and ever. Amen. 54. Contemplation. AS Christ was the teacher of truth: soe was he the great example of humility. So Saint Iohn records the History,John 1.4.5. Christ rose from suppet, and laid aside hi gar∣ments, and ook a towel, and girded him∣self, after that he poured water into a ba∣son, and began to wash his Disciples feet, and to wipe them with the towel where∣with he was girded. Then arguing and so concluding with his Disciples,John 13.14.15. If I then your Lord and Master, hav washed your feet, ye also ought to ash one anothers feet, for I have given you an example, that ye should do as I have done unto you.
45. Observation. CHrist said to Saint Thomas,Joh 14.. I am the Way, (o) the Truth, and the Life, the way and foundation whereon (p) the truth and guide (q) whereby, and the life and happiness (r) whereunto every Chri∣stian ought to walk, Christ was power∣ful in his Doctrine, (s) wonderful in his works, (t) and meek and lowly in his per∣son, (u) and by Christs example the whole Church is taught the lesson and doctrine of humility.

55. Contemplation. AS Christ in great humility vvashed his Disciples feet; so in great care and ten∣derness tovvards his Church, he ordained, and consecrated, and commanded the cele∣bration ofMat. 26.26. his last Supper, before his Death. So Sain Matthevv vvriteth, Iesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to his Disciples, and said, Take, eat, this is my body; and he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye, all of it. 55. Observation. AS Regeneration, & the spiritual birth of christians, is effected in the Sacrament (x) of Baptism; so in a communion and holy participation of the Lords Supper by faith, vve feed on the body and bloud of
christ. (y) The Sacraments are holy myste∣ries, pledges of christs love, (z) and testi∣monies of our remembrance of his Death, until he come again; ordained by Christ for our great and endless comfort. The bene∣fits are the strengthening and refreshing of our soulsChurch-catechism in the Com∣mon rayer Book. by the Body and Bloud of christ, which are verily and indeed taken and received of the faithfull in the Lord: Supper. 55.

AS Christ instituted the holy Sacraments of Baptisme and the Lords Supper: so he constituted the holy OrdersEphes. 4.11.12. and Hie∣rarchy of his Church. And he gave some Apostles, and some Prophets, and some E∣vangelists, and some Pastours and Teach∣ers, for the perfecting of the Saints, for the work of the Ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ. 56. Observation. AS God called the Patriarchs (a) before the Law, and ordained Priestes and Prophets under the (b) Law: so for the ser∣vice of the Gospel he hath, and will con∣tinue to the worlds end, a succession of ho∣ly Orders, (c) for his own honour, and
the service of his Church. And it is evident unto all men, (d) diligently reading holy Scripture, that from the Apostles time there have been these Orders of Ministers in Christs Church, Bishops, Priests, and Dea∣cons. 56.

BEfore our Saviours Death, at his Tryal, and at his bitter Passion, many circum∣stances and aggravations of shame and sor∣row, did environ and surround the inno∣cent Lamb of God, taking away the sins of the world, bearing his Fa hers wrath, the malice of Satan, and barbarous bloody cruelty of wicked and ungodly sinners. 58. Observation. THe shame and sorrowes that Christ en∣dured for mans salvation, and above all expression or apprehensio. In holy Iob's phrase, (l) Christ saith, I am afraid of
my sorrows. In King Davids prophesy, (m) The sorrows of hell did compass him about. In Ieremia Lamentations, (n) See if there be any sorrow like unto my sor∣row, wherewith the Lord hath aflcted me, in the day of his anger. In the Prophet Esaias (o) relations, he was despised and rejected of men, a man of sorrows, and ac∣quainted with grief. He hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows, we estee∣med him stricken, smitten of God, and af∣flicted. And if the sumptoms and circum∣stances of our Saviours passion be examin∣ed, they will be found to be most notori∣ous and terrible; for he was (p) betrayed by his own servant, (q) conspired against by their chief Priests and Elders, (r) sold by Iudas one of his own Apostles, (s) disco∣vred in the Treason by a kiss, (t) appe∣hended by the souldiers, (u) led away by Caiphas: (w) forsaken by his Dsciples, (x) forsworn by St. Peter, (y) bound, and o led to Pontius Pilate, z scourgd by Pilates
command, (a) crowned with thornes by the savage souldiers, cloathed in purpl, sa∣luted as a king in greater scorn, and then smitten with their hands. (b) Those bloud-thirsty Tygres put a reed in our Saviours hand, then bowed the knees and mocked (c) him, and then they spit upon him, take the reed out of his hand, and more him on the head. 57.

AS before our Saviours Death, and in our Saviours Passion; So at his Death and Crucifixion many signes and wonders were seen, and the most bitter and bloody proceedings of his merciless enemies are re∣corded
in holy Scriptures, how Christ suf∣fered and died on the Cross. 58. Observation. CHrist was crucified, that his servants (d) might be crowned; endured an igno∣minious death, (e) that Christians might live gloriously for ever? The circumstances of time and place, the manner and nature of his Death, his executioners and compa∣nions, doe highly justify our Saviours pati∣ence, humility, and charity, and most cleer∣ly aggravate the envy, covetousness, and malice of wicked men and Devils. He was led to Golgotha, as a place for his Executi∣on. (f) A strange Potion, a mixture of Vi∣negar and Gall is ministred unto him. (g) The rude souldiers part his garments, and cast lots for them. (h) In jealousies and sus∣picions they watched him when he was nailed to the Cross. (i) They fixed an ac∣cusation over his head. (k) Two thieves
were crucified with him. (l) The passen∣gers and spectators ailed and reviled him. (m) From the sixth hour to the ninth was darkness over the land. (n) At the ninth hour Christ cried with a loud voice, My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me. (o) When he had cried again with a loud voice, he gave up the Ghost. 59. Confirmation.

59. Doxology. O Most blessed Lord and Saviour Iesu, who wast obedient to the Death,Phil. .8. even to the ignominious and accursed death of the Cross, and didst there make poor sinners peace, by the effusion of thy most precious bloud, blotting out the band-writing of Ordinances that was a∣gainst us,Colos. 2.14 and nailing it unto thy Cross, that penitent sinners might be saved, and
crowned with immortal blessings. To thee O blessed Saviour, for thy great sufferings, ad our salvation, be ascribed, with the Father, and the holy Ghost, all praise and dominion, and thanksgiving, ever. A∣men. 60. Contemplation. AS before, and at our Saviours Death, many strange and wonderfull effects did manifestly appear; so after his innocent and bitter Death, more and more strange miracles did succeed, to set forth and evi∣dence, that Christ,Te Deum Apost. Athan. Nicen. Creed. who suffered on the Cross, was the immortal seed, and the eter∣nal Son of God. 60. Observation. WHen Iesus had yielded up the Ghost, immediately after his Death the vail
of the TempleMat. 27 51. vvas rent in tvvain from the top to the bottom, (q) the earth did quake and tremble, (r) and the rocks rent, (s) the Centurion (vvho commanded the guards) vvas amazed, and confessed, saying, Certainley, this vvas a Righteous Man. (t) And again, as Saint Mark relates, (u) Truly this man vvas the Son of God. And all the people that came together to that sight, be∣holding the things that vvere done, smote their breasts, and returned. (w) Thus Hea∣ven and earth did bear (x) vvitnesse, and seem to sympathize, and groane, and trem∣ble, vvhen the Son of God had suffered, that the enemies of the Crosse of Christ might be confounded and terrified, if not con∣verted. 60.

In passione ergo Domini Salvatoris, velum quod erat à fris, canscissum est à sursum usque der∣sum, ut ab initio mundi usque ad finem, conscisso ve∣lamine, mysteria publicentur que usque ad adventum Domini rationabiliter fuerunt occultata, Origen.

60. Doxology. LEt heaven and earth praise the Lord,Psa. 148.2. Angels and men let them and all crea∣tures give thanks unto God, for the great blessings that the whole world hath recei∣ved by our Saviours bitter Death and Passi∣on. Let all the sons of men fear and trem∣ble, smite their breasts, and humble their souls at the sight of their own sins, and our blessed Saviour Iesus sufferings, and for our salvation by his Death. Let us give him praise and glory for evermore. Amen. 61. Contemplation. AS many notable signes and wonders attended before, at, and after the death
of Christ: so these which follow seem more remarkable, and therefore preserved and placed as Articles of our Creed, that Christ after his Death was buried, that he descended into hell, that he rose again the third day, that he ascended into Heaven, that he sitteth on the right hand of God, and from thence shall come to judge the quick and the dead. 61. Observation. THe Scriptures are the Treasure-houses (x) of the riches of Heaven, and the Church, our Mother, (y) dispenseth by her faithful sons and servauts, the treasure and riches of Gods grace and mercies in the merits of Christ to repenting and believing Christians, in the ministration (z) of the holy Word and Sacraments, wherein they are taught (a) the truth of Christs Burial, and his descension into Hell, (b) the certain∣ty of his Resurrection, and how then the
graves were opened, and many bodies (c) of Saints which slept arose, (d) the confir∣mation of his Ascension into heaven (e) in the presence of his Apostles, and the holy Angels, (f) the glory of his Session at Gods right hand, (g) and the final expectation of Christs coming to Iudgement.
