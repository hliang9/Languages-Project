‚ùßA Newe Secte of Friars called Capichini. These newe freshecome Friars being sprong vp of late, doe nowe within Andwarpe keepe their abidinge: Seducinge muche people to their damned estate, by their newe false founde doctrine the Gospel deridinge. Sayinge and affirminge, which is no newe false tidinge, that all suche as doe the Popes doctrine dispise: As damned soules to hell muste be ridinge. For they doe condemne them with their newe found lie, These be the children of the worlde counted wise: whose wisedome is folly to God and his elect. But let Sathan worke all that he can deuise, God it is alone which the Gospel doeth protect.
