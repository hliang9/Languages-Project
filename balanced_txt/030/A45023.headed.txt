An Humble Motion To The PARLIAMENT Of ENGLAND Concerning The ADVANCEMENT of Learning: And Reformation of the Universities. By J. H. LONDON, Printed for John Walker, at the Starre in Popes-Head-Alley. MDC IL.
TO THE PARLIAMENT. IT hath been the usuall method of that E∣ternall Wisdome in the pursuance of any of his high Designes, to render his Instru∣ments, while they continued faithfully use∣full, full of honour and successe: But when they once began either to stand still, or look back; to de∣cline that honour which he had formerly cast upon them, and to wrap it up in a cloud of forgetfulnesse and misery; and then raise up such other means, which though to the eye of Reason they might appeare con∣temptible, should carry on his great worke to a just pe∣riod, and make a full assertion of his glory, in despite of all the wicked cunning and resolution of men and the deepest Theorems of contrary policy.
That this Assertion is neither vain nor new, I need not call in the Aids of any remoter Histories, if I appeale from the walls where you now sit in counsell, to the eyes wherewith you now see, you will finde as strange and as noble an assertion of this Thesis, as was ever be∣held by any Age or Nation. For whereas at first you met together by the conduct of a strong Provi∣dence (which in spight of all opposition and backward∣nesse of these times and powers assembled you toge∣ther) and begun more seriously and couragiously to weigh what a heavy trust lay upon your shoulders; such of you who were early labourers, cannot but with joy remember through what pangs and throws you were delivered of the first attempt of Freedome; when that great Bugbear of a continuall and shining power (which though it endeavoured to seem a great light of it selfe, yet was onely an opake dense body, and had no other splendour but the reflection of yours) hung back, nay was possessed against you, when some ill-behold on to their education had not shaken off those prejudices which commonly attend men that judge according to their first thoughts; and others who could not but make a right judgement of things▪ being either byassed by in∣terest, or poysoned with hopes, grew cold toward you; what a labour was it to make one head, (which had it followed the Law, might have as much obliged the Na∣tion as any whatsoever) an oblation to a betrayed and oppressed people? Nay when that was done, and an Army not of our owne Nation, with excessive care and charge removed; how were you encumbred by a violent and sturdy humour, which would not suffer you to make use of those little advantages of liberty which you had
lready gained, but assayed to returne you under the ormer, if not a severer Tyranny. But the counsels of men were abortive, and you were reserved for greater matters, that humour burst forth like an Impostume, and went out from you, which had it continued within, and not professed open hostility, had been dangerous, if not fatall. But when you were ce left to your selves, you had power to act more vi∣rously, and by a happy Antiperistasis to grow more intense; so being closely united in the Centre, you bravely brake through that stiffe circumference that beset you, and were made the Masters of many happy and signall Victories. Yet those Victories seemed notwithstanding to carry  ate with them; for whereas your excessive lenity had permitted some of your conquered enemies to lodge a∣midst you, they scattered such a quicke and powerfull contagion among those whom you represent, and espe∣cially the chiefe City, that there were apparent symp∣tomes of a relapse, which was shortly followed by such a dangerous sicknesse, that if you had not been miracu∣lously aided with an almost immediate hand of Provi∣dence, you had never overcome, and yet you suddenly, and ere your selves could imagine, wrastled out of it. But when your Victories were redoubled with these successes, there wanted not some who sate in counsell mong you, who to say no worse, either durst not, or would not be couragious in following those opportu∣nities wherewith Providence courted you; nay they to retarded you by cunning crosse debates, that your tter peace seemed far more dangerous to you, then ther of your former wars, you standing strugling with
this oppressive humour, and not discovering any signs of motion, unlesse it were of Retrogradation; whilst you enabled your conquered enemy to give you what was already yours, and stroke you with such concessi∣ons, as you had far more reason to dread, then any of his former Proclamations or menaces. But how soon were all these corrupt counsellours purged from among you, and dis-inabled for to disperse any of their infection? whilst you being loosed from those charmes wherewith you before were maleficiat▪ began to act powerfully and smartly, and indeed performed more in a few months, then you had done before in twice as many yeares, or your Ancestour could doe in the double number of Centuries. I mention this with no other designe, then for you glory (for you have cleared our liberties, and set them now on the right Base, having by a transcendent com∣prehensive peece of Justice, removed the common op∣pressour) and also to tell you, that unlesse you doe no also not rest here, but even run forward to the end o that course to which the divine will shall by apparen signes direct you, the worke will be taken out of you hands and put into others, who finishing it with the li and constancy which you ought to have done, must ex∣pect that reward and honour which waited on you. I say not thus much that either I feare it in you, o that I can gather any even remote causes of feare, b that I would from it say, that unlesse you doe absolutel alter the complexion and temper of the Commo wealth, and endeavour to your utmost to provide th best means to preserve it in the best constitution fo the future; all that which you have hitherto done fo us, will prove nothing, if not evill.
Now by what means this may be effected, I have nei∣her vanity nor impudence enough to direct you, espe∣cially since you seem to the exactest judgement of man, o be as happy in re-erecting, as you were fortunate in ling down, and to take such a course both in matters e, Civill, and Military, as may, as much as possible  or render abortive all the machinations of future chefe, and avoid those errours and imperfections ich cannot be exempted from humane Lawes. But et (as here you must bee acknowledged for res∣ing that liberty which warrants this freedome) all ese cares, which are so pious, so noble, so worthy of ch Lawgivers, will be found neither intense nor large ough, if ye remit one grand consideration which must fuse it selfe through all, and knit them together; ay bestow on them both form and vigour: The most effectualll advancement, I meane, not the bare permissive opagation of Learning. Somewhat you have done in this kinde, but how uch to this purpose I cannot judge; for besides that it ached no further then Politicall aimes, it removed any persons of a more thriving and consistent growth  learning, then it either left there, or planted in their eads; it medled not at all with a view or reformation of ose fundamental constitutions, on whose happy on ak designations▪ the interest and prosperity, the decay d ruin of such litterary Republicks principally depends,  we shall shortly finde opportunity to demonstrate. But the wishes of the most knowing and best men are  far above these ender performances; they professe nd I do but now make their sighings Articulat) that e body of learning lyes scattered in as many peeces as
ever Medea cut her little Brother into, and that they are as hard to finde and re-unite as his was. That there is no publick encouragement given to these gallant in∣dustries that endeavour to gather them up, and as much as may be, recompose them: That we seem insensible of that great Genius which animates and conducts this present Age, and therefore sleight the discovery of that in particular persons, who being many times big with Heroick designes, perish for want of assistance in the de∣livery; or in case they be delivered, are found to have wasted themselves in the production of a weak or a∣bortive infant, which otherwise might have been strong and goodly: whereas men if they would but se themselves to awaite and receive every glimpse and dawning of knowledge (or at least cherish those that would doe so) would finde it easie to bring it into a just and beautifull body, and make an happy inversion of that common saying, That our Ancients were Gyants and we are Dwarfs. And whereas some of the Heathe wise men could say, That those were the best personage that liv'd nearer, and lesse remoter from the Age of th gods: we might contrarily by experience finde, tha we had made up the decayes of Humanity, and inforce bake time into its first happy and lusty circle. For if we looke into the life of man, take him in th bare naked condition, in which Nature thrust him upon earth, what a miserable helplesse thing shall we find him? miserabler in this then the bruits themselves, wh having at the most (though this also be denied with a good reason as granted them) the use of a dim an darke reason, or rather sense, and that in a direct line cannot be judges of their condition, and therefore con∣sequently
want the greatest ingredient of misery, the sense of it; man is betrayed by his reason, (which cannot be smothered in him, but that there wil be some sparks and embers still alive) to a discerning of his sufferings and some rude and unpolished wishes of a better condi∣tion; which if he can ever get into, it is meerly by the collision of his naturall faculties, which strike out some small sparkes to kindle that fuell: so that he being in a manner in the condition of a Beast, hath no other way to exempt himselfe from that misery and slavery, but that little knowledge which chance, or the darke Axi∣omes of his owne reason can helpe him with. And if againe we consider men gathering into the Primitive societies, and assisting each other with their mutuall endeavours and observations, we shall finde that they come nearer civill Societies, by how much they have made greater inroads into experience, and were better versed in the acts of life. Nay, how willing have they been to congratulate, yea Idolatrze some of them, and put them into the lists of their gods, (as wee may see out of the ruines of some Histories which time hath not yet eaten up) for some little inventions, which are at this day so common with us, that they seem to be among the postulated principles of nature, and to be borne with us; so that these men who were ignorant of knowledge, and pos∣sibly would have sleighted it, if it had been offered to hem in its owne lustre; yet did live, subsist, and were ivilized by it. But if we make a step further, and looke upon Com∣monwealths, how easie will it be to observe, that as they flourished under the verdure, so have they withe∣red
under the decay of Learning. Nor have they been so fortunate under any governours as those who com∣ming from a noble education, and a right observation and deduction of things (which may well make a man learned, though he never had seen a book) were neither subject to these wilde eations, nor savage rudenesses which untutored Natures, through the want of a better discipline, were apt to fall into. Nay, if we looke somewhat more narrowly into them, we may see that many private men born amidst the dregs of the people, & not capable of any such high hopes, have by this means far overtopped men of anti∣quity and ancient discent, and outvyed them with une∣quall services; whether by way of prevention, as old Ap∣pius a man wholly unacquainted with any systematicall knowledge, in disswading the Romans from an incon∣siderate peace they were about to shuffle up with Pyr∣rhus; or conservation, as that excellent reigne of Au∣gustus, one, who though his Cradle was not private, yet in his first accesse to businesse, was not onely left in a private capacity, but surrounded by an inimicall faction: or if we look on augmentation what an illu∣strious time had Rome under Trajan, though a Spaniard, that shee seemed to renew her age, and spread the wings of her Eagle, where they could never have ho∣ped to reach in her first period of greatnesse, which eve after his dayes fell into a sensible and graduall weak∣nesse: not to note Epaminondas that god-like Theban▪ who owed all his orient vertues to the light of the Schooles, with whom (though he came from a vulgar wombe) the greatnesse of his Country (as Plutarch ob∣serves) di shoot up and fade.
But if we would goe no further than the ornaments and outward splendour of a place, what was it distin∣guished all the Pallaces in Rome and Neroes golden house from the Sabin cottages, or the dwelling of Publicola? or the Imagery of Greece and Statues of Corinth, from the first rude shapes of unpollished oake, but curiosity and art; which yet notwithstanding had been vainly hoped, if there had not been a concurrent humour of men to entertaine and foster it; and this humour hath been so fortunate to them, that notwithstanding time hath defaced all the bounds of the Roman conquests, and left them as invisible and inobservable, as the flight of any bird that flew yesterday, yet in a few stones and Medalls (not to mention the monuments of her intel∣lectuall greatnesse) she hath left us such prints and mea∣sures, that we may justly trace and compute her (as he did the Giants bulke by his thumbe) in her vast and stu∣pendous symmetry: whilst other Countries more re∣mote from this greatnesse & happinesse that have not so much as their ruines left them to vindicate them from ables, and to testifie that they once were, live not∣withstanding in all learned mouths, & that from the in∣terest perhaps of oe Citizen, whose merits hath made him a part of posterity, and enabled him to a noble gratitude to his Country, in rescuing her from the do∣tage and Tyranny of Time. And indeed without let∣ters, and consequently the preservation and encourage∣ment of them, to what a darknesse and mist should we be confined, and in what a shadow should we live, a darknesse worse then that of Plato his cave, when our children, or childrens children, should be to seek for what we know to day, & no observation be left to man∣kinde
(for traditions must needs be in a few hands and soone corrupt) to shorten the long journey of know∣ledge, and to bring it nearer an end: As we may see by one example: The best man upon earth, and the one∣ly more than man, spake and did so many things as all the Volumnes in the world could scarce containe (as one of his own Penmen witnesses of him) and yet there is no more memory of them preserved amongst us, then what is left in a very few sheets, not at all to mention that Question, whether all the integrall parts of that divine Book were preserved or no. Certaine we are what a great losse we have in humane stories, and what a large measure of Time, was either not described by them, or not now to be found, so that in a Trichotomy of Time made by the learnedst Roman sixteen hundred years since, there was one part unknowne, and the other fabulous; and yet sure we cannot but beleeve, but that before mankinde had gleaned up some litterature, and was softened and polished by it, there were abundance of examples of either forti∣tude, and many invincibe Heroes before Achilles, whose Trophees are buried with them, and Triumphs forgot as if they had never been seen, whilst those others that remaine, must be accounted just such with us as the fa∣vour or envy of Poets and Historians are pleased to make and represent them, so vast is the Preroga∣tive of letters, that they can dispense not onely life, but estimation and glory unto whom they please, and com∣mand the reputation of past, and the beleefe of present and future ages. But to advance knowledge to its highest and truest end, how necessary and subservient will it be to that
great designe of Religion, which without an immedi∣ate concourse and favour of Providence, can scarce ei∣ther subsist without it, or preserve it selfe untainted with grosse errours, or distempered imaginations; how serviceable may it be to many sublime mindes and re∣fined understandings, that calling all things to an exact Test of reason, wil not be brought to the acknowledge∣ment of their Maker, or the Truth of what is left con∣cerning him; if they be not guided by forcible demon∣strations and porismaticall inferences of nature, which may not precariously, but irresistibly infer a Deity; and strong and naturall inductions of Reason: without which, such mindes are but in vaine attempted, and difficultly overcome: Or to goe further; how shall we ever be sensible of the excellency and power of that divine Book, which Gods owne finger hath wrote and left us; if wee want ability and eyes to looke upon the fulnesse and order of those Treasures; Man indeed who is a determinate narrow thing, must necessarily confine his thoughts to one subject, and when he thinkes of one thing, of necessity desists thinking of another. But God who is such a free infi∣nity, can with one intuitive knowledge see all things, and is the centre in every part of his circle. And there∣fore what he writes must needs be as universall as his owne Spirit, and at one time communicate many knowledges; whereas man can onely write of this or that, and therefore it is unprofitable industry, not to  undertaken without due assistances to attempt the search of that Book, which like himself, hath an infinity and immensity of knowledge in it. Not to speake of the forme of it, which being writ in Tongues much
removed from this place and age, and that surely with all height of Elegance and fulnesse of expression; tis not to be hoped for that any Translations can come up to it, but that there must be abundance of exquisite know∣ledge smothered up in the Originall. Which though it hath been studied and pursued, by numerous exalted wits, & unwearied undertakers; yet we know that there are abundance of ripe notions left to be found out by future and latter endeavours, which shall never think to want a Crown from this attempt, till this earth burn i her funerall Pile, and we shall see all knowledge not in  mist, but in a myrrour, and view the centre, the spring▪ the root, the life of it face to face. Nor can I see what ca more heighten or beautifie this best Science, then the regaining those Trophees from the Heathens which they stole from us, who, though they knew not how to use, yet triumphed in them: For all their glimmering notions, were but lighted at our candle, although they obscured and disguised them with false lights; yet b that light did they shine to themselves and after ages▪ who cannot but looke up with reverence at their ad∣vanced Natures, and wish they had been heightened b a more noble principle, which had crowned all the various Sciences with the principall Science, and in the brave strayings after Truth, helpt them to better fo¦tune than onely to meet with her handmaids, and kep them from the fate of Ulisses, who wandring throug Hel, met all the ghosts, yet could not see the Queen. B there is a strange Magneticall attraction in knowledg which plucks and draws the soule towards it, which  just so much nearer its due repose, by how much it fal nearer to this centre; And indeed it were a pity, that th
great Princesse of it should be lesse adorned, then some of her subjects; and that she who is all glorious within, should want her garments of wrought gold and needlework, and not as well make her selfe glorious in the spoyles of her enemies, as the Israelites steal away jewells from the Egyptians, or Solomon fetch gold from Ophir to adorn the Temple. I wish it were in my power, and your patience (most Noble Senators) rather to view this intention, in its many large particularities, then to propose it thus dead coloured in a generall draught, which can like a Mer∣cury on the way, onely point but goe no further; But truly tis enough for me a person, (hid in obscurity and neglected into retirement) to make good wishes and breath after these huge attempts, which I hope the sublime disposer of all humane affaires, will as well put into your hearts, as he hath put into your hands to ac∣complish. You have done great things for us, and equall to what hath been done in any Nation, either stoutly or fortunately. And if you will but now make good our hopes in this one thing, you will put an end to all our wishes, and settle us in a condition which will somewhat resemble that eternall fruition which we all breath after, a time of prayses. And indeed, if you were men that onely looked up∣on your selves, and studied no further then the propa∣gation of your owne fame and interest. What better means have you to confute all the scandalls and impu∣tations of your deadly adversaries, who have not spa∣red to speake you worse then Goths and Vandalls, and the utter destroyers of all Civility and Literature, then by seriously composing your selves to the designe of
cherishing of either. What directer caus-way could you finde to the aggrandization of your owne glory, then entertaining the celebrated care of so ma∣ny Kings, the onely splendour of so many Republicks, the life and lustre of so many Ages? That which is cer∣taine to make all brave men for the future, your admi∣rers and followers, and to distinguish your Government from theirs, who being hurried by Confusion and Bar∣barisme, shall hereafter vanish into eternall forgetful∣nesse. What better way to your profit, then to com∣mand abundance of fruitfull wits, which shall every day bud forth with some invention, serviceable either to the necessities of the poore, or graver magnificence of the rich? when mechanicall knowledge shall be mul∣tiplied and abbreviated, and you be able not onely to requite forreigne parts for the curiosities they have lent you; but also invite them hither to be your schol∣lers, when there shall be a confluence of the finest in∣dustries among you, and he shall be accounted to want of due civill Accomplishments, that hath not come to perfect them from this place. How serviceable will it be to you when you over∣flow with retired sagacities and raised industries, whom you may either for Gowne or Sword by land or sea employ upon all occasions; when you shall not need to put people in the places of greatest trust by reason of their Titular borrowed Gayety, but make use of such persons, as shall discover the greatest luxury and efflorescency of Vertue; Such persons who may suc∣ceed you in the seats where you now sit, (and may it be a fortunate Omen) exceed and outstrip your glories, such persons, which shall preserve us in a blessed peace;
herein yet there shall be neither sloath nor luxury, d either enlarge our Territories with wide forraigne quests, or else pull downe those powers which are ow the hate and burdens of the face of the earth. But you that are men of sublime mindes, that have rried you beyond all the doubts and objections of flesh and blood, above the extent of your owne designs,  almost the latitude of your owne wishes, beyond the dictates of common Law and reason, will not give over while there remains so great a worke. That God who is abstract wisdome, and delights that his rationall creatures should search after it, and that his Ministers should study to propagate it, will expect that you should be Foster-fathers of knowledge. He may punish your naturall children with stupidity or ignorance, if you doe not take the day while it is yours, to lead them into the paths and Mazes of Science. And will he, think you, forgive you (you being Fathers of the Publicke∣wale) if you forget those that are your children in that relation? He cannot surely; he that is just will expect from you the discharge of your duties, which how it can be without a compleat taking care of your charge your best selves can best consider. But certainly it is none of the probablest wayes to bring a people into a little shape of liberty, and free their estates, from some small inconsiderable burdens, and leave the better part of them, their mindes, no re enlightned, no more tutoured, no more bur∣ed, than you at first found them. By this time some may object, to what end I presse all this. Have not wee Universities as famous as any under Heaven? Is there not provision in this case
enough? Have not our Ancestours been liberall be∣yond any of Europe? will we violate their wills? dis∣compose the present frame, before we be ascertained what other to set up? beside running the Common∣wealth into an unnecessary charge, and that for an un∣necessary end, and in a time unfit, if not contrarian to these designes, and that for an Idaea? Beleeve me these are pretty Objections, and till the be confuted, very probable; but I beleeve well look into, they will according to the usuall ingenuity  Truth, prove both to conduce to, and further this in▪ tention, and also to demonstrate unto you, that the thi it selfe is so easie and feasible, that your selves canno without imputation of a grosse neglect, and ugly dis∣care of the Publick, avoid this consideration. Tis true that our Universities for outward Magni∣sicence, and a large, if not luxurious liberality, are equal if not superiour to any of those that we yet know of  the lettered part of the world. They are venerable so their antiquity, and have a long time thriven under th indulgency of the past ages, & been ennobled by the p¦duction of many rare and divine personages, who ha made more illustrious the whole Nation. But wheth in generall their Statutes be so exact and refined,  may satisfie the need and curiosity of this exalted ag or that our Accademies at the present teach either al or the gallantest Theories of knowledge, will be see anon. And that being once made evident, it will no be hard to inferre, that other Universities of a late standing and poorer subsistance, have both in extent o knowledge, and multiplicity of excellent persons, be able to equall, if not out-doe them. Nay that tho
present Revenues whereupon they now ureit, have hoaked abundance of active Industries▪ nay beene a meanes to thrust into Ecclesiasticall or Litterary offices  many of persons, who had they been suffered to obey their owne inclinations, and followed some Trade or Handicraft, might have ranked themselves amongst the ablest of their Profession; Whilst others who had oules more towardly and capable, were by such rones as these kept out of the Hives, and either for∣d to seek their food from afar, or else sit downe (un∣lesse provided for by their Parents) with no other gaine by their Philosophy and Reason, then a few Soicall sentences in the contempt of wealth, and the commendations of poverty. Now that there is provision enough, we shall both grant, and by it take occasion to insinuate, that the State need not multiply any of her expences in pur∣ance of this wish. All our suit is, that these endow∣ments, and pious liberality, may be converted into uses table to the ends of the Donors, and tend rather to a publicke advantage, then to the private fostering of  many idle Pedantick Brotherhoods. It now lies like cke, and possibly is noysome to the place where it ▪ but spread it abroad, it will manure all the Land, and returne the increase of an unvaluable and happy har∣st. There is none requires it to another use, but one∣ to a better use, and in the end it can be no more rob∣y, then tis sacriledge to rescue a Temple from the superstition wherewith it was defiled, to the use of a er and more illuminated Religion. I must needs confesse, (and I speake it with a deale of Religion to the memory of them that are gone before
us,) that among the many good examples they have left to this Nation, their liberality, if not profusenesse, in things of this nature hath not been the least. But then I beseech you, Honourable Worthies, consider in what times they lived; they were darke, befe with mists of ignorance and superstition, and they could onely direct their charity that way so far as they knew it best. Their Ordinances and cautions, were, no doubt in their times, full of excellent wisdome and deep reason. But since they ceased to be mortall, it hath pleased the Son of Righteousnesse to breake through the clouds which shadowed their ages, and to let u have more of day. And as the Sun here below doth not onely in his rescuing the light, discover himselfe▪ but also guilds and discloses all about him; so that eter∣nall Sun, when he opens himselfe, opens at the same time all humane and inferiour knowledge, which  still more or lesse visible, as his rayes shine on it, o withdraw from it. Now he having every day made greater appearances of himselfe; humane learnin hath also been more enlightned; and he is not acquain¦ted with the Businesse of knowledge, that knows no what sensible increases (I had almost said perfections it hath of late arrived to. So that what means was used before to preserve it from perishing, and to pro¦pagate it, must now be used for augmentation, an splendor. What means were used to keep it in a few hands in a corner (like a great exile, thrust away by contrary power) till some better times, must now b used to disperse it through the face of the earth, and t make it tread as far as mankinde. What meanes we used before, for a bare historicall knowledge, mu
ow be turned into a censorious justice upon ov'r old opinions, and into severe and eager disquisitions of new truths; for knowledge hath no limits nor Land-marks but being ubiquitary, and therefore desirous to diffuse it selfe, she endeavours by all means her promotion and di∣ltation. Nor doth she ever meet with any that would enlarge her Empire, but shee ambitiously encourages them, and willingly crownes them. Now for any one to thinke, that one and the same meanes are to be used to preserve a State, either new curdled and moulded into forme, or else by outward violence retired to its last seat and almost first principles, and the same state when it hath overcome either its infancy or misery, and like a wakened Gyant begins to rowze it selfe up, and looke where it may conquer, is utterly unvers'd in the affaires of the world, and below instruction. And doubtlesse, upon these considerations, were it possible that these happy soules could either returne ither, or were it suitable to their blessednesse to minde things that are done under the Moone, they could not but joyne with any that would undertake to serve them in so pious an ingagement, as to make their contributions more excellently serviceable to the ends they purposed. And therefore we cannot thinke it any more violation to their will, at all to advance their provisions to their owne ends by better wayes, then e thinke that you (Noble Senators) are parracides to your Country in rescinding those Lawes which your Predecessors made, yet through length of time, and pine of those in whose care they lay, began contrary  their first intention, rather to oppresse, then defend and releeve us. For so long as humane reason is weake
and imperfect, it can never provide any Lawes against all circumstances of chance, length of time, fraud and weaknesse of mankinde, but it will bring forth a ne∣cessity to repeale them, equall, if not superiour to that which first enacted them. For discomposition of the present frame, may not, I pray this be a Topicke for any Government, though never so ill grounded, never so irregular, or never so Tyrannicall? Should we sit still, and expect that those in whose hands it is, should quietly resigne it, or new mould it themselves, or some fine chance should do i to our hands? or should we not out of this very rea¦son, if our houses were all untiled and obvious to all in¦juries of the weather, forbeare to pull them down o mend them, because we would make no alteration, and so continue in our miserable patience, because we feare a change and some trouble; like Aesops Plowma crying to Jupiter, to helpe our cart out of the mire, an we never put to a hand? or should we expect tha some Deity, or unthought of influence would rescu us from these inconveniences which we saw, but would not remove? I am afraid whether any can be serious upon this question: For as happinesse is the reward o courage and industry; so what ever people ever yet ob¦tained any Reformation without sweat or wounds, an a just violence to the over-ruling power; just I say though it clashed with the letter of some Positive La for with the Fundamentall and true ends of govern¦ment it could not. But there is no need in this ca to urge this so hard to you, who so nobly bra through this objection, and redeemed the supreme power, which being now so indisputable in your hands
this wish requires no more of you then the exercising  it, wherein you will onely finde opposition from those who have endeavoured to blast, and yet continue a will to defeat and maligne your best actions. Nay, and  hope you will give me leave to mention it for your Honours) we are encouraged rather to presse this from your owne example of magnanimity, and zeale  whipping those high Priests, and buyers and sellers t of our Temple, and that when your power was  umbrage, that now you will (when it hath obtai∣ned its just light and fulnesse) employ it on so easie a take, as this last peece of Reformation; which will balme your memories, and leave almost nothing to your Successours to doe piously or justly. That this e of time may not be capable of such a noble al∣teration, I am not afraid from the best comparison and recollection of times and reasons, not onely to ny, but even to evince the contrary. For what more seasonable opportunity can we have, then that we see the highest spirits, pregnant with great mat∣ters, and in despite of these Tumults and Troubles which inviron them of every side, labouring with somewhat, the greatnesse of which they themselves cannot tell, and with a wonderfull deale of courage, attempting the discovery of a new world of know∣ledge? These bodings cannot be of nothing, but upon  arrower recognition will appeare full of miracle, which amounts with me to no lesse then the chasing away of shadows before the breake of the great day. d surely, that begins a fuller manifestation of him∣selfe, suffers us to approach him by these degrees, and therefore hath diffused a great and a restlesse Genius
in this age, far greater then any hath been of a long time. And as Astrologers say, that there are at some certaine times some powerfull influences showred by the conjunction or positure of some Planets, which if they be not received and magically applied at that very time, do immediately passe away, and become ineffectuall, and are not to be expected againe, till af∣ter many ages; so any tract of time, when it meets a sublime and elevated spirit to assist and guide it, can∣not certainly withot disadvantage and losse, refuse to entertaine it; nay they cannot be so stupid, as not to thinke both that the time is unregainable, and that a judgement awaits them for being so bold as to resis the discoveries of it. But I cannot thinke so ill of these men among whom I was borne, that they will shut their eyes against this light that breaks so brightly and glistringly in upon them, and be lethar∣gically content to please themselves with the reverend follies and dreams of their forefathers. Tis no matter what some frozen Sadduces, or some others of a worse name if there be any, can scoffe▪ that it is folly to entertaine any such vaine imagina∣tions, and madnesse to prosecute them: Tis folly will prove the happiest wisdome, and no more a deviation of the understanding, then the entertaining a new na∣turall exact scheame of heaven, and nature, in lieu of the old broken interfering Hypotheses, which rely on no other probability but a sent of sense, distorted by education, and brawned by custome. Tis no matter, what some purblinde Polititians, or sneaking worldlings talke of the difficulty of times, and say, that these soft aires of peace, cannot be heard
midst the loud musicke of Warre, and that mens thoughts, are too much broken and harrassed to fall pon these things, which must be the fruits of the eepest and most silent leasure, You have the highest destiny favouring your designes, put an end to all ch Tumults; and we have now no more of War then  necessary to the preservation of our peace, which ems to smile on us againe, and promise us, that she ill not flye away, for fear lest her snowy▪ garments ould be stayned in blood. But put the case that your Enemy were as visible d powerfull as ever, yet I dare be knowne to thinke, at it were much more honourable for you to assume ese thoughts: nay that they both were not consistent together. What can you imagine to doe re worthy of memory, or imitation, then in the dst of your most urgent dangers to lay a modell, and w the lines of happinesse and security for all poste∣y? How can you better demonstrate your selves rlesse and hearty, in what you goe about, then by wing such a severity and composition of spirit; nay h a contrary neglect of what opposition is set be∣e you, as to minde those vast designes of litterall gnificence, or further acquisition? What more ning in all the Annalls of Rome, then the porten∣us bravery of sending Forces into Spaine, when nniball was at the Gates, and selling that field ereon he en camped at so deare a rate, as it would e passed at, had he been prisoner within the walls, d his Army dispersed? yea (and to shew that these er times want not parallels of the Ancient Gran∣rs) what will be more illustrious in the History of
Holland, then their high and visible cares, and al prodigall magnificence for learning, while as they y strugled with a sad war, and had not yet released the necks, from the sway of a peridious and horrid Ty∣rant? For the people whom you are to care for, it can not be but that peace might have softened and ema∣culated them, whereas their calamities have brought them into a better agility and constitution, to promo their excellent desires to liberty in any thing which they may conceive really conducible; and there is n cause to doubt, but they will facilly be swayed  that power under whose valorous conduct they  asserted themselves from all impressions and marks  dishonour and slavery, which usurpation, iniquity  time, or forreigne force had put upon them. It cannot be denied, but by the invaluable losse  bloud and Treasure, the body of this Nation is be∣come thin and leane, and therefore he were a Vi that would offer to gnaw or suck it any more (for  farther pressure, be it never so little is now excessi and therefore it would be but just to wave a Pet i for any publicke contribution (though possibly the hath been some liberality exercised to worse e which had it been directed this way, might have  qualled any of the ancient magnificencies and hono able profusenesses upon learning) although if y were urged to some small liberality, or rather p vented any suit for it, it would be a huge further a to what is desired of you, yet we onely beg; nay o jure you by all that is deare to you, or desired you, that you will imploy this which you finde
ady left to your hands, and doe these things with∣out any charge, and onely lend us your Authority, to oe this longed for worke; and no doubt if you can∣not, or will not lend any fewell to it, God will stir  the hearts of many private persons, and inflame em with equall intentions, and make their hands ing it in in a full measure. And now that which remaines of me to doe (for I nceive I have quitted my selfe of the Objections, d therefore may dismisse them) will be a triple ske. First, to shew how farre the state of our Uni∣rsities needs a reformation. Secondly, how it may  brought about: And thirdly, I shall particularize me ends which I have transiently before glanced at, t as ends, but as fruits and enjoyments of your ble piety. And herein I shall the rather be short, cause these being at the most, but the best sort of wishes, I shall observe that course which the best en do in their devotions, to pray for the best things ey can, yet not limit the power they pray to, to ch or such a way of granting their requests, as being olved by what meanes soever it comes, to receive it earfully, and knowing that power which they ad∣esse themselves unto, cannot onely doe it in a bet∣r manner then they can thinke of, but in a fuller. For the first: I could never yet make so bad an Idaea  a true University, as that it should serve for no bler end, then to nurture a few raw striplings, come t of some miserable Country-school, with a few eds of Latine, that is as immusicall to a polite ear as e gruntling of a Sow, or the noise of a Saw can be  one that is acquainted with the Laws of harmony.
And then possibly before they have survayed th Greeke Alphabet, to be racked and tortured with  sort of harsh abstracted logicall notions, which their wits are no more able to endure, then their bodies the Strapado, and to be delivered over to a jejune barr Peripatetick Philosophy, suited onely (as Mounsi Des-Cartes▪ sayes) to wits that are seated below Medi∣ocrity, which will furnish them with those rare ima∣ginations of Materia prima, Privation, Universalia, and such Trumpery, which they understand no more then their Tutors▪ and can no more make use of in the af∣faires of life, then if 3000. yeares since they had r through all the Hierogliphicall learning of th Egyptians, and had since that time slept in their Mu∣my, and were now awaken. And then as soone  they have done licking of this file, to be turned t graze in poor Ethicks, which perhaps tell them  much in harder words, as they had heard their Mo∣thers talke by the fire-side at home. Then are they turned loose, and with their paper-barks committed to the great Ocean of Learning; where if they  not torne, they returne backe so full of desperation and contempt of their profession, and sad remem∣brance of their youth so trivially spent, that they h all towardly engagements that way, and suffer them∣selves either to sinke in a quagmire of idlenesse, or to be snatched away in a whirlepool of vice. But in c some with much adoe get a shore (for a long or a  voyage upon these termes they cannot make) and  the foresaid means stilt themselves into some profe∣on; what deplorable things (unlesse it be those fe which Nature makes for otentation to be jewells i
this earth) prove they, in filling the world with de∣testable quacking Empericks, lewd, and contentious, Gown-men, or ignorant mercenary Divines? Againe, I have ever expected from an University, that though all men cannot learne all things, yet they should be able to teach all things to all men, and be able either to attract knowing men from abroad out of their owne wealth, or at least be able to make an exchange. But how far short come we of this, though I acknowledge some difference between our Universities? We have hardly Professours for the three principall faculties, and these but lazily read, and carelesly fol∣lowed. Where have we any thing to do with Chimi∣stry, which hath snatcht the keyes of Nature from the other sects of Philosophy, by her multiplied experi∣ences? Where have we constant reading upon either quick or dead Anatomies, or ocular demonstration of herbes? Where any manuall demonstrations of Ma∣thematicall Theorems or Instruments? Where a pro∣motion of their experiences, which if right carried on, would multiply even to astonishment? Where an exa∣mination of all the old Tenets? Review of the old expe∣riments & traditions which gull so many junior beliefs, and serve for nothing else but for idle Priests, to make their Sermons more gaudy? Where is there a solemn disquisition into History? A nice and severe calculation and amendment of the Epochs of time? Where a survey of Antiquities, and learned descants upon them? Where a ready and generous teaching of the Tongues? Free from Pedantisme, and the impertinencies that that kind of learning hath been pestered with? And all this done not by some stripling yongster, who perhaps under∣stands
that which he professes as little as any thing else▪ and mounts up into the chaire twice or thrice a yeare, to mutter over some few stolne impertinencies, but by some stayed man, of tryed and known abilities in his profession, allured by a competent encourage∣ment to stay in the University, who may at certaine times read, at certaine times attend the resolution of doubts, offering directions at other times, and ingaging them in sober and rationall disputes, in which being restrained from sophistry, they may chafe and polish their endowments, and whe one the other by praise or emulation. If we finde very few, or perhaps none of them in our Universities▪ I suppose I offer no violation nor in▪ jury to their hoarinesse and venerable fame, if I say, they are apable of farther promotion, and that they have not yet arrived to the exactnesse of the Jesuits Colledges, and many transmarine Universities, the latter of which, if not the former, they far exceed in pecuniary endowments and outward statelinesse. And truly, but that I would not doe violence to the Mother that bare me, and prophane that place which is in my account holy, I could lay open abundance of their customes, both superstitious, irrationall, uncivill, and ridiculous; I could instance how some vices are growne generall in some degrees of them, how many slugs there are, how some courses they take will prove meerly the choaking of all literature. But since this would amount to a long abble, and degenerate into some Satyre or Pasquill, rather then an Areopagitick, I will be content, having a publicke businesse in hand; to lay aside all bitternesse, though it might be advanta∣gious
to my purpose, and with due mecknesse▪ and quanimity, draw to my last taske, and then sit downe with silent wishes and earnest expectation. Two things then I have to beg; some assistances hat you would give the Universities from themselves▪ and some assistance that you would give them from without themselves. From themselves: that you would educe those Frier-like Lists of Fellowships into a fewer number, and those that you retaine, to be bestowed on men, excellent in their particular endowments, and peculiar for some use or other, that so the number ff the Professours might encrease, and all of them be enabled to prosecute the hints and impetus of their owne inclinations▪ and others of more patient heads e tyed to instruct those severall persons which should make addresses to them; a third possibly, worne out with▪ contemplations and those greater labours of the minde, might sit warme, and know nothing lesse then Necessity in their honoured old age. Sixe Fellow∣ships thus ordered, with a sufficient allowance and en∣couragement would be more advantagious, and con∣tribute more to the raising up of the despised head of learning, then sixscore at this present doe; while the remaining portion of Revenues might be sequestred by  select Committee of able and knowing men (wherein some Representatives of the University should be mingled) to be changeable and accountable every eare: to be disposed of, for examining and pursuing experiments, encouragements of honour, compleating and actuating some new inventions, supplying the nee∣y ones that really wanted these wings to take great ights, relieving of strangers; and lastly, provoking
some sydereall and flaming soules to display them∣selves in their full and radiant meridian lustre. For then will it prosper with Learning, when rewards fit themselves to men, and men are not forced to di∣stort themselves to rewards; when every mans Genius moves in its owne orbe, and is not hurried aside in an eccentrick motion. From without the Universities: that you would thinke of some better way of disposing those few Colledges which are thinly scattered up and downe the land, and make them either collaterall or subservi∣ent to this designe; whereas now they are of little or no other use then to nourish the supine idlenesse of a few Lurdans, and foment their illitterate debates; tossed to and fro among them without any delight to any but those who love bawling and canvasing such unlearned opinions which runne in this circle without end, and contribute not the least to the promotion or discovery of Truth. Secondly, that as you would (with all due provision for the civill peace) take off that hatefull gagg of licen∣cing which silences so many Truths, and frights so ma∣ny ingenuities, and makes them abhorre the publick; so you would put such a gentle imposition upon Books, that upon every Impression two might goe to the publicke Library; and that forreigne Bookes, brought over hither in any number, might doe the like, or at least at some reasonable rate. Thirdly, that all the Medalls, Statues, ancient Rings, and other Antiquities, pictures of learned delight, or famous men, that either were the late Kings or any other persons whose estates stand confiscate to you▪
might be appropriated this way. For by a cheaper d more generous magnificence you cannot endeare ur selves to all the lovers and sons of knowledge, and refull Patrons of mankinde; nor secure the memory  your noble acquests by more illustrious Trophees. And lastly, since that this Island can no more possesse  the Treasures of knowledge then it can the Trea∣es of the earth, that you would be ready to cast all pect and honour upon learned forreigners, although u use no largesse towards them. Men that through  hirst of fame have beguiled themselves into large d divine contemplations, cannot but thinke they reap a great fruit of their labours, and be surprized with it, when they see themselves smiled upon, and courted by h a mighty State, and be ambitious to disperse their eories there, where they see they are so much ho∣red. Now how by this policy your Brethren of lland, have in a manner monoplized all the spark∣g wits of Europe; there are many that sit among  that can best informe you. Nor is there yet any apparent reason to me why you should not also studde  embosse this Nation with them. Now to what e particular designe all this should levell. There e been so many modells, and those so various, ugh to the same end, chalked out by the greatest enuities, that it would be very hard (lov'd I tran∣ptions or largenesse never so well) to represent m all, each one abounding in his owne sense, and  possibly not so servient to the designations of ano∣. It shall be enough for me (waving my judge∣nt or disquisition of them) to set downe the resul∣ce of a many diligent observations and iterated
thoughts; which as they have not strayed too much  to wilde Idea's, so I know not why they may not  more particularly fitted for our elevation. First, I have considered that an endeavour to bring all persons under the sway of knowledge, could no but approach very neare a Plaonicke Commonwealth, and must in the triall enervate the people, and call them from those necessary professions of Tillage an War, and make them acquainted with the artifices o delight. Besides there were but a few inclinations so noble, as could overlooke the grosse entertainment of sense, and aime at a more pure and intellectu happinesse. And among these men I found particul Temperatures as it were, and some secret Sympat and Antipathies to some, or some particular studie whilst there were very few intellectuall complexi that desired all; and these enjoyed not the particula so fully as those that bent that particular way.  found also that many men rudely educated, and  as would have proved no great Clerkes, though th had been bred up in the Pedanticke way of t Schooles▪ had notwithstanding through long a sore observation, so well tutored their reason, th they proved many times persons fitter for busi then those that had the assistance of much unpro∣able literature. I had seen also some men after ma yeares spent in the world, begin to retire into the∣selves, and as seriously and effectually as they c apply themselves to Books, which yet was commo∣ly ineffectuall to them, if not quickned with so live-voyce and knowing assistance. From this masse of observations I fell to consid
us, That if Man were a creature both so excellent d active, it were but justice to him that the naturall rgency of his Genius should be found out and assisted; d that surely could not be in any better time then his infancy at the dawning of his reason, when he ld not be employed any other way, and his inno∣cy made him most susceptible of any impression or ure. And if at such a time, then surely he was to  assayed by most easie trialls, and that by pleasant stimes of sense, and not by any harsh abstractions  rough discipline. Yet those recreations of his I ought ought to be such as should be profitable, and le to furnish his maturer thoughts with some solid as and sound representations of things. And here made account I had found the right path, which our hooles having so long left, was the reason they re so seldome prosperous or fruitfull in great mat∣rs. Well, this being so, those that had spent their ildhood thus, I supposed, might with much more vantage and ease, retire into a more ignoble calling; d those whom some harder fortune alienated to o∣er employments, might carry such grounds away h them, as might conduct and dispose their obser∣ions all their lives after; whilst all those who had  greater vivacity of spirits, might be set apart to orthy and suitable employments, and none be des∣ired by ill methods, or tyrannicall Tutors. Thus far had I got, and there remained this with ; That those men that were set apart for knowledge st busie themselves about two things, either about e dispersing, or augmentation of it: And about dis∣sing of it, there could be no better meanes then to
make it easie and amiable; and this brought me to be∣leeve that that education would thrive the best in any place, that was the least cumbred with unnecessary notions, and did the most facilly and orderly insinuat it selfe into the understanding; and I tooke the duty of a Master to endeavour these two. Besides, I consi∣dered that that was the best which was the most reall and universall: and then I perceived that it was bette to grave things in the mindes of children, then word, for I had knowne some great speakers, though in∣discreet, gazed on onely as strange sights and Patra▪ where as I could not imagine, but that if a wise ma came into any Country, whose language he had neve heard, he would by his deportment and insinuations make a shift to be entertained and respected. And this made me suppose, that many men that could count their languages by their fingers, might possibly be of no more use among mankinde, then so many Apes or Magpies. But such whose mindes were strengthened with realties, were onely men, and in∣deed so much men, as they were masters of the true use of reason, and knew how to guide it; and that to them▪ Languages must of necessity adde beauty an perfection, and acquaint them with a much of know∣ledge which was never writ in their mother Tongue. And since that there were some men who would fortunately learn and teach the knowledge of others, though they could not augment it much themselves; I judge that nature did principally intend these for dis∣pensators and conveighers of it. And others of more vast and capacious intellectualls, that could never be bounded by the Theories of one other, were onely fit
or augmentation; and because there were some pro∣pensions and aversions, of which they themselves ould not well render an account, which if disobeyed succeeded untowardly and unsuccessefully; I presently ferred, that the genius of each one was to be em∣ployed and cherished in its owne kinde; and that there as seldome any great matter to be expected from it,  preternaturally diverted, or dispersed into many va∣ous thoughts and designes, which did onely distract d weaken it. But when once I began to take a prospect of the whole Landscap of Knowledge, Methought there was uch of it moorish and fennish, much of it overgrown with thornes and brambles, and some parts of it had t been justly measured, nor indeed fully discovered,  that I thought it would be too stupid humility, to st with the traditionall wisdome of our Ancestours, d not to looke after further enlargement and ad∣vancement. For there being much of it uncultivated d unmanured; I saw there was abundantly left, r to provoke and satisfie each future industry, which w they should be employed, I could not better tell w to designe then thus; first, considering the excel∣cy of Man, and the restlesse activity of his under∣standing, and the strange volutations of his affaires, I ought the actions of so noble a creature deserved r better, then to be covered in oblivion. And be∣cause experience was nothing but a sober deduction d summing up of many observations, and man was  apish imitative thing; I thought there was nothing better to abreviate the length of observation, and to rnish him with good copies which he should fol∣low,
then being acquainted with past actions and time▪ and conversing with the images of the bravest persons that went before. And truly, all this, I for a while flatter'd my selfe, was supplyed us out of those Histo∣ries which as yet survive. But after some acquain∣tance with them, I began to quit this beliefe; for I found many of them clash, many of them rent, many ridiculous, most composed to pleasure, and therefore not descending to those particularities and circum∣stances, without which a History is but dead, and a bare Skeleton without either flesh or sinewes. Besides a many of them seemed to flourish up into Ideas, and others were so larded and pestred with the private discourses and conceptions of their Writers, that they seem to have been composed for no other end. Besides most of them were but Summaries and Epi∣tomes, so that those deductions which were drawne from them, were not so pertinent, but fallible, and such as seemed rather to follow the conceptions of the Observatour, then to be naturally enforced from the things themselves. For this cause I began to wish that there were a place in some University appointed for a collection of all such Papers, Letters, Tran∣scripts, and Relations, which should discover the in∣ner side of Negotiations, and events, and the true fa of things, without the adulteration of common po∣licy. And I thought it were profitable rather to ta in many needlesse things, then to leave out one need∣full, because a judging minde out of many particula∣rities, could draw a better estimate of things, and de∣duce more certaine, and unquestioned axiomes. But because Man is a creature of such infinite va∣riety,
and that in every one, there is somewhat shi∣ning and excellent; I wished that some laudable dili∣gence, had gathered a catalogue of Characters, and that f the lives of some of the more eminent; which I ould not care, how much they had been stuffed with particular actions, because Man in businesse is but a Theatricall person, and in a manner but perso∣nates himselfe, but in his retired and hid actions, he ulls off his disguise, and acts openly. So that I judged by that meanes that Characters were the best and aithfullest to be gained, and we should come to a ighter knowledge and judgement of Vertue, and the assions. For I had seen abundance of things related as high acts of generosity, which possibly were but e effects of weaknesse, cruelty and despaire. And withall seeing onely the greatnesses of some men mentioned, and neither their particular imperfecti∣ons, nor the meanes by which they atchieved their nds particularly set downe; I thought it could not out stretch many weake mindes to disproportionate thoughts; and like Palmeine or Don Quixote make them thinke of things beyond the Moon. Therefore d▪ I conceive it necessary to trace these Grandees as much as may be, through all their windings and hid∣den paths. But because men must walke upon the earth, and eeds receive those influeuces which are shed from eaven, and therefore exceedingly differ according to their severall climes; I thought not onely an exact escription of the severall Countries was to be ob∣tained, and if it were possible, all their secret myste∣ies, and retired criticismes of state; that so, obser∣vative
mindes, might have farre richer stuffe, and va∣riety of formes whereupon to work. And also there might probably by this meanes in length of time, be found out severall satisfactory reasons, and wayes o discovering and judging the many inclinations and na∣tures of men: And so by that means a greater faci∣litation of businesse, and possibly greater successe in it, then have yet commonly happened. Moreover, Man that had solely the use of reason, and by it was separated from other creatures,  thought had all the interest in the world to endea∣vour the perfection of it, and the severall wayes of it best advantages. And this I thought, was no bette way attempted, then if▪ the veynes of things were rightly and naturally cut up, and he had such prin∣ciples placed within him, as would without any di∣sturbance or confusion assist him in the pursuance of any Truth, or in the examining of any thing doubt∣full. This I thought had been done by Logick (as they call it) but there the Predicaments were so untowan∣ly ranged, that a mans minde shall not without some hesitation know where to fasten; and then when he hath pitched there, he is but engaged in a dispute. But I beleeve had the dissection beene naturall, the minde would instantly have pitched right, and the have been inabled to have weilded that Notion▪ to her best use. Here I expected reliefe from Metaphy∣sicks, but they were so abstrusely abstract, and so far remote from use, that they seemed to hurry the minde too far away, and make it too volatile and aery, and so difficultly attainable, that halfe a life need to beseverely spent in learning them. But the
conduct of reason which I wished for, I wished natu∣ll and easie, and such as might gently sinke into unger mindes, and be there imbraced with no im∣lsion; but the delight which commonly tickles the ule when she meets with any radiant and pregnant uth. This made me imagine highly of the Mathe∣ticks for the clearnesse of their grounds and excel∣t building upon them; but these were withdrawne m Quantity, and besides had the liberty to make eir owne suppositions, which to morall and politick ason (which was to judge of things as it found them tracted into many casualties and circumstances) was ied; and therefore that there was but little ad∣tage to be had this way, so that I could not de∣ any better meanes then to make the minde pliant  passible to any Truth, to free her from all these uinated prejudices of education, tradition, or ldish observation, and then withall to plant such a btfulnesse in her, as should not easily ascent to any e thing which was not fortified with strong reason  right experience. And to doe this, there cannot  be extream necessity of a person not meanly vers'd he causes of errour, and stratagems of reason, who uld dig out such axioms as should rectifie the mind,  lead her by the hand, in the most subtile contem∣tions, and so refine her, that she might be able to ract pure and large Theories out of things most im∣s'd and hid in matter. or the Mathematicks themselves, I found them full  excellent variety and harmony, strongly fenced h their owne Truth, and branched out into many irable inferences and productions. But yet me∣thought
that there was somewhat in them which was yet hid from us, and that the ancient foun∣ders of these sciences had been content to retaine somewhat not fully discovered. For I found most men imployed onely in learning those immense heas of Demonstrations they had left us, but seldome enlar∣ging them or going forward, which made me fear that the key of these Sciences were hid, and that without such a key, or engine it had been unpossible to reare up such a huge super-structure of vast consequences. But this I found two or three great spirits had already light on, and had directed a way which if well followed, will make our Mathematicall reason nimble and apt to finde the fountain head of every Theoreme, and by de∣grees, as we may hope, inable us to the solution of any Probleme without any more assistance then pen and inke (so that a man may carry all these admirable Sciences about him) and direct us to more exact and easie instruments then any have been yet knowne, and recall mens minds by delicate ravishing contemplati∣ons, from the sordid jugling use of those instruments on which they now so perversly and unanimously doat. But when I once begun seriously to view that strange disposition of things which we call Nature; I could not even in my ruder estimation of it but be much astonished. For it was plaine to me there was more art and prodigious workmanship in a Gnat or a Fly then there was in the greatest engines or pro∣ductions of man; which if they were not casually found out, were but the meere promotions and pursu∣ances of Nature. By this I took my self deeply engaged for to looke upon that Fabricke with more curiosity
and diligence then they commonly use, who judge and suppute every thing according to the outward tickling and blandishments of sense. And as to this designe, I thought I was well provided for, by those many volumnes of naturall Philosophy, which I found to flatter me with a many large and braving Titles. And I thought that when I was once well acquainted with them, I should have had my minde fitted for excellent notions, and embellished with such rich principles, as could not but furnish me with a many excellent and sweet deductions. But when I had spent some time thus; and began to shake off that implicite faith which must for a while binde up learners, and discovered what con∣tradictions, loose conceptions, and endlesse controver∣sies those Volumnes were fraught with, I perceived I had gained nothing else but a multitude of vaine spe∣culations, which in all reason of the world I ought to dis-beleeve. About this time I happened to bee ac∣quainted with a sort of books that denounced a sharpe warre against the old Philosophy, and very severely undertooke to put it all under the sponge, and withall to raise up such other new observations as should prove more handsomely, and truely make up the ap∣parences and changes of Nature. These men I hugged, and indeed expected from them, some performances equall to my expectations; but then againe I found that man may be farre more happy in discovering of errours then in finding out of Truths. For some of those Treatises were meerly draughts and designations, others violently wrested the explaining of things to their owne principles, and rather forced Nature to their conceptions, then enlarged their conceptions as
wide as Nature. Othersome there were, who abusing a Philosophicall liberty, strayed into some anticke Theories, and made Nature monstrous: Others laid down very probable and neat Hypotheses, but absolutely unsuited to the nature of the thing; so that I collected, that though we had made some steps forwards, yet we were not at our journies end. And because I saw that a many curious notions were but like spiders webs, and that experiences have the greatest light, I thought we were principally to insist upon that way. But because most experiments were found out rather casually then by Philosophicall reasoning, and some men out of one small observation could be bold to raise abundance of vaine consequences▪ and for one and the same experi∣ment, there were sundry reasons brought, and it was easily wrested, and salved by divers principles, I judged that as there was an extreame deale of diligence and nicity to the practicall pursuance of Nature, so, that it was not safe to draw any one principle from any one observation, unlesse there could not possibly be any o∣ther reason given for it, or else alike discoveries had confirmed it, that if any other interpretation were put upon it, it was unproper and vaine: For as it is easie for men of acute wits to mis-judge and mis-expect Nature; so when an axiom is rightly gained, it is easie to work it up, and to draw from it many strange and magicall Productions. And because there are abundance of extraordinary appearances both at home and abroad, I judged it ne∣cessary, that all these should be carefully gathered and registred; so that those many varieties comming into a long Catalogue, and digested by a sober minde, might
afford many rare and beautifull discoveries of the glory of their Creator. What other meanes might be used both in this and Medicine, would be too large now to insist on, since I at first purposed but a Synopsis, which, I cannot despair my selfe, if it were rightly or hotly pursued, could not but bring forth a more plentifull harvest then we at the present expect. There are, no doubt, many of nobler thoughts, who might furnish you with more exact and high designations; and truly; I shall thinke my selfe abundantly satisfied, if, from these poore re∣flections, you may be invited to take their advice, and follow their vast and judicious considerations in this nature. However for my part let this humble Essay be as much neglected or revil'd as may be, I shall sit down quiet with a conscience of the discharge of my duty, though it can reap no farther, then the putting of these wishes upon the file, and transmitting them to Po∣sterity. These things, as I have but briefly touched, so to par∣ticularize them had been extreame folly, your Wis∣domes being so able to direct you, in case God stir your hearts for to take in hand this taske: which if you cheerfully goe through, no doubt but that gale of di∣vine favour, which hath constantly gone along with you, will not now leave you, but bring you to the end. And as your eyes have been blest with many strange fights, and your mouths oftentimes filled, nay strucken dumbe with wonder; so there is no doubt, but if you doe this one thing which now remaines, you shall see the Taper of a learned Piety burne among us, I hope, like an immortall lampe, fed w refined▪
and sublimest knowledge, whilst all those false ligh of ignorance, humane forgery, and superstition shall vanish away, or be put out, and the stubborne pervicacy of humane reason turn'd into a gentle com∣pliance to divine truth. You shall see Nature traced through all her Turnings, to a cleare demonstration of her first cause, and every day bring forth varieties of experiments, either to the reliefe, astonishment, or delight of men; you shall then see us freed from all these fabulous illusions and impostures, which have hitherto beset either Traditions or Cures; and Na∣ture which now disguises her selfe into so many shapes, forced into an open veracity and pure naked∣nesse. You shall see the number of Arts daily increa∣sed▪ and th we knowne already, wonderfully promoted. You shall then see Scheams of Common∣wealths brought forth, easie and naturall, and not va∣ried into a multiplicity of crooked Hypotheses. You shall then see Policy reconciled to Divinity, Morality, and it self, and yet better able to lay designes and pre∣vent dangers. You will then have it in its native sim∣plicity, and your posterity may at once learne to be both wise and innocent. You shall have the use of the Tongues daily increase, and that judgement of confu∣sion, which hath so long and so heavily laine upon mankinde, by degrees removed. You shall have the wayes of Education made smooth, and your children with a pleasant successe possessed of all the Treasures of reall knowledge, ere they could have thought they had entred the gates. So that when you have added these fights to the former, and witnessed by a happy old age the blessednesse of this Land; you may see the
reines also prosper in the hands of those that shall be your Successours, and melting away in a soft dissolution, finde that Crown above which is owing to fidelity, and that reward below, that the best Law-givers have ever met with; that is, your Names shall increase in the silent motion of Time, and all Posterity shall looke backe upon you, with an eye of Piety and Adora∣tion. The End.
