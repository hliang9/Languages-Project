THE ENGLISH DICTIONARIE: OR, AN INTERPRETER of hard English Words. Enabling as well Ladies and Gentle∣women, young Schollers, Clarkes, Merchants, as also Strangers of any Nation, to the vnder∣standing of the more difficult Authors already printed in our Language, and the more speedy attaining of an elegant perfection of the English tongue, both in reading, speaking and writing. Being a Collection of the choisest words contained in the Table Alphabeticall and English Expositor, and of some thousands of words neuer published by any heretofore. By H. C. Gent. LONDON, Printed for Edmund Weauer, and are to be sold at his shop at the great North gate of Pauls Church. 1623.
TO THE RIGHT HO∣nourable, Sir Richard Boyle, Knight, Lord Boyle, Baron of Youghall, Viscount Dun∣garuan, Earle of Cork, and one of his Maie∣sties most Honourable Priuie Councell of the Kingdome of Ireland, &c. PArt of euery desertfull birth, (Right Honourable) in any man his Country may challenge, his Soueraigne a part, his Parents a part, & his friends another. As I cannot be vseful in euery respect to each of those, so I will striue to expresse at least a will, if not a perfection in abilitie to all. Where a generall voice warrants an approbation, there euery ser∣uice is a duty. The truth of it both concernes and inuites me, out of the fame and applause of your Noblenesse, to make a particular dedication of some serious houres to your suruey, whom the world speakes both noble and learned, wherein as I haue done my best to accommodate discourse
with the choisest language, so I desire that my ambition of being knowne vnto your Lordship may not be imputed either vnto an errour of im∣pudence, or an impudence in erring. Please you to know thus much of me, that I am partly im∣boldned hereunto, by the assurance of your loue and fauours to that noble Gentleman, Sir Wil∣liam Hull, to whom as I am tied in double bonds of bloud and friendship, so, I am so much obliged vnto him, that I cannot deuise a better rent than to doe you seruice: But chiefely the re∣port of your owne honourable merit and iust commendations, encourage mee to this duty, though otherwise vnknowne, not questioning but you will be pleased to take notice of one who loues and honours vertue in all Personages for vertues sake. Vouchsafe (Right Honourable) this poore testimonie of my obseruancie, intended only to serue you, not to instruct you, and you shall not onely largely requite my endeuours, but may also expect a more steady and particular du∣ty from Your Honours most ready seruant, Henry Cockeram.
A Premonition from the Author to the Reader. I Am not ignorant of the praise-worthy labours which some Schollers of deserued memorie haue heretofore be∣stowed on the like subiect that I haue here aduentured on: howsoeuer it might therefore seeme a needlesse taske of mine, to intrude vp∣on a plot of study, the foundation of whose buil∣ding hath beene formerly leuel'd and laid, yet the Iustice of defence herein is so cleere, that my en∣deuours may bee truly termed rather a necessity of doing, than an arrogancie in doing. For without appropriating to my owne comfort any interest of glory, the vnderstanding Readers will not, the ignorant cannot, and the malicious dare not, but acknowledge that what any before me in this kinde haue begun, I haue not onely
fully finished, but throughly perfected. To write an Apologie of iustification would argue rather a distrust of my Worke than a confidence of me∣rit: Be pleased therefore (honest and (therin) learned Reader) to suruey a short Premonition for the order of the ensuing Vocabularie. First the method is plaine and easie, being alphabeti∣call, by which the capacity of the meanest may soone be inlightened. The first Booke hath the choisest words themselues now in vse, where∣with our language is inriched and become so copious, to which words the common sense is annexed. The second Booke containes the vulgar words, which whensoeuer any desirous of a more curious explanation by a more refi∣ned and elegant speech shall looke into, he shall there receiue the exact and ample word to ex∣presse the same: Wherein by the way let me pray thee to obserue that I haue also inserted (as occa∣sion serued) euen the mocke-words which are ridi∣culously vsed in our language, that those who desire a generality of knowledge may not bee ignorant of the sense, euen of the fustian termes, vsed by too many who study rather to bee heard speake, than to vnderstand them∣selues. The last Booke is a recitall of seuerall per∣sons, Gods and Goddesses, Giants and Deuils, Monsters and Serpents, Birds and Beasts, Riuers, Fishes, Herbs, Stones, Trees, and the like, to the intent that the diligent learner may not pre∣tend
the defect of any helpe which may informe his discourse or practice. I might insist vpon the generall vse of this worke, especially for La∣dies and Gentlewomen, Clarkes, Merchants, young Schollers, Strangers, Trauellers, and all such as desire to know the plenty of the English; but I am confident, that experience will be the truest Herauld to publish to the world on my be∣halfe, how as my debt to my countrie is to bee challenged, so my Country shall not altogether boast of any immunity from being indebted to my Sudies. Thus what I haue done is (Reader) for thy benefit, accept it and make vse of it, so shall I finde reward in my labours, and rest thy friend, H. C.
To his very good friend, Master Henry Cockeram, on his Vo∣cabulary. He whose selfe loue, or too ambitious spirit, Enuies or carpes at this thy Muses action, Nere let him liue, or of a Muse once merit Regard or fame, but die in his detraction, Irreuocably plagu'd with Zoilan spight, Ere he once taste of Hellicons delight. Could I, oh could I quintessence my skill, Or with Elixir truly alcumize, Knowledge with learning should instruct my quill Effectually to praise thy Muses guise, Re-felling all the criticall disasters, Among some captious, yet wise seeming masters, Made by her curious eye, their owne distasters. Nicholas Smith, Eques Auratus Encomiastes Posthumus.
To my industrious friend, the Au∣thor of this English Dictionarie, Mr. HENRY COCKRAM of EXETER. BOrne in the West? liue there? so far frō Court? Frō Oxford, Cambridge, London? yet report (Now in these daies of Eloquence) such change Of words? vnknown? vntaught? tis new & strange. Let Gallants therefore skip no more from hence To Italie, France, Spaine, and with expence Waste time and faire estates, to learne new fashions Of complementall phrases, smooth temptations To glorious beggary: Here let them hand This Booke; here studie, reade, and vnderstand: Then shall they finde varietie at Home, As curious as at Paris, or at Rome. For my part I confesse, hadst not thou writ, I had not beene acquainted with more wit Than our old English taught; but now I can Be proud to know I haue a Countryman Hath strugled for a fame, and what is more, Gain'd it by paths of Art, vntrod before.
The benefit is generall; the crowne Of praise particular, and thats thine owne. What should I say? Thine owne deserts inspire thee, Twere base to enuie, I must then admire thee. A friend and louer of thy paines, IOHN FORD
To the Reader on this Verball of his esteemed friend, Master Henry Ccke∣ram of Exeter. ARt hidden moulds, the Author freely sends, His sweat of brow to publike priuat friends, His courtesie to labour, yours to raise, As it deserues the countenance of praise. Hardwords farfetch'd, made smooth, before being rough, Claime fauour for requitall, that's enough. If you betray them with a trecherous kisse, He'l laugh in's sleeue, and at your follies hisse. Thomas Spicer. To the Reader on this Vocabulary of his good friend, Master Henry Cocke∣ram of Exeter. IF things farre fetch'd are dearest, most esteem'd, which by times sweatful houres haue been redeem'd. Of what count's this, of which sort like was neuer, Praise it of force you must, and loue him euer. The Adage is far sought, deare bought, please ladies, You must yeeld to this Maxime, or proue babies. Then giue worths due, that worthinesses guise, If not, my Motto is, you are vnwise. Bartho. Hore.
To my very good friend, Master Co∣keram, Author of this worke. TO speake good words of thee were but in part To pay backe what we owe, for thy rare Art Hath taught vs all good language: a rude pile Of barbarous sillables into a stile Gentle and smooth thou hast reduc't: pure gold Thou hast extracted out of worthlesse mould. And that no one may thinke thy merit weake, Of a rough speech th'ast taught vs all to speake A perfect language; in which Cockerams praise Shall liue belou'd, whilst time leaues making daies. Iohn Day. To his industrious friend, Master Henry Cockeram. TO ouer-praise thy Booke, in a smooth line, (If any errour's in't) would make it mine: Onely, while Words for paiment passe at Court, And whilst loud talke and wrangling make resort I'th Terme to Westminster, I doe not dread Thy leaues shall scape the Scombri, and be read. And I will adde this as thy friend, no Poet, Thou hast toild to purpose, and the euent wil shew it. Iohn Webster.
To his worthily respected friend, Master Henry Cockeram. WHo hath discouer'd yet a neerer way, By which, what we conceiue, we can conuey To others, then by words, that full expresse What Mimicke action doth but onely guesse: But where a language hath variety, And euery word a reall property, How much it adds to elocution, As doe but reade this Booke, then thinke vpon The Authors paines and praise, giue him respect For this addition to our Dialect. Iohn Crugge.

Sue, a most cruell fierce beast, carrying her young vpon her backe to shadow them from the heat with her huge taile. Tyger, a truculent beast, and the swiftest of all o∣ther beasts: wherefore they are taken very young in the dams absence, and carried away by them on horsebacke: who hearing the crie of the olde Tyger following after them, doe of purpose let fall one of the whelpes, that while shee beareth that backe, they in the meane time may escape safe with the other to the ship: but of all, the Hircan Tyger is the most cruelst.
