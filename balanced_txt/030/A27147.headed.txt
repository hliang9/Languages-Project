The more ye tramp in a— it grows the broder.
That which hussies spares, Cats eat. The weakest goes to the walls. There is no medicine for fear. Touch a gall'd Horse on the back and he will fling. There is no fool to an old fool. There is none without a fault. The longer we live, the more farlies we see. They are welcome that brings. Twa Daughters, and a back dore are three stark thieves. The Piper wants meikle, that wants the nether chafts. There came never a large Fart forth of a wrans— Teem bags rattles. The thing that is fristed, is not forgiven. Take part of the pelf when the pack is dealing. Tread on a Worm and she will stir her tail. They are lighlty herrite, that hes all their awn.
The Craw thinks her own Bird fairest. They buy good cheap that brings nothing hame. Thraw the wand while it is green. The Sowter's wife is worst shod. They will know by an half-pen∣ny if a Preist will take offering. The worst world that ever was, some man wan. The Tailors wife is worst clad. Take him up there with his five Eggs and fower of them rotten. Thy tongue is no slander. This bolt came never out of your bag. There is little sap in dry peis hools. Tarrowing bairns were never fat. The mother of mischief is na mair nor a midgewing. The higher up the greater fall. There are many fair words in the marriage making, but few in the tochergood paying.
True love kythes in time of need. There is nothing mair precious nor time. The mair cost, the mair honour. The lesse play the better. They that speirs meikle, will get wot of part. There is meikle between word and deed. There are mae wayes to the wood nor ane. The blind Horse is hardiest. The mae the merrier, the fewer the better cheer. They are good willy of their Horse that hes none. Three may keep councel if twa be away. They put at the Cairt, that is ay gangan. Twa wits is better nor ane. They laugh ay that wins. There are mae maidens, nor maukin. They mense little the mouth, that bites off the nose.
There is nothing so course, as a new washen louse. They are as wise, as speir not. This world will not last ay. Twa hungry meltithes makes the third a glutton. The grace of God is geir enough. Thou shouldst not tell thy foe when thy foot sleeps. The greatest Clerks are not the wisest men. There belongs mair to a bed nor four bare leggs. They had never an ill day, that had a good evening. There is meikle hid meat in a Goose eye. Take a man by his word, and a Cow by her horn. The shots overgoes the old swine. Touch me not on the sair heel. The Malt is above the Meal. There is a dog in the well. Thy thumb is under my Belt.
The goose-pan is above the roast. The next time ye dance, wit whom ye take by the hand. U. USe your friend as ye would have him. Unskilful mediciners, and horse-marshels, slayes both man & beast. Use makes perfectness. W. VVEll done, soon done. Wonder lasts but nine nights in a Town. We have a craw to pluck. Whatrax my Jo, I ken your coptaen. Wrang hes no warrand. Wont beguil'd the Lady. Wit in a poor mans head, and mosse in a mountain, avails nothing Weil is that weil does.
Well good-mother-daughter. Whatrax of the feed, where the frendship dow not. Wood in wilderness, & strength in a fool. Weapons bodes peace. Wiles help weak folk. Waken not sleeping dogs. Women and bairns keep counsell of that they ken not. We hounds slew the Hare-quoth the messoun. Wishers and woulders are poor householders. Weil worth aw, that gars the plough draw. Words are but winde, but dunts are the Devil. With empty hand no man should hawks allure. Wark bears witness who weil does. Wrang hearing makes wrang re∣hearsing. Wealth gars wit waver.
Weil bids, weil betides. Wrong count is no payment. Y. YE should be a king of your word. Your winning is no my tinsel. Ye may puind for debt, but not for unkindnesse. Ye learn your Father to get bairns. Ye will break your crag as soon as your fast in his house. Ye ride a bootless errand. Ye may not sit in Rome, and strive with the Pope. Ye seek grace at a graceless face. Ye strive against the stream. Ye drive a Snaile to Rome. Youth never casts for peril. Ye seek hot water under cold ice. Ye breed of the cat, ye would fain have fish, but ye have na will to wet your feet.
Youth and age will never agree. Ye will get war bodes ere Beltan. Ye breed of the gouk, ye have not a rime but ane. Ye may drink of the burn, but not bite of the brae. Ye cannot make a silk purse of a sows lug. Ye have a face to God, and ano∣ther to the Devil. Ye breed of the Millers dog, ye lick your lips ere the poke be open Ye would do little for God, and the Devil were dead. Ye have a ready mouth for a ripe cherry. FINIS.
