An ACT for the Preventing Fri∣volous, and Vexatious Law-Sutes, and giving Remedy to the Parties Grieved, to Recover their Costs at Law, in certain Cases, where heretofore no Costs were given. CHAP. XXXV. WHEREAS it is found by daily Experience, in the Courts at Law, that divers Malicious, and Evil Dis∣posed persons, on purpose, without any just Cause of Sute, do make several Innocent per∣sons, Defendants, joyntly with others, against whom they conceive they have good Cause of Action; and so, tho' such Innocent person or per∣sons, so joined in the said Action, shall be found (not Guilty) and Acquitted of the said Action; Yet if any of the other Ioint Defendants shall be found Guilty, and a Verdict pass against them, by the Common Laws of this Realm; such Defendant, or Defendants so Acquitted, after all his, or their Trouble and Expence, in Defend∣ing such Action, is without Remedy to recover any Costs of Sute against such Plantiffs, for such his, or their unjust Vexation, contrary to all Reason and Iustice. For Remedy whereof: Be it Enacted by the King's Most Excellent Majesty; by, and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons in this present Parliament Assembled, and by Authority of the same, That from, and
after the First Day of May, which shall be in the Year of Our Lord God, One thousand Six hundred and Ninety eight; if any person or persons, shall be made Defendant, or Defen∣dants with others, in any Action, Sute, or Plaint, in Trespass Quare Clausum fregit, or Trespass of Assault and Battery, and such person or persons, so joyned in such Action, shall upon Tryal of the same, be Acquitted by Verdict, altho' the other Defendant, or Defendants, in such Action, shall be found Guilty, and a Ver∣dict pass against him, or them therein, every such person and persons so Acquitted, shall have, and Recover his, and their Costs of Sute, for such his, and their unjust Vexation, as if a Verdict had beén given against such Plantiff, or Plantiffs, or a Verdict had been given for all the Defendants in such Action, unless the Iudge or Iudges, before whom such Cause shall be Tryed, shall immediately after the Tryal there∣of, in open Court, Certifie upon the Record un∣der his Hand, that there was a reasonable Cause, for the making such person or persons, Defendant or Defendants to such Action or Plaint. And whereas by the Law, as it now stands, no Costs of Sute can be awarded, or given to any person or persons, in any Action that shall happen to recover, or have any Iudgment given for him upon any Demurrer in Law, by reason whereof many contentious persons, make use of such manner of Delays, on purpose to keép others from their Iust Right, or otherwise in∣tending thereby, to weary them into some small Composition, for what is really due unto them.
For Remedy whereof, be it further Enacted, That if it at any time from, and after the said First Day of May, any person or persons, who shall Commence, or Prosecute any Action, or Plaint, in any Court of Record, whereupon any Demurrer, or Demurrers shall be joyned, by any Plantiff, or Defendant, Demandant, or Ten∣nant, in any suth Sute or Sutes, he or they, for whom Iudgment or Iudgments shall be given, upon any such Demurrer or Demurrers, shall have, and recover, his and their Costs of Sute, to be awarded by the Court in such like manner, as if such Iudgment or Iudgments had beén given, or recovery had by such party or parties, upon Action tryed by Iury, and Ver∣dict passed for such party therein; and that if any person or persons, from, and after the First Day of May, as aforesaid, shall obtain such, or any other Iudgment or Iudgments, in any His Majesty's Courts of Record in this Kingdom, or any the Courts of the County Palatine of Tipperary, and the person or per∣sons against whom such Iudgment or Iudg∣ments shall be so given, shall in delay of Exe∣cution thereupon, and with intent to annul such Iudgment or Iudgments, Sue forth any Writ or Writs of Error; and afterwards the said Iudg∣ment or Iudgments, shall be Affirmed, or the said Writ or Writs of Error Discontinued, or the Plantiff or Plantiffs therein, become Non-sute; that then, and in every such Case, the party or parties against whom such Writ or Writs shall be so brought, shall recover his and their Costs and Damages, at the discretion of the Iustices before whom such Writ or Writs shall be so Sued, and to have Execution for
such his or their Damages or Costs, so re∣covered by Writs of Capias ad Satisfaciendum, Fieri Facias, or Elegit, or any of them, at the Election of such Party or Parties for whom such Damages and Costs shall be so awarded. And whereas by the Laws of this Realm, no Costs of Sute are Recoverable in any Action of Waste, or Debt, to be brought upon the Sta∣tute, for not setting forth of Tiths, nor in any Writ of Scire Facias, or Prohibition, which hath beén found very Mischievous and Pre∣judicial to the Sutors in such Actions, and to such Persons, as for the recovering their just Rights have beén Forced to Sue forth the same. For Reformation whereof, for the future. Be it further Enacted by the Authority a∣foresaid, That from, and after the First day of May, aforesaid, if any person or persons bring any Action of Waste, or Action of Debt, upon the Statute, for not setting forth of Tyths, in which said several Actions, the Single Value, or Damage Found by the Iury, or Iuries, in any such Action, shall not exceéd the Summ of Threé pounds, the Plantiff or Plantiffs recovering, either by Iudgment up∣on Verdict, or Demurrer in such Action or Actions, shall likewise have and recover his and their Costs of Sute, at the like Discretion of the Iustices before whom such Writ or Writs shall be brought, and Iudgment or Iudgments therein given, as also if any person or persons shall after the time aforesaid, Sue forth any Writ or Writs of Scire Facias, or Commence any Sute or Sutes in prohibition, and recover, and have Iudgment in the same, either by Ver∣dict or upon Demurrer, every such Plantiff or
Plantiffs so recovering, shall likewise have, and recover his and their Costs of Sute in such Action or Actions, at the Discretion of the Iustices, before whom such Recovery shall be so had; and if it shall happen in any the Sutes aforesaid, that the Plantiff or Plantiffs in such Action or Actions, shall become Non-Sute, or Verdict, or Verdicts pass against him or them, in such Sute or Action, or he, or they shall discontinue such his or their Sute or Action: Then (in all such Cases) the De∣fendant, or Defendants, in such Action or Acti∣ons, shall have and recover his and their Costs of Sute in such manner as such Plantiff or Plantiffs should have done, if he or they had Recovered, and had Iudgment given for them in such Action or Actions, as aforesaid, any Law, Custom, Practice, or Vsage to the con∣trary thereof, in any-wise notwithstanding. And that in all the Actions aforesaid, where any of the party or parties to the same, shall so recover their Costs of Sute, it shall, and may be Lawful to, and for them, or any of them to Sue forth Execution for such his or their Costs by Writs of Capias ad Satisfaciendum, Fieri Facias, or Elegit, as aforesaid. And for the preventing Willful and Mali∣cious Trespasses, to be brought for the future. Be it further Enacted, that from and after the First day of May aforesaid, in all Actions of Trespass to be Commenced and Prosecuted in any of His Majesty's Courts of Record at Dublin; wherein at the Tryal of the Cause it shall appear, and be Certified by the Iudge, or Iudges, before whom such Cause shall be Tryed under his or their Hands, on the back of the
Record, that the Trespass upon which any De∣fendant shall be found Guilty, was Willful∣ly and Maliciously committed; In every such Case, the Plantiff shall not only recover his Damages, assessed by the Iury, but his full Costs of Sute, to be Taxed for him by the Di∣rection of the Court, where such Action shall be Tryed. Provided nevertheless, That no Alteration of the same shall be made in any the Cases aforesaid, where any Executor or Administra∣tor shall be Defendant, in any the Actions, or Sutes aforesaid, so at any time hereafter to be brought against them; but that in all such Cases, they shall not be lyable, or subject to payment of any Costs of Sute, otherwise, or in any other manner then as the Law, now requires. And for the preventing the Abatement and Discontinuance of Process for the future, in cer∣tain Cases, and the helping the Law in the particulars following. Be it likewise Enacted by the Authority a∣foresaid, That in all Actions to be Commenced, or brought in any Court of Record within this Kingdom, from, and after the First day of May aforesaid, if it shall happen that any person or persons, being Plantiff or Plantiffs in such Action or Actions, shall die after he or they shall have obtained any Interlocutary Iudg∣ment, or Iudgments, in such Action or Actions, and before a full and final Iudgment or Iudg∣ments given therein, the Death of such Plantiff or Plantiffs, shall not abate such Action or Acti∣ons or hinder the further proceédings of such Cause, but that notwithstanding such dying of such Plantiff or Plantiffs, his or their Exe∣cutors,
or Administrators, may proceéd to Final Iudgment against the Defendant or Defendants, in such Action or Actions, as is hereafter set forth. (If such Action or Actions, shall happen to be such, as by Law may, or might have beén Commenced, or Maintained Originally by any Executor or Administrator) as such Plan∣tiff or Plantiffs aforesaid, might have done, if alive. And if it shall happen, that in any such Action or Actions, the Defendant or Defendants in the same, shall die after such Interlocutary, and before such Final Iudgment or Iudg∣ments obtained, as aforesaid, such dying shall not abate such Action or Actions, but that then, notwithstanding the Death of such Defendant or Defendants, it shall and may be Lawful to, and for such Plantiff or Plantiffs, in such Action or Actions, it Living, and if Dead, his Exe∣cutor or Administrator, to Prosecute such their Action or Actions against the Executors or Ad∣ministrators of such Defendant or Defendants, and proceéd against them to Final Iudgment therein, as is likewise hereafter in that behalf set forth and provided, as if the said Defendant or Defendants, themselves, had beén Living; if such Action or Actions be such as may, or might by Law be Originally brought and pro∣secuted against an Executor or Administrator. And that in Case of the Death of such Plan∣tiff or Plantiffs, as aforesaid, it shall, and may be Lawful to, and for his, and their Executors, or Administrators, or any of them, to Sue forth, and Prosecute one, or more Writ or Writs of Scire facias, against the Defendant or Defendants, in such Action or Actions, if then Living, or if Dead, against the Executors, or Admini∣strators
of such Defendant or Defendants, for Reviving and Continuing such Sute, or Sutes, till Iudgment final shall be given therein; and in Case of the Death of such Defendant, or De∣fendants, as aforesaid, it shall and may be law∣ful, to, and for such Plantiff or Plantiffs (if li∣ving) and if Dead, his or their Executors, or Administrators, or any of them, in like manner to Sue forth, and Prosecute one, or more Writ, or Writs of Scire Facias against the Executors, or Administrators of such Defendant, or De∣fendants, for Reviving and Continuing such Sute or Sutes, till Iudgment final shall be given therein, as aforesaid; the Effect of which said Writ, or Writs of Scire Facias, shall be for the party or parties against whom the same shall be Awarded, to shew cause, why notwith∣standing, such the Death of any the parties to such Sute or Sutes, aforesaid; The Plantiff, or Plantiffs in the said Writ or Writs, of Scire Facias, his, or their Executors, or Admini∣strators, should not proceéd to Iudgment final therein, for the Recovery of such Debt or Da∣mage, for which such Action or Actions, was at first brought. And if at the Return of such Writ or Writs, of Scire facias, the Defendant or Defendants, named therein, shall appear, but not shew sufficient Cause to stay, or Ar∣rest the Iudgment final, or in default of such Appearance, it shall be Returned, that such Defendant or Defendants were duly War∣ned, or after Two such Writs of Scire Facias re∣turned; it be returned that the said Defendant, or Defendants could not be found in the Bai∣liwick where such Summons Issued, or that they had nothing in the said Bailiwick, by which
they, or any of them could be Summoned, that then, in every such Case, One or more Writ, or Writs of Inquiry of Damage, shall be Awar∣ded for the Plantiff or Plantiffs, in such Writ, or Writs of Scire Facias, against such Defendant, or Defendants therein named; upon return of which said Writ, or Writs of Inquiry, duly Executed, Iudgment final shall be given for e∣very such Plantiff or Plantiffs, against every such Defendant or Defendants, in such Writ, or Writs of Scire Facias, as aforesaid. And be it further Enacted, for the Purposes a∣foresaid, That if at any time after the time Li∣mitted, as aforesaid, Two or more persons shall be Ioyntly Plantiffs in any Action or Actions, against Two or more persons, likewise Ioyntly named Defendants therein, the Death or Deaths, of One or more of such Plantiff or Plantiffs, or such Defendant or Defendants, shall not abate such Writ or Writs, in such Action or Actions, but that the same being suggested upon the Roll, or Record, of such Action or Actions, it shall, and may be lawful to, and for the Survi∣ving Plantiff or Plantiffs, in such Action or Actions, to proceéd to Iudgment against the Surviving Defendant or Defendants, in the same, as if such Death had not beén. And whereas by the Law, as it now stands, if any Action or Sute be Commenced, or brought upon any Bond, or other penal Summ, for per∣formance of Covenants, or other Agreéments, in any Deéd or Indenture; The party that brings the same, can Assign only One Breach of Cove∣nant, altho' there are in Truth several Breaches Committed, of which the party Plantiff in such Action, can have no Benefit, or Reparation, not¦withstanding,
that he is really Damnified by Reason thereof. For Remedy whereof. Be it further Enacted by the Authority afore∣said, That in all Actions, which from, and af∣ter the said First Day of May, shall be Commen∣ced, or Prosecuted in any of His Majesty's Courts of Record, in this Kingdom, or any the Courts of the County Palatine of Tipperary, upon any Bond or Bonds, or on any Penal Summ, for Non-performance of any Covenants, or Agreé∣ments, in any Indenture, Deéd, of Writing contained, the Plantiff or Plantiffs, may Assign as many Breaches of the said Covenants, or A∣greéments, as he, or they shall think fit: And thereupon, it shall and may be Lawful, for the Iury, upon such Tryal of such Action or Actions, not only to Assess such Damages, and Costs of Sute as have beén heretofore usully done in such Cases; but also to give Damage for such of the said Breaches, so to be Assigned, as such Plantiff or Plantiffs, upon such Tryal of the Issues taken therein, shall prove to have beén Broken, and that the like Iudgment or Iudg∣ments shall be Entred on every such Verdict or Verdicts, as heretofore have beén usually done in such like Cases. And if it shall happen, that such Defendant or Defendants, shall not Plead to the Issue, but Iudgment shall be given a∣gainst him or them for such Plantiff or Plan∣tiffs, upon Demurrer, or by Nihil dicit, Non sum Informatus, Cognovit Action. or the like; then, and in such Case, it shall and may be Lawful, to, and for such Plantiff or Plantiffs, to suggest up∣on the Roll of Record, in such Action or Actions, such, and as many Breaches or the said Cove∣nants and Agreéments, as he or they shall think
fit upon which said Suggestion, one, or more Writ, or Writs, shall Issue, directed to the Sheriff of that County, where such Action or Actions shall be brought, to Summon a Iury to appear before the Iustice, or Iustices of Assize, or Nisi prius, at their next coming into that County, to enquire of the Truth of every one of those Breaches, and such Iury, to Assess the said Damages seve∣rally, which the said Plantiff or Plantiffs shall have sustained, for every of the said Breaches so Assigned, as aforesaid; in which said Writ, it shall be likewise Commanded to the said Iustice, or Iustices of Assize, or Nisi prius, before whom such Damages shall be so given, that he, or they shall make a full and certain Return of the said Writ or Writs, and the due Execution there∣of to the Court from which the same shall so Issue, according to the Exigency thereof, and the time therein mentioned; which said Writ or Writs so returned, shall be Filed, and there∣upon Iudgment or Iudgments, shall be En∣tred in the said Court, on such Return, as in Cases of Writs of Enquiry of Damages, of the like nature. And in Case the Defendant or Defendants, after such Iudgment Entred, and before Execution Executed, shall pay into the Court, where the said Action shall be brought, to the use of the Plantiff or Plantiffs, his or their Executors, or Administrators, such Da∣mages so Assessed by the Iury, by reason of all, or any the Breaches of such Covenants, to∣gether with the Costs of Sute, that then a Stay of Execution shall be Entred upon the Record of the said Iudgment, and made accordingly for that time, as also, whensoever it shall happen, that by reason of any Execution Sued forth,
and Executed upon such Iudgment, the Plan∣tiff or Plantiffs, his or their Executors, or Ad∣ministrators, shall be fully Satisfied or Paid, all his or their Debt or Damages so Assessed, or the Penalty of such Bond, or Bill penal, at the Election of the Defendant, together with his or their Costs of Sute, and all reasonable Charges and Expences for Executing the said Execution; that then, and from thenceforth, the Body, Goods, and Lands of such Defendant, shall be dischar∣ged from such Execution, which said Discharge, shall likewise be Entred upon the Record of the Roll of the said Iudgment. Yet it is hereby declared, That notwithstanding such Discharges, or Stay of such Executions, and the Entry or Entries of either, or any of them, as aforesaid, upon Record, where such Damages do not a∣mount to the Penalty of such Bond or Bill Penal, such Iudgment or Iudgments, shall still remain, continue, and be in full Force, Vigour, and Effect to the purposes hereafter mentioned (That is to say) As a further Security to an∣swer to such Plantiff or Plantiffs, and his, or their Executors, or Administrators; all such Da∣mages as shall, or may be at any time after∣wards sustained, for, or by reason of any further Breach of any the Covenant or Covenants in such Indenture, Deéd, or Writing contained, if any such shall happen to be, and no Satisfaction be made for the same, as aforesaid, as far as the Remainder of such Penalty, after the pay∣ment of the Damage formerly Recovered out of the same, will reach; upon which said Breach or Breaches, such Plantiff, or Plantiffs may have, and shall be at Liberty to Sue forth a Writ of Scire facias upon the said Iudgment
against such Defendant or Defendants, his, or their Executors, or Administrators, or against his Heirs, or Ter-tenants, Grounded upon Sug∣gestion of other Breach or Breaches of the said Covenants or Agreéments, upon the Roll of the said Iudgment, as aforesaid; and thereupon to Summon him or them respectively to shew Cause why Execution should not be had or awarded upon the said Iudgment; upon which, there shall be the like proceédings as was in the Original Action of Debt, brought upon the said Bond or Obligation, for Assessing of Damages, upon Tryal of Issues, Ioyned upon such Breaches; or in Case of Default upon a Writ of Inquiry thereof, to be awarded in manner as aforesaid. Provided always, That upon Payment, or Satisfaction to be made of all such future Da∣mages, Costs and Charges, in manner as afore∣said, or of so much of such future Damages as the Remaining Summ of the Penalty of such Bond or Bill Penal, after Payment and Satisfaction for the Damages formerly recover∣ed will extend unto, together with Costs of Sute, all further proceédings, or the said Iudg∣ment shall again be stayed, and so Toties quo∣ties (as Occasion shall Require) upon every new Breach, the said Iudgment to be made use of as far as aforesaid, and no further, and upon Satisfaction made in manner aforesaid, the De∣fendant his Body or Goods and Lands to be again Freéd and Discharged out of Execution, as aforesaid.
