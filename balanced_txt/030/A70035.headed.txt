THE SCRIPTVRES HARMONY: Containing A briefe, plaine, and perfect computation of the yeeres and times from the Creation of Adam, unto the death and passion of our blessed Lord and Savi∣our Iesus Christ, according to the Scriptures; As followeth.
FRom the Creation of ADAM unto the ceasing of NOAH'S Flood, are 1656. yeeres. FOR, Adam was 130 yeeres old when he begat Seth. Gen. 5. vers. 3. Seth at 105 yeeres begat Enos. Verse 6. Enos at 90 yeeres begat Cainan. Verse 9. Cainan at 70 yeeres begat Mahalaleel. Verse 12. Mahalaleel at 65 yeeres begat Jared. Verse. 15. Iared at 162 yeeres begat Enoch. Verse 18. Enoch at 65 yeeres begat Methuselah. Verse 21. Methuselah at 187 yeeres begat Lamech. Verse 25. Lamech at 182 yeeres begat Noah. Verse 28. 29. Noah was 600 yeeres old when the Flood was upon Ch. 7. ver. 6. the earth. THE waters of the Flood began in the sixe C. 7. v. 10. 11. C. 8. v. 13. hundred yeere of Noah's life, in the se∣cond moneth, the seventeenth day of the moneth, and were dried up in the sixe hundred and one yeere, in the first moneth, the first day of the moneth. So that the Flood continued ten moneths and thir∣teene
dayes; which being the same with the sixe hundreth yeer of Noah, are not to be accompted. The said times accompted are 1656 yeeres. From the ceasing of NOAH's Flood unto ABRAHAMS departing from VR of the Chaldees, are 362. yeeres. FOR, Shem Noah's sonne, begat Arphaxad 2 yeeres after Ch. 11. vers. 10. the Flood. Arphaxad at 35 yeeres begat Salah. Verse 12. Salah at 30 yeeres begat Eber. Verse 14. Eber at 34 yeeres begat Peleg. Verse 16. Peleg at 30 yeeres begat Reu. Verse 18. Reu at 32 yeeres begat Serug. Verse 20. Serug at 30 yeeres begat Nahor. Verse 22. Nahor at 29 yeeres begat Terah. Gen. 11. v. 24. Terah at 70 yeeres begat Abraham. Verse 26. Reasons why it cannot be admitted that TERAH begat ABRAHAM at 130. yeeres old. FIrst, because we must then grant, that there were two promises made by God unto Abraham; The
one before his departure out of Ur of the Chaldees; The other after Terah's death, before his departure out of Haran: Which is a meere conceit, and can∣not be proved out of the Scriptures. For Saint Ste∣phen by repeating the words of Moses, Get thee out Acts 7. v. 2. 3, 4 Gen. 12. v. 1. of thy Countrey, &c. shewes plainly, that Moses and he did both speake of one and the same promise, which (he expressely saith) was made in Mesopota∣mia (containing at that time the land of the Chaldees) before Abraham dwelt in Charran. And indeed had Saint Stephen at that time spoken any thing differing from Moses (though by divine revelation, yet) he Sr. W. Ral. Hist. l. 1. c. 1. Sect. 3. had offered the Jewes, his accusers, too great an oc∣casion of scandalizing him, and the Gospel of Christ. Secondly, because we must then admit, that Mo∣ses, who so punctually and largely has set downe the life of Abraham, did leave out, and not at all mention the first and chiefe promise made by God unto Abraham: which would savour of no lesse im∣piety then improbability. Thirdly, because the last and best English Tran∣slations, render not the words of Moses thus; Terah Gen. 12. v. 1. died in Haran. And the Lord saith, or, then the Lord said; but, Now the Lord had said unto Abraham, in the Preterpluperfect Tense, shewing, that the Lord had made this promise before Terah's death, and (as Saint Stephen saith) in the land of the Chaldees. Juni∣us and Tremelius translate it by the Preterpluper∣fect Tense Dixerat enim: So Beza annot. in Act. 7. Ʋatahl. in a. locum. And Vatablus a learned Hebrician confirmes it, He∣braicè
per futurum legitur, quod pro praeterito perfecto ponitur: & perfectum pro plusquam perfecto; Lege Actor. caput▪ 7. in principio. Vertendum igitur, I am verò dix∣erat Dominus. And as Gods promise, so Abraham's departure out of Haran, was also before Terah's death. Nei∣ther doth the relation of it after the death of Terah any way hinder: For the Scriptures do fre∣quently Judg. 10. v. 5. 6. 8. So c. 13▪ v. 24. &c. 15. v. 20. compared with c. 13. v. 1. So Num. 9. v. 1. compared with c. 1. v. 1. So Ezek. 26. v. 1. comp. with c. 26. v. 1. Gen. 25. 1. Gen. 2. v. 3. 22. &c. 3. comp. with c. 1. v. 27. So Jer. 26. v. 1. compared with c 25. v. 1. So c. 49. v. 34. compared with 2. 39. v. 1. So Dan. 7. v. 1. comp. with c. 5 v. 30. in Story place that after, which was done before in time. As we know, that the eighteene yeeres wherein the Phili∣stines and Ammonites oppressed Israel, were in the daies of Jair the Judge, yet it is said, And Jair died, and was buried in Camon. And the children of Israel, &c. where the story of the oppression is placed af∣ter Jairs death. So Abraham's taking another wife, is mentioned after the death of Sarah, which was long before her death, in her time. So the relation of the making of woman, and the fall of man fol∣lowes after the seventh day, yet we know, that both were created on the sixth day. The Prophets, especi∣ally Jeremiah & Daniel, afford many such examples. Fourthly, because it cannot be inferred out of Saint Stephens words, that Abraham departed not out of Haran till his fathers death: for he saith, from thence when his father was dead, , God transplanted him, that is, fully and absolutely remo∣ved him into this Land, tam animo quam corpore; Flac. Illyr. Gloss. in Act. 7. v. 4. Vide Genebrard Chronol. l. 1. which indeed could not be before his fathers death,
because of the duty and naturall affection, which he did and ought to beare unto his Father. So that he departed thence at 75. yeeres old, as Moses saith: but was not transplanted thence till his fathers death, as Saint Stephen saith, at which time Abraham was 135. yeeres old. Fifthly, because the Scriptures set downe pre∣cisely, that Terah lived 70. yeeres and begat Abraham, Gen. 11. v. 16. Nahor, and Haran. Now if the 70. yeeres be not refer∣red to Abraham, then they are inserted ambiguously, and to no purpose. Ambiguously, because it cannot be determined whether they belong to Nahor or Ha∣ran. And to no purpose, because what matter is it to the continuance of the Church (which was the scope of Moses in that Chapter) to mention how old Terah was when he begat Nahor or Haran, who were Idolaters, and not of the Church? Sixthly, because we must then admit that it was no wonder that Abraham should beget a child at 100 yeeres old; whereas the Scriptures record it for an extraordinary act of Gods power, beyond the course of nature. Shall a child (saith Abraham) be Gen. 17. v. 17. borne unto hm that is an hundred yeeres old? Therefore C. 18. v. 11. 12. Sarah laughed within her selfe, saying, After I am wax∣ed old, shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also? Abraham's age (as well as her owne) was the cause of Sarah's laughter. And Saint Paul saith, there sprang even of one and him as good as Heb. 11. v. 12. dead, so many as the Starres of the skie in multi∣tude.
Nay more, He considered not his owne body now dead, when he was about 100 yeeres old. Rom. 4 v. 19. Whence it is cleere, that Abraham's strength of na∣ture was in his hundreth yeere quite spent, his body was unable to beget children; and therefore the wonder was wrought on him, as well as on Sarah. But in truth I cannot see, how they should ac∣count this a wonder, who give Abraham a wife and sixe sonnes of her after Sarah's death; the eldest of whom should we suppose that Abraham begat him Gen. 17. v. 17. compared with C. 23. v. 1. the same day that Sarah died, must be begotten in the 137 yeere of Abraham's age: and (if some may be credited) all six were begotten in lesse then foure Sr. W. R. Hist. l. 1. c. 1. Sect. 4. yeeres. Sed ex uno absurdo mille sequuntur. Seventhly, because the best Writers and Chro∣nologers affirme, That Terah begat Abraham at 70. yeeres old. As, Joseph. Ant. l. 1. c. 7. Euseb. Chron. fol. 6. August. quaest. 25. in Gen. Beda de 6. aetat. mundi. Func. fol. 20. Bucholz. pag. 4. Calvis. pag. 35. Hen. Buntingus. fol. 22. Christ. Helvic. fol. 3. Isaacs. fol. 30. Neverthelesse Abraham was not the eldest, but the younger sonne of Terah, and is placed first, be∣cause Compare Gen. 11. v. 29. with C. 17. v. 17. of his excellency and dignity. Abraham departed from Ur of the Chaldees when he was 70. yeeres old. His departure was immediately after Gods Cove∣nant with him, Acts 7. v. 2, 3, 4. which is implyed, Gen. 11. v. 31. and c. 12. v. 1. Now Gods Cove∣nant
was when Abraham was 70. yeeres old. For from the Covenant to the Law were 430. yeeres; but from the 75. of Abraham to the Law, were but Gal. 3. v. 17. 425. yeeres; Therefore the Covenant (and so his departure out of Ur) must be five yeeres before, which was in his 70. yeere. The said times accompted are 362 yeeres. From Abraham's departing from Vr of the Chaldees, unto the departing of the children of Israel out of Egypt, are 430. yeeres. FOR, Abraham going forth from Ur of the Chaldees Gen. 11. v. 31. c. 12 v. 4, 5. Be∣za in Act. 7. v. 2. 4. 6. came unto Haran, alias Charran, in Mesopotamia, where he dwelt 5 yeeres; and so (leaving his father Terah) was 75. yeeres old when he departed thence into the land of Canaan. Note, that as in the loines of Adam all men sinned; Rom. 5. v. 12. Heb. 7. v. 9. 10. and as in the loines of Abraham the Levites paid tithes: So the children of Israel in Abraham went forth from Gen. 12. v. 6. 9. 10. Ur of the Chaldees towards Egypt, and passed thorow the land of Canaan, journeying still towards the South, untill they came into Egypt. Isaac was borne unto Abraham when he was 100. C. 21. v. 5. yeeres old, and in the 25 yeere after his de∣parture out of Haran.
Isaac was 60 yeeres old when Rebekah bare C. 25. v. 26. Jacob. Iacob, alias Israel, went into Egypt with all Gen. 32. v. 28. C. 47. v. 9. his family, when he was 130 yeeres old. The children of Israel were in Egypt 210 Joseph. ben Go∣rion de Stat. Macca. Et Hebr. pleri{que} omnes, quibus potissi∣mum in Chroni∣cis credendum. Lyra in Gen. 15 v. 13. Beza in Act. 7. v. 6. yeeres. Which was by their father Jacob Prophe∣tically implied in this word, Descend yee, or, Get you downe; the letters whereof in Hebrew , signifie 210. Gen. 42. v. 2. (These 210. yeeres may be thus set forth in particular. Kohath with his father Levi came into Egypt: Gen 46. v. 8. 11 Exod. 6. v. 18. unto whom Amram was borne about 60. yeeres after. Amram was 70. yeeres old when Moses was C. 2. v. 1. 2. 10. C. 6. v. 20. Epiphan. l. An∣corat. borne unto him. Moses was 80. yeeres old when he conducted Compare Num. 10. v. 11. 12. &c. 13. v. 26. with Deut. 2. v. 14. &c. 34. v. 7. the children of Israel out of Egypt. The time of the ten plagues of Egypt is the same with the latter part of the eightieth yeere of Moses, Exod. 7. vers. 7. And it is necessarily concluded Exod. 7. v. 19. to c. 12. v. 29. from those many testimonies of Moses his being in
the Wildernesse 40. yeeres. Wherefore Saint Ste∣phen, Joseph. Antiqu. l. 2 c. 6. Acts 7. v. 30. did not there intend a full and compleat expiration of 40. yeeres, as he did before, verse 23.) The said times accompted are 430 yeers, which are mentioned, Exod. 12. v. 40. 41. But when the Scriptures speak of 400. yeeres, as Beza annot in Acts 7. v 6. Gen. 15. vers. 13. and Acts 7. vers. 6. The accompt is to be taken from the birth of Isaac. From the departing of the children of Israel out of Egypt unto the laying of the foundation of Solomons Temple are 480. yeeres. FOR, Moses remained in the Wildernesse 40 yeeres, Deut. 2. v. 7. Psal. 95. v. 10. Amos 5 v. 25. Acts 7. v. 36. 42. &c. 13. v. 18. From the Covenant that God made with Abra∣ham, saying, IN THEE SHAL Gen. 12. v. 3. Acts 3. v. 25. Gal. 3. v. 8. ALL NATIONS BE BLESSED, (upon which he departed from Ur of the Chaldees) unto the giving of the Law Exod. 19 v. 1. 18 &c. 20. v. 1 in Mount Sinai are 430. yeeres and almost three moneths: But the Apostle Gal. 3. v. 17. leaveth out the moneths as an imperfect number.
Ioshua in the 7 yeere after the death of Moses Comp Deut. 2. v. 7. 14. with Josh. 14. v. 7. 10. divided the Land of Canaan; and after that governed 10 yeeres, (which the Scriptures call a long time in respect of Joshua's age) and may Josh. 13. v. 1 &c. 23. v. 1. be proved by deducting the evident and certaine numbers out of the 480. yeeres mentioned, 1 King. 6. vers. 1. Othniel judged Israel 40 yeeres. Judg. 3. v. 11. Under whose government Israel served the Lord Josh. 24. v. 31. Judg 2. v. 7 10. all the dayes Which were 17. yeeres ac∣cording to the Hebrewes; o∣thers say 20. C. 3. v. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. of the Elders, who had seene the great workes of the Lord; But when the Elders were dead, they fell to Idolatry, and much wickednesse: till at last the Lord sold them into the hand of Chushan-Risha∣thaim King of Mesopotamia: by whom being eight yeeres grievously oppressed, they cried unto the Lord, and the spirit of the Lord came upon Othniel their Judge, and he delivered them. Note, that when the Scriptures say the Land had Judg 3. v. 11. rest 40. yeeres, and Othniel died; it is not to be un∣derstood that the Land was in peace 40 yeeres to∣gether under Othniel, but that the Land had rest or peace unto the end of 40. yeeres from the decease of Joshua; Or, untill the fortieth yeere of Othniels Ad annum qua∣dagesinum.

Shamgar, was a deliverer, but no Judge; for the C. 3. v. 31. Scriptures neither mention that he judged, nor that the Land had rest in his daies. Deborah 40 yeeres. C. 5. v 31.

Presently after the death of Deborah, Midian op∣pressed C 6. v. 11. to the 33. Israel: and though Gideon, a mighty man of valour, was in the first yeere of their oppression (otherwise there could not be forty yeeres in his C 8. v. 28. daies) by the Lord in speciall manner called to the government, and had the Lords promise, that he should save Israel from the hands of the Midianites: yet untill the seven yeeres oppression (which God C. 6. v. 1. 34. C. 7. v. 9. 22 23 had appointed) were finished, and untill the spirit of the Lord came upon him, he did not deliver them.
Abimelech 3 yeeres. C. 9. v. 22. Tola 23 yeeres. C. 10. v. 1, 2. Iair 22 yeeres. Verse 3. In the end of the fourth yeere of Jair, the Phi∣listines C. 10. v. 7, 8. C. 11. v. 29. and Ammonites began to vexe and oppresse Israel, which they continued 18. yeeres, untill the Lord raised up Jephthah to deliver them. Iephthah judged Israel 6 yeeres. C. 12. v. 7. About 34. yeeres after that Sihon King of the Num. 21. v. 24, 25, 26. &c. 22. v. 2. compared with c. 33. v. 38. 48. Amorites had fought against the predecessor of Balak the sonne of Zippor King of Moab, and had taken all his Land, even unto Arnon; Israel smote Sihon and all his people, and possessed his Countrey: which was in the last yeere of Moses. From whence unto Jeph∣thah were but 266. yeeres current; yet by adding the yeeres of their owne possession unto Sihon's, whose right they had by the Law of Conquest, Jephthah did justly say, that they had dwelt in or Judg. 11. v. 26. possessed those Countries three hundred yeeres.

And therefore Saint Paul saith, that God gave the Israelites Judges Acts 13. v. 20. , quasi. after a sort 450. yeeres. Samuel and Saul 40 yeeres. See Expositours upon Acts 13. v. 21. 1 Sam. 6. v. 1.

yeers: which were the yeeres of the iniquity of the house Ezek. 4. v. 5. of Israel; for some of the Israelites who were mix∣ed with the Tribe of Judah, remained untill this time. In the end of his reigne Jerusalem was taken. 2 K. 25. v. 2. 3. 8. Here began the Captivity of Judah 2 K. 25. v. 4. to v. 22. 2 Chron. 36. v. 17. to v. 21. Jer. 1. v. 3. &c. 52. v. 27. (commonly called the Captivity of Babylon) with the utter destru∣ction of Ierusalem. The said times accompted are 430 yeeres and 10 dayes. Reasons why it cannot be admitted that the Captivity of Judah (alias the 70 yeeres Captivity) began in the third yeere of Iehoiakim. First, because the fourth yeere of Iehoiakim was the first yeere of Nebuchadnezzar; How then could Nebu∣chadnezzar Jer. 25 v. 1. come up in the third of Iehoiakim? And to say that Nebuchadnezzar began to reign and came up in the end of the third of Iehoiakim, is contrary to the Text alleadged, and also against reason; For what man can imagine, that Nebuchadnezzar should receive his Crowne, raise immediately a mighty
host, subdue all Syria, march afterwards with an Joseph. Antiqu. l. 10. c. 7. Army into Iudea: (which is neere 400. miles from Babylon) the very sight whereof caused Iehoiakim to become his servant, and all this to be done in the ve∣ry 2 K. 24. v. 1. end of the third of Iehoiakim? Secondly, because it is grounded upon nothing but figments and falsities. As, that Jehoiakim was See Broughtons consent of Scriptures. Mores Tables. carried to Babylon, and sent home againe Read Jer. 22. v. 18. 19.: That Daniel and the rest were carried away Captives in the first yeere of Nebuchadnezzar: That Jehoiakim rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar in the sixth yeere of his reigne: That Nebuchadnezzar came not against him till five yeeres after: That the Chaldean King∣dome continued but 70. yeeres; Which they seeke to wrest from the words of Jeremiah, but in vaine; Jer. 25. for though in the fourth of Jehoiakim he prophe∣sieth of the just continuance of the Chaldean King∣dome untill the end of the 70. yeeres Captivity, yet he saith not that the 70. yeeres Captivity began in the fourth of Jehoiakim: for the Scriptures declare that they began not till the end of the reigne of Ze∣dekiah, which was eighteene yeeres after the said prophecy. Thirdly, because the Captivity of Jehoiakim, as also of his sonne, was but a particular Captivity of some few, though (I grant) many Nobles were then carried away. But the Captivity of Judah, or the 70. yeeres Captivity, was not the Captivity of a few, or only of the chief, but of the whole Land of Judah; of Prince and people, with the utter de∣struction of Jerusalem, in the end of the reigne of
Zedekiah. Of this Captivity it is said. So Iudah 2 K. 25. v. 21. was carried away out of their Land. And Je∣hozadak 1 Chr. 6. v. 15. compared with 2 K. 25 v. 18. the sonne of Seraiah went into Cap∣tivity when the Lord carried away Iudah and Jerusalem by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar. Thus Iudah was carried away Captive out Jer. 52. v. 27. of his owne Land. And the word of the Lord came un∣to Jer. 1. v. 1, 2. Jeremiah in the dayes of Iehoiakim, unto the end of eleventh yeer of Zedekiah, unto the carrying a∣way Ierusalem Captive in the fifth moneth. What words can plainer expresse the time when the Captivity of Iudah began? Them that had escaped from the sword carryed 2 Chr 36. v. 20. 21. he away to Babylon: where they were ser∣vants to him and his sons, untill the reigne of the King∣dome of Persia: to fulfill the word of the Lord by the mouth of Ieremiah, untill the Land had enjoyed her Sab∣baths: for as long as shee lay desolate, she kept Sabbath, to fulfill three score and tenne yeeres. See here the 70. yeeres desolation must be fulfilled from this Captivity in the end of Zedekiah. Fourthly, because if Jehoiakim were carried away captive in his third yeere, then must Jeconiah's Cap∣tivity be in the ninth yeere of Nebuchadnezzar. For  Chr. 36. v. 59. Jehoiakim reigned eight yeeres after that, and his
sonne Ieconiah three moneths and ten dayes: But this is contrary to the Scriptures; which say direct∣ly, that Nebuchadnezzar tooke Iehoiachin, alias Ieco∣niah, 2 K. 24. v. 12. in the eighth yeere of his reigne. And Ieremiah saies, in the seventh yeere. Jer. 52. v. 28. Fifthly, because in the last chapter of Ieremiah, where the severall Captivities are reckoned up, there Jer. 52. v. 28 29, 30. is no notice taken of the Captivity of Iehoiakim, nor of the Captives at that time carried to Babylon, be∣ing none but a few children chosen out of cer∣taine of the children of Israel, and of the Kings seed, Dan. 1. v. 3. 4 and of the Princes, such as had ability in them to stand in the Kings Palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans. Whereas the Captivity of Zedekiah is there, and also in the 39. Chapter, and in the latter booke of the Kings and Chronicles largely related, as being the grand and most remarkable Captivity, The Captivity of Iudah. From the beginning of the Capti∣vity of Babylon unto the Comman∣dement to restore and to build Jeru∣salem againe, are 152. yeeres. FOR, 2 Chr. 36. v. 21 Jer 25. v. 11 &c. 29. v. 10. Dan. 9. v. 2. The Captivity continued 70 yeeres. The next yeere after, being the first yeere of
King Cyrus, Israel returned from Captivity. Ezra 1. v. 1 They began to build the Temple in the second Ezra 3. v. 8. yeere of the said Cyrus, And it was finished in 29 yeeres after, which was the sixth yeere of King Darius, the son of Hystaspes. C. 6. v. 15. Of this Temple it was prophecied, that the glory thereof should be greater then of the former; wch was, Hag. 2. v 9. not in respect of the beauty in building, but because of the presence of the Messiah, our Saviour, who John 18. v 20. should teach therein. Artaxerxes in the end of his seventh yeer, which Ezra 7. v. 8. 11 was 52 yeeres after the finishing of the Temple, sent Ezra, and gave him Commission to restore and to build Jerusalem againe. Here began the 70. weeks revealed by the Angel Gabriel unto Daniel. Dan. 9. v. 21. 24 The said times accompted are 152 yeeres. Reasons why it cannot be admitted that Daniels 70. weeks should be ac∣compted from the first yeere of King Cyrus. The one is, because the Angel saith expressely,
that the 70. weeks must be accompted from the go∣ing forth of the Commandement to restore and Dan. 9. v. 25. to build Jerusalem: which Commandement was not given forth by Cyrus; for the Commissi∣on of Cyrus (twice rehearsed by Ezra) was onely Ezra. 1. & 6. to build the Temple. And though it be also true, that Cyrus gave Commandement to build Jerusalem, yet Esa. 44. v. 28. &c. 45. v. 13. he gave not Commandement to restore Jerusalem: Whereas that Commandement which the Angel spake of, was both to restore and to build Jerusalem. This was given forth by Artaxerxes in the seventh Ezra 7. v. 11. yeere of his reigne; As may be seene by the tenour of Ezra his Commission. For Ierusalem was then re∣stored when the Lawes were taught, and Religion established: and it was then built, when Magistrates and Iudges were set therein. Without Religion Ie∣rusalem could not be restored: without Magistrates it could not be called a City. To settle both these, Ezra onely received authority and had Commande∣ment. The other reason is, because the Assertors of this opinion, when they come to particulars, doe grosse∣ly rend in sunder all Histories, especially of the Per∣sian Monarchy; and are forced to build on their own phansies. As, That Cyrus after he took Bahel, Broughtons Ad∣vertisement of corruption, pag. 11. See Mr. Mores Tables. reigned but three yeeres: Cambyses after his fathers death foure: But Mr. More will have it that Camby∣ses reigned with his father sixe yeeres, and one after his fathers death. Both alike true. For if Cyrus and Cambyses reigned so short a time, how could Camby∣ses,
the Prince of the Kingdome of Persia, withstand Dan. 10. v. 13. compared with v. 1. the building of the Temple 21. yeeres, as the Scrip∣tures affirme; and are so understood even by Mr. Broughton himselfe? Broughton ibid. That Darius the sonne of Hystaspes (sirnamed A∣hasuerus) hindered the building of the Temple; who See Broughtons consent of Scripture, Anno Mun. 3560. And Mr. Mores Tables. is generally acknowledged to be the finisher Joseph. An∣tiqu l. 11 c. 4. Func. fol. 65. Bucholz. pag. 34 Sir W Ral Hist. l. 3. c. 5. Sect. 3. Ezra 4. v. 6. ther∣of: and whose great favour and liberality unto the Jewes is not onely set forth in the Book ef Esther, but also in prophane histories. And though it be true, that in the beginning of the reigne of Ahasuerus they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Iudah and Ierusalem: yet this accusation was so farre from hindering the building of the Temple, that it pro∣cured from Darius, alias Ahasuerus, a Decree for the speedy finishing thereof. C. 6. v 1. unto v. 13. That Artaxerxes, mentioned in the seventh of Ezra, was the same Darius mentioned before in the Broughtens Ad∣vertisement; and Consent. sixth chapter, in whose reigne the Temple was fini∣shed. But this cannot be. For Ezra ending his sto∣ry of Darius in the sixth chapter begins his seventh thus: Now after these things in the reigne of Artax∣erxes King of Persia, &c. Which words shew plain∣ly that he spake of another King, and of things done long after Darius. Besides, in the seventh yeere of Artaxerxes, Ezra had Commission to set Magistrates Ezra 7. v. 8. 25. and Iudges over the people, which could not be the next yeere after the finishing of the Temple, unlesse we will suppose that Zerubbabel the Governour, and Hag. 1. v. 1. Zech 4. v. 6. Ieshua the High-Priest, and the other Magistrates, did all die together on a sudden, as soon as the Tem∣ple was finished.
That Xerxes hindered the building of the Temple; Broughtons Ad∣vertisement pag. 12. 13. That Artaxerxes Longimanus was brother to Xerxes; whom all Histories with one consent declare to be his sonne: That he reigned but 36. yeeres: that Ar∣taxerxes Mores Tables. Mnemon reigned 11. yeeres with his father, and 10. alone; and infinite such like absurdities. Neither can they excuse themselves, because of the diversity of Writers touching the time of these Kings. For the best and soundest Writers doe not differ: and that which is, and hath from time to time beene generally received, must be taken for truth. But Vincent. Ler. contra Haeres. c. 3. these follow none at all, and cannot so much as find one pur-blind Author to countenance their inventi∣ons. And therefore they doe cautiously omit the particular accompt of Daniels 70. weeks. But Mr. More tels us, that Daniels 70. weeks must needs begin at the very end of their 70. yeeres captivi∣ty, Mores Tables. pag. 94, 95. or else the analogie of their 70. yeeres captivity, and 7. times 70. yeeres liberty, could not stand: and also the comfort were not so forcibly brought by the Angel, if there were any meane time betweene the end of their captivity, and the beginning of their liberty. To resolve this, we must know, that An analogy is a proportion, similitude, or resemblance, which one thing hath unto another. Now that any intervenient time can destroy an analogie, is a meere paradoxe. For in matter of proportion and similitude, neither time nor place are considerable. Betweene the Pas∣chall Exod. 12. v. 3. 21. Luke 23. v. 33. Lamb in the first Passeover, and the passion of Christ the Lamb of God, there was a true analogy: yet there interceded 1552. yeeres. Betweene the
lifting up of the Serpent in the Wildernesse, and the lifting up of the Sonne of man, there was a true Numb. 21. v. 9. John 3. v. 14. analogy: yet there interceded 1512. yeeres. Be∣tweene Jonas his being three dayes and three nights Jona 1. v. 17. Matth. 12. v. 40 in the Whales belly, and the Sonne of man his be∣ing three dayes and three nights in the heart of the earth, there was a true analogy: yet there interceded about 820. yeers. Between Christs suffering, and the signes now administred in the Lords supper, there is a true analogy: yet the time since He suffered is more then 1600. yeeres. Therefore it is manifest, that the analogy betweene Judah's 70. yeeres Captivi∣ty and Daniel's 70. weekes may well stand, though the weeks doe not immediately begin in the end of the Captivity. Nor does any meane time betweene the Jewes Captivity, and their liberty, diminish the comfort thereof more then the 46. yeeres till the Israelites were peaceably possessed of the Land of Canaan, di∣minished their comfort of being freed from Egypt the house of bondage. From the commandement to restore and to build Jerusalem againe, unto the death and passion of our Lord and Saviour JESUS CHRIST, are 490. yeeres. FOR, It is expressely declared unto Daniel, that from Dan. 9 v. 25.
the going forth of the Commandement to restore, and to build Jerusalem, unto the Messiah, The Prince, shall be 7 weeks (so long it was before the Reformation could be fully perfected & Religion e∣stablished) and 62 weeks (which make 69. weeks) and Verse 26. 27. after 62. weeks, in the week following (which added to the said 69. maketh full 70. weeks) shall Mes∣siah So Numb. 14. v. 34. So Ezek. 4. v. 5, 6. So Dan. 10. v 13 So Revel. 2. v. 10. be cut off, and He shall confirme the Covenant, &c. Now accompting each day for a yeere (as the Scriptures doe frequently) 70. weeks do amount unto 490 yeeres. The full time from the Creation of Adam, unto the death and pas∣sion Which Ezek. might happily intend by 4000 Cubites c. 47. v. 3, 4, 5. of our Lord and Saviour IESUS CHRIST, is 4000 yeeres and 10 dayes.
A particular proofe of the times from the beginning of the Cap∣tivity of Babylon unto the death and passion of our blessed Saviour IESUS CHRIST, whereby the former computation, as also many places of the Scriptures, are cleared. The first Monarch of Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar reigned 45 yeeres. Comp. 2 K. 24. v 12. with c. 25 v. 27. Jer. 25. v. 1. He began to reigne in the end of the fourth yeere of Jehoiakim King of Judah.

Jer. 52 v. 12. 27 of the nineteenth yeere of his reigne; or, as it is, Ier. 52. v. 29. in the end of the eighteenth yeere. From the finding of the booke of the Law in the 2 K. 22. v. 3. 8. 18. of Iosiah, unto the last carrying away of the Jewes into Captivity in the three and twentieth yeere Jer. 52. v. 30. of Nebuchadnezzar, are 40. yeeres; which was the Ezek 4. v. 6. time of the iniquity of the house of Iudah.

One Argument Mr. Broughton brings, wherewith (as he conceives) he disproveth al computations but his owne; and it is drawne from the ages of Zerub∣babel, Jeshua, Mordecai, Ezra, and Nehemiah; which See Broughtons consent of Scripture. (saith he) must be stretched beyond all likelihood, if the Kingdome of Persia continued above 130. yeeres. As to Zerubbabel. Jeremiah tels us, That Jehoi∣akim, alias Jeconiah, was brought forth of prison in Jer. 52. v. 31. 33, 34. the 37. yeere of his Captivity, which was the 26. yeere of the Captivity of Judah; and did eate continually before the King of Babylon, untill the day of his death: which admit to be two yeeres after; then were 28. yeeres of Judah's Captivity passed. Salathiel, alias Matth 1. v. 12. 1 Chr. 3. v. 18, 19. Shealtiel, was the sonne of Jeconiah by succession: Salathiel begat Pedaiah, Pedaiah begat Zerubbabel. Now admit, that Salathiel immediately after he succeeded Jeconiah, begat Pedaiah, and that Pedaiah at 24. yeeres also begat Zerubbabel, (which probably was not sooner) then was Zerubbabel 18. yeeres old in the first yeer of King Cyrus, and 48. when the Tem∣ple was finished, in the reigne of Darius Hystaspes.
As to Jeshua. He was the sonne of Jozadak, alias Ezra 3. v. 2. 1 Chr. 6. v. 14, 15. 2 K▪ 25 v. 18. 21 Jehozadak, the sonne of Seraiah, the chiefe Priest, who was slaine by Nebuchadnezzar. Now admit that Jehozadak was ten yeeres old when he was carried into Captivity, and that 30. yeeres after he begat Jeshua; then was Jeshua 40. yeeres old in the first yeere of Cyrus, and 70. when the Temple was fi∣nished. As to Mordecai. Admit that he was five yeeres Esth. 2. v. 6. old when he was carried away Captive with Jeco∣niah, then was he 122. yeeres old in the 12. yeere C. 3. v. 7. of Ahasuerus, when the two daies of Purim were by the Decree of Queene Esther made feastivall; after C. 9. v. 1. 32. which should he live eight yeeres, he then died at the age of 130. which was not unlikely in those 2 Chr. 24. v. 15 times. As to Ezra. Admit that he was five yeeres old when his father Seraiah the chiefe Priest was slaine, then was he 170. yeeres old in the 20. of Artaxerxes Longimanus, when he read and instructed the people in Neh. 2. v. 1 &c. 8. v. 3. 13. the words of the Law: after which, should he live ten yeers (though peradventure he lived not one yeer) he then died at the age of Isaac 180. yeers old. And what unlikelihood is there but that God for the good of Gen. 35. v. 28. his Church might as well preserve Ezra unto this age, as he did Phinehas the sonne of Eleazar to a far Moses Aegyptius in suo Misna, ut citatur l. 2. chr. Genebr. greater, whom the Jewes affirme to have lived 300. yeeres? Nor will it further extend the age of Ezra to shew, that Ezra went into the Chamber of Johanan, and that he wrote the Books of the Chronicles in
Johanan's time. For Johanan, alias Ionathan, was the sonne of Iehoiada, the sonne of Eliashib, the sonne of Ioi∣akim, Neh. 12 v. v. 10 11. the sonne of Ieshua. Now admit each of these to be begotten in the thirtieth yeere of their fathers age, (observing what we spake before concerning Ieshua) then was Iohanan borne in the fifth yeere of Artaxerxes Longimanus; and so Ezra might very well in the beginning of Artaxerxes his eighth yeere go into the chamber of Iohanan, who was then about Ezra 10. v. 6. three yeeres old. And what hinders but that he might write the sonnes of Levi, the chief of the fathers, Neh. 12. v. 23. in the Booke of the Chronicles, even untill the dayes of Iohanan, seeing he lived in the 20. of Artaxerxes, at which time Iohanan was 15. yeeres old? But if Mr. Broughton may prevaile, the said Priests shall be much more forward in procreation. For he will allow but 87. yeeres from the Captivity of Ze∣dekiah See Broughtons consent of Scripture. unto the 7. of Artaxerxes. Whence it follows, that though ten yeeres be granted to Iehozadak at the time of Captivity, yet every one of them must begin to beget children before 19. yeeres old, other∣wise Iohanan could not be borne when Ezra came to Ierusalem. True it is, Nehemiah saith, that the Levites and Priests were recorded unto the reigne of Darius, but by Neh. 12. v. 22. whom this was done, he tels not; it is plaine, not by Ezra, for he wrote but untill the dayes of Iohanan. 1 Chr. 9. com∣pared with Neh. 11. And though Nehemiah concludes, these were in the daies of Joiakim, and in the dayes of Nehemiah the Governour, and of Ezra the Priest, the Scribe; yet it C. 12. v. 26. cannot be understood, that they were all of them
in every one of their daies, for that is impossible: but that all of them were in all their daies; some in the daies of Joiakim, some in the dayes of Ezra, some in the daies of Nehemiah. As to the age of Nehemiah. Admit that he was 25. yeeres old when he came to Jerusalem, and lived unto the end of the Persian Monarchy, he was then Neh. 2. v. 11. 130. yeeres old when he died, which is nothing un∣likely. Func. fol 74. Thus we have the continuance of the Persian Kingdome unto 210. yeeres, and probably the ages of Zerubbabel, Ieshua, Mordecai, Ezra, and Nehemiah; without the diminution of the one, or stretching of the other beyond reason. The first Monarch of Grecia. Alexander the Great, after the full over∣throw Justin. l. 11. Bacholz. pag. 53. of Darius, reigned 7 yeeres. Upon his death-bed he parted his Kingdome a∣mong 1 Mac. 1. v. 6. 9. Dan. 11. v. 5. to the 30. his servants, such as were honourable; who all after his death put Crownes upon themselves, and soone fell into warres one against another. Of whom the chiefest were foure: Seleucus King of Sy∣ria, Joseph. Antiqu. l. 12. c 1. Justin. l. 13. Sleidan. l. 1. Dan. 7. v. 6 c. 8. v. 8. 21, 22. &c. 11. v. 3, 4. Ptolomeus of Egypt, Antigonus of Asia the lesse, and Cassander of Macedon. And of these the two former excelled in power: between whom what leagues and conflicts should be, Daniel foretold un∣der the names of The King of the North, and the King Dan. 11. of the South. For Syria lieth Northward, and Egypt
Southward, from Judea. The whole chapter is para∣phrased by Joseph Hall Bishop of Exceter. Note, That the Grecian Kingdome Func. fol. 75. Bucholz. pag. 56 so often mentioned in the Books of the Maccabees, began 13 yeeres compleat after the death of Alex∣ander the Great. Antiochus sirnamed Epiphanes, sonne of Dan. 8. v. 23. &c 11. v. 21. 1 Mac. 1. v. 10. 2 Mac. 4. v. 7. Joseph. Antiqu. l. 12 c. 5. Antiochus King of Syria, a King of fierce countenance, a vile person, that wicked root, after his brother Se∣leucus was dead, began to reigne in the end of the 137 yeere of the Grecian Kingdome. On the eighth day of the fifth moneth in the 141. Dan. 8. v. 11, 12 13. 1 Mac. 1. v. 13, 14. 15. 21. to the end of the ch. &c. 2. v. 6. to the 16. Joseph. Antiqu. l. 12. c. 7, 8. yeere, the transgression of desolation began, and the daily sacrifice decaied by the grosse idolatry of those, who (with the licence of Antiochus) joyned them∣selves to the Heathen, and were sold to do mischief. And in the 143. yeere, he took Jerusalem, polluted the Sanctuary, hindered, and afterwards forbad the daily Sacrifice, and compelled the Jewes to all man∣ner of ambition. Whom Mattathias the Priest for 1 Mac. 2. v. 1. 19 to the 48. & v. 66. 70. &c. 3. v. 1, 2. Joseph. l. d. c. 8. some times couragiously and prosperously resisted; but he quickly deceasing, Judas Maccabeus (accor∣ding to his appointment) rose up in his stead, and became both the Captaine and Governour of Ju∣dea, in the end of the 146. yeere of the Grecian King∣dome, Antiochus having then reigned 9 yeeres.
Iudas, sirnamed Maccabeus, was slaine in 1 Mac. 9. v. 3. 18 Joseph. l. d. c. 9. & 19. the end of the first moneth of the 152. yeere, having governed 5 yeeres and 1 moneth. In the second yeere of his government on the 1 Mac. 4. v. 36. 10 he 60. five and twentieth day of the ninth moneth, in the 148. yeer, he finished the cleansing of the Sanctuary, and restored the daily Sacrifice. So that from the time that the transgression of desolation began, and the daily Sacrifice decaied, unto the cleansing of the Sanctuary, and the full restoring of the Sacrifice, are 6. yeeres 3. moneths, and 17. dayes; which containe those 2300. dayes revealed unto Daniel. Dan. 8. v. 13. 14. 1 Mac. 12. v. 48. &c. 13. v. 12. 23. compare c. 11. v. 19. 20. with c. 13. v. 41, 42. Func. Chr. f. 83. Bucholz. p. 79.

Antiqu. l. d. d. c. 15. & 18. governed 31 yeeres. Aristobulus, who was the first that Crowned Joseph. l. d. c. 19 himselfe King of Judea, reigned 1 yeere.
Alexander, sirnamed Ianneus, 27 yeeres. Ioseph. l. d. c. 20 & 23. Salome, whom the Greeks call Alexandra, Ioseph. l. d. c. 24. the wife of the said Alexander, reigned 9 yeeres. Aristobulus, compelling his brother Hyrcanus Ioseph. l. 14. c. 1 & 8. the High-Priest, to submit unto a private life, took upon him both the Kingdome and Priest-hood; but in the third yeere of his reign he was taken prisoner by Pompey, and carried to Rome. Presently after, Gabinius the Romane Generall, Ioseph. l. d. c. 10. vanquishing Alexander the son of Aristobulus, ere∣cted five seats of Justice; The first at Jerusalem, the second at Gadar, the third at Amatho, the fourth at Jericho, the fifth at Saphor in Galilee, and so changed the Kingdome into an Aristocracy; which was im∣mediately Ioseph. l. d. c. 11. interrupted by Aristobulus, who escaped from Rome, but was soone taken by the said Gabini∣us, and againe sent back. Aristobulus reigned (including the time of his Ioseph. ibid. Captivity) 3 yeers and 6 moneths Afterwards the said Aristocracy continued Ioseph: l. d. c. 15. schol. illustrat. 15 yeeres and 6 moneths.

At that time Augustus made a Decree that all the world should be taxed. Note, That when Jacob said, the Scepter shall not depart from Judah, untill Shiloh come, It is not
to be understood that the Crowne should continue in the Tribe of Judah from the time of the said Pro∣phecy untill Christs comming. For before David Calvin. institut. l. 1. c. 8. Sect. 7. the Prophecy tooke no effect; And after Zedekiah, even untill the Maccabees (excepting onely Zerubba∣bel Neh. 5. v. 14. 15 Ezek. 21. v. 25, 26, 27. Genebr. Chr. l. 1. and Nehemiah, who yet were no Kings, nor ab∣solute Governours) it is altogether uncertaine who ruled in Judea: and from the Maccabees untill Christ, it is manifest the supreme authority was not in the Tribe of Judah. The true sense thereof is, That af∣ter Davids reigne, in whom the Prophecy first took effect, The Scepter, that is, the right and just title un∣to Comment. vulg. in 1. Matth. the Crowne, should not depart from the Tribe of Iudah untill Christ came; which is clearely proved Matth. 1. v. 1. to the 17. by Saint Matthew. But at our Saviours birth or com∣ming the Jewes were not onely dispossessed of the Baron. apparat. ad Annal. Eccl. Chemnit. Harm. Evangel. c. 2. Crowne, but also had lost the very right and title thereunto, by swearing fealty unto King Herod not long before: and so Iacobs Prophecy was fully ac∣complished.

Seven yeeres after Augustus confined the said Arche∣laus for his Tyranny unto Vienna a City of France, where he died. Herod, sirnamed Antipas, and Philip,
at the aforesaid division of Herod's Kingdome, were by Augustus made Tetrarchs, the former of Galilee, Luke 3. v. 1. the latter of Iturea, and of the Region of Trachonitis. This Herod beheaded Iohn the Baptist, and was by our Saviour termed a Fox, for his deceit and trea∣chery: Matth. 14. v. 1.

Upon the expiration of the 30. yeere of His age, Luke 3. v 21. 22, 23. comp. with Numb. 4. v. 23. 30. 47. Matth. 4. v. 12. 17. Mark. 1. v. 14. Chemnit. Harm. Evangel. c. 17. &c 22. Ioseph.

He was baptized and entred into His Ministery; though He did not publikely shew Himselfe, till Iohn was cast into prison, which was almost a yeer after. Neither can any inconvenience follow from the season of the yeere, that Christ should then go into the river Iordan to be baptized For in Iudea there is very little winter, and that onely in October, and the beginning of November. And the Scriptures tell us, that on the second day after the Passeover, which was the 16. day of the moneth Abib alias Nisan, and is with us the 27. of March, a sheafe of the first fruits of Harvest was offered. The first Passeover after His Baptisme was about the end of three moneths, Iohn 2. v. 13. 23. The second Passeover is expressed, Iohn c. 5. v. 1. where the word Feast, by way of eminency is put for the Passeover, which was the chiefest feast of the Jewes. So Matth. 27. v. 15. So Iohn 4. v. 45. compared with c. 2. v. 23. So c. 11. v. 56. So c. 12. v. 1, 2. So c. 13. v. 1. 29. The third Passeover, Iohn 6. v. 4. The fourth Passeover, Iohn 13. v. 1.

From whence these particulars are manifest. 1. That from the beginning of the Captivity of
Babylon, unto the first of King Cyrus are 70. yeeres; from thence unto the end of the 7. of Artaxerxes Longimanus are 82. yeeres; which added together, make 152. yeeres. And from thence unto the death and passion of Our Saviour, are 490. yeeres, or, as the Angel informed Daniel, 70. weeks; In the end of Dan. 9. v. 24. which last yeere of the said 490. Our Saviour was crucified. 2. That neere the midst of the last week of the said 70. Our Saviour entering into His Ministery, be∣gan Dan. 9. v. 27. John 4. v. 23. Matt. 27. v. 51. Mark. 15. v. 38 to cause the Sacrifice and the Oblation to cease, but by His death He did utterly abolish them; which was signified when the vaile of the Temple rent in twaine. 3. That neere the 25. day of December, and most August. in Psal: 132. & de Trin. lib 4. 2. Chrysost. in c. Lucae. 1 v. 29. Niceph. Hist. Eccles. l. 1. c. 12. Paul Oros. l. 7. c. 7. Genebr. l. 2. Ba∣ron.

Unto which 9. moneths and 10. daies, adding the 5. dayes before the Creation of Adam, Gen. 1. v. 23. Exod. 12. v. 2. compared with c. 13. v. 4. Beda de ratione Temp. c. 28. & 40. Polan. Synt.
