He toke to his wyfe a kynges doughter that fayre & good¦ly was. and to all people gracyous & to her husbonde ryght dere. and cōcey¦ued of hym and bare hym a sone named Dyoclesian The chylde grewe & of all people was beloued. And whan he was of the aege of seuen yeres. his moder thempresse fyll soreseke / felynge herselfe that she my¦ghte not lyue: sent after her lorde themperour a mes¦senger that he sholde come without taryenge yf euer he wolde see her on lyue. And whan he was comen she sayd vnto hym. O my lorde of this īfyrmyte may I not escape. Wherfore I humbly requyre you of a lytell petycyon before my deth. He answered. Desyre what ye wyll. for I shall nothynge denye you. Then sayd she. After my deth ye shall take an other wyfe as it behoueth. I aske & pray you yt she vpon my son̄ haue no gouernaūce or power. but yt he be kepte and nourysshed fer from her. & yt he may gete to hym con¦nynge and wysdome. The Emperour sayd.

¶ How the Emperoure to the seuen wyse maysters commytted and delyuered his sone to lerne. UPon a tyme as the emperour laye in his bed he bethought hym inwardly vpon his sone sayenge in his herte. I haue only. but one sone / ye whi¦che shall be myn heyre. It is good whyles he is yon¦ge that he be sette to lerne connynge and wysdome by the whyche he maye after my dethe gouerne & ru∣le the empyre. Erly whan he was rysen vp from his bedde. he lete to be called afore hym his lordes of his counseyll. and of them toke aduyse what best therin was to done. And they answerd. Lorde. in Rome are vii. wyse maysters they excelle and excede all other men in cunnynge & lettrature. lete them be sent for & and delyuer to them your sone to nourysshe & to ler¦ne. That vnderstandynge the emperour sent his let∣ters sealed with his seale to ye· vii. maysters that they incontinent sholde come to hym without delay. And they anone came before themperour. and he demaū∣ded them yf they knewe wherfore yt he had sente for them. They answered the cause ne your wyll we kno¦we not / but yf please you to shewe vs your mynde & entent we ben redy to fulfyll it to the vttermoste of our powers. To whome ye noble Emperour sayde. I haue but one sone the which I shal delyuer vnto you to nourysshe and to teche. So that by your doctryne & wysdome he maye the more wysly guyde and go∣uerne yt empyre after my decesse. ¶ The fyrste may¦ster
named Pantyllas sayde. Lorde delyuer too me your sone & I shall teche hym as moche connȳge wtin vii. yere as I and all my felowes can Then spake the seconde mayster that named was Lentulus. Syr of longe tyme I haue serued you. & hytherto I haue had no maner reward. I demaunde nothyng elles of you but that ye delyuer me your sone to lerne and gouer∣ne. and I shall make hym as connynge within .vi. ye∣re as I & all my felowes be. The thyrde mayster sayd that had to name Craton. My lorde many tymes ha¦ue I ben with you vpon the se in peryll of my lyfe / & of you haue I had no maner of rewarde. yf that I my¦ghte for my rewarde obteyne that ye wolde wouche∣sauf to commytte your sone vnder my rule & gouer∣naunce. I sholde enfourme hym as moche within .v. yere. yf his wit therto wyll attayne as I and my felo¦wes can. Tho stode vp the fourth mayster / that to na¦me had Malquydrac ryght lene of body & sayd. My lorde calle to your remembraunce how that I and al my predecessours haue serued emperours. & haue re∣ceyued no maner of rewarde. wherfore I shal aske no¦ne other thȳge but yt ye wyll delyuer me your sone to enfourme & teche / & I shall make hym to take asmo∣che scyence & wysdome within foure yere as I and al my felowes haue lerned in all our lyues. Than spake ye fyfth mayster yt was called Ioseph{us}. lorde I am old & many tym{is} I am called to your coūseyl / & yt my coū¦seyll ye knowe well hath auayled & {pro}fyted you & yet I folowe ye same. But I desyre no more saue to dely∣uer
me your sone & I shal enstructe & enfourme hȳ in as moche conynge & scyence that he wtin .iii. yere shal profyte & wyte as moche as I & alle my felowes. tho came forth the syxte mayster that was named Cleo∣phas whiche sayd lyke the other {pro}mysynge to lerne & enfourme ye chylde in alle theyr connynges wtin two yere. The seuenth muyster rose vp & sayd. which also desyred the chylde & promysed for to lerne hym wtin one yere ye scyences and wysdome of them all. As all this was done. Than the Emperour sayde my trusty frendes I am moche bounden to thanke you all. and euery of you. for that eueryche of you haue so effectu¦elly desyred my sone to nouryssh & lerne. If I sholde now commytte hym to one and not to an other / ther∣of sholde come ye descencyon & varyaunce amonges you. Therfore to you al & euery of you I commyt my sone to nourysshe and to teche. The maysters heryng this wt grete thankȳges gyuynge to the Emperoure toke & receyued his sone. and ladde hym towardes the courte of Rome. ¶ Vpon the waye spake Craton to his felowes. If we this chylde sholde lerne within the Cyte of Rome there is so grete resorte & concourse of people that it sholde hynder & lette hym in his ler∣nynge & fantasyenge. I wote a fayre place withoute rome thre myle ryght pleasaunte & delectable. there lete vs do make a .iiii. square chāber of stone & put hȳ therin & vpō ye walles of ye syde lete vs paȳte & wryte ye .vii. artes lyberales. so yt ye chylde al times may se & beholde therin his doctrine as wel as in his boke & th{is}
aduyse & counseyll pleased theym all. and was done accordynge in euery poynte. The maysters dylygent¦ly euery daye durynge .vii. yere taught & lettred the chylde. whiche maysters determyned amonge them selfe and sayde / It is good yt we examen our dyscy∣ple how he is spedde in connynge & scyence. They al accorded to the same. Tho sayd mayster Pancyllas / howe shall we proue hym. Craton sayde. Lete euery of vs as he slepeth put vnder euery corner of his bed an olyue leue. and than we shall knowe yf he percey∣ued or felte ony thynge or not this done. he wakynge gretely marueyllynge lyftynge vp his eyen towarde ye rofe of the chamber feruently. The maysters seyn¦ge yt sayd. Wherfore lyft ye vp your eyen so sharply He answered it is no merueyll. for in my slepe I saw the vppermost parte of the chamber inclyned towar¦de the erthe. or vnder me it was lyfte vp. This herȳ¦ge ye maysters sayd amonge themselfe. Yf this childe maye lyue he shal be a man of grete connȳge & fame. ¶ How the Emperour by the coūseyll of ye grete prȳ¦ces & lordes of his Empyre wedded an other wyfe.
¶ How themperour toke an other Wyfe a bishop marries the emperor to the king of Castille's daughter
THe prynces and grete lordes of the Empyre in the meane tyme came to the Emperour & sayd. My lorde ye haue only but one sone. it is possy¦ble yt he myght happen to dye. And therfore it were profytable that ye sholde wedde an other wyfe to en¦gendre and make mo chyldren to thentente that the Empyre of Rome be not lefte without heyre. Also ye are so myghty that yf it sholde happen you to gete many chyldren ye may promote & auaunce them all to grete dygnytees and lordshyppes. Therupon an∣swerde themperour. It is your counseyll that I shall take an other wyfe than seke me one yt is gracyous / pure vyrgyne / fayre and gentyll borne. & than shall I folowe your counseyll and aduyse. They wente & sought and serched many kyngdomes and londes. & at the laste they founde the kynges doughter of Casty¦le that ryght fayre was & beateuouse. & her they ga∣ue the Emperour to wyf. She behad her so well that anone in her loue he was taken so sore that he forga¦te and put in oblyuyon all the heuynesse & sorowe of of his herte that he had taken for ye deth of his fyrste wyfe. And they lyued longe togyder wtout chyldren And as Thempresse sawe yt she myght not cōceyue. For she herde yt themperour had a sone wt seuen wy¦se maysters to lerne & nourysshe to ye behouffe {pro}ufy¦te of Thempyre. she thought in herself & wysshed his deth. And from yt houre forth she ymagyned how she myght conspyre his deth. It hapned on a nyght as ye Emperour lay in his bed. he sayd to thempresse. My

WHan themperour perceyued yt his sone was co¦mynge vpon ye waye. he rode with grete Ioye to mete hym. The maysters vnderstandyng the comynge of themperour sayd to the chylde. It is best that we departe. & in the meane whyle we maye {pro}uyde how we may saue your lyfe. The chylde sayd it pleaseth me well that ye so doo. but haue mynde of me in tyme of my necessyte. As they that herde. they toke theyr leue and departed towardes ye Cyte. The chylde came after accompanyed ryght honourably. And as he and his fader themperour were mette. for ioye & gladnesse he toke hym about the necke & kyssed hym and sayd. My dere sone how is it with you / is it longe sythen that I sawe you. He bowed down his he¦de and and answerd no thynge. The fader had grete wonder why that he spake not. and thought in himsel¦fe that his maysters had hym so enformed that he ry¦dynge sholde not speke. And whan they were comen to the palays and were descended from theyr horses. The fader toke his sone by the honde & lad hym in to the hall and set hym next hym & behelde him & sayde Say me how it is with your maysters. & how they ha¦ue enformed you. for now it is many yeres syth I saw ou. He enclyned downe his hede & gaue none answe¦re. The fader sayd. wherfore speke ye not to me. And whan thempresse herde that themperours sone was comen she was ryght Ioyous and glad. & sayd I wyl goo to se hym. She apparaylled her with ryche vestu¦re & atyre. & toke with her two of her gentylwymen &

wente there as ye emperour was syttȳge wt his sone she sette her downe by ye chylde. & she sayd to them∣perour is this your sone ye hath ben nourysshed wt ye seuen wyse maysters. & he sayd / it is my sone / but he speketh not. She sayd. Delyuer to me your sone. & if euer he spake I shall do hym speke. Tho sayd them∣perour ryse & go wt her. The sone dyde reuerēce to ye fader. as thoughe he sayd I am redy too accōplysshe your wyll. & went wt her. ¶ Howe thempresse ladde Dioclesyan themperours sone with her in her chamber for to make good chere wt hym the whiche he withstode. THempresse lad hym wt her in to her chamber & commaunded all other to auoyde. & set hym by her afore her bedde & sayd. O my best beloued dy¦oclesyan. I haue moche of your persone & beaute her¦de. but now I am glad yt I may se you wt myn eyen that my herte coueyteth & loueth. for I haue caused your fader to sende for you / that I haue solace & Ioy of your persone. Wherfore I wtout faute gyue you knowlege that. I for your loue vnto this day haue kep¦te my vyrgynyte. Speke to me & lete vs goo bed to¦gyder. But he gaue her no worde to answer. She se∣ynge that sayd to hym. O good dyoclesyan haue the half of my soule wherfore speke ye not not to me / or at ye leest shewe me some token of loue / what shall I do speke to me. I am redy to fulfyll and perfourme your wyll. & whan she had thus sayd she enbraced hȳ & wold haue kyssed hys mouth & he torned his vysa∣ge
from her. & in no wyse wolde cōsent. Tho sayd she ayen to hȳ. O sone wherfore do ye thus wt me: behol∣de there is none yt may se vs. lete vs togyder slepe / & than shall ye well {per}ceyue yt for your loue I haue kept my vyrgynyte. and he torned his vysage frome her / She seynge yt he was of her ashamed. shewed vnto hym her naked body and brestes and sayde. beholde my sone what body I haue att your wylle. gyue me youre consent or elles it shall be herde for me to passe with my ryght mȳde. He neyther wt sygne ne wt coun¦tenaūce of vysage shewed her ony maner of loue. but as moche as he coude wtdrewe hȳ from her. whā she sawe yt she sayd. O my moste swete sone yf it please you not to cōsent to me ne yet speke. haply for some re¦sonable cause. Lo here is paper pen & ynke yf ye wyl not speke wt your mouth than wryte your wyl yf I ony tyme herafter may trust in your loue or not The chylde wrote as hereafter folowed. O lady god forbe¦de yt I sholde defoule my faders orcheyerde. yf I shul¦de defoul it: I wote not what fruyte I shold haue of it. I knowe wel one thȳge yt I sholde syn̄ in ye syghte of god. & I sholde ren in ye maledictyon of my fader. & therfore from hensforth prouoke or styre me no mo¦re therto / Whan she had yt cedule seen & red. she bra∣ke it wt her teth: & tare or rent her clothes wt her nay¦les to her nauyll. & her vysage al to scratched it was al blody. & cast from her al ye ornamētes of her hede & cryed wt a loude voyce: come hither my lord{is} & help me afore yt th{is} rude & euyll body / shame & rauyssh me.
Howe thempresse complayned to themperour of the shame to her done by his sone.
THe Emperour was in his halle and herde the crye & noyse of thempresse. he hastely ranne to¦wardes his chambre & his knyghtes and other of his seruauntes folowed hym after for to see what there was to done. Tho beganne thempresse to crye and to speke to themperour thus. O my lorde haue pyte and compassyon vpon me. beholde this yonge man is not your sone. but ye foulest rybaude & harlot yt euer was borne. & a defouler of wymmen. for as ye knowe wel I lad and brought hym with me in to my chamber. & sholde haue exhorted and caused hym to haue spokē I haue done asmoche therto as I can or may. & why les I with my wordes exhorted and meued hym for to haue spoken. he hath endeuoyred hymself with me to haue synned. & by cause I wolde not to hym consē¦te. but withstode as moche as I myght for to flee the shame. he my vysage hath made all blody. & my ve∣sture and ornamentes of my heed broken & all to tor∣ne. as ye may openly se: And yf ye had not so sone co¦men vnto my callynge / he had accomplysshed in me his mooste foule and worste wyll. whan themperoure this sawe and herd. fulfylled wt grete malyce & wood∣nesse / commaunded his seruauntes that they sholde lede hym to the galowes & hange hym. And after his lordes herde that. sayde / Lorde ye haue no moo but this sone only. It is not good yt ye thus lyghtely putt hym to deth / the lawe is put and ordeyned for trans∣gressours & mysdoers. and yf it be so that he muste de¦ye. lete hym by ye lawe dye leest that it be sayd yt them∣perour
in his grete furour and Ire without lawe and Iustyce he hath put his only sone to dethe. As them∣perour this herde commaunded him to be put in pry¦son vnto the tyme that iugement were gyuen ayenst hym. And whan thempresse vnderstode that the chyl¦de was not put to dethe / she cryed & weped bytterly & wold haue no reste whan the nyght was comen the Emperour entred in to his chamber to go to bed. and founde his wyfe wepynge & sorowyng. To whome he sayde. O my mooste dere lady / for what cause are ye thus sorowfull. She answered. Knowe ye not how yt your cursed sone hath me thus moche shame done & offended / and ye haue commaunded hym too be han¦ged and yet he lyued / & your worde is not performed ne my shame is not wroken. To morowe sayde them¦perour he shall dye by ye lawe. Then sayd she. Shalle he so longe lyue. Then̄e myght it happen to you as it dyd vpon a burgeys of Rome of whome an example is sayd. The Emperoure sayd I praye you shewe me that example. That shall I doo gladly sayd the Em∣presse. ¶ The fyrst example of the Empresse.
this was. The gardyner heryng his mayster obeyed hym. & hewe downe the tree. And as this was done ye yonge plante all holy perysshed and came to nought wherof came grete harme. for whan ye poore & the se¦ke people perceyued yt the tree was so destroyed they cursed all them that were of counseyll & helpers ther∣to / by the whiche they all afore tyme were heled & cu∣red of theyr infyrmytees & maladyes. Then sayd the Empresse vnderstande ye what. I haue sayd. yes ry∣ghte well. than sayd she. I shall declare to you what I haue sayde. The declaratyon of the Example ¶ This tree my lorde betokeneth your moste noble persone / that with your counseyll and helpe many po¦re & seke folke are gretly holpen & conforted. And the yonge ympe that vnder the grete tre is vp growen is your cursed sone that now by his cunnynge begȳnith to growe and studyeth how he fyrste may the armes and bowes of your myght cutte of / and to wynne too hym the londe & praysynge of the people. and ouer yt he ymagyneth to destroy your person that he may hȳ¦selfe reygne. But what shall fall than therof come. all poore and feble people shall curse all them the whiche myght haue destroyed your sone & haue not done it / I counseyll you whyles ye are in your power & helth yt ye destroye hym leste yt the curse of the people fall vp¦on you. Tho sayde the Emperour. ye haue gyuen me good counseyll. To morowe I shall condempne hym to the moost vylest deth that can be thought whan ye
daye was come / ye Emperour went & sate in Iugemē¦te. & commaunded his seruauntes yt they sholde lede his sone to be hanged wt trompettes blowynge in to kenynge of deth. And as themperours sone was lad throughe the Cyte. the comen people began too wepe & crye alas ye onely sone of themperour is lad towar∣des his deth / & therwithall came Pancyllas rydyng vpon a hors ye fyrste mayster. whan the chylde sawe hym / he bowed his hede to hym. as though he had say¦de. Haue mynde vpon me whan ye come afore my fa¦der. se how I am lad to wardes the galowes. Than ye mayster sayd to the seruauntes / make no haste. for I hope by the grace of god this day to delyuer hym frō the deth. Then sayde all the people. O good mayster haste you to ye palays and saue your dyscyple. he smo∣te his hors with ye spores tyll he came to the palays / & kneled before the Emperour & dyde hym reuerence / To whome themperour sayd. It shall neuer be to the good. which answerd I haue deserued a better rewar¦de. The Emperour sayd there lyest yu. for I delyuerd to the & thy felowes my sone well spekynge / & in alle thyng well manered. & now he is dompe & that wors is he wolde haue oppressed my wyf. therfore this day he shall dye. & ye all shall dye a shamefull dethe. The mayster sayd. O lorde as for your sone yt ye saye that he speketh not. yt knoweth god. & without a cause it is not as ye shall vnderstande. And that ye saye more / yt he your Empresse wolde haue defowled. I shall saye you of a trouth. he hath ben in our company by ye spa¦ce
of xvi yeres & we neuer coude perceyue suche thin¦ges by hym. And therfore my dere lorde I shall shew you one thynge that yf ye put your sone to deth for ye wordes of your wyfe. it sholde happen too you wors than to a knyght the whiche that kylled his beste grey hounde thrugh the wordes of his wyfe whiche saued his sone from ye deth Tho sayd themperour to ye may¦ster tell me yt example. The mayster sayd. Lorde that shall I not do / for afore or I coude make an ende ther¦of your sone myght be dede & thenne in vayne & with out fruyte I sholde reherce it. but yf it please you this notable example to here / call ayen her sone tyll to mo¦rowe. & as ye thynke by reason then do with hym you¦re pleasure. As themperour that herde anone he lete the chylde too be called ayen & in the meane tyme be he sette hym in pryson whyles the mayster sholde fy¦nysshe his tale. And then he beganne to saye in suche maner as folowith. The example of the fyrste mayster
the emperor hears a master's example; through the door, his son is seen surrounded by guards
THere was a valyaunt knyght whiche had oon¦ly one soone as ye haue. The whiche he loued so moche that he ordeyned for his kepynge thre nou¦rysshes. the fyrste sholde gyue hym souke & fede hym ye seconde sholde wasshe hym & kepe hym clene. ye thir¦de sholde brynge hym to slepe & to reste. This knygh¦te had also a greyhounde & a fawcon yt he also loued ryghte well. The greyhounde was so good yt he neuer ran too noo game but he toke it. & helde it tyl his may¦ster came. And yf his mayster dysposed hym to go to batayle. yf he sholde not spede in ye batayll / anone as he sholde mounte vpon his horse. ye greyhounde wold take the horse tayll in his mouth & drawe bakwarde / & wolde also cry & howle meruaylously loude. By thi¦se sygnes the knyght vnderstode yf that he sholde spe¦de in his iourneye or not. The faucon was so gentyll and so hardy that he was neuer caste of to his praye but he toke it. This same knyght had grete plesure in iustynge & turneynge. so yt vpon a tyme vnder his ca∣stell he lete proclame a tornement to the whiche came many good lordes and knyghtes. The knyght entred in to ye tourney. & his lady went with her maydens to se it. And as they went out after went the nourysshes & lefte the the chylde lyenge alone in the cradell in the halle where the greyhounde laye nygh the wall. and ye hauke or faucon standynge vpon a perke. In this hal¦le there was a serpente lurkynge or hydde in a hole. to all them of the castell vnknowen. The whiche whā he felte that they were all absent he put out his hede
of his hole. & as he no man sawe but the chylde lyenge in in ye cradell. he went out of his cauerne towardes ye cradell for the chylde to haue slayne. The noble fau∣con seynge that. behelde ye grehounde that was slepȳ¦ge / she made suche a noyse & rustelynge with her win¦ges or feders yt the greyhounde a woke and rose vp. and whan he sawe the serpente nyghe the chylde. ano¦ne ayenst hym he lepte / & they bothe faught so longe togyder. tyll yt the serpente hadde greuously hurted and wounded the greyhounde. that he bled sore. soo ye the erthe about the cradell was al be bled with the blo¦de of the greyhounde. The greyhounde whan that he felte hymselfe so greuously hurted and wounded. ster¦te fyersly vpon the serpente. and faught sore togyder and so egerly. so that betwyne theym the cradell was ouer caste wt the chylde the botome vp warde. And by bycause ye the cradell had foure pomelles or fete they saued the chyldes vysage & his lyfe frome ony hurtȳ¦ge fallynge to wardes the erthe. & what shal I say mo¦re. Incontynent therafter with grete payne the grey∣hounde ouercame & slewe the serpente / & went & layd hym downe ayen in his place & lycked his woundes / And anone after as ye iustes & torneye was done. the nourysshes were the fyrste that came in to ye castell / & as they sawe the cradell reuersed with bloode vppon the erthe enuyronned. and that the greyhounde was also blody. they thought and sayde amonges themsel¦fe that the greyhounde hadde slayne the chylde. and they were not soo wyse as too tourne vppe ayen the
cradell with the chylde for too haue seene what was therof befallen. But they sayd / lete vs fle or ren away leest that oure mayster put or lay the blame vpon vs and slee vs. And as they were thus away rennynge / they met wt the knyghtes wyfe. and she sayd to them wherfore make ye this sorowe / & whether wyl ye ren & they sayde. O lady woo and sorowe be to vs and to you why what is there happened. shewe me. The gre¦hounde they sayd that our lorde & mayster loueth soo moche hath deuoured and slayne youre sone / & lyeth by the wall all full of the bloode. As ye lady this herde she fell to the erthe and began to wepe and crye pyte∣ously: & sayd alas. O my dere sone be ye thus slayne & dede. what shall I nowe make that I haue my onely sone thus loste. her withall came in the knyght frome the torneye. & beholdyng his lady thus cryenge & ma¦kyng sorowe. he demaūded her wherfore that she ma¦de so grete sorowe and lamentacyou. She answered hym. O my lorde youre greyhounde that ye loue soo moche hath slayne your onely sone. & lyeth by the wal sacyate with bloode of the chylde. The knyght huge∣ly angred went in to the hall. & the greyhounde went to hym to mete and to fawne as he was wonte to doo And the knyght dre¦we out his swerde & with one stro¦ke smote of the houndes heede. and went to ye cradell and founde his sone al hole. and by the cradell the ser¦pente slayne. And by dyuers sygnes perceyued that the hounde hadde foughten ayenst the serpent for the saluacyon of ye chylde. Then with grete sorowe & we¦pyng
he tare his here and sayd woo be to me that for the wordes of my wyfe I haue slayne my good grey∣hounde ye whiche hath saued my chyldes lyfe & hath slayne the serpente. Herfore I wyll put my selfe to pe¦naunce & brake his swerde in thre peces. and went to wardes ye holy londe. & abode there all the dayes of h{is} lyfe. Then sayd ye mayster to themperour. Lorde vn∣derstande ye what. I haue sayd. And he answerd and sayde ryght well. The mayster sayd: Yf yt ye do youre sone to dethe for ye wordes of your wyfe. it shall come to you wors than it dyde too the knyght for his grey¦hounde. The Emperour sayde ye haue shewed me a fayre example. & wtout doute this daye shall not my sone dye. Tho sayd the mayster yf ye do so ye do wys∣ly. but I thanke you that ye haue hym spared this da¦ye for my sake: ¶ The seconde complaynte of the Empresse. ¶ Whan ye thempresse herde yt the chylde was not yet deede. She began to wepe bytterly & sate her downe vpon the erthe in ye asshes & wolde not holde vppe her heed. As themperour that herde he entred in to ye chā¦ber & sayd to her. O good wyfe wherfore make ye all this sorowe & trouble your selfe so moche. She sayd demaunde ye me that knowe ye not well what grete despyte & shame yt I haue suffred of your vnhappy so¦ne. & haue {pro}mysed me yt ye shold se iustyse ouer hȳ do¦ne & yet he lyueth of trouth. it shall hapne too you as
it happened vpon a shepeherde & a boore. The empe∣rour sayd. I praye you shewe me that exāple for my lernynge. and she sayd yesterday I shewed one: and I sawe none effecte that therof came. too what entente sholde I now shewe. Neuertheles I shal this notable example telle & declare vnto you / in this maner here after folowynge.

THere was somtyme an Emperour the whiche had a grete foreste / wherin was a bore yt was so cruell & so fell that all men goynge through the fo∣rest he kylled and deuoured. The emperour was ther¦of ryght heuy. and lete to proclame thrugh all his em¦pyre. that who soeuer he was that coude sle the bore sholde haue his oonly doughter too wyfe. & therto his Empyre after his deth. & as this in all places procla∣med was there was not one man founde yt durst me¦dle or intromytte. Than was there a shepeherde why¦che in hymself thought. myght I this bore sle & wyn̄e I sholde not not only auaunce my self. but also al my generatyon & kynred he toke his shepeherdes staf in his honde. and went in to the forest. And as the boore had of hym a syght. he drew hym to wardes the herd man. and he for fere clymmed vpon a tree. Than the bore began to byte and gnawe the tree / so that the her¦de thought shortely that he sholde haue ouer throwe it. This tre was laden wt grete plente of fruyte The herde gadred and plucked therof and cast them to ye boore. In so moche that whan he had fylled hym ther with he put and layde hym downe to slepe. The whi∣che perceyuynge the herde by lytell & lytell he descen∣ded & with the one hande he clawed the bore. & with ye other he helde hym selfe on the tre / & seynge yt the boore slepte soundly & faste. drewe out his knyfe and smo¦te yt bore to ye herte & kylled hȳ. & wedded thēperours dought{er} to his wyf: & aft ye deth of her fad{er} he was ma¦de emperour. tho sayd she my lorde wote ye not what
I haue sayd. He sayd ryght well. Then sayd she. this myghty bore betokeneth your mooste noble persone / ayenst whome maye no man with stande. neyther by wysdom ne with strength. This shepeherde with hys staffe is the persone of your vngracyous sone. which wt his staff of connȳge begynneth to play wt you as ye herdman clawed the bore and made him to slepe & af¦ter kylled hym. In yt same maner ye maysters of your sone by theyr fals fables and narracyons clawe & glo¦se vnto the tyme that your sone slee you. that he may regne. Tho sayd themperour god forbede yt they shol¦de doo too me as they dyde to ye bore. & sayd vnto her this day my sone shall be hanged. And she answered yf ye do so ye do wysely. Than themperour ye seconde tyme syttȳge in iugement. cōmaunded to lede hym to ye galowes & hange hym. And whyles he was goȳge. the seconde mayster came before themperour doynge hym reuerence as it is before shewed in ye comȳge of the fyrste mayster. To whom ye seconde mayster sayd O my lorde themperour yf ye sholde do sle your sone for the wordes of your wyfe it myghte worse come to you than it dyde to a knyght which for the wordes of his wyfe was vniustly put in a pyller. Themperoure sayd. O good mayster tell me how it hapned. And he sayde my lorde I shall not saye it but yf yt ye wyll doo call ayen your sone from ye deth vnto the tyme yt thex¦ample be tolde. the whiche yf it tourne you not frome your purpose. your wyll be fulfylled. The emperour cōmaūded yt ye chylde sholde be called ayen. And vnd{er}
sorowfull. neuerthelesse she knocked to haue come in. Tho spake the knyght out of the wyndowe. O yu mo∣ste euyll & vnclene wyfe. now I knowe & am experte that many a tyme ye haue forsaken my bedde & gone and done auoutrye. now shall ye stande tyll the bel be rongen and yt the wakers may take you and doo with you accordyng to the lawe. The wyfe answered. My lorde wherfore lay ye that to me. In trouth I shall sa¦ye you I was called by my moders mayden & fetched in the nyght. & whan I sawe that ye slepte so swetely I durste not a wake you bycause that ye are olde. and therfore I toke ye keyes & went to my moder the why∣che is sore seke. that I fere too morowe she muste bee anoynted or aneeled notwithstandyng for that I shol¦de not you offende or dysplease I haue hasted me ayē to you & haue lefte her lyenge in grete payne & infyr∣myte. Therfore I pray you for the loue of god lete me in afore the bel be rongen. The knyght answered So shall ye not come in. ye muste there abyde vnto the ty∣me that the bell be rongen. & tyll that ye wakers come and take you. Then she sayde that sholde be to you & to me: to all our frendes & kynred a grete shame and rebuke. Therfore atte the reuerence of almyghty god lete me come in. Than sayd he. Haue in thy mȳde euil and false wyfe how oftentymes ye haue forsaken my bedde and doone auoutrye. It is moche better that ye suffer shame and bee wayle for youre synnes here in this worlde. thanne for too suffer payne in helle.
She sayd ayen to hȳ I praye you for the loue of hȳ yt was crucyfyed & dyed vpon the crosse haue mercy vp on me. The knyght answered. ye laboure all in vayn̄ for ye shall not come in. but ye shall tary the comynge the wakers. As she herde that. she sayde my lorde ye knowe well that by this dore standyth a well. yf ye le∣te me not come in I shall therin drowne my selfe. ra∣ther thanne all my frendes sholde be shamed for me. Then̄e sayd he. wolde god yt ye had be drowned long afore or ye in my bedde came. And as they thus spake togyder. ye mone went down & was al derke. Tho say¦de she. yf it wyll none otherwyse be I shal drowne mi¦selfe. but yet afore as a trewe crysten woman I wylle make my testament. Fyrst I bequethe to god & to ou¦re lady my soule. my body too be buryed in ye chyrche of saynt Peter & of all other thȳges & goodes yt god hath sent me. I gyue vnto you to dyspose for my sou¦le after your wysdome & dyscrecyon. & whan she had thus sayd. she went to the well. & a grete stone ther be¦ynge wt bothe her armes she lyfte vp & sayd. Nowe I drowne my selfe. & caste ye stone downe in to the well & wente ayen pryuely and stode by the dore. The kny¦ghte herynge that noyse cryed wt a lowde voyce sayn¦ge / alas alas my wyfe is drowned. and hastely came downe and ran̄e to the well. And whan she sawe that the dore was open. anone she entred and locked and made faste ye yate / & went vp to ye chamber & laye & lo¦ked out of ye wyndowe. The knyghte stode by ye welle & cryed and wepte bytterly and sayd. woo be to me I
haue now loste my moost beloued wyfe. cursed be the tyme that. I made faste the dore ayenst her. The lady herde that & sayd. O ye cursed olde grysarde. why stā¦de ye there this tyme on ye nyght. was not my body to you suffycyent. wherfore goo ye thus euery nyghte out to your harlottes & hores and leue my bed. As he herde the voyce of his wyfe he was ryght gladde and sayd Blessed be god that yet she is not drowned. But my good lady wherfore laye ye suche thynges ayenst me. I thoughte to haue chastysed you. and therfore I locked the dore. ¶ But in no wyse I entended your peryl / ye knowe well whatte sorowe I made for you whan I herde you to haue fallen in the well. & therfo∣re I came lyghtly to haue holpen you. Therupon she sayde. falsly ye lye. I neuer dyde suche thinges as ye laye to me. But it appereth by a comyn prouerbe. he yt is defectyfe or culpable hymself in a synne. he iugeth euery man to be in the same. or elles ye fader soughte neuer his sone in ye ouen: but yf he had ben therin hȳ∣selfe. And therfore ye put that to me yt ye your selfe ha¦ue oftentymes done & vsed. but one thynge I promyt you. ye shall abyde there tyll ye wakers come. & that ye bell be rongen that they may lede you before ye iuges to abyde & suffer the law. Tho sayd the knyght. wher¦fore laye ye suche thynges too me / I am olde & all my lyfe dayes I haue ben conuersaunt in this Cyte. & in this was I neuer dyffamed. & therfore lete me in that to me ne to your self ye do no shame. She sayd. ye spe¦ke in vayne. It is better that ye forthynke your sȳnes
in this worlde than in hell. Haue in mynde what the wyse man sayth. A poore man proude. A ryche man a lyer. An olde man a fole god hatyth. So ye be a lyer and ryche. what nede was it too you for too lye vpon me. And ye are a fole. for ye had ye floure of my youth at your pleasure. and yet ye muste renne to hoores & harlottes. And therfore it is a grete grace of god that ye haue tyme and space too forthynke it. leste that ye sholde perysshe and be dampned for eurmore. & for yt suffre your penaunce pacyently. The knyght sayd. O my best and well beloued lady all though it be so. yet is god mercyfull. and he asketh noo thynge of a syn¦ner. but he amende his lyfe and forthynke and doo pe¦naunce for his synnes. Nowe lete me come in and I wyll make amendes. She sayde. Whiche deuyll hath made you so good a prechour So come ye not in And as they thus spake the bell was rongen / ye knyght he∣rynge that sayd. O my mooste dere lady the bell ryn∣geth now. suffer me to come in that I be not a shamed for euer. whiche answered. ye ryngȳge of the bell pre∣tendeth the helthe of youre soule take it pacyently in your penaūce. And as this was sayd come ye wakers yt aboute the cyte went & founde the knyght standyn ge in ye strete & sayd to hȳ. O good man it is not gode yt ye in this houre of ye nyght stande here. And as she herde the voyce of ye wakers / she sayd. Good felowes venge me on ye olde cursed horehunter & rybaude. for ye knowe whose doughter & what. I am. This cursed olde man is wont euery nyght to leue my bed. & go the
to his hoores & harlottes. I haue longe forborne hym and wolde not shewe it ne complayne vpon hym too my frendes. for I trusted that he wolde haue amēded his mysrule. & it helpeth not. And therfore take hym & punysshe hym after the lawe. ye all suche olde dotar∣des may take example by hym. Then ye wakers toke hym & all nyght chastysed hym in pryson. & on ye mor¦ne they put hym on ye pyllery. Tho sayd to the Empe¦roure. Lorde haue ye ynderstonde what I haue sayd & he sayd ryght well. Tho sayd ye mayster. yf ye put to dethe your sone by ye excytacyon of your wyfe. it shall to you worse come than it dyd to ye knyght. The Em∣perour sayd she was the worste woman yt euer I her¦de of that so falsly her husbande brought to shame & rebuke. I say to you mayster yt for ye reason of this ex¦ample my sone shall this daye not dye. The mayster sayd to hym. yf ye do so than do ye wysely. And yt her¦after ye shall ioye. & I commende you to god / & than¦ke you of your pacyent herynge / and of the sparynge of your sone and so he departed. ¶ The thyrde complaynte of the Empresse ¶ Whan thempresse herde yt the chylde was not dede she wepte bytterly & entred in to her preuy chamber / & tare her skyn wt her nayles. & wt loude voyce cryed & sayd alas yt euer I was borne. & yt I soo grete a kyn¦ges doughter sholde thus be intreated & shamed and therof can haue no remedy her gētilwȳmen th{is} herȳg wēt & shewed it to thēperour. & he went vnto her & cō¦forted her saȳg. O lady wepe not so ne cry not. for it
becometh you no thynge / whiche sayde / the loue that I haue & owe to you maketh me more to sorowe than the contempte of the dede. for why the inwarde loue of your herte hath hytherto prohybite & letted me yt I haue not retorned ayen in to my countree to my fader but I fere yf I sholde so do to you it myght do harme for he is myghty to honoure me wt rychesses. and too venge my quarell & despyte in suche wyse yt ye & you¦res myght forthynke it Therto sayd themperour lete that goo out of your mynde. shewe it not / for as long as I lyue I shall neuer fayle you. And she sayd / lorde I praye god that ye maye longe lyue. But I fere me yt it shall hapen vpon you as it dyde of a knyght and of his sone that wolde not burye his faders hede in the chyrcheyerde. ād yet his fader was for hym slayne / Than sayd themperour Shewe me yt example. how that was that he wolde not burye his faders heede / She sayd I shall do it to your proufyte. ¶ The thyrde example of the Empresse
¶ The thyrde example of the Empresse. the empress complains to the emperor; his imprisoned son is seen through the doorway
THere was in the cyte of rome a knyghte yt had two doughters & one sone. this knyght hadde so grete delyte in hauntinge iustynge and turneynge that all thynge that he myght wynne & gete he layde it and spente it therupon. In that tyme was an empe¦rour named Octauyan. whiche in rychesse of golde & syluer exceded al other kynges and prynces In so mo¦che that he had a toure full of golde. and ordeyned a knyght to haue ye kepynge & charge therof. This kny¦ghte that so haunted iustynge & other ydell games ca¦me to so grete pouerte that he was dysposed to sel his herytage. & called to hym his sone and sayd. My sone it behoueth me of your counseyll. for necessyte and po¦uerte compelleth me to sell myn herytage. or elles for to fynde all other way by the whiche I maye lyue. for yf I sholde sell myn heritage. ye & your systers sholde perysshe. The sone sayde. Fader yf ye can fynde ony other meane without sellynge of the herytage. I shol¦de be redy to helpe you. To whome ye fader sayd I am bethought vpon a good counseyll. Themperour hath a toure full of golde / by nyght tyme lete vs go thyder with instrumentes and dygge and hewe through the toure. and lete vs take of the golde as moche as shal suffyse vs. Therto answered the sone & sayd. that coū¦seyl can not be amended. for it is better of themperou¦res golde to take to helpe vs than our herytage to sell They rose vp bothe in a nyght and went to the toure and with instrumentes they made there thrugh an ho¦le and toke as moche golde as they bothe coude cary
awaye at that tyme. The knyght payed his dettes & haunted ayen iustes as he dyde before tyll all was spē¦te and consumed. In the meane whyle the keper of. ye tresoure went in to the toure & whan he sawe the tre∣soure stolen. & a grete hole made through the wall. he began to waxe sore a ferde & went to themperour and shewed how it was befallen. To whome themperour sayd all angrely. What nedest yu to shewe that haue I not delyuered to the my tresoure / & therfore of the I wyll aske it. Tho anone as the keper herde that went to the toure ayen. & set afore the hole a grete vessel ful of pytche medled with other gummes so subtely. that noo man myght come in at that hole. but that he must nedes fall in to that vessell. & yf he therin fyll he cou¦de no more come out of it. Not longe after the knygh¦te had all the golde consumed and spent & went ayen with his sone to the toure to stele more golde. and as the fader went in fyrste. anone he was fallen in ye ves with pytche to the necke. & whan he sawe that he was taken & coude not gete out he sayd to his sone. folow me not. for yf thou doost thou may not escape to be ta¦ken. Than ye sone sayd. god defende it yt I sholde not helpe you: for yf ye are founden we are all but dede. & yf that ye may not be holpen by me. I shall seke coun¦seyll how that ye maye be delyuered & holpen. The fa¦der sayd / there is none other counseyll. but with thy swerde smyte of myn heed / and as my body is foun∣de without hede noo man shall knowe me. & so yu and my dought{er}s may escape & auoyde th{is} wordly shame &
dethe. The sone sayde. fader ye haue gyuen ye best co¦unseyll. For yf it were so that ony man myght percey¦ue ony knolege of you. none of vs sholde escape yt deth & therfore it is expedient that your hede be smyten of. Anone he drewe out his swerde & smote of his faders hede & caste it in to a pytte. & afterwarde hyd it therin and yede and shewed to his systers all the mater. whi¦che many dayes after pryuely bewayled the dethe of theyr fader. After this ye keper of ye tresour came in to the toure & founde a body wtout ony hede. wherof he wondred sore. and shewed it to ye emperour To who∣me he sayde. bynde that body at the tayle of an horse. & so drawe it by al the stretes of the cyte. & dyligently take good hede yf ye here ony crye or wepynge. where soo euer ye here that he is lorde of the house. take all them & wt the body drawe them to the galowes & han¦ge them. The whiche themperours seruauntes fulfyl¦led accordynge to his cōmaūdemēt. And as they ca∣me ayenst the house of the dede knyght. & as the dou∣ghters sawe body of theyre dede fader. they made a merueylous grete shryche & wept pyteously & as ther broder that herd. anone he wounded hymself. greuou¦sly in the mouthe with a knyfe. so that grete plente of bloode came oute of the wounde. The offycers whan the herde that noyse & crye entred in to the house. & de¦maunded the cause of theyr noyse & clamour. Tho an¦wered the sone that I am thus wounded. for whan my systers sawe my bloode so habundauntly go oute as ye see. they began to wepe and crye. And whan the
offycer sawe the wounde they byleued his wordes. & so dysceyued went theyr wayes. and hynge the body of the knyght vpon the galowes where it hynge long tyme & his sone wolde neyther take his body downe frome the galowes. ne yet bury his hede ye Empresse sayd vnderstande ye what I haue sayd. Themperour sayd ye ryght well. ¶ The declaratyon of the example. ¶ Tho spake thempresse. thus my lorde I fere me it shalbe of you & of youre sone. This knyght for loue of his sone was made poore. & fyrste he commytted thef¦te & brake the toure. secondary dyde hymself too be he¦ded. that his chyldren sholde haue no shame. After yt sone cast his he¦de in a dyke. & buryed it nether in chyr¦che nor in chyrcheyerde. his body he suffred to hange styll vpon the galowes. yf that he coude not haue ta∣ken it downe in the daye he myght wel haue done in ye nyght. In the same maner ye laboure nyght and day that ye maye promote your sone to honoure & ryches But without doubte he dayly laboureth for your con¦fusyon & destructyon that he may regne after you in your empyre. Therfore I aduyse you yt ye do hȳ to be hanged before or he you destroye. Themperour sayd ye haue shewed me a good example. The knyghtes so ne whan he had smyten of his faders hede wolde not bury it. Without doute my fader shall not do so by me but he communded anone his offycers that they shol¦de lede hym to the galowes. & they obeyed his cōmaū¦dement
hastely. & as they lad hym thrugh the stretes ye people made grete noyse & lamentacyon. alas alas the onely sone of the emperour is lad ayen to wardes ye galowes / & as they thus ladde hym. the thyrde may¦ster named Craton came rydȳg vpon an hors / & as ye chylde sawe hym he bowed downe his hede to hym as though he had sayd. haue mynde vpon me. The peo∣ple cryed sayng. O good mayster hast you & saue you¦re dyscyple. He smote his horse wt spores & hasted him to ye palays. And whan he came before themperoure he honourably salued hym. whiche sayd. thy comyng hyther shall neuer auayll the / nor it that yu comest for The mayster sayd. I hoped in my comynge to haue be welcome & haue had a better rewarde & not too haue be rebuked. The emperour sayd / as ye haue deserued so shal it be to you. To whom he sayd. My lord what haue I deserued. Themperour sayde. ye haue ryghte well deserued deth. For why I delyuered to you my so¦ne well spekynge & wel manered for to enfourme and teche. & ye haue delyuered hym ayen too me dompe & a rybaude. To whom the mayster sayd / in that ye say he is dompe yt I commytte to god / for he maketh the dompe to speke & the defe to here. But in that ye saye yt he wolde haue your wyfe enforced that wolde I gla¦dly knowe yf ony creature haue yt seen. for there is no malyce aboue ye malyce of a woman / and that shall I proue by a good example that wȳmen are full of lesȳ¦ges & decepcōns. & yf ye put to deth your sone for the wordes of your wyfe / it shall happen to you as it dyd
to a noble man of his wyfe & of his pye. the whiche he loued merueylously. To whome themperour sayd. I you tell me howe that wymmen are full of malyce & lesynges / whiche sayd I wyll not do it / but yf ye fyrst calle ayen your sone frome the dethe. & then at youre pleasure I shall shewe thexample. Than themperour anone made the chylde too be called ayen and put in pryson. Than the mayster began to say this example in this fourme folowynge.
the emperor hears a master's example; through the door, his son is seen surrounded by guards
THere was in a cyte a ryche burgeys that had a pye the which he loued so moche yt euery day be taught her to speke latyn & hebrewe. And whan yt she had lerned perfetly. to speke those two langages / all yt she sawe & herde. she shewed & tolde to her may∣ster. This good man had a fayre yonge wyfe as ye ha¦ue / the whiche he loued moche. but she contrary loued not hym / bycause he myght not furnysshe her of such pleasures & lustes as she desyred to haue. And therfo¦re had she an other fayre yonge man that she loued a∣boue her husbōde. And alwayes as her husbonde was out of the towne about his marchaundyse & other be¦synesses to do. and she sent for her best beloued yt they myght togyder make good chere. The pye as she that sawe tolde it to her mayster. at his home comyng. in suche wyse that ye noyse ranne all ouer the cyte of her aduoutry. wherof her husbōde many tyme brauled & chydde her. She answered hȳ. ye beleue your cursed pye. whiche as longe as she lyueth shall alwayes ma¦ke betwix vs varyaunce & dyscorde. And he sayd the pye can not lye. for that she seeth & hereth that she tel¦leth me. and therfore I beleue her more than you. It fortuned that th{is} good man went in to ferre coūtrees to do his marchaūdyse. & as sone as was gone his wy¦fe sent for her frende & loue to solace & make good che¦re wt hȳ. but he durst not come by day lyght. but abo∣de to ye euenynge leste that he sholde be seen & marked of ye peple. And as ye nyght was comen / he knocked at ye gate: & she was redy & opened it & sayd. Go in frely
for n̄o man shall. see you. & he sayd I fere me ye the cur¦sed pye shall accuse vs. for by her is comen grete scla∣undre vpon vs through out all the cyte. Entre in she sayd boldely and fere not. And as he sholde passe th∣rough ye halle where the pye was in her cage. she herd hym say thyse wordes. O my moste beloued I fere me gretely of ye pye that she shal bewraye vs. And as the wyfe herde that she sayd. Be styll foole. it is derke she may not se you. Then̄e ye py that herynge sayde If I se the not I here thy voyce. & thou doost wrong to my mayster. for yu slepest with my maystresse. and whan̄e my mayster cometh I shall tell hym. The yonge man herynge that sayd. Tolde I not you yt the pye sholde dyscouer vs. And ye wyfe sayd fere no. for this nyght we shall be auenged vpon the pye. And entred in to ye chamber & slepte to gyder that nyght. About mydny∣ghte the wyfe arose. & called to her a mayden and say¦de / fetche me a ladder & set vp too ye rofe of ye house yt I maye wreke me on the pye. The mayde dyde so and they bothe went vp & made an hole through the coue∣ryng of ye house ryght ouer the pye / and there thrugh caste sande clay stones & water vpon the pye. so moch that the poore pye was nere dede & on the morne the yonge man went erly out at a backe dore. And whan the good man was comen home as his custume was he went & vysyted his pye and sayd to her. O pye my welbeloued byrde / say me howe yu haste fared the whi¦les that I haue ben out. She sayd. mayster I shall tel you tydynges that I haue herde. your wyfe as sone as
ye were gone by the nyght tyme she lete a man come ī and as I that herde I tolde hym yt I wolde shewe it to you at your comynge home / that not withstondyn¦ge she lad hym in to your chamber & slepte with hȳ al nyght. ye demaunded me also howe ye I haue doue in your absence. And I saye you of a trouth that I was neuer so nygh my deth as I was that same nyght wt snowe hayle & rayne ye fyll vpon my body. so longe du¦rȳge that I was almoste left for dede. The wyfe whā she herde that sayd too her husbonde. Syr ye byleue your pye now may ye here what she sayth / she cōplay¦nyth yt in ye same nyght there fyll so moche snowe hay¦le & rayne vpon her yt she was almost dede. & yet ther was none of thē al that same nyght. for ther̄ was not in a yere a fayrer ne a clerer nyght than it was & ther¦fore from hensforth byleue her not. Tho went ye good man to his neyghbours & demaūded of them yf yt ny∣ght were ony tempest or rayne. They auswered yt so∣me of them had waked all ye nyght. & in all yt yere they had not sene a fayrer nyght. Tho wēt he to his house & sayd to his wyfe. I haue foūden you in ye trouth for ye nyght was fayr & clere as I vnderstōde of your ney¦ghbours. ye may now knowe of a trouth sayd she ye py is a lyer. wt her lesȳges she hath sowen & made discor¦de betwix vs. & ouer that I am diffamed thrugh ye cite by her fals lesȳg{is}. than ye burgeys wēt to ye pye & sayd wherfore haste yu made lyes & fals tales be twix me & my wyfe. Is this ye thāke that I haue for yt mete that I was wont to gyue yu wt myn owne hōdes euery day
& haste also therby my wyfe brought in to grete dyffa¦macyou thrugh al the towne. The pye answered. god knoweth yt I can not lye for that I sawe & herde yt ha∣ue I shewed to you. Than sayd he. yu lyest. Haste thou not sayde vnto me that in ye same nyghte was hayle & snowe & rayne. that yu haddest nerehonde loste thy ly∣fe whiche is false. And therfore from hens forth yu shalt make no mo lesynges ne dyscorde betwix me and my wyfe / & toke ye pye and brake her necke. As the wyfe sawe that she was ryght glad & sayd now haue ye do¦ne well now maye we all our lyue dayes lyue in reste & peas. And whan he had slayne ye pye. he loked vp & sawe in the top of ye house a laddre & a vessel wt water sande & stones. and as he that behelde. he perceyued the falshede of his wyfe. and cryed with a loude voy∣ce. Woo be too me that for my wyues wordes I haue my pye slayne and all my solace and ioye loste. yt why the in all thynges sayd to me trouthe. And as he had thus doone anone for sorowe lefte his marchaundyse and all his house and went to wardes the holy londe. and neuer retorned ayen towardes his wyfe. Than̄e the mayster sayd to themperour. Syr haue ye vnder stande what I haue sayd. he answered ryght well. the mayster sayd. was not yt a false & cursed wyfe yt so by her lesynges caused ye pye for to be slayne. The empe¦rour sayd. In trouthe she was full of falsenesse. I for¦thynke gretly the pye. the whiche for her true saynge lost her lyfe Verely I say to you ye ye haue tolde, me a fayr exāple therfore th{is} day my sone shal not dy. Tho
sayd the master. Syr yf ye do so ye do wysely. & I thā¦ke you that ye haue spared your sone. this day for my wyll. and to god I commende you. ¶ The fourth complaynte of the empresse. ¶ Whan thempresse herde that ye chylde was not yet dede. she made grete noyse & cryenges in suche. wyse that she was herde thrugh the palays & sayd. Woo be to me that euer I was made Empresse wolde god I had dyed whan I was broughte in too thyse partyes whan the emperour herde ye noyse & crye that she ma¦de. he entred in to the chamber. & conforted her as mo¦che as he myght & demaunded the cause of her lamen¦cacyon / whiche sayd. O myn owne lorde haue no wō∣der though that I be in this grete sorowe and agony for I am your wyfe. & in your company by your sone I am shamed. as ye sawe me lately all be bled & scrat∣ched. & ye haue promysed me that he sholde therfor be hanged / & yet he lyueth, wherfore sholde I not sorow Themperour answered be content & pleased / and I shall do iustyse vpon my sone to morowe. But in that I forbare hym yesterday was at the meuyng of one of the maysters by an example Than sayd she. Haue ye forboren to do iustyce for one worde. were it soo for all the worlde ye sholde not let to do iustyce / & ye saye for the example of one mayster ye haue lefte it. I fere me it shall happen with you & wt youre maysters as vpon a tyme it fortuned too an Emperoure with his
seuen wyse maysters. ¶ The empeperoure sayde. I praye you tell me that example. ¶ Shesayd. ¶ To what entent sholde I laboure in vayne / for yesterdaye I shewed you a good example and it auay¦led not. For what someuer I shewe for your honoure and proufyte that the maysters of your sone torne vp and downe to your destructyon. as in this present ex¦ample I shall clerely shewe you. To whome thempe¦rour sayd / O my best beloued lady tell me that exam¦ple. that by the same I maye the better beware / for though that I respyted my sones lyfe for one daye / I shal not therfore gyue hym his lyfe / for that is dyffer¦red it is not therfore auferred. And she sayde. gladly I shall shewe it for your proufyte, and began to tell it as here after foloweth.
the empress complains to the emperor; his imprisoned son is seen through the doorway
SOmtyme was in the cyte of rome seuen wyse maysters by whome all ye empyre was gouer∣ned & ruled. And themperour that than was dyde no no thynge or attempte wtout the counseyll of them. as they vnderstode that themperour was to them soo in¦clyned. yt without theym he sholde ordeyne or doo noo thynge in ye meane tyme they made by theyr arte and connȳg yt themperour sholde clerely se as longe as he was in his palays. but anone as he was out of his pa¦lays. he was made blynde / & that dyde they to the en∣tēt yt they myght the more frely intromytte themself of all thynges that apperteyned to themperour. by ye whiche they gate & wanne too theym grete profyte & lucre of goodes. & after that they had made. & wrou∣ghte that experymeut. they coude neuer chaunge it ne fordo it. afterwarde. but themperour abode styl blȳd many yeres. Then the vii maysters made & ordeyned through out thempyre. that yf ony man had dremed a dreme he sholde come vnto them wt a florene of gol¦de or of syluer. & they sholde expowne & declare vnto them the Interpretacyon of theyr dremes wherby & by other vniuste meanes they obteyned moche more substaunce & money of ye people than themperour dy∣de. Soo vpon a tyme whan he sate at the table wt the empresse he began to syghe & sorowe in hymselfe. and whan she perceyued that she enquyred dylygently of hym ye cause of his heuynesse & doloure Themperour sayde / sholde not that to me be heuy & sorowfull yt I so longe haue ben blynde & out of my palays / & of yt can
haue or fynde no remedy. To whome spake thempresse & sayd. my lorde here my counseyll & it shall neuer repent you yf ye do therafter In your courte ye haue vii. wyse maysters by whome ye & all ye empyre is go¦uerned. yf ye nowe beholde & marke this in your mȳ∣de / ye shall fynde that they are ye cause of your blynd¦nesse & dysease. & yf it be so they are worthy too dye a shamefull deth. therfore take hede to my coūseyl and aduyse. Sende ye for them & shewe vnto them youre dysease & infyrmyte. & threte them on payne of theyr lyues. yt they sholde fynde a remedy to make you hole of your fyknesse & blyndnes. This coūseyl pleased the emperour well. & anone sent for ye maysters And whā they were come. themperour anone shewed vnto thē his infyrmyte & blyndenes. & charge them vpon puy¦ne deth / yt they sholde seke a rememedy & make hym hole therof. Tho answered they. Ye desyre of vs a thī¦ge that is dyffusyfe & harde. for vs to do thus shortly but gyue vs respyte & dayes & in ye tenth day we shall gyue you answere. Themperour was therwith well content & pleased. Then ye seuen wyse maysters went to counseyll. how they myght ye best chaunge & alter / & that in noo maner coude they fynde ye meane howe they myght put awaye ye blyndnes from the Empe∣rour. wherfore they were all ryght sorowfull. & sayde amonge them self. wtoute we fynde a remedye we are all but dede men. Soo went they from thens thrugh out al thēpyre & sought yf they coude fynde ony reme¦dy or coūseyll therfore. It hapned them vpon a tyme
goynge thrugh a cyte. & in ye myddes therof they foun¦de chyldren playnge. & ater them came a man wt a ta¦lente or florene of golde & sayd to them. Good may∣sters this nyght I haue dremed a dreme. thenterpre∣tacōn therof I wolde fayne knowe. Wherfore I pray you shewe me what it sygnyfyeth & take this golde to you. That herde one of ye chyldren yt played among ye other & sayd too hȳ. gyue me ye golde & not them. & I shall expowne thy dreme. The man sayde. I dremed this nyghte yt in the myddes of myn orchyerde was a grete sprynge of water. wherof came many smal sprȳ¦ges yt all myn orchyerde was full & ouerflowen wt wa¦ter. The chylde sayd. take a spade & dygge. in ye same place there as ye thought that ye water out sprange. & there shall ye fynde an horde of golde so grete that ye & all your chylderne & lynage shall be for euer ryche The man dyde as ye chylde had shewed hym. & found ye tresoure accordynge to his wordes. Tho went ye mā to ye chylde & offred hym a pounde weyght of ye golde ye he had founde for ye interpretacyon of his dreme. & he wold none receyue but cōmytted hym to ye prayers of ye man. The .vii. maysters whan they herde ye chyl∣de soo wysely expowne ye dreme. they sayd to hym. go¦de chylde what is youre name he answered & sayde I called Merlyne. Then sayd ye maysters. we se clerely grete wysedome in you. we shal shewe vnto you a gre¦te mater. & of yt we wolde gladly yt ye coude fynde a re¦medy. The chylde sayd. Shewe me your mater. And they sayd themperour of rome as longe as he is in his
palays he hath his syght clere wtout ony impedymēt And as sone as he is gone out of his palays he is soo blȳde yt he may not se. Yf ye can now det{er}myne ye cau¦se herof & fȳde a remedy yt he may be eased & haue h{is} syght ayen ye shall haue grete rewardes & honoures of thēperour. The chylde sayd. I know ye cause as wel of his blȳdhede as of ye remedy. They sayd to hȳ. Co∣me wt vs to themperour. & ye shal be rewarded so lar¦gely yt ye shall be pleased. To whom ye chylde sayd. I am redy to go wt you. And whan they came wt ye chyl¦de before themperour. they sayd to hȳ. Lorde loo here this childe yt we haue brought afore you yt which shal fulfyll your desyre as touchȳge the cause of your blȳ¦denes as ye recouerȳge of your syghte. Themperour sayd. Good maysters woll ye take it vpon you & aby∣de therby that ye chylde shall do wt me. They all sayd ye. for we be experte in his wysedome. Themperour torned hymself towardes ye chylde and sayde. wyll ye vndertake to tell me the cause of my blyndnesse & the remedye. The chylde answered & sayd. My lorde the emperour lede me in to your bedchamber. & there I shal shewe you what is to be done And as he was ther in broughte he sayd to ye seruaūtis. take of ye clothes of the bedde. & all thapparayle. & ye shall se wonders And as yt was done they sawe a well smokyng yt had vii sprȳges or floodes. the whiche whan thēperour sa¦we meruayled gretly. ye chyld sayd ye se this wel & wt¦out it be quēched ye shal neuer haue your syʒt. thēpe∣rour sayd. how may yt be. ye chyld sayd. but by one way
Themperour sayde. Shewe vs than the meane. & yf it be possyble to me it shall be done. yt I maye recouer ayen my syght as well wtout as wtin. To whome the chylde sayd. my lorde ye .vii. sprynges of this well are thyse .vii. wyse maysters. ye whiche you & your Empy¦re hythertoo haue trayterously gouerned & haue you made blȳde as ye be wtoute your palays yt they youre subgettes by extorcyon myght plucke & pyll. ye not se¦ynge. but nowe they knowe not ye remedy. Here ye nowe my counseyll. & this well shal be quenched & extȳc¦te do stryke of ye fyrste maysters hede. & anone ye shall ye fyrste sprynge quenched. & so by ordre one after an other. tyll yt they are all beheded. & anone all the spryn¦ges wt the well shall be vanysshed and gone awaye / & ye shall haue ayen your syght as ye had afore. And as this was done & fulfylled / the well with the .vii. spryn¦ges were vanysshed. And as themperour had his sy∣ghte ayen he made the chylde a grete lorde & gaue hȳ grete habundaūce of goodes. After that spake them presse. my lorde haue ye this example well perceyued that. I haue tolde you. & he sayd ye in the best wyse. ye haue recyted a good and a ryall example. Than sayd she. In the same wyse your .vii. wyse maysters inten∣de too doo with you. by theyre false narracyons. that your sone may reygne vpon you / that god forbede. ¶ The declaratyon of the example. ¶ This welle is youre sone wherof oute flowen se∣uen sprynges. that sygnefye the seuen wyse maysters the whiche soone ye maye not destroye withoute the.
vii. maysters be made feble & broughte too noughte that done this well that is your sone wt all his cauylla¦cyons & wyles shal not scape / but lete hym be hanged fyrste leste that he haue helpe of his maysters. & forth after cosequently ye .vii. maysters. And so ye shall go∣uerne & guyde your empyre in reste & peas. Thempe¦rour anone cōmaunded his seruauntes to lede his so to the galowes whiche they were lothe to do. So was there than a grete multytude of people gadred with grete noyse & bewaylynge so that the noyse came to ye eres of ye fourth mayster named Malquydrac. ye whi¦che lepte vpon his hors / & hasted hym to ye palays So mette wt hym his dyscyple & dyde reuerence to hȳ / & recommaunded hym vnto hym / & whan he came be fore themperour & had done his obeysaunce & reuerē¦ce as apperteyned. Themperour answered & sayde. Lytell thanke haue ye olde cursed caytyfe for ye techȳ¦ge of my sone for I delyuered you my sone well spekȳ¦ge & in all thynge ryght vertuous. And ye haue sent hym a fole dompe / & a rybaude / for he wolde haue be∣layne wt force my wyfe / & therfore all ye with him to∣gyder shall be hanged Tho sayd ye mayster. My lor∣de I haue not that deserued of you. god knoweth why your sone speketh not. in shorte tyme ye shal perceyue other thȳges. but ye tyme is not yet comen. But in ye ye say he wolde haue oppressed your wyfe. ye is not gos¦pel ne proued. ne for one sȳguler {per}sone ye shold not iu¦ge to deth your sone. yf now for ye wordes of your wy¦fe ye iuge your sone to dye. it wil be wors to you than
to an olde man of his wyse. & that I shall proue. Too whome themperour sayd. Thynke ye to doo with me ye olde dotarde. as somtyme seuen wyse men dyde to an emperour. Therto sayd sayd ye mayster The offen¦ce or trespace of one or yet of twenty. may not founde to the rebuke & blame of all other. for ouer al the worl¦de there bee bothe good & euyll. But one thynge of a trouth I shall shewe you. that euyll shall come to you yf ye this daye do your sone to deth for the wordes of your wyfe. the whiche I wolde shewe by a notable ex¦ample. Than sayd the emperoure woll ye that recyte for our lernynge. The mayster sayde. yt ye wyll calle ayen your sone. & kepe hym tyll I haue made recyta∣cyon of the example. & than what someuer ye shal thī¦ke best to done with hym. doo it. I shall reherce this ex¦ample or elles not The emperour cōmaunded that he sholde be called ayen / and desyred the mayster to say as here after ensueth or foloweth. ¶ The example of the fourthe mayster.

THere was an olde knyght & a ryght wyse mā that longe lyued without wyfe & chylde. His frendes came to hym many tymes & counseyled and exhorted him that he sholde take a wyfe. The knyght thus counseyled & styred by his frendes soo oftymes that at the laste he agreed too theym. And they gaue hym to wyfe the doughter of the prouost of rome that ryche was & ryght fayre. whome whan he had seene anone he was made blynde & taken in her loue. & be∣gan to loue her meruaylously wel and whan they had ben a certayne space togyder & had no fruyte ne chyl¦de. Vpon a tyme in a mornynge it happened that she went to the chyrche where she met wt her moder. & sa¦luted her as it behoued. My dere doughter sayd the moder how pleaseth you your maryage & your husbō¦de: She sayd ryght euyll. for ye haue gyuen to me an olde lame man / me in al thȳges dyspleasynge. I wol¦de ye had that same tyme buryed me. for I had leuer lye & ete with a swyne than with hym. and therfore I may no longer thus eudure. but I must loue an other Tho sayd ye moder. god forbede that My dere dough¦ter howe longe tyme I haue be with your fader & yet hytherto I neuer medled me with suche folysshenes. The doughter sayde. moder it is noo meruayle for ye bothe in your youth met togyder. & the one toke sola¦ce of the other. & I may receyue of hym noo maner of solace corporall for he is colde / & vpon ye bed he lyeth as styll as a stone. or as a thyng immouable: The mo¦der answered. yf ye wyll ioue an other say me what he
is. The doughter sayd a preest I wyl loue. to whome ye moder sayd it were better to you & lesse syn to loue a knyght or a squyer than a preest. & the doughter say¦de. If I shold loue a knyght or a gentel squyer in shor¦te tyme he wolde be wery of me. & after yt he wolde do me shame & tell it ouer all. & so it is not of the preest. for he wyll holde and kepe his owne honoure & coun∣seyll as well as myn̄. And also spyrytuell men be mo¦re true to theyr loues than the seculer men. The mod{er} sayd. Here my counseyll & it shall be good for you. Ol¦de folkes are wylly & fell tempte your husbonde fyrst & yf ye scape hym wtout doynge ony harme or smytȳ¦ge. than loue the preest. The dought sayd I maye not so longe abyde. The moder sayd vpon my blessynge abyde tyll ye haue proued hym. The doughter sayde vpon your blessynge I wyll abyde so longe. tyll I ha∣ue attempted hȳ but fyrst say me how that I shal pro¦ue hym. The moder sayde. He hath in his orchyerde a tree whiche he loueth moche. do yt to besmyten downe whyles he is oute at hontynge. & ayenst his comynge make hym there a fyre. & yf he forgyue it you thā ma¦ye surely loue the preest. As she had herde the coūseyl of her moder she went to her house. To whom her hus¦bonde sayd. Where haue ye ben so longe. She answe¦red I haue ben in the chyrche where as I met wt my moder & wt her a lytell I haue talked & comyned. & so began proprely for to dyssymyle. After mydday ye kni¦ghte rode out for to hūte. Then she thynkȳge vpon ye counseyll of her moder went to the gardyner & sayde
to hȳ. Cut downe this yonge tree newly planted that I may make a fyre therof to warme my lorde withal at his comynge from huntȳge. For it is a grete wynd & a ryght sharpe colde. The gardyner sayde. Mada∣me yt wyll I not do. for my lorde loueth better that tre than he dothe all ye other trees neuertheles I shal wel helpe you to gadre wood ynough for to make withall a good fyre but in ony wyse this I wyl not hewe dow¦ne. She herde that. & boldly she toke ye axe from ye gar¦dyner & hewed downe the tree her selfe & made ye gar¦dyner wt other to bere it home. At euyn whan ye lorde came from huntynge he was sore a colde. The lady le¦te make a grete fyre. & went & met wt hym. & set hym ou a stole afore the fyre to warme. And as he a lytell whyle had sytten he perceyued ye odoure of the fyre. & called to hym ye gardyner & sayd. I fele by this odour yt my newe plante brenneth in the fyre. The gardiner sayde. Lorde it is trewe. my lady your wyfe hath fel∣led it down. The knyght sayd to her god forbede that my plante sholde be cut downe by you. She answerd anone & sayd. Lorde I haue done it knowyng the we¦der colde & you also colde. & therfore I haue ordeyned this fyre for your cōforte. As the knyght yt herde he lo¦ked angrely vpon her & sayd. O cursed woman how werest yu so hardy to hewe down so gentyl a yonge tre ye whiche yu knowest wel yt I loued aboue al other trees As she that herde she began to wepe & excuse her sel¦fe & sayd My lorde I haue done it for your good & pro¦uffyte. & ye take it so greuously. & began to cry wo wo
be to me. Anone as ye knyght sawe ye wepȳge & teeres of his wyfe & herde her cause we was meued wt mer∣cy saynge to her. Cesse of your wepȳg. & be ware how ye ye ony more angre or trouble me in ony thȳge / that I loue. The next daye erly in the mornȳge / she went ayen to the chyrchewarde. & met wt her moder comȳ¦ge ayenst her. & they salued eche other. Than ye dough¦ter sayd to her moder. O dere moder I wyll loue the preest. for I haue attempted my lorde as ye coūseyled me / but all for nought. for he anone forgaue it whan he sawe me a lytell wepe. Tho sayd ye moder. though olde men one tyme forgyue / they double the payn vp¦on an other tyme. & therfore I counseyll you yt ye an other tyme attempte hym. Tho sayde the doughter I maye no lenger abyde. for I suffer so moche payn for the loue of ye preest. that wt my tonge I canne not tell therfore ye shall perdone me I wyll noo more folowe or do after your counseyll. than sayde the moder. for the loue that the chylde sholde haue vnto the moder attempte hym yet ones. & for your faders blessyuge / and thenne yf ye goo quyte wtout ony harme or betin¦ge. loue the preest in the name of god. tho answered ye doughter. it is to me a grete payn so long tyme to aby¦de. neuertheles for ye blessyng of my fader I shal ons atēpte hym. but say me how I shall begyn. the moder sayd I vnderstande yt he hath a lytell hoūde yt he lo∣ueth wel & yt kepith his bed. cast ye hoūd wt so grete mi¦ght afore his face that it dy & yf ye scape wtout a stry¦pe or that he forgyue it lyghtely. in the name of god
than loue the preest. Than sayd the doughter. I shall in all thynge doo after your coūseyll. for there is noo doughter lyuynge to day yt wolde more gladly haue yt blessynge of the fader & the moder than I. And so she bad her moder fare well / & went to her house ayen / & that day wt grete importunyte & trouble of herte she she brought too the nyght. & whan the nyghte was co¦men. she cōmaunded the bed to be couered wt pupure & wt clothe of golde the whyles the knyght sate by the fyre. And whan the bed was thus made redy. the ly∣tell hounde as he was accustomed lepte on the bedde & she toke hym by the hynder legges. & wt a wood & a malycyous herte she cast it ayenst the wall yt it lay styll dede. Whan the good olde knyght that sawe / he was merueylously angry. & sayd wt a loude voyce too his wyfe. O worste & most cruell of all wycked wymmen now coudest yu fynde in thyn herte that lytell gentyll hounde to sle. yt I somoche loued. Lorde sayd she haue ye not sene how the hounde wt his foule fete hath our / bed that is soo precyously couered with ryche clothes made foule comynge out of the myre: And the knygh¦te sayde wt moche anger. Knewe ye not yt I loued mo¦che better that lytell hounde than the bed. whan she herde that. anone she began petyously to wepe & sayd woo be to me that. I was borne For all thynge that I doo for the best it is all tourned in to the worste. The knyght wolde not suffre the wepynge and weymen∣tynge: of his wyfe. but for that yt he loued her soo mo¦che he sayd to her leue or cesse your wepȳge for I for∣gyue
you it all togyder. And I counseyll you that ye beware how that ye dysplease me from hens forth / & they went toogyder to bed. Vpon ye morowe she rose vp erly & went to the chyrche where as she found her moder / to whome whan she hadde done reuerence as it behoued. She sayd. Moder now wyll I loue ye pre∣ste. For I haue nowe attempted the seconde tyme my husbonde & all thynges he suffred. The moder sayde. O my dere doughter there is noo cruelte or falshede aboue the cruelte of olde folkes. & therfore I coūseyll you ye ye yet ones proue hym. To whom the doughter answered. Moder ye laboure in vayne. for yf ye wyst what & how moche payne ye I suffer for ye prestes loue ye sholde rather helpe me yf ye loued me. The moder sayd. Here me doughter this one tyme. & I shal neuer let you more. Thȳke howe yt ye haue souked mylke of my brestes: & the grete payne that I suffred for you at your byrth By thyse paynes my dere doughter I de syre of & I charge you yt ye denye me not this good pe¦tycyon. & I promyse to god I shall no more let nor hȳ¦der you of your entente: but rather helpe you therto / Tho answered ye doughter. it is to me a grete payne to absteyne me & forbere my selfe so longe from the lo¦ue of the preest. neuerthelesse for ye grete charges that ye haue layde too me. & also for yt ye haue made a vo∣we no more for to lette me. but to further me. tell me how I shall attempte hȳ. & I shal ones yet put it in ad¦uenture. The moder sayd. I know well that on sonda¦ye next comyng he entendeth to haue vs all to dyner
& there shall be your fader & I and all your frendes & al ye best of the cyte. And whan ye are set in your place & all the metes are brought & serued vpon the table / faste one of the keyes preuely yt hangeth at your gyr∣dell in the table clothe & than fayne to haue forgoten your knyfe and say thyse wordes openly. Se what a shorte wytte that I am of. I haue forgoten my knyf in my chambre / & ryse vp hastely & go & yt cloth wt al the metes ye shall caste down & ouerthrowe vpon the grounde. And yf ye scape wtout payn I make a vowe to god yt I shall neuer let you after. The doughter say de yt shall I gladly doo & so toke her leue & departyd. The feste daye came yt all as the moder sayd were bo∣deu. The seruaūtes made redy & couered ye table. All were set at yt table. & the doughter sate ouer ayenste her lorde. And whan the table was well serued. wt me¦tes & other thynges as therto belonged / ye lady of the house sayd with an hygh voyce. Se how forgeteful I am of mynde I haue lefte my knyfe in my chamber ye whiche I muste fetche / & rose hastely vp and drewe ye clothe with all the mete that was vpon it with her. ād all the golde vessels & saltes lay vpon ye groūde. The knyght vexed sore angrye in his herte. but for shame he dyssymyled afore his gestes. & cōmaūded on other clene clothe & other metes to be brought & wt Ioy and myrth he solyted & meued his gestes to ete and make good chere. so that by hȳ they were all gladed. The fe¦ste or dyner done they gaue all thankȳges to ye knygh & toke theyr leue & departed euery man to wardes his
owne house. Vpon ye nexte day in the mornȳge ye kny ghte arose erly & went to the chyrche & herde a masse the whiche ended. went to a barbour & sayd too hym. Mayster are ye experte in blode letynge in what vay¦ne yt I wyll desyre you. He sayde. syr I am experte in what vayne yt ye can name in mannes body. The kny¦ghte sayd. I am well contente come on wt me. & whan he was comen to his house. he entred in to his cham∣ber where his wyfe laye in bed & sayd to her. Ryse vp shortely. Than sayd she. what shall I do vp thus erly it is not yet nyne the clocke. The knyght sayd. ye mu¦ste ryse vp. for ye muste be letten blode on both your armes. She sayd. I was neuer laten blode / & shall I nowe blede. Tho sayd ye knyght. that is trouth. & ther for ye are a fole. For thȳke ye not yt ye hewe fyrst dow¦ne my tree. & an other tyme ye kylled my lytell hoūde & yesterday ye shamed me afore all our frendes & pa∣rentes. & the fourth is yf I sholde suffer you thus too go forthe ye sholde me for euer confoūde & shame. the cause herof I consyder yt ye haue euyll & wylde blode wt in your body. & therfore I wyll that yt corrupte blo∣de shall be drawen out that ye from hensforth shal no more put me to shame & angre. and lete to be made a grete fyre. and she stode and cryed and helde vp her hondes to wardes the heuen and sayde. My lorde for¦gyue me this tespace / and haue pyte vpon me at this tyme. and I shal neuer more offende you. The knygh¦te sayd pray for no mercy. for by the mercy that god hath wroughte without that thou holdest oute thyn
arme strayte I shall sone haue thyn herte blood. And he sayd also to the barbour. smyte harde & make a de¦pe hole in her arme. or elles I shall gyue you a grete strype. Than smote ye barbour so sore that the bloode came habundaūtly out. and the knyght wolde not suf¦fer hym to staunche it vnto the tyme that she chaun∣ged coloure in her vysage. And as this was done the knyght bad to be stopped or staūche yt vayn̄e. & bad yt barbour smyte the vayne vpon. ye other arme. Then̄e cryed she wt a loude voyce. My swete husbonde haue compassyon vpon me for now I deye. The knyght an¦swered. my wyfe ye sholde haue afore thought on th{is} or that ye haue done to me thyse thre euyll tournes or despytes. Then̄e she helde out her lefte arme. & ye bar¦bour smote therin an hole yt the blood came out ryght hudgely. & suffred her to blede vnto the tyme that the coloure in her vysage chaunged & that she swouned / Than sayd the knyght. now bynde that arme & staū¦che it. & sayd to her now goo to bed. & studye and thyn¦ke hensforth how ye maye amende your self or elles I shall drawe ye bloode of your herte. And as this was done he gaue the barbour his rewarde and he wente ayen vnto his owne house. and the wyfe vnder ye han¦des of hir maydens nyghe deed was ladde to hyr bed¦de & bad one of hir handmaydens go to hyr moder in all haste & say that she come speke with me afore I de ye. The moder whan she harde ye she was gladde of ye correctyon of hir doughter & hastely came to hyr / the doughter whā she herd hyr moder sayd to hir O my
moste swete moder I am almoste dede. for I haue so moche blode bled. yt I byleue yt I shal not scape ye deth Tho answered ye moder / sayd I not too you that olde men are ryght cruell. & fell. wyll ye nowe loue the pre∣ste. Whiche sayd. The deuyll may the preest confoun∣de & shame. I wyl neuer loue other but my husbonde Than sayde the mayster to themperour. Lorde haue ye vnderstande me. And he answered ryght well. For amonges all other yt euer I haue herde this was the best example. Thre euyll dedes she dyde vnto her hus¦bonde. & I doute not but yf she had done ye fourth she sholde haue shamed hym for euer. Than sayd ye may¦ster therfore I counseyll you yt ye beware of your wy¦fe leste that it happen worse to you. for why yf ye doo to deth your onely sone for her wordes. ye shall be de¦ceyued in ye ende. & for euer ye shall forthynke it. The Emperour sayd truly mayster this day my sone shal not dye. The mayster sayd My lorde I thanke you yt ye for min example and my sake this day haue spared your sone. ¶ The fyfth complaynte of the Empresse ¶ The empresse herȳg yt the chylde was not yet dede apparayled & clothed her in her vesture or clothȳge. & lete to be ordeyned her waynes & cartes / as thoughe she wolde haue gone to her fad{er} home in her coūtre for to haue cōplayned of ye grete shame yt was done vnto her & coude haue no remedy herof. The seruaūtes se¦ynge yt. went & shewed it to themperour yt thempresse
was goynge in to her countree. Whan he yt perceyued he went to her saynge. whither are ye goyng. I hoped yt ye had loued me so moche yt in all ye worlde ye sholde haue sought no solace but wt me. To yt she sayd. That is true. & therfore I go from you. for I had leuer here of your deth. than to see you dye. wtout doute ye dely∣te soo moche to here thyse maysters. yt it shall happen vpon you as it dyde to Octauian. themperour ye whi¦che wes so coueytous that ye noble men of the empyre buryed hym quycke & fylled his mouth wt molten gol¦de. Themperour sayd. Dere wyf do not that an other tyme ye blame to you or to me myght be layde. Than sayd the empresse. truly ye blame is yours. for haue ye not promysed me many tymes that your sone sholde dye. & yet he lyueth. & therfore from hensforth I wyll no more byleue you. Then sayd themperour. It beco∣meth not a kynge euery cause lyghtly too dyscusse. wt out aduyse. & specyally vpon his sone. vpon whom it is not behoueful. lyghtly to gyue Iugement And ther fore I say & pray you that ye wyll tell me somwhat by the whiche I may my selfe gouerne. for it is vtter de∣struccōn of a kynge wtout aduyse & vndescretly to gy¦ue Iugement. She answered & sayde. I wyll gladly tell you a notable example. so that from hensforth ye shall not be coueytous or desyrous to here ye maysters And began to saye in this forme The fyfth example of the Empresse.
the empress complains to the emperor; his imprisoned son is seen through the doorway
OCtauianus themperour reygned in Rome ry∣ghte ryche & coueytous. & aboue all thynges he loued golde. The cytezyens yt tyme of Rome dyde mo¦che harme & many grete out rages to other nacyons In soo moche that dyuerse nacyons & regyons were meued & styred ayenst ye Romayns. In that tyme the re was mayster Virgilius. ye whiche excelled in magi¦que & in other scyences all other maysters. The cyte∣zeynes prayed hym that he by his arte & connȳge wol¦de make somwhat by the whiche they of theyr enne∣myes myght haue warnȳg & knowledge byfore. Wher by that they myght puruey for themselfe ye better. He lete doo make by his arte and connȳge a toure. & abo¦ue vppon ye toure dyde to be set as many ymages as in al the worlde were regyons or prouȳces. and in the myddes of the toure he let to be made and set an yma¦ge. whiche helde in his hande an appell or a grete roū¦de balle of golde. And euery ymage of the toure helde in his hande a lytell bell. and stode torned lokynge to wardes his owne prouynce to hym assygned. And as oftentymes as ony prouynce wolde styre or rebel ayē¦ste the romaynes. so often torned hym the ymage of yt lende & range the bell. That herȳge the cytezeyns of Rome armed themselfe & to that prouynce yede with all theyr myght for that londe to kepe vnder. and soo was there no londe so grete yt coude wreke them vpō the romaynes, and therfore were they bedradde and fered ouer all the worlde. After that mayster Vlrgili∣us made for the solace and conforte of the poore peo∣ple
a lyght that alwaye brende. and by that lyghte he made two bathes the one of them hote. in the whiche the poore people myghte bathe and wasshe theym / & that other colde in the whiche they myghte theymsel¦fe refresshe. and betwyx that lyghte and the bathes he made an ymage standynge. in whos forhede was wryten. He yt smyteth me shall anone haue vengeaun¦ce. This ymage stode there many yeres. At the laste there came a clerke and behelde that ymage & radde this wrytynge / and thoughte in hymselfe. what ven∣geaūce myght he fynde therfore. I byleue better that yf ony man sholde smyte the that thou fyllest there wt to ye erthe. he sholde fynde some tresoure vnder thy fe¦te. & therfore is thy wrytynge that no man sholde ha¦ue it. & the clerke lyfte vp hys hande & gaue the yma∣ge a grete stroke yt it fell to ye groūde. & anone ye lyght was out. & the bathes vere vanysshed away. & he foū¦de no tresoure. The poore folke yt perceyuynge were all sorowfull sayenge. cursyd mote he be for euer mo¦re yt for his synguler couetyse hathe destroyed this y¦mage. & vs hathe robbed of so grete solace & cōforthe Here after assembled thre kynges the whiche of ye Ro∣mayns had ben oppressed & suffred greate wronges. & went to coūseyll wt them of theyr coūseyll. how they myght best of ye Romayns be auenged. & some of thē sayd. we labour in vayne. as longe as there standyth ye tour wt the ymages we maye no thynge do ayenste theym. To yt counseylle arose vp foure knyghtes and sayd to the kynges. we haue thoughte a goode reme∣dy
how we shal destroye the toure wt the ymages and yt to do and brynge aboute we wyll our lyues sette to pledge. yf that ye wyll do yt coste. Tho sayd ye kynges what coste shall we do. They sayd. we muste haue. iiii tonnes full of golde. Than sayd ye kynges. take that golde & fulfyll youre promyse. The knyghtes toke ye golde & went towardes Rome. & whan they were thy¦der come. in the nyght wtout one of yt yates in the dy∣che wt water they drowned one of ye tonnes wt the gol¦de. & an other tonne they drowned by the secōde yate & the thyrde tonne by ye thyrde yate. & the fourth ton̄ by the fourth yate they drowned. And whan they had thus done erly in the mornynge they entred in to ye cy¦te at an houre conuenyent whan yt themperour went ouer the marte. they dyde to hym reuerence as it be∣houed. Themperour seynge them demaunded frome whens they were. or what scyences or what seruyce yt they coude do. Whiche answered. we are of ferre coū∣trees & we be sothsayers so perfyte ye there was neuer thynge so preuely or secretly hydde. but yt we shall fȳ¦de it by our dremes. we haue herde. that ye laboure & haue pleasure in suche thynges. and therfore came we to you for to wyte yf ye had ony nede of our seruyce / Themperour sayd. I shall proue you & yf it be so yt I fynde you true. ye shall haue of me grete rewardes & thanke. they sayde we aske no thynge but ye haluen de¦le for our rewarde of the golde that by vs shall be foū¦den. The emperour sayd. I am therwith wel content And thus had they with the emperour many wordes
At euen whan themperour was goyng to bedde they sayde too hym. My lorde yf it please you this nyghte shall the oldest of vs set his connynge a werke & dre∣me. & the thyrde day we shall shewe you his dreme & what it sygnefyeth. Themperour sayd goo in goddis name. And they weut forth wt grete gladnesse. & all yt nyght they passed ouer with derysions & myrth vpon truste that they sholde come to a good purpose. whan ye thyrde daye was comen they went erly too thempe¦rour. & the fyrste of them sayd My lorde pleaseth you to goo with vs without one of ye yates of thy cyte & I shall shewe you where as a tonne full of golde is hyd Themperour sayd. I shall go with you and se yf it be true that ye saye. Whan they were comen to the place they drewe out ye tonne that they there afore had put / The emperour whan he that sawe was gladde. and gaue to them theyr parte. Tho sayde the seconde dre∣mer. my lorde this nyght I shal dreme. Themperour sayd. god gyue you a good dreme. ye next nyght came he & toke out ye other tonne. and gaue it to themperou¦re. & toke hym his dele. In lyke wyse dyd the thyrde. & ye fourth. vpon ye whiche themperour was out of all mesure ioyus & glad & sayd he had not sene afore soo true & experte sothsayers or dremers as they were / Than sayd they al togyder at ones as it had ben out of one mouth. my lorde we haue one after another dre ye whiche as ye haue sene be all true proued. But now yf it please you that we may dreme all togyder this nyghte. we truste that too vs shall bee shewed where
we shall fynde a greate quantyte or substaūce of gol∣de & of rychesse. the Emperoure sayd god gyue to you a gode dreme yt to me and to you may be proffytable Unto ye next morowe they came ayen vnto ye Empe∣roure & sayd to hym wt Ioyouse & gladde vysages or coūtenaūces. My lorde we brynge gode & proffytable tydynges. for this nyght in our slepes such & so grete a tresour is to vs shewed ye. whiche yf ye wyll suffre it for to be soughte. ye shall be so moche enryched that in this worlde shall be none to you lyke. Themperour sayd. where sholde ye fynde ye hoorde or tresoure. they sayd. vnder the fundament of the tour yt the ymages standen on. The Emperoure answered. God defend that I sholde for loue of golde destroye that toure wt ymages wherwith yt we of oure ennemyes be defen∣ded & warned. They sayde too hym ayen. My lorde. Haue ye founde vs in oure saynges otherwyse than true & ryghtful. Themperour sayd nay. O lorde sayd they. we with our owne hondes shall gete oute ye gold wtout hurtynge of the tour or of ye ymages. And it is expedyent yt secretly in the nyght by vs it be done. for drede of resorte and concours of ye people leste that ye sholde ren in the noyse & clamour of theym. and also that they sholde not take that good and golde away from you and vs. The Emperour sayde. Goo in the name of god and doo your beste. as ye well can̄e. and I shall to morowe erly come too you. Tho went they with Ioye and gladnesse. and in the nyght they were laten in too the toure. and with grete haste and dyly¦gence
they vndermynded it. & on the next daye erly they mounted vpon theyr horses & rode ayen towar∣des theyr owne countre with ioye & glory. And or that they came wtout the fyght of rome / the toure fell dow¦ne. And on the morne ensuynge whan it was fallen / & the Senatours it perceyued they sorowed gretely & there was a grete sorowe & bewaylynge thrughout all ye cyte & went to themperour & sayd. lorde how ma¦ye it be yt this tour is thus fallen. by the whiche we ha¦ue alwayes had warnynge afore of our enemyes. He answered & sayd. To me came foure fals deceyuers & & fayned themself to be foure sothsayers & yt they cou¦de fynde tresoure hyd in the groūde. And they sayd that vnd{er} the fundacyon of ye toure was hydde an vn∣numerable sōme of golde. ye whiche they sholde well vndermyne wtout hurtȳge of the toure or ymages / & I gaue fayth to them & they haue dysceyued me. they answered hȳ / ye haue coueyted so moche golde. & for your insacyate couetyse we shall be all destroyed. but fyrste your couetyse shall full vpon your selfe. & toke & ladde hym vnto ye capytoll. & layde hym on his bac & poured his mouth full of molten golde. sayng to hȳ ye haue desyred golde. & therfore ye shall drȳke golde & after they buryed hym quycke. Not long after that came thenmyes ayenst ye Romayns. & ouercame & de¦stroyed them al. Than sayd thempresse vnto thempe¦rour haue ye my lorde this example well vnderstand & he sayd ryght well. Than sayd she. The tour wt the ymages is your body wt your .v. wyttes. as long as ye
lyue there none so hardy to trouble or make werre vp¦on you ne vpon your people. That hath your sone ry∣ghte well vnderstonde wt his .vii. maysters & wt theyre false narracyons or fables fynde how they may de¦stroye you. for ye are ouermoche couetyse to here & en¦clyned to them. & in so moche ye they shal vndermyne you & caste you vnd{er} fote. & brȳge you to nought. The ymages are your fyue wyttes ye be all lost. For theyse yt ye be all chyldyshe or folyshe they shall destroy and sle you. & your sone shall opteyne your empyre. Thē¦perour sayd. ye haue recyte to me a good exāple. wher¦fore it shall not to me happen as it dyde wt ye tour but my sone fyrste this daye shall be hanged. To whome thempresse sayd. yf ye doo so ye shall fare well & lyue long. Vpon ye nexte day he commaūded hȳ to be lad to hangȳge.. & as he was to wardes ye galowes lad. ca¦me rydynge ayenst hym vpon an hors his fyfth may¦ster to wardes ye palays. & came before themperour & saluted hym wt all reuerence / & he despysed his salu¦tacyon. & put hym in fere of his lyfe. & ye mayster sayd My lorde I haue not deserued to dye. & ye my saluta¦cyon despyse it is not your honoure. for your sone ha¦th not with vs be of suche condycyōs as ye repute hȳ for. as ye in shorte tyme shal fynde. & that he speketh not is of his his grete wysdome. & knowe ye yt he shal well speke as ye tyme comyth. though ye he now speke not. as ye in shorte tyme shall here. But ye saye yt he your wyfe wolde haue shamed. yt byleue not. for so wi¦se a man as he is neuer sholde attēte so shamful a de¦de.
And ye put hym to dethe for your wyues wordes. ye sholde not scape without shame and vengeaunce / In lyke wyse as ypocras scaped not wtout vengeaū∣ce for ye deth of Galienus his cosyne. The emperour sayd that wolde I fayne here and vnderstonde. The mayster sayd. what sholde auayle ye narracyon to tel vnto you for your prouffyte yf in the meane seasone your sone sholde be hanged. & thersore yf ye wyll call ayen your sone. and therafter do as ye thynke beste it shall be at your pleasure. Themperour lete call ayen his sone and set him in pryson. And tho began ye may¦ster too tell vnder this maner as foloweth. ¶ The example of the fyfthe mayster.
the emperor hears a master's example; through the door, his son is seen surrounded by guards
SOmtyme there was a famous physycyan na∣med Ypocras ryght connynge. ye whiche exce∣ded all other in connynge & scyēce he had wt hym his neuewe or kynnesman yt was called Galienus. ye whi¦che he loued moche. This Galien{us} was of an excellēt wytte & applyed all his wytte & mynde to lerne of h{is} vncle the scyence of physyke. Whan ypocras apper∣ceyued that in as moche as he coude hyde from hym hys conynge ferynge that he sholde excelle hym in yt crafte. for ye grete wytte that he was of. As Galienus this sawe. he studyed & excersysed. in soo moche yt in shorte tyme he had perfyte connynge physyke. for the whiche ypocras enuyed hym moche. It hapned vpō a tyme therafter. yt the kȳge of Ungary sent his mes∣sengers vnto ypocras that he sholde come vnto hym his sone for to cure or make hole. Ypocras excused hȳ¦self & wolde no goo. but sent his cosyne Galienus wt his wrytynge in the company of ye messengers for to excuse hym. And whan Galienus was comen afore ye kynge he was ryghte worshypfully receyued. but he merueyled why that ypocras wolde not come, he excu¦sed hym saynge that he had many grete thynges too do that he myght not come. but he hath sent me in his stede. & wt the helpe of god I shall make hole that chil¦de. That pleased well ye kynge. Galienus went to the chylde. & whan he had seene his vryne. and tasted his pounces. he sayd tho the quene. O excellent prynces I pray you here & suffer my wordes. & tel me who is ye fad{er} of this chylde. She sayd. who sholde be his fader
but my lorde the kyng. Galienus sayd. I am sure yt he is not the fader. She answered yf ye wyll say yt for a trouth I shall doo your hede to be smytn of. he answe¦red I say yet ones agayn yt this kȳge is not the fader and I am not therfore comen hyther to lese my hede. for I haue no suche rewarde deserued. & he was goyn¦ge his waye. The quene yt seynge fpake. O good may¦ster yf ye wyl kepe it secrete. & not dyscouer me. I shal shewe & open vnto you myn herte. The mayster sayd God defende that from me. that I to no persone shol¦de shewe it. and therfore o noble quene shewe it bolde¦ly to me for it shall neuer passe my mouthe after. and I shall your sone ease and make hym hole. She sayde yf ye doo that. ye shall haue of me a good rewarde. & therfore here what I shall saye. Of fortune came hy∣ther vnto my lorde. the kyng of Burgondyen. and he was so longe wt me conuersaunt that this chylde by hym I bare. Tho sayd ye mayster. Fere ye not. I kne∣we well that it was so byfore. & anone he gaue the ch¦de to ete beef or of an oxe to drȳke. and the childe was eased of his infyrmyte. And whan as the kȳge herde that the chylde was quite of his malady he gaue vnto ye mayster a good rewarde. but of the quene he secret∣ly receyued and had a greter gyfte and a specyal than¦ke and went his waye And whan that he was comen home. ypocras his mayster demaunded of hym. haue ye ye chyld heled. & he sayd ye. Than asked he hȳ what he gaue to hym. & he sayd. I gaue hȳ flesshe of or beef to ete. & water to drȳke. Tho sayd ypocras. Than is
the moder of that chylde not true too her husbonde. yt is trouth sayd Galienus. Ipocras anone was meued wt enuye. & thought in hymselfe yf here be not found a remedy. my scyence shall no more be set by. & he shal be named and praysed aboue me. And from that day forthwarde he thought & deuysed how he myght slee hym. Vppon a day Ipocras called and sayd come go we to seke and gadre herbes in the gardyne. To who¦me he sayd mayster I am redy. And whan they were comen in to ye gardyne. Ipocras sayd. I fele that this herbe is ryght vertuous. stoupe downe & gadre me of it. Galienus dyde so. and as they went aboute the gar¦dyne. sayd ypocras now knowe I well by ye odoure of this herbe that it is better & precyoser than golde. and therfore stoupe downe to the groūde & drawe hym ou¦te wt the rotes for he is ryght moche. Galien{us} bowed hymself down to plucke vp the herbe. ypocras drewe oute his knyfe & kylled hym. After that ypocras fyll seke to the dethe that ye strengthes of his body fayled hym and dyde as moche as he coude to helpe hymself but it wold not be and as his scolers & dyscyples her¦de of it they went hastely to hȳ. & all that they myght or coude do for the prouffyte of his helthe they dyde / but it auayled hym nothynge.. ¶ Whan ypocras that perceyued. he sayd vntoo his scolers. Goo and fetche me a grete tonne an fyll it full vnto the brynkes with water. And whan they had soo done. he sayd too them make nowe therin an hondred hooles. and whan that was doone. there wente none of the water oute. Tho
sayd ypocras. Beholde my moste dere dyscyples. how yt ye vengeaunce of god is fallen vpon me. as ye open¦ly may see. For in this tonne are an hondred holes. & yet gooth there out not one droppe. ryght so there co∣meth no vertue out of ye herbes to helpe me. and ther¦fore what ye doo to me it helpeth not. For I must dye But my dere chyldren yf my neue¦we Galienus were now on lyue. he sholde hele me. whom I haue slayne / yt me sore forthynketh. & therfore ye vengeaūce of god cometh ouer me. And this sayd he torned hȳ to ye wal & gaue vp the goost. ¶ Tho sayd ye mayster to them∣perour. My lorde vnderstande ye well what I haue sayd. He answered ye ryght well. what hurte had it bē to hym & Galienus had lyued. The mayster answerd it had ben ryght good. for Ipocras at that tyme had not dyed. & therfore by ye ryghtwyse Iugement of god his medycynes auayled hȳ not. & therfore I shewe to you yt it shall happen worse to you. yf yt ye put to deth your sone for ye wordes of your wyfe. whiche in tyme of necessyte shall assyste & socoure you. A consyder ye not. yt ye haue after your fyrst wyfe. ye haue wedded this wyfe yt ye now haue. & so ye may yt thyrde & yt four¦the. & neuer shall ye haue of ony of them suche a sone ye shal kepe & saue you from peryll. Themperour say¦de truly he shal not dye. Tho sayd ye mayster than do ye wysely. & I commende you to god. & thanke you. yt ye haue this daye for me spared your sone. Thempe∣rour sayd I marke this wel yt wȳmē are crafty. & sub∣tyl. herfore I wyl not for you but for my self saue hȳ.
The syxte complaynte of the Empresse. ¶ Whan that thempresse had knowlege. she shewed her selfe as a wode or an Impacyent body yt all that sawe her or herde her wondred & sayd to themperoor your wyfe she pyneth her self as though she sholde de¦ye Themperour that heryng went to her & sayd wher¦fore be ye so heuy. & so impacyent. O lorde how shold I holde it in. whan I am the only doughter of a kyng & your wyfe. & in your company I haue had a grete despyte & shame. and contynually ye haue promysed me to punysshe it. but ye perfourme it not. The empe¦rour sayd. I wote not what I shal do. ye laboure from day to day. to haue my sone slayne. And the maysters labour to saue his lyfe. and amonges al thyse I know well that he is my sone. but whether the trouth is that knowe I not. Than sayd she. that is it yt I complayne that ye beleue the maysters more than ye do me. Ther¦fore it shall happen to you as dyde to a kyng with his stewarde. Than sayd. the Emperoure. tell that exam¦ple happely it sholde meue me the soner to put my so¦ne to deth. She sayde. gladly. but I praye you gyue attendaunce what I shall saye. and began to tel as he¦reafter ensueth. The syxte example of the Empresse.

THere was a kyng ryght proude & merueylous¦ly dysformed in his vysage in suche wyse that wȳmen hym hated & abhorred. This kynge thought Rome to destroye & the romaynes to slee. & ye bodyes of Peter & Poule to take & cary a waye. whiche while he was in this mȳde he called to hȳ his stewarde that was ryght secrete wt hym of his pryue counseyll and sayd to hym. Seke me a fayre woman yt this nyghte may slepe wt me. The stewarde answered. My lorde ye knowe wel your infyrmyte & dysese. & yt no womā wyll doo it wtout a grete somme of money. The kȳge sayd. thynke ye yt for money I wyll want one haue I not golde & syluer ynough though it were a thousan∣de florenys I sholde it gladle gyue. The stewarde he∣rynge yt was anone smyten wt couetyse. went too his owne wyfe whiche was ryght fayre chast. & of a gode kynrede. & sayd to her. O my good wyfe. my lorde de¦syreth & coueyteth sore to slepe wt a fayr & beauteuou¦se woman. & wyll not forbere it. though yt she wold as¦ke of hym a thousande florenys. and hath commaun¦ded me too puruey hym of one. And therfore I coun¦seyll you that ye to vs gete that money. The wyfe say¦de. were it not so that the kynge so proude and foule of vysage were. yet wolde I not to that euyl consente bycause of the synne ayenst god. The stewarde answe¦red. & I consente that ye shal do it. & therto I coūseyl and cōmaunde you. and promyse you wtoute that ye cōsente to me herin. ye shall neuer haue good daye wt me. She heryng that trembled. in so moche that for
drede she consented to hym. The stewarde yt herynge went to the kynge & sayd Syr I haue founde a fay¦re woman & she is comen of a good house. whiche wil not lesse haue than a thousande florenes & in the euin she shall come. & erly in ye mornȳg she must away that she be not seen of the people. The kynge answered & sayd. I am well content. whan the nyght was comen the stewarde lad his wyfe to ye kynges bed & made fa¦ste the dore & yede his waye. Erly in the mornȳge the stewarde arose & went vnto ye kynge & sayd. My lord it shall be daye wtin a whyle. it is good that ye perfor¦me your promise & let the woman go. The kyng sayd this woman pleseth me so well yt so sone she shall not departe from me. whan the stewerde that herde he de¦parted thens al sory. vnneth he taryed ony whyle but came to the kynge and sayd. My lorde the mornynge is comen. therfore let the woman goo. leste yt she be a∣shamed. as I haue promysed her. The kyng sayd yet shall she not. go from me. & therfore goo out and shet the dore ayen. The stewarde ryght sorowfull depar∣ted and wente vp & downe with an heuy & an angry herre. tyll that the fayre & the clere daye appered. and than entred ayen in to the chamber and sayd. My lor¦de it is clere daye. suffre that woman to departe that she be not therwith ashamed. The kynge answered / I saye to you for a trouth she shall not yet departe for her cōpany is to me ryght pleasaūt & acceptable. The stewarde yt herȳge coude no lenger forbere ne holde his owne coūseyll. but sayd vnto ye kyng. O my good
and gracyous lorde I beseche you suffre her to depar¦te. for it is myn owne wyfe. The kynge herynge that sayd to hym. Open ye wyndowe. & whan it was open. the fayre & the bryght day appered. he behelde the wo¦man ryght fayre & goodly. perceyued yt it was ye wy∣fe of the stewarde & sayd to hym. O thou moste & wor¦ste rybaude or knaue. why haste thou for so lytell mo∣ney ashamed & vndone thy good & fayre wyfe. & her vnto me vnwetyngly haste delyuered. Therfore ha∣ste ye & gete the out of my realme & neuer more heraf∣ter come in my syghte. for frome hens forth yf euer I may se the thou shalt dye ye moost shamefull & horry blest dethe that euer canne be ymagyned. Whan ye ste¦warde herde yt he fled his waye & durste not abyde & was neuer so hardy ony more to come in to that real me. And ye kȳge kepte ye wyfe al his lyue dayes in gre¦te worshyp. and gaue to hyr plente of all thynges that to hyr behoued & appertayned. After that the kynge lete do gadre & assemble a grete & a myghty armye & puyssaūce of men of werre. & went to Rome with gre¦te myght. & besyeged the cyte on all sydes. so long tyll that the Romayns wolde haue delyuered hym for to haue departed and withdrawen hymself from thens the bodyes of the holy apostles Petyr & Poule. Than was there in yt cyte seuen wyse maysters as ye nowe haue. by the coūseyll of whome all the cyte was gyded & gouerned. And the cytezeyns came too theym and sayd. What shall we do. it behoueth vs as that we de¦lyuere vnto oure dedely ennemyes the bodyes of the
holy apostles or elles ye cyte Tho answered the fyrste mayster. I shal wt my wysdome & connynge this day ye cyte & ye body of the apostles saue. & so one after an other promysed to doo ye same eueryche of theym for one daye. In lyke wyse as ye maysters haue promysed your sone. wt that ye kynge began to assaute the Cyte on all partyes. Tho began ye fyrste mayster to saye. & to alledge so wysely for to haue pease. yt ye kynge that day lefte his assaute. makynge & withdrewe hym a ly¦tyll. fro the cyte. & soo dyde all the maysters one after an other vnto the laste. To whome came ye burgeyses & sayd. O mayster ye shall vnderstande that. ye kynge hath made his othe & sworne that to morowe wt al his puyssaunce & strength he wyll haue & wynne the cyte Or elles we muste all be in Ieoperdye too lese our ly¦ues. Therfore in aquytynge of your promyse defende & kepe vs from daunger lyke as all your felowes afo¦re haue done to that answered ye mayster & sayd be of good comforte & fere not. For too morowe I shall by my connynge shewe suche a werke and operacyons / that the kyng with all his puissaunce and myght shal fle & leue the syege. The nexte daye the kynge made & gaue a grete assaute too the cyte. Tho went the may∣ster and endued or clothed hymselfe with a meruay∣vesture or clothynge hauynge therin the fethers or ye tayles of pecockes and of other foules of dyuers colou¦res. and toke two bryght swerdes in eche hande one. and went there with all and stode vpon the hygheste toure of all the cyte. and began too meue and torne or
shewe hymselfe aboute on all partes towarde the oste so that they myght all beholde & se hym. and he helde in his mouthe the two bryght swerdes yt merueylous¦ly shyned. They wtout of ye kynges hoost that seyeng sayd to hym. O lorde beholde vpon hyghest of yonder toure a wonderfull thynge or fygure. Ye I se it wel yt it is merueylous / but what it is I knowe not. They sayd to hym It is Ihesus the god of ye crysten folke yt is come out of heuen vs al to sle & destroye wt his two swerdes yf wee here ony lenger abyde. The kynge herynge that trembled for fere and sayde what shall we do there is but one way and that is that we anone go and departe fro hens leste that theyr god auenge hymselfe vpon vs. Tho began ye kynge wt all his oste to fle. notwithstond¦ȳge there was no nede. but yt they of yt mayster were begyled & deceyued. And whan ye romaynes yt sawe they hastely moued after al armed in good ordynaunce. & the kynge wt many of his peo∣ple they kylled & destroyed. & also in that manere by grete subtylte of ye mayster was ye myghty kynge wt his folke ouercomen. Then sayd thempresse to them∣perour. Lorde haue ye vnderstande what I haue say¦de. He sayd ye. Well in ye best wyse. She sayd. haue ye no herde what. I haue sayd to you at the begynnynge of this narracyon. of the stewarde that the kynge tru¦sted so moche. which for lucre of good shamed his ow¦ne wyfe. & he for that was dryuen & banysshed out of the londe. In lyke wyse your sone for the desyre and appetyte that he hath to the empyre. entendeth to cō¦founde
and destroye you. But while ye be in your my¦ght & power do with hym as ye kynge dyd wt his stew¦arde yf ye wyll not put hym to deth. banyssne him out of your empyre. yt ye without fere may leue in furete of your lyue. And haue ye not also herde how ye kyng lay before ye cyte of Rome. & howe he was by the wyse maysters dectyued & scorned yt he with his folke were kylled & slayne. In the same wyse ye seuen maysters entende to do wt you. & by theyr false wyles and sub∣tyltees to desceyue you. & in the ende to sle you ye your sone may regne. Therupon answered themperour & sayd that shall not so be. for my sone too morowe shal deye. Than commaūded his seruaūtes that they shol¦de lede his sone to hangynge. And as the folke herde that there was a grete noyse & a gaderynge of theym and bewayled the dethe of ye only sone of themperour And as ye syxte mayster herde that. he hasted hym too the Emperour & salued hym moche honourably. & he toke it vnthākfully. & thretned hym or menaced him to dye wt his sone for that he was wt them made dom¦pe. and a rybaude. ye whiche he had shewed vpon his wyfe. The mayster sayd. I haue deserued no deth. wt your sone. but grete & large gyftes. for he is not dom∣pe as ye shall here wt in thre dayes yf he may lyue soo longe. and yf ye put hym too deth for wordes of your wyfe. than shall I merueyll of your wysdome. & with out doute it shall happen to you as it somtyme happe¦ned to a knyght that so moche alowed the saynges of his wyfe that he was bounde to an horse tayle & dra∣wen
thrugh out all the cyte to the galowes. Thempe¦rour sayde for the loue of god shewe me that example that I may the better beware of that peryl. That wyl I not doo sayd the mayster. wtout ye do cal ayen your sone. Than themperour commaūded to call his sone And the mayster began afore al the folke to tel in this maner folowynge. ¶ The example of the syxte mayster.
the emperor hears a master's example; through the door, his son is seen surrounded by guards
THere was an Emperour of Rome the whiche had thre knyghtes whom he loued aboue al o¦ther. And in that same Cyte was an aūcyent knyght yt had wedded a fayre yonge wyfe as ye do thempres whiche aboue al other thȳges he loued. This lady cou¦de synge ryght wel. & melodyously & wt suche swetnes ye many drewe to her house & desyred her company / It befell vpō a season as she sate in her house. ye vysa¦ge torned in to the strete yt she myght se them that wēt by. & began swetely tu synge. yt all folke delyted for to here her. By chaunce came that wayes a knyght of ye Emperours courte & herde that voyce. lyft vp his eyē & behelde her Intentyfly, & anone he was taken in her loue. and entred in to her house & fyll in communyca¦cyon wt her of loue. & amonges al other he demaūded what he sholde gyue her too slepe by hym one nyght She answered an hondred floreyns. The knyght say¦de. tell me whan I shall come. & I shall gyue you an hondred floreyns. She sayd whan I may haue a con¦uenyent tyme I shal sende for you. The nexte day she sange ayen in the same place. and it fortuned the secō¦de knyght of themperour to come by that same way. the whiche in lykewyse was smyten in her loue. & also {pro}mysed her an hondred floreyns. To whom also she promysed to shewe hym a tyme prouyded. The thyrd day was the thyrd knyght in lyke wyse caught in her loue. the whiche also promysed an hōdred floreyns. & she too gyue hym knowelege of the tyme. Thyse thre knyghtes haue so secretly spoken with that lady yt no¦ne
of them had knowledge of other. The lady ye was of malyce & cautelous replenysshed. came to her husbon¦de & sayd. syr I haue secrete maters too shewe you. & folowe therin my counseyll yf ye do it: our necessite or pouerte ye may largely releue. The knyght sayd tel it me I shal holde it secrete & fulfyl it to my power. She sayde thre knyghtes of thēperours court haue ben wt me one after an other. in suche wyse ye none knoweth of an other counseyll. & euery of them haue offred me an hondred floreyns myght we ye thre .C. florayns ge¦te & no knowledge therof be had. sholde it not be to vs a grete helpe & our pouerte well releued. The knyght sayd. forsoth yes. & therfore what someuer ye coūseyl me to do I shall folowe it. Tho sayd she. I shall gyue you this counseyll. whan they come with the floreyns ye shall stande behynde ye yate wt your swerde draw¦en in your hande. & bycause yt euery of them comethe alone. ye shall sle one after another. & so we shal haue the thre. c floreyns of them without knowlege of ony other. The knyght answered. O my best beloued wif I fere me that this euyll can notte be hydde. and we sholde therfore shamefully suffre dethe yf that it we∣re knowen. She sayd I shall this werke begynne. & I shall make therof a good ende. and fere it not. whā the knyght sawe that she was so hardy. it caused hym to be the more bolde. and she sent for the fyrst knyght and he came to hyr anone with oute ony taryenge to the yate & knocked. & she askyd yf he brought ye c. flo¦reyns. and he sayd ye. I haue theym here all redy.
Tho lete she hȳ in. & anone at ye entrynge in. her hus∣bonde kylled hym & so he dyde ye seconde & the thyrde & in to one secrete chamber they drewe the bodyes of them. whan it was thus done ye knyght sayd. to his la¦dy. O dere wyfe yf thyse bodyes be founde wt vs. we shall dye ye moost shamefull deth yt can be ymagyned for it is not possyble but yt thyse knyghtes shall be mys¦sed in themperours courte. & grete, serche & Inquysy on shall be for them made thrugh all this cyte. where they are become. She sayde. Syr I haue this werke begonne. & shal make therof a good ende. fere not. as I afore sayd. This lady had a brother the whiche had the gouernaūce of the watche of ye cyte that on ye nygh¦tis vpon stretes watched wt his felowes She stode at her gate & called her brother & sayde. O my best brod{er} I haue a secrete mater the whiche in cōfessyon I shal shewe you. & therfore come a lytyll withī. & whan yt he was come in. the knyght receyued hym frendly & ga¦ue hym wyne to drynke. & sayd. my well beloued bro∣der. this is ye cause yt I haue called you. for of your coū¦seyll I haue moche nede. The broder answered say it boldely to me. & what someuer yt I may do. to my po∣wer. yt shall be at your desyre wtout lettȳge. Tho sayd she. yesterdaye came in a knyght in good frendshyp / but afterwarde he fyll in suche wordes & varyaunce wt my husbonde. yt he slewe hym. & lyeth in my chain∣ber. & myn owne dere broder we haue noo man that we may truste but you. & yf ye body were foūde by vs we sholde dye. & she made mencyon but of one. ye bro∣ther
sayd delyuer it me in a sacke & I shall bere hȳ to ye see. she herynge yt was full glad therof. & delyuered to hȳ the body of ye fyrste knyght he toke it & went wt∣all a good pase & cast it therin. & as this was done. he came ayen to his syster & sayde. gyue me nowe of the beste wyne for ye are of hym quyte. & she thanked hȳ & went in to her chamber as though she had gone for wyne and began to crye wt an hygh voyce. ye knyghte that was caste in to the see is come ayen. As her bro∣ther yt herde he wondred sore. & sayde gyue me hym. I shall se yf he shall aryse ayen. & toke the body of the se¦conde knyght & wende it had ben of the fyrst knyght & went in to the see. & wt a grete stone he drowned hym therin. yt done. went ayen vnto his systers house & say de. nowe fyll me a cuppe with good wyne. for I haue drowned hym so depe ye he shall neuer come ayen she sayd thanked be god & went ayen too her chamber & sayned her to fetche wyne. & cryed with a grete voyce Alas wo be to me he is rysen ayen and come out of ye see. & as her brother herde that with grete meruaylle sayd. what deuyll is this knyght that I haue thus ca¦ste in to ye water & notwithstandynge is comen ayen. Delyuer hȳ me ye thyrde tyme. & I shall se yf he shall come ayen. Tho gaue she hym ye thyrde knxght. whi∣che he byleued had ben ye fyrste knyght. & yede wtoute ye cyte to a grete foreste & made a grete fyre & caste the knyght therin. & whan he was almost brente. ye brod{er} went thens a lytel dystaūce to do his nede. Tho came there a knyght. yt wolde tyde to ye cyte where on ye mor¦nȳge
they sholde haue a tourneye & a Iustȳg. & it was colde weder & derke. & was not fer fro ye cyte. as yt he had a syght of that fyre drewe therto & alyghted from his horse & warmed hȳ. The waker came & sayd to hȳ what arte yu. The knyght sayd. I am a gentyl knygh¦te. Tho spake ye waker & sayd. yu arte no knyght but a deuyll for fyrste I caste ye in to the water. the .ij. tyme wt a grete stone I drowned the. & the .iii. tyme I haue put ye in this fyre supposynge yt yu haddest be brente. & yet yu standest here. & tho he toke ye knyght wt his hors & cast them both in to the fyre. & after yt he went ayē to his syster & tolde what had hapned hȳ. Nowe brȳ¦ge me of ye best wyne. for after ye I had breute hym I foūde hym ayen by yt fyre wt his horse. & I haue caste them both in the fyre. & his syster perceyued well yt he had brent a knyght of the tourney whiche anone brou¦ghte hȳ of ye best wyne habūdaūtly. & after he had wel dronken. he went thens. Not longe tyme after that there fyll a grete debate & cōtencōn betwyx the kny∣ghte & his wyfe. in suche wyse yt he smote her. which had indygnacyon therof & waxed. angry & sayd that many myght here it. O wretche wyll ye kylle me as ye haue done the thre knyght{is} of themperours. men yt herynge layde handes on them. & brought them be fore ye emperour & ye woman anone knowledged yt hyr husbonde hadde slayne the thre knyghtes of thempe¦rours. & how he toke fro them thre hondred floreyns & as it was thus in trouth foūde. bothe were drawen atte an horse tayll and hanged vppon the galowes.
Than sayd ye mayster to themperour. haue ye vnder∣stande what I haue sayd. He answered ryghte well. I saye for certayne that wyfe was ye worste woman that myght be of all wymmē. for she moued & styred hȳ to murdre. & afterwarde dyscouered hym. The mayster sayd. It is wtout doubte yt it shall to you happen wor¦se yf ye put to deth your sone by ye aduyse of your wy¦fe. Themperour sayd. my sone shall not dye. this day The mayster yt herynge yaue thankynges to thempe¦rour. and toke leue & went his waye. ¶ The seuenth complayn¦te of the Empresse. ¶ Whan the empresse herde yt the sone of themperour was yet lyuynge. as a mad woman she ranne to them perour wepynge & cryenge. O vnhappy wyfe what shall I doo. alas alas for I muste nedes sle my selfe yt so am ashamed & no punysshement there vpon done Themperour answered. God defende you suche thȳ¦ges to haue in mynde. but suffer a whyle. & ye shall ha¦ue a good ende in your cause. She answered. Syr ye ende shall be euyll. for of yt shal folowe to you grete cō¦fusyon & to me. Themperour sayd. be styl of such thȳ¦ges. She sayd. Lorde it shall come to you & your son̄e as it happened to a kynge & to his stewarde. Thempe¦rour sayd. I praye you tell me that example. She say¦de. I wyll gladly tell it. but I fere me that ye wyl here me no more. for ye next day ye seuēth mayster shal spe∣ke & saue your sone from yt deth as his felowes haue
done. The seconde day after this. then your sone shal speke of whoos wordes ye shal haue & take suche Ioy & delectacyon yt the loue berwyxte vs shall bee holy forgeten & wasshed away. Themperour sayd that is Impossyble to me. for I shal neuer your loue forgete, Tho sayd she, O my best beloued lorde. please it you I shal tel you one example. by ye whiche ye shall be wa¦re before of many perylles in tyme comynge. & specy∣ally of your cursed sone. whiche entendeth to destroy me by his maysters. The emperour sayd. tell on your example. and the Empresse began to tell in this wyse ensuynge. The seuenth example of the Empresse:
the empress complains to the emperor; his imprisoned son is seen through the doorway
THere was somtyme a kyng. the whiche loued his wyfe aboue all thynge. in so moche that he closed her in a stronge castell. & bare ye keyes of the ca¦stel hymselfe. The lady was therfore ryght heuy & de¦solate. Now in ferre partyes there was a valyaunte knyght. ye whiche in a nyght had a dreme after this ef¦fecte For he thought that he sawe one of the fayreste quenes yt myght be. ye whiche aboue all thynges desy∣red to haue her loue. yt yf he myghte se her walkynge he sholde clerely haue knowlege of by whome to hym grete frendshyp & worshyp sholde come. To yt quene in ye same nyght by vysyon of the sayd knyght. it was to her also shewed. & yet they hadde of eche other ney¦ther knowlege of name neyther of fame. whan ye kny¦ght had thus dremed & seen in his slepe. he thought & determyned in his mynde that his fote sholde not re¦ste vnto ye tyme tyll he had founde that lady. yt to hym was shewed in his vysyon. and lepte vpon his horse / and toke with hym all that to hym was necessarye for his journey. and rode and laboured thrughe dyuerse regyons and londes soo longe tyll at the last he came vnto the same londe. where that the quene was by her husbonde closed or kepte in a stronge castel. And whā this sayd knyght was come in to ye same cyte. and by a certayne season had theri soiourned. it happened on a day as this knyght walked by the castell. and kne∣we not yt ye quene was therin she sate in a wȳdowe to beholde & see ye people goynge by. & amonge all other she sawe the sayd knyght. and knewe that he was the
same man. that she had dremed of. And ye knyght by chaunce lyfte vp his eyen & perceyued ye lady syttyng in the wyndowe. & anone his mynde shewed hym yt it was she yt he the dremes of had. & he began to synge a songe of loue. And as she herde yt. she was anone ta¦ken wt his loue. The knyghte from thensforth dayly went & walked aboute yt castell beholdynge it ouer all yt yf in ony maner wyse he myght gete to her too shewe his mynde. The lady perceyuȳge that she wrote a letter & cast it downe to hym. And whan he had sene ouer ye letter. & vnderstode ye wyll of that lady. he be∣gan to haunte Ioustes & tournamentes & dyde so ma¦ny gret & merueylous actes or dedes. that ye name of hym came to the kynge. And as the kynge herde that he sent after hym & sayd to hym. Syr knyght I haue herde moche honour of you. yf it wyll please you for to abyde & to dwell wt vs. we shall gyue you large gyf¦tes & rewardes. The knyght answerd. O ryght myʒ∣ty prynce I am your seruaunte. wolde god yt I coude do ony seruyse to please your magnyfycence. wtout ta¦kynge of rewarde saue one thyng afore all other I de¦syre. The kynge sayd. shewe it boldely what thynge yt it is. The knyght sayd. my lorde sythen yt it hath plea¦sed you for to take me as your seruaūt & one of youre counseyll. me semeth that it were expedyent for bothe our solaces. that I hadde a place nyghe too the wall of the castell: that I myght at all tymes be the more re∣dy at your callynge whan that ye haue nede. Then̄e the kynge sayd I consente it to you make it as ye thȳ¦ke
it beste. Tho wente the knyght & hyred werkemē & made a fayre logynge by ye walles of ye toure. & whā it was all redy. He made a couenaūt wt a werkeman for to make out of his house a secrete way in to ye tour & whan it was made redy after his entente. he kylled ye werkeman by cause he sholbe not dyscouer. & went in to ye quene & dyde to her reuerence accordȳg & they talked of many thynges. yt at thende he desyred for to slepe by her. which she oftentymes denyed. but neuer yeles she cōsented to hȳ. After yt ye quene thought what shall I do. yf I sholde gyue knowlege herof vnto my husbōd. therof sholde come two euyls yt one is my sha¦me. & ye by auenture he shode vtterly forsake me & dry¦ue me out of his londe for euer. & ye knyght he sholde sle. for fro yt dethe he coude not escape. & therfore it is better yt I be styll & tell not. The knyght after yt as of tentymes as it pleased hym he went in to the quene. & & dyde his wyll with her. And she gaue hym a rynge the whiche ye kyng had gyuen vnto her at theyr wed¦dynge. This knyght in euery batayll and tournamēt hadde the vyctory. wherfore he wus and stode in gre¦te fauour with the kynge in somoche that he made hȳ his stewarde. & gouernoure of al his Regyon. & lond. ¶ At happened vppon a daye that the kynge dyspo∣sed hym selfe for too goo too chase or huntynge. and he commaunded his stewarde for too make hym redy vppon the morowe for too goo with hym. whertoo he offred hym selfe all redy. ¶ And on the morowe after
they entred in to ye forest. & all that daye they chased. & folowed ye wylde bestes that they were so wery that ye kynge by a fontayne sate hȳ downe to reste. & ye kny¦ghte by ye kynge. & fyll on slepe by hym. hauynge ye rȳ¦ge vpon his fynger. ye whiche the kyng marked & kne¦we. After yt the knyght perceyued yt the kynge had se∣ne the rynge. fayned hymself seke & sayd. My lorde I fele my selfe sore seke yt yf I fynde not hastely remedy therfore by the meanes physyke I am but a dede mā & therfore I pray you lycence me to go home. To who¦me he sayd. go my dere frend in goddes name. he ano¦ne gate on his horse & hasted hȳ to his house. & wente to the quene & gaue her ayen ye rynge. & tolde her how ye kynge hud marked it & sene it on his fynger & pra∣yed her yf he made ony questyons of ye rynge yt he shol¦de shewe it to hȳ. This done he went downe ayen to his lodgȳge. And anone ofter yt the kynge came to the quene & she receyued hym ryght. louȳgly. & after yt a lytyl tyme was passed. the kyng sayd. My lady shew me where ye ryng is that I gaue to you. I desyre to se it. O my lorde to what entente at this tyme desyre ye to se it. Than sayd he. yf ye shewe if not to me Incōty¦nēt it shall repente you. She rose anone vp & went to cheste & brought the rȳge to ye kynge. And as he sawe ye rynge. he was halfe ashamed & sayd vnto her. O ho¦we lyke is the knyghtes rynge vnto this rynge. why∣che I sawe vpon his fynger. and I bileued that it had ben my rynge. and therfore it was that I asked it of you so hastely after the rynge. And of this euyll suspe¦cyon
I yelde my self gylty ayenst you my dere lady. in this behalfe. for ye strength of the toure deceyued me. For I thȳke ye noo man myght come therin. but I my self alone. She sayde. My dere lorde. wond{er} not. for o¦ne rynge is lyke an other. for werke men make seldo∣me ony werke. but ye other make the same. but god for¦gyue it you that ye haue had me suspect. whan ye kno¦we the strength of ye toure. & the keyes ye haue alway by you. & byleue no man ther wt. After yt the knyght le¦te ordeyn̄ a grete dyner & sayd to the kȳge. My lorde it is so that my lady in loue is come out of my countre & I haue done to be made a feste or a dyner. & gladly I wolde pray you that at this tyme ye wyll doo me ho¦nour. & take suche mete as is in my house. The kynge sayd I shal gladly do you yt worshyp & more. The kni¦ght was therof glad. & by his secrete way went to the quene & sayd to her. My lady this day ye shal come to my house by my preuy way. & clothe you in ryche clo∣thynge after the way of my coūtre. & ye shal syt at the table wt the kynge as my souerayne lady. & make hȳ good there She sayd as ye wyll I shall in all thȳges fulfyll. & whan the houre of mete was come. & the kȳ¦ge from the castell was comyng to wardes the knygh¦tes house. In the meane tyme the quene entred by the secrete way in to the knyghtes lodgynge & apparay∣led her after the maner of the knyghtes countre. and whan the kynge was entred in to the house. she salu∣ed hym reuerently and receyued hym. and whan the kynge hadde beholden her he demaunded of the kny¦ghte.
what woman is this that is so fayr. Then ye kny¦ghte sayd my lorde it is my souerayne lady that now is come out of my coūtre after me. I haue taryed lon∣ge in her seruyce. Then the knyght set the kynge att ye t able as it behoued. & made the quene to syt by hym / & the kynge thoughte that it was his quene. and sayd wtin hymself. O how lyke is this woman vnto my wy¦fe. So ye strength of the toure deceyued hym. that he gaue more fayth and credence to ye knyghtes wordes than he dyde vnto his owne eyen. The quene began̄e for to speke & talke vnto the kynge and to styre hym for to ete and drynke & to make good chere. And whā as the kynge herde her voyce and speche than he sayd to hymselfe. O blessed lady. lyke is this woman vnto my quene. in her behauyng / in speche / in vysage / & in all other thȳges & condycyons. and alwayes ye streng the of the toure fayled hym. In the ende of ye mete. ye knyght prayed his loue to synge a songe afore ye kyng the whiche began for to synge a songe of loue. whan as he herde that & knewe her voyce. he thought is not this my wyfe. How may it be she. haue not I ye keyes of the toure my selfe in kepynge. and soo all the mete tyme he sate and strofe within hymselfe. Tho att the laste he sayde vnto the knyght that he sholde take vp the table for he hadde som what for too done for why that he sate in suche a grete thought. and aduysemēt The knyght answered and sayde. My lorde ye make noo good chere. ye are full of thoughtes. ¶ And yf it
please you we shall make to you more sporte & solace. And the woman sayd please it you syr kynge here by vs tary. we shall make you all the sporte & solace that we can. lyke as ye quene is in her solace & conforte. He sayd take away the table. for I may no lenger abyde Then the knyght at the commaundement of ye kynge toke vp the table. & thanked theym all. And ye kynge wente hastely vnto the castell in serchynge whether yt the quene were wtin or not. And in the meane whyle the quene went vp by her preuy way. & put of her vp¦permost vestures & the kynge founde her in the same clothynge that he lefte her afore. Whan as the kynge was entred & so founde her. he embraced & kyssed her & sayd vnto her. This day I haue eten wt my knygh¦te and wt his loue that is come out of his coūtree. and sythen I was borne vnto this day myn eyen hath not sene two so lyke creatures in al thyng as she is to you and this mete tyme I haue be soo moche styred with dyuerse thȳges yt I coude no lenger abyde there. but yt I muste come & serche whether ye were here or the∣re. Tho sayd ye quene. Syr how myght ye thynke yt. for ye knowe well yt this toure is fast. & stronge ynou∣ghe & that no body can come in nor out wtout you. for ye alone haue alwayes the keye. How were it then pos¦syble for me to be there. Ye fynde somtyme one man lyke on other and therfore ye sholde take none argu¦mētes of mysdemyng or of suspycion as ye late dyde of the rynge. The kynge sayd. that is true and therfo¦re I knowlege my selfe gylty that. I haue mysdemed
you. After that came to hym ye knyght & sayd. My lor¦de I haue of longe tyme serued your good grace. and now it is tyme that I retourne ayen in to my countre & therfore for all the seruyce yt I haue done vnto you I desyre of you but one thynge to do for me. yt my lo∣ue ye whiche I entende to wedde in the face of the chyr¦che. whiche hath folowed me out of ferre countrees. & her I shall brynge thyder ayen as my lawefull wyfe Therfore I beseche and praye your noble grace that ye wyll do me this honour. that by your owne honde ye wyll gyue her afore the preest vnto me. the whiche shallbe vnto me greete honour and worshyp whan I come in to my countree. The kynge answered. yt pety¦cyon and more yf ye desyre it. that shall I gladly doo and fulfyll it. The knyght prefyxed the daye of mary¦age. To the whiche daye this good kynge came to the chyrche worshypfully. The preest was redy & stode in¦dued wt his vestymentes for to solemnyse the matry¦monye. The knyght had the quene all redy apparay∣led in his owne house after his maner & had ordeyned two knyghtes for to lede her to the chyrche. they byle¦uynge that it had ben his paramour: And whan they were before in the face of ye chyrche ye preest sayd. who shall gyue this woman vnto this knyght. then the kȳ¦ge sayd. I shall gyue her to myn owne knyght. and to¦ke her by the hande & sayd vnto her. O good woman ye are moche lyke vnto my quene. and therfore I lo∣ue you the better. and also for that ye be my knyghtes wyfe and shall be of my house and putte the quenes
hande in to ye knyghtes hande. an ye preest after ye ma¦ner of the chyrche hath bounde & wedded them togy∣der. and whan all this was fynysshed & done the kny¦ghte sayd vnto ye kyng Syr my shyp yt I entende to go in towardes my countre is all redy to make sayle wherfore I humbly beseche hyghly your moost noble grace that it wyl please you for to accompany my wy therunto & that ye wyll aduertyse & enfourme her yt ye wyll aduertyse an enfourme her that she loue me & haue me in fauoure aboue all other creatures lyuyn¦ge and the rather for your gode excytacyon & doctry¦ne. Thenne the kynge with a grete multytude of peo¦ple went with theym & accompanyed theym vnto the shyppe. of whoos departynge many of them were do launte to the shyppe. the kynge began to say vnto the quene. my moost dere frende. herken now well vnto my counseyll and folowe it. for it shall be for your ho¦nour & proufyte. My knyght hath now here wedded & done to you al ye worshyp yt in hym is. wherfore loke yt ye loue & honour hym aboue all erthly creatures & yt hath god commaunded & that ye be too hym true & obedyent. & as this was sayd he delyuered her vnto ye knyght. saynge my blessyng go wt you both. & our lor¦de kepe & conduyte you in sauete to your coūtre. Thē the knyght and the quene bowed and enclyned down̄ her hedes vnto yt kynge. & thanked hym of all thyng{is} and they commytted hym to god. and entred in to the shyppe and the maryners haled vp the sayles and say led forth afore the wynde soo that wtin a short tyme
the kyng had loste ye syght of the shyp. And from thēs he went hastely to ye castall & myssed the quene. & whā he founde her not / he was meued in all the partes of his body. & sought all about ye toure and serched. tyll at laste he founde ye hole or ye secrete way ye the knyght had made. & as he saw that than cryed he and weped and sayd. Alas alas this knyght in whom I had¦de so grete confydence & truste hath taken away my wyfe was I not a fole yt I gaue more fayth in to his word{is} then I dyde to myne owne eyen. ¶ Than sayd them∣presse. My lorde haue ye vnderstand what I haue say¦de. Themperour sayd. ryght wel. in ye best wyse. Then sayd thempresse. remember how yt he trusted the kny¦ghte & yet he deceyued hȳ. In the same manere wyse ye haue confydence in the. seuen wyse maysters / and they laboure for to destroye me that am your wyfe. & ye gyue more fayth vnto theyr wordes than ye do vn¦to your owne eyen. for ye haue well sene how yt youre sone rente and scratched me. Wherof yet I bere and haue the tokens & the markes as ye may see. And al¦so ye knowe well how that your cursed sone hath me ashamed & ye marke not howe they defende hym in his foly and falshede. Therfore it is to be dradde yt it shall happen to you as it dyde to the kynge that too you I haue spoken of. Themperour sayde. I byleue myn eyen better than theyr wordes. & therfore I say you yt to morowe I shall do Iustyce of hym. On ye mo¦rowe the Emperour commaunded that his sone shol¦de be hanged. Tho began ayen a grete noyse in and
the emperor hears a master's example; through the door, his son is seen surrounded by guards
THere was a knyght yt had a fayre yonge wyfe whome he entyrely loued in so moche that he coude not be out of her syght. It hapned on a tyme yt they played togyder at the chesse. & ye knyght by chaū¦ce helde a knyfe in his hande & she playng fortuned to smyte her hand vpon ye knyf. yt a lytel blode began to appere. Whan ye knyght sawe that his wyfe bled. he sorowed moche and was sore aferde of his wyfe yt he fel to the grounde in a swoune. his wyfe cast colde wa¦ter vpon his vysage. yt he a lytell came ayen too hym selfe & sayd lyghtely call the curate wt the holy sacra∣mente for I muste deye for the blood yt I haue seen co¦me out of your fȳger hath smyten the deth to my her¦te. The preest came and houseled hym. & anone after he dyed wtout ony taryeng for whoos deth there was made grete sorowe & bewaylȳges and specyally of ye wyfe. And after that the obsequyes & buryenge was done accordynge. She went and lay vpon the buryel or graue and there she made the gretest sorowe of the worlde. and sayd that she wolde neuer departe from thens but as a turtyll douue she wolde for the loue of her husbonde there abyde & dye. Tho went her fren∣vnto her and sayd what auayleth this for his soule to lyue & dy here it is better yt ye go to your house & gy¦ue almes for ye loue of god & yt shal more auayle his sou¦le. than in this place to abyde. To whom she answerd be styll ye are euyll coūselours. Cōsyder not ye how I am fro hȳ seperate & departed by his deth for a lytell blode yt he sawe com out of my hōd or fȳger. & therfore
I shall neuer fro hens departe. Her frendes herȳge yt lete make a lytell house or lodgynge nygh vnto ye gra¦ue. & put therin all thynges yt to her was necessarye & went theyr wayes thȳkynge that within a whyle she sholde be wery to be alone. & so desolate from all com¦pany & yt therby she sholde desyre ayen ye company of people. In yt cyte was thenne a lawes yt whan a tres¦passour or offendour ayenst the lawe were hanged. yt ye shyryf all yt nyght sholde watche & kepe the body all armed. & yf it hapned yt the body of hym hanged were stolen away. ye seryf sholde lese all his londe. & his lyfe at ye kynges pleasure. At hapned sone after yt the kny¦ghte was dede a man too be hanged for trepasse that be had done. so that ye sheryf after ye lawe of the londe all the nyght watched by ye galowes yt was not fer fro ye cyte. & yt chyrche yerde was not ferre from the wal∣les of ye same. Tho became ye sheryf so colde yt he wyst not but to dye for colde. wtout the rather yt he myghte warme hym. it was so feruent a colde & so stronge a a froste. and he behelde fro thens about hym & sawe yt fyre in yt chyrcheyerde. & hasted hym & came therto. & whan he was come he called & knocked at the lytyll house. The woman spake who is that yt at this houre is knockynge at ye house of this sorowfull woman. I am ye shyref that so moche colde suffreth yt wtout ano¦ne ye late me in I shall frese to deth. She sayd. I fere me yf that I lete you come in ye sholde shewe me such wordes yt sholde cause me for to be more heuyer & he fayd I promyse vnto you yt I shall saye no wordes to
your dyspleasure. Then lete she hym in. and whan he a whyle had sytten by ye fyre & was well warmed he sayd to her. O fayre woman wt your lycence wolde I fayne speke but one worde vnto you. She answered to hym. syr say what it pleaseth you. He sayd. O lady ye be a fayr gentyl woman ryche & yonge. were it not better & more conuenyent for you to dwell at home in your house & to gyue almesse than to destroye & consu me your lyfe here wt wepynges & cryenges. She say¦de syr knyght had I knowen this afore ye had not co¦me herin for I say to you. as I haue sayd too other of¦tentymes. Ye knowe well yt my husbonde loued me so well that for a lytyll bloode yt he sawe me blede on one of my fyngers he is dede. wherfore I shall here deye for the loue of hym. As the knyght herde this he toke leue and wents to the galowes. & whan he was there come. he sawe yt the theef that he left there hangynge was stolen & caryed a waye. & began therfore to wexe heuy & full of sorowe. & sayd. wo is me what shall I do for I haue loste my lyfe and all my good. And he go∣ynge thus full of sorowe & heuynesse. & wyste not why¦che waye to torne hym or to go. at the laste bethought hym to go to yt deuoute & desolate lady. & she we vnto hyr ye heuynesse of his herte. to wyte of yt she coude gy¦ue hym ony gode counseyll. And whan he was then̄es come he called. & she axed the cause of his knockynge Tho sayd he. madame I am the shyref that was he∣re ryght no we wt you. & I wolde feyne shewe you ye se¦cretes of myn herte. Therfore I praye you for ye loue
of god open the dore. and he wente in & sayd to her. O moost vertuous lady I come to haue your counseyll and aduys. for ye knowe well ye lawe of ye londes are that whan so euer ony man is hanged & stolen a waye of the galowes. than the shyref his lyfe and godes be in ye kynges handes. Nowe it is happened in ye tyme that I was here with you & warmed me. ye theefis sto¦len a way frome ye galowes. therfore I praye you for the loue of god gyue me your aduys what is me beste to do. She answered I haue compassyon vpon you. for by the lawe ye haue loste lyfe & goodes to ye kynge Do nowe after my coūseyll. & ye shall neyther lese ly∣fe ne godes. He answered therfore I came to you ho∣pynge to haue gode comforth. She sayd wyll ye than promyse to take me to your wyfe. the knyght answe∣red. wolde god that ye wolde do yt. but I fere me leste yt ye wolde dysdeyne so moche to humble you too me yt am so pore a knyght. She sayd I gyue you my wyl therto. & he yaue her ayen his wyll & consented too be her knyght durynge his lyfe. Tho sayd she. ye knowe well yt suche a day my lorde was buryed whiche for ye loue of me deyed. take hym oute of his sepulture. & go hange hym in stede of ye theef. The knyght answered lady your coūseyll is good. Tho went they togyder & opened the graue & drewe hym out. The knyght sayd howe shall we nowe doo. by cause or the theef was ta¦ken. two of his vpper tethe were smyten oute. & I fe∣re me yf yt were perceyued I shold be dede. She sayd to hym. take a stone and stryke oute two of his tethe
The knyght answerd. madame yt may not do for whi¦le he lyued he was my wel beloued felowe & it sholde be to me a grete rebuke. yf I cōmytted soo dysloyall a dede vnto his body beynge dede. She answered for your loue I shall do it. & toke a stone & smote out two of his tethe. & sayd to the shyref. take hȳ & hange him vpon ye galowes lyke to ye theef. The knyght sayde I fere me to do it. for ye theef in takynge of hȳ was woū¦ded in ye hede. & he wanted both his eres. & therfore yf it were serched & founde otherwyse. it sholde be to my vtter vndoynge. Than sayd she. take out your swer∣de & make hym a grete wounde on his hede. & cut of his eres. O madame god forbede ye I do yt to the dede body yt I loued so well in his lyfe. Than sayd she. gyue me your swerde & I shal for ye loue of you do it. & toke ye swerde & smote a manly stroke vpon ye dede mānes forhede. & cut of bothe his eres. And whan she hadde thus done. sayd. Now take & hange hym wtout com∣pany. & than ye knyght answered. yet I fere me to hā∣ge hȳ. for ye theef wanted both his stones. & yf that we¦re serched & foūde wtout. all our labour were in vayn Then sayd she. I sawe neuer so feerfull a man seyng yt mater so clere & sure. Take a knyfe & cut of his slo¦nes. And be answered. yt may I not do in no wyse and therfore I pray you spare me. & ye knowe well what a man is wtout his stones. She sayd for ye loue of you I shall do it. And toke ye knyf in her hande & cutte of husbondes stones and to hym. nowe take this churle thus dysfygured and hange hym vp withoute drede
And went forth togyder and henge vp the body vpō ye galowes & so was the shyref delyuered out of the kȳ¦ges daunger. Tho sayd ye lady. now be ye quyte of all your daungeours & fere & all thy sorowes by my coū∣seyll. And therfore I wyll yt ye wedde me in ye face of ye chyrche. The knyght sayde I haue made a vowe yt I shal neuer wed other as longe as ye lyue. which I wyl holde. but afterwarde he sayd. O yu moost shameful & worst womā of al wȳmen who wolde take ye to his wy¦fe. An honourable & a louynge knyght was thy husbō¦de. whiche for a lytel blode yt he sawe of thy fȳger shed dyed now haste yu smyten out two of his tethe. yu haste cutte of his eres. & his stones. & yu haste made hȳ a gre¦te wounde in his hede. what deuyll wolde wed ye. & by cause yt yu shal neuer shame more good man. I shal re¦de ye. & drewe his swerde & wt one stroke he smote of her hede. The mayster. sayd. My lorde haue ye vnder¦stande what I haue sayd. The emperour sayd. ryght well. Amonges all wymmen was this ye worste & the knyght rewarded her accordynge. so as she sholde no more men shame. And thēperour sayd more ouer. O my good mayster myght I ones here my sone speke I sholde gyue no charge of my lyfe. Tho sayd the may¦ster. To morowe ye shall here hym speke afore you & afore al ye lordes of thempyre. & he shall shewe ye very trouth of all ye varyaunce betwyxte vs & thempresse as I hope. & toke his leue of themperour & departed. ¶ How yt Dyoclesyan themperours sone cōplayned
on thempres. & how yt he excused him of her cōplaynt. ANd after yt all the maysters assembled togyd{er} & toke theyr counseyll how & in what maner they shold brynge out ye chylde of pryson & lede to the palays. & tho they went to ye chylde there as he laye in pryson afore the mydday his wyll & his coūseyl to he¦re. To whome ye chylde sayd. what yt shall please you. shall please me. but in no wyse besye you not howe yt I shall answere. or what I shall saye. for wt Ioye I shal answere to all thȳges yt shal be demaūded of me. whā yt seuen maysters herde yt they were ryght glad. & clo¦thed hym in purpure & in clothe of golde. & two may¦sters went afore hym. & one on his ryght honde. an o∣ther on his lyfte honde. & ye other thre folowed hym af¦ter. & afore them al went xxiiii men wt dyuerse instru¦ment{is} of musyke & brought hym wt grete melody and honour to ye palays. And whan themperour herde al this melody. he demaūded what it was. Then it was tolde hym. Syr emperour it is your sone. yt whiche co¦meth tofore you & afore all your lordes to speke & ex¦cuse hȳselfe of all thynges yt are layde to his charge / Themperour sayd. yt is good tydȳges myght I here my sone speke. And whan ye chylde was come to ye pa¦lays he ran vnto his fader & sayd vnto hȳ. hayle fader & my moost honourable. And whan themperour her¦de ye voyce of his sone he was so glad yt for Ioye he fyl downe to ye erthe. but ye chylde toke hym lyghtly vp a¦yen. and whan he was come ayen to hȳself. Tho begā
THenne sayd the sone vnto the fader. beholde this rybaude that many a nyghte hathe with your wyfe lyen in your chamber in auoutrye. & haue defouled your bedde. & therfore the Empresse loued hym so well. the whiche ye knewe not. whan the Em∣perour sawe yt. he was impacyent & wrothe. yt he cō∣maūded yt she with ye rybaude sholde be brent. ye sone sayd. lorde fader make no haste of yt iugement before that I haue reproued her of the cryme yt she layde vp¦pon me falsely. & that she vntruly & falsly hathe com¦playned & lyed vpon me. Tho sayd the fader. My de¦re sone I cōmytte all the iugemente in to your hand{is} The sone answered yf she be founde false & a lyer ye lawe shall iuge her. But my dere fader whan ye sent after me at ye instaunce of hyr. then I with my mays¦ters behelde the sterres in ye fyrmamente. & there we sawe yt yf I sholde speke ony worde within seuen da¦yes I sholde haue deyed a shamefull dethe. and there¦fore that was the cause that I spake not. And where as the Empresse sayd & put vnto me. that I wolde ha¦ue oppressed & rauysshed hyr. in yt she lyeth falsly but she dyd hyr best to haue caused me to do it. And whā she in no wyse coude bryng me therto. she toke me pa¦per penne & ynke. & badde me wryte the cause why yt I refused her. And whan yt I had wryten yt I wolde not do or commytte so greate & abhomynable synne. and also wolde not my faders orcharde defoule. Tho began she to tere hyr clothes & scratche her vysage yt it ran on blode. & cryed wt a loude voyce. & cōmytted
vnto me the cryme or blame. And whan ye Emperou¦re herde this he behelde her wt a fell coūtenaūce. and sayd to hyr in this maner. O thou wretched woman was it not suffycyent to fulfyll thy foule & lecherous appetyte I & thy rybaude. but wolde also haue hadde my sone Than fell the Empresse to themperours fote & she cryed hym mercy. Then ye Emperoure sayd. O thou cursyd & most vnhappy woman thou askest for¦gyuenesse & thou art worthy none to haue. for yu haste deserued to dye in thre maner wyse. The fyrst is yt yu haste done auoutrye. The seconde is that thou hastee prouoked and styred my sone to synne & haste to hym commytted. & layde ye cryme falsely & vntruly. And ye thyrde yt thou haste euery daye entyced & prouoked. me wt thy false tales for to put hym to dethe. & therfo¦re ye lawe shall haue ye course vpon ye. & iuge the to the dethe. Then sayd the sone. Fader ye knowe well. that for ye lesynge that she lyed vpon me. I was dayly lad to hangynge. But god with the helpe of my maysters hathe delyuered me. O my moost honourable fader. it was sayd vnto you by ye Empresse that I wolde al∣so by ye helpe of my maysters depose you out of youre Empyre. & that I laboured to dystroye you & for to sette me in your place. sholde not ye than haue sorow¦ed. ye haue the Empyre to gouerne. & wherfore shold I not holde you for my fader. God defende that. for of you I haue my lyuyng. and I shall holde and repu¦te you for my souerayne lorde and fader durynge the terme of my lyfe. And I wyll not in ony manere de∣pryue
you of youre honoure. but I shall laboure and besye my selfe aboute the gouernaūce of ye same. and all your cōmaūdementes I shall fulfyll. in euery thȳ ge. But it is in lyke wyse as the fader caste his sone in to the see for too drowne hym. bycause he sayd yt he in tyme comynge sholde be his lorde. & yet ye sone by the helpe of god was saued. and was made a gretter lord than he was. & yet was it no hynderaūce to the fader but prouffyte. Also ye sholde see & remembre yt my ly∣fe & gouernaūce shall neuer hynder you but it shal be to your greate solace & Ioye. Than sayd ye Emperou¦re. blessed be almyghty god & the houre yt I euer bega¦te you. & deserued to haue suche a sone ye I fynde soo wyse & good in all thynges. Telle me nowe an exam∣ple by ye whiche I maye parfytly thy wysdome vnder stande. & that myn herte maye the better Ioye in the. Thenne sayd the sone fyrst cōmaūde sylence to your people yt I be not letted in my wordes tyll ye I haue do¦ne. And whan yt it is ended. gyue sentence wt ye ryght wysnesse of the lawe vpon me and vpon the Empresse Tho cōmaunded the Emperoure sylence. & the chyld began to tell in maner as hereafter foloweth. ¶ The example of Dyoclesyan the Emperours sone
THere was a knyght whiche hadde but one so∣ne that he loued ryght moche in begynnynge as ye nowe all onely haue me. whome he delyuered to a mayster of ferre coūtrees to nourysshe & to lerne. ye chylde was of a grete wytte & prouffyted moche and grewe as well in lernynge as in body. And whan he had dwelled with his mayster seuen yere. his fader de¦syred to see hym. & sent letters to hym yt he sholde co¦me ayen in to his coūtree & vysyte his frendes in lyke wyse as ye haue sente for me. The chylde was obedy¦ent to his fader & came at his cōmaūdement of whos comynge he Ioyed moche. for yt he was as well grow¦en in his membres as in doctryne. To euery man he appered pleasaūt and gentylle. It happened vpon a daye yt the fader and the moder syttynge at ye table. & the chylde seruynge theym. A nyghtyngale came fle∣ynge afore ye wyndowe where as they satte. & began for to synge so swetely yt they merueyled. And ye kny∣ght sayd. O how swetely this byrde syngeth. well we¦re hym yt coude vnderstande his songe. & coude shew the interpretacyon therof. Thenne the sone sayd. my worshypfull fader the song of the nyghtyngale I cou¦de well declare. but I fere your dysplesure. The fader sayd. saye hardely my sone ye interpretacyon of ye byr¦de. & than ye shall proue whether I shall be angry or not. but I shall marke well ye reason of myn angre. & whan ye sone herde yt he sayd. ye nyghtyngale hath sa¦yd in his songe. that I shall become a grete lorde. yt I shall be honoured & worshypped of all men. & name¦ly
of my fader. the whiche shall brynge the water for to wasshe in myn handes. and my moder shall holde the towell. The fader sayd thou shall neuer see yt day suche seruyce of vs to haue. nor none suche dygnyte shall folowe the. and in greate malyce & wodenesse he toke his sone vppon his sholders & ranne to the see & cast hym in it and sayd. Lye there the interpretatour of ye byrdes songe. The chylde coude swymme. and swymmed to a londe where he was foure dayes with out mete or drynke. The fyft daye there came a shyp saylynge. and as the chyld sawe that. he called loude to the shypmen̄ & sayd for the loue of god delyuer me frome the peryll of dethe. The shypmen sawe that it was a fayre yonge man they had compassyon on hȳ and went with theyr bote and fette hym aborde. and in to ferre countrees with them shey ledde hym. and solde hym there to a duke. The chylde grewe goodly and fayre. & the duke loued hym moche. & hadde him gretely in his fauoure. Vppon a tyme the kynge of yt realme lete calle and assemble all the greate lordes & noble men of his londe to a generall coūsell. This du¦ke prepared & ordeyned hym to go to ye coūsell. & mar¦ked the wysdome & the wytte of the chylde & toke the thylde with hym. And whan they were all gadred & assembled before the kynge in his coūseyll My welbe¦loued lordes & frendes sayd ye kynge. wylle ye wete ye cause wherfore yt I haue called you to this counseylle Then sayd they all we be all souerayne lorde at your commaūdemente. Then ye kynge sayd.
It is a secrete mater yt I shall shewe you. yf yt ony mā can open it & declare what yt it sygnyfyeth. I swere & promytte vnto hym by my crowne yt I shall gyue too hym myn only doughter in maryage. & he shal be my felowe in my realme duryng my lyfe. & after my de∣the he shall haue & possede all the hole kyngedome. & ye mystery of the counseyll is this. Thre rauons alwa∣yes folowe me where so euer that I goo. they leue me not. but cry wt suche horryble voyces. yt it is grete pay¦ne for me to here them: & to beholde theyr lokynges. & therfore yf ther be ony man ye whiche that knoweth the cause of theyr folowynge. & can shewe what they mene by theyr cryenge & voyde theym fro me. wtout doubte I shall fulf¦yll this promyse yt I haue made. & as the kynge had thus sayd. there was none foūde in all the coūseyll yt wyst the cause or coude moue or put awaye the rauons. Then sayd ye chylde too the duke. Mylorde thynke ye that the kynge wyl holde his pro¦myse or worde yf I accomplysshe his wyll and desyre Than ye duke sayde I thynke he wyll holde yt he hath promysed. but wyl ye yt I gyue the kynge knowlege of you what ye can do. Then ye chylde sayd. I wyl my ly¦fe set in pledge & I shall perfourme & make it good yt I haue sayde. whan ye duke herde that he went to the kynge & sayd. My lorde the kyng. here is a yonge mā that is ryght connynge & wyse. the whiche promyseth for to satysfye & fulfyl in al thȳges your desyre as tou¦chȳge the rauons yf ye wyll fulfyll that ye haue pro∣mysed. The kynge swore by the crowne of his kynge∣dome
what I haue promysed in al thynges shalbe ful fylled Tho brought he ye chylde before the kynge. and whan the kynge sawe hym he spake to hym. O fayre chylde can ye gyue answere to my questyon. The chyl¦de sayd My lorde ye in the best wyse. your questyon if wherfore yt the rauons folowe you & horrybly crye vp¦on you To whiche I answere. Vpon a tyme it hapned that two rauons a male & a female had brought for∣the bytwene them the thyrde rauon. vpon the sayd se was so grete famyne & scarsytee of all maner of thȳ¦ges yt men bestes & foules dyed & perysshed for defau¦te. The thyrde rauon yt tyme beynge yonge in the nest the moder lefte it sekynge where she myght best gete her lyuynge. & came nomore to ye neste. The male ra∣uon seynge that with grete penurye and laboure fed the yong rauon tyll that he was able to flye and. whā the dere tyde was passed and gone then the female ra¦uon came ayen too the yonge rauon and wolde holde felysshyppe and company with hym. And as the ma∣le rauon sawe that he wolde haue dryuen her away. saynge thus. that she in his grete myscheyf and neces¦syte lefte hym and his company. and therfore nowe she sholde wante his company and felysshyppe. She alledged and sayd that she had in his byrthe grete la¦boure and sorowe. and suffred penurye. And therfo∣re of his company she sholde rather Ioye than the fa¦der. For this my souerayne lorde they folowe you as kynge the ryght Iugement whiche of them both shal haue the yonge rauon in theyr company. and this is
the cause of theyr horryble clamour and noyse that they make dayly vpon you. But my lorde hadde ye he¦reupon a ryghtwysse sentence gyuen ye sholde neuer more see theym or be troubled wt theyr cryenge. Tho sayd the kynge. for the cause that the moder hath lett & forsaken the yonge rauen in his mooste necessyte. it standeth with reason & iustyce yt she shall wante & be without his felyshyp. And where yt she sayth & alled∣gethe yt in the berynge & byrth of hym she hadde grea¦te payne and traueyle. that helpeth her not. for yt pay∣ne was torned in to Ioye as sone as she sawe the yon¦ge rauen in the worlde. But for yt the male is ye cause of produccyon & generacyon in euery beste. & also yt he the yonge rauon in his necessyte sustayned & fedde in to the recoueryng & nourysshynge of his body. ther¦fore I gyue for a iugement & for a sentence dyffinity¦ue yt the yonge rauen shall abyde & holde company wt the fader and not with the moder. And whan the ra∣uons herde this sentence. with a greate noyse & crye they flwe vp in the ayre & were no more seen nefoū¦de in all that Regyon. whanne that this was doone ye kynge demaunded of the yonge man wha this name was. He answered I am called Alexander. Tho sayd the kynge. I wyll haue one thynge of you. yt ye frome hens forth shal name & take me & none other for your fader but me. for ye shall marye my doughter. and ye shall be possessour of all my realme. The yonge Alex¦ander abode and dwelled stylle with the kynge. and euery man hadde too hym fauour and loue. for he be¦gan
to haunt and occupy hymselfe in iustes & in tour¦neys. wherin at all tymes he had the pryse aboue all other yt were in all Egypte. soo yt his pere or lyke was not founde. & there was not so harde nor so obscure a questyon put vnto hym. but yt he coude assoyle it. At that tyme was there an Emperoure named Tytus. that excelled in gentylnesse curtesy & curposyte of all other Emperours kynges and prynces in ye worlde. In so moche yt suche a fame & noyse flewe & ranne o¦uer all the worlde of it yt what so euer he was yt wolde prouffyte in connynge maners or behauynge. that he sholde go to the Emperours courte And whan Alex¦ander herd that he sayd to the kynge My most honou¦rable fader & lorde ye wote well that al the worlde is full of the fame of themperoure so yt it is delectable to abide & dwel in hys courte wherfore yf it please yow my lorde & fader I wolde gladly go to hys court that I myght be wyser & prompter in maners & behauȳ∣ge than I am. Thereupon answered ye kynge. It plea¦seth me ryght well. but I wolde that ye take with you plente of golde & syluer & other necessaryes. so moche yt ye myn honoure ther wt may saue. & yt ye may haue also yt is to you requysyte & behouefull. And also me semeth it were expedyent yt ye afore your departyng sholde mary my doughter. Tho answerd Alexander wyll it please you my lorde too spare me at this tyme & at my comynge home ayen I shall wedde hir wt all honoure as to her apperteyneth. The kynge answe∣red. sythen it is your wyll to go to themperours court
I lycence you and therto I consente. Alexander toke leue of the kynge. & toke with hym tresoure ynoughe & went to themperours courte. And whan he was co¦me with a fayre companye. he wente afore the Empe¦roure & felle on his knees. and salued hym & dyd hym reuerence. Themperoure rose frome his sete impery¦all and kyssed hym. & asked of hym of whens & what he was. & wherfore he was comen. He answered and sayd I am sone & heyre to the kynge of Egypte. & am come to do seruyce to your moost hyghe maieste yf it please you to accepte me. Themperour sayd yt he was ryght welcome. & cōmytted hym to his stewarde. and made hym his keruer. The stewarde ordeyned hym a fayre chamber & purueyed hym all thynges yt were necessary to the same. And Alexander behaued hym so well & wysely yt in shorte tyme of all people he was beloued. Not longe after that came ye kynges sone of Fraunce to do seruyse to themperoure & to lerne nur¦ture. whome themperour receyued honourably and demaūded his name & of what kynred he was come. He answered I am sone to the kynge of Fraūce. & I haue to name Lodwyke your seruaūte. Tho sayd the Emperoure I haue made Alexander my karuer. & ye shall be my cuppe berer. yt al wayes ye shall do seruyse afore me at my table. & cōmaūded his stewarde to as¦sygne hym a lodgynge whome he assygned wt Alex∣ander in his chamber. These were soo lyke in stature in vysage. & in condycyons yt vnneth ye one myght be dyscerned fro ye other. but yt Alexander was more in
cōnyng & lyghtlyer in his dedes than Lodwyke was for Lodwyk was a femynyne man & shamfast. & the∣se two yong men loued well togyder. This Emperou¦re had a doughter oonly named Florentyne. ye which was ryght fayr & gracyous. & shold be his heyre who¦me he loued entyerly. whiche had a courte by her selfe & seruaūtes to her assygned To whome ye Emperour euery daye was accustomed to sende frome his table of his deyntes. in tokenyng of loue by ye hande of alex¦ander. wherupon ye doughter began to haue hym mer¦uaylouslye in her fauoure bycause of his wysdome & his gracyous demenure. It hapned vpon a day alex∣ander at the mete tyme had suche a besynesse yt he ser¦ued not at ye table nor none other gaue attendaūce for hym in his rowme. Lodwyk perceyued yt & serued in his stede. And whan he had serued the Emperoure in his laste seruyce vpon his knee. ye Emperoure cōmaū¦ded hȳ to bere a dysshe vnto his doughter as he was wonte to do. thynkyng hym to be Alexander. Tho to¦ke Lodwyke ye dysshe & yede to ye palays of the Empe¦rours doughter & salued her wt grete reuerence & set ye mete afore her. but vnto yt tyme he had not seen her she perceyued anone yt it was not alexander. & sayd to hym in this manere. what is your name. & whos sone are ye. & he answered to hyr & sayd. Madame I am ye kynges sone of fraūce. & my name is Lodwyk. She sayd I thanke you of your laboure. & he toke his leue & departed. In ye mene tyme came Alexander to ye ta∣ble. & they fulfylled ther seruyce. The dyner done ano¦ne
Lodwyk went to his bedde sore seke. And Alexan¦der apperceyuynge that went to his chamber & sayd to hym. O my best beloued frende & felowe Lodwyk how is it with you. & what is ye cause of your infyrmi¦te. He answered hym & sayd. ye cause of it I knowe not but I fele me soo seke yt I fere me I can not escape ye dethe. Alexander sayd ye cause of your infyrmyte and dysease I knowe well. For to daye whan as ye bare the mete vnto the Emperours doughter. ye behelde hyr vysage & beaute so feruently. yt your herte is ta∣ken & rauysshed wt her loue. Therupon he answered O Alexander all the physysyans in the worlde coude not more truly Iuge my sekenesse. but I fere it shall be my dethe. Then sayd Alexander. Be of good com¦forth & I shall helpe you vnto my power. & yede vnto the market & bought wt his owne moneye a fayre clo¦the sette with precyous stones. vnknowynge to Lod∣wyke & presented it on his behalue vnto the mayden. & as she sawe yt she asked hym where he myght that costely & precyouse cloth fynde to bye. & he sayd. Ma∣dame it is the sone of ye moost crysten kynge yt sendeth it vnto you for youre loue. for he but for one syght yt he hathe had of you is so seke yt he lyeth vpon his bed vnto the dethe. & therfore yf ye suffre hym to perysshe ye shall neuer recouer ayen your honoure. Tho sayd she. O Alexander wolde ye this coūseyll me ye I shold soo lese my vyrgynyte. god defende that. & be ye sure Alexander yt of suche messages ye shall neuer more haue ne wyn thanke. therfore go ye out of my syght &
speke no more therof to me. whanne Alexander herde that he dyd his obeysaunce & departed. ye nexte daye Alexander wente ayen to the cyte & bought a chaplet that was two tymes more in value than ye cloth. and therwith he yede to ye maydens chamber & yaue it to hyr on the behalue of Lodwyke. And whan she sawe that costely gyfte she sayd vnto hym in this manere. I marueyle of you yt soo oftentymes as ye haue seen and spoken with me. that ye haue not done your ow∣ne erande or spoken for your selfe. but for an other. Then he answered. O madame I haue not ben so dis¦posed. by cause that my byrthe is not to be compared with yours. And also it happened me neuer suche a case that my herte was so wounded. & he yt hathe a go¦de felawe is boūde for to doo hym good & true felys∣shyp. and therfore moost eccellent pryncesse of youre moost habundaūte pyte haue compassyon vpon hym & make hym hole that ye haue se woūded vnto ye deth that it be not for euer layde vnto your crueltee & im∣pyteouse herte. she answered hym. go your wayes for at this tyme I wyll gyue you none answere therof. And as he herde ye. he toke his leue & departed. And the thyrde daye he wente vnto the market & boughte a gyrdell yt thre tymes was more in value & costelyer than the chaplet was. & presented it vnto her on the behalue of Lodwyk. And whan she sawe & behelde ye so precyouse. she sayd vnto Alexander. Saye to Lod¦wyk yt he come to my chamber aboute ye thyrde hour in ye nyght. and he shall fynde ye dore open. & Alexan∣der
herynge that he was gladde. & went to his felow and sayd. My beste beloued felowe be ye of gode com¦forth. for I haue conquered ye mayden vnto you. and in this nyght I shall brynge you vnto hyr chamber: And whan yt was sayd. he stert vp as thoughe that he hadde wakened out of his slepe. & was well reuyued & for grete ioye he was made all hole. And ye next ny∣ght folowynge Alexander toke Lodwyke & brought hym vnto the chamber of ye lady wt whome he was in solace & Ioye all the nyght. & fro ye tyme forth all hyr herte was vpon hym so yt there was but one loue be¦twyxt them bothe. And after yt Lodwyke vsyd her of¦tentymes to vysyte. so yt it came by processe of tyme to the eres of ye knyghtes of ye courte. how yt the Empe∣rours doughter was knowen by Lodwyke: & conspy¦red amonges them selfe how yt they myght hym ther with all fynde. & hym to take or sle. as Alexander had knowlege therof. he armed hym to withstande them And whan the knyghtes vnderstode yt they ferynge. Alexander suffred his felowe to go in peas. & Alexan¦der many tymes put hym selfe in ieoperdye for hym. he not knowynge therof. but ye mayde knewe it welle. In shorte tyme after yt there came letters to Alexan∣der of the dethe of the kynge of Egypt ye he sholde has tely come and receyue his kyngdome with honour & Ioye. and that shewed he anone too the mayden and to Lodwyk. and also of his departynge. wherof they were sorowfull & heuy. he sayd also vnto ye emperour
My mooste redoubted lorde please it you for to vn∣derstande that I haue receyued letters of the deth of my fader. wherfore it behoueth me to go & receyue ye kyngdome. & that ye wylll lycence me to depart. and for all benefetes to done I offre my selfe & all my go¦des. & rather then I sholde by my goynge awaye of¦fende or dysplese you my lorde I shall forsake all my realme & all yt I haue in ye world. & abyde wt you styll Then sayd ye Emperoure. knowe ye for certayne yt of your departynge I am ryght heuy for ye were vnto me the beste seruaut that was in all my house. But it becometh not an Emperoure to lette his seruauntes frome ther promocyons. or auaūcementes. but soner to promote theym vnto hygher & gretter honoure. Therfore go ye vnto. oure tresourer. & he shall dely∣uer you as moche golde as ye wyll haue. & in ye name of god & with my blessynge go in to your coūtre. and thus Alexander had leue of ye Emperoure & bad fare well. & many of ye courte were sorowfull of his depar¦tynge. for of all he was beloued. Lodwyk wt the may¦den brought hym on his waye well seuen myle. After that Alexander wolde not suffre theym for to go fur¦ther. then fell they bothe to ye groūde for grete sorow & Alexander toke & lyfte them bothe vp ayen from ye erthe. & comforted theym with fayre & swete wordes and sayd. O Lodwyke my moost beloued felawe. I warne you yt the secretes beynge betwyxt you & my lady. ye hyde them & kepe them as preuely as ye may & take good hede to all thynges. For I wote an other
shall come and be in my stede. that shall enuy you of the fauoure & grace yt ye stande in wt the Emperoure and daye & nyght shall lye in a wayte to take you wt a faute. & to put you to a rebuke. Then answered lod¦wyk & sayd. O Alexander I shall be ware as moche as to me is possyble. but how shall I nowe do whan I wante your company. therfore one thynge I shall de¦syre of you yt ye wyl take this rynge of me for a remē¦braūce. Then sayd he I shall for the loue of you glad¦ly receyue ye rynge. & yet sholde I neuer wtoute ye ryn¦ge forgete you. & cōmytted them too god. Then they embraced eche other aboute ye necke & kyssed. and so departed frome other. Not longe after ye the kynges sone of Spayne named Guydo was receyued of the Emperoure in ye rowme & place of Alexander. to who¦me the stewarde assygned Alexanders place & cham¦ber. whiche was sore ayenste ye wyll of Lodwyke. but he coude not amende it. Guydo perceyuynge yt Lod∣wyke ayenst his wyll had hym in his felysshyp. anone he toke & had enuye ayenst hym. so that Lodwyke of a longe tyme for fere of ye sayd Guydo kepte hym out of ye company of ye sayd mayde. Neuerthelesse after∣warde ouercomen with the loue of ye mayden. somty¦me haūted & wente ayen to hyr as he afore tyme had done. Guydo shortly perceyuynge awayted so longe therupon. yt he the trouthe knewe. and was therof in surete that the mayden was by Lodwyke knowen & hadde accompanyed with hym. Vppon a tyme it hap¦pened ye the Emperoure stode in hys halle & praysed
gretely Alexander of his gentylnes and wysedome. That herynge Guydo sayde. My lorde he is not soo moche worthy to be cōmended as ye wene for he hath ben a longe whyle a traytour in youre house. thenne themperoure sayd telle me how. Guydo sayd. ye ha∣ue but one doughter oonly. ye whiche shall be your hey¦re. and ye Lodwyke hathe defouled & lyen by hyr by the helpe of alexander & he gothe to hyr euery nyght whan it pleaseth hym. and whan ye emperoure herde yt he was sore meuyd & wexed angry. & it happened Lodwyke vpon ye same tyme to come thrugh ye hall and whan the Emperour sawe hym he sayd. what he¦re I of ye thou euyll and vntrue body. yf it be founde & proued true thou shalt deye ye moost shamefull de∣the yt can be deuysed Lodwyke sayd My lorde ye em¦peroure what is ye cause. Guydo answered. I saye & depose here afore my lorde ayenst the yt thou haste de¦fouled his oonly doughter. & euery nyght thou goost to hyr & doost fornycacyou wt her. and yt in batayle I shall proue & make good vpon thy body wt my body Thenne sayd Lodwyke I am innocente. & not defec∣tyue in yt cryme. & falsely yu puttest yt and layest vpon me. & therupon I holde ye batayle. for I truste on god thy falshede shall come vpon thyn owne hede. Then ye Emperoure assygned theym the daye of batayle & fyghtynge. That done Lodwyke went vnto ye may∣den & shewed to her ye cause & the daye of batayle by the Emperoure assygned. and in what maner Guy∣do hadde hym accused. and sayd to hyr. Nowe it be∣houeth
me to haue your coūseyll. or els I muste deye for why as ye knowe it had not aueyled me to haue a¦yensayd the batayle wtout I wolde haue yelded my∣selfe gylty. Guydo is stronge & hardy in armes that his lyke is none but alexander. & I am weyke & feble & therfore yf I holde the batayle ayenst hym I am but a dede man. & so shall ye abyde shamed & rebuked. Then sayd she. Do my coūseyle in that. yt ye mystrust youre selfe. go hastely vnto my fader. & saye to hym that ye haue receyued letters. wherby that ye are acer¦tayned that ye lorde your fader is sore seke & lyeth vp∣pon his dede bed & desyreth to se you & speke wt youre persone. & to dyspose his kyngdome & his godes afo∣re he departe out of this world & desyre his lycence for the loue of your fader yt ye maye go & vysite hym. & yt he wyll proroge & lengthe the daye of bataylle whyles ye ye maye go & come. And whan ye haue obteyned his congye or lycence. as hastely as ye may go secretely to the kynge alexander. & whan ye are come to hym take hym aparte & shewe hym ye cause of youre comynge & requyre hym in this youre vtter extremyte yt he wylle vs helpe & ayde. and whan yt Lodwyke had herd this coūseyll. it pleased hym well & dyde hereafter Hys leue goten & lenger daye or terme of batayle prefyxed and assygned departed & toke his iourneye to wardes ye re¦alme of Egypte. & neuer letted daye nor nyght tyll he came vnto kynge alexanders castell. & whan ye kynge alexander hadde vnderstondynge of his comynge. he was moche glad & went to mete hym. & receyued him
honourably. & had wonder of his comyn̄ge Tho sayd Lodwyk. O my dere lorde & my beste byloued frende. my lyfe & my dethe is in youre handes. for as ye sayd to me afore yt I sholde haue an other felowe ye whiche sholde lye in awayte to aspye me & too destroye me / wt¦out I save ye more wysely to my selfe: & as longe as I myght I absented me tyll yt I coude no lenger. but af¦terwarde ye kynges sone of Spayne makynge watch soo longe on me tyll that he perceyued ye trouthe. & ha∣the accused me vnto ye Emperoure. so that frome this daye vnto ye .viii. daye hereafter prefyxed it behoueth me to come & fyght wt hym body ayenst body. and as ye knowe well he is a stronge & an hardy man. and I am weyke & feble. & therfore hathe Florentyne coūsey¦led me yt I sholde not hyde this my charge frome you For she knoweth you for a faythfull frende. & that ye wolde not leue vs in this necessyte. Then sayd alex¦ander. is there ony body yt knoweth of your comyng vnto me for this mater more than Florentyne. He an¦swered hym & sayd no creature lyuynge. for I toke leue of ye Emperoure to go & vysite my fader lyenge greuously seke. Then axed alexander hym what coū¦seyll hathe Florentyne gyuen to you howe & in what wyse I myght helpe you. He sayd. O moost constaūt & faythfull frende. in this wyse she hathe coūseylled me. cōsyderynge yt we be lyke. yt ye sholde come & do ye batayle wyth hym. no man shall knowe you but she and the batayll done I shall come ayen to ye court. & ye vnto youre coūtree. Then he asked whan ye day shol¦de
be of the batayle. and he sayd this daye .viii. dayes Thenne sayd alexander. yf I sholde this daye tary then can I not come to yt daye prefyxed. Therfore se what I shall do. I haue boden all my subgectes that to morowe they sholde come & be at my weddynge & brydale. and yf I sholde go than is yt daye loste / and yf I go not & do the batayle than Florentyne & ye are bothe vndone. what thynke ye nowe beste for to doo whan Lodwyke herde yt he fell to the erthe & began to syghe & sorowe oute of mesure saynge. sorow and heuynesse come to me on all sydes. Then sayd alex∣ander vnto hym. be of good comforte for I shall not forsake you thus thoughe that I sholde lese my wyf & kyngdome but herken what that I haue thought in so moche as we are bothe lyke: soo yt the one of vs can not be knowen frome ye other but we be bothe to¦gyder & I am not yet gretly knowen here. but my ba¦rons & other folke shall take you for me. therfore here shall ye abyde & tary & mary my wyfe in my stede. & holde ye feest & brydale. & do in all thynges as though I were there my selfe present. excepte whan as ye co¦me to bedde wt my wyfe loke yt ye be there true & fa∣ythfull: & I shall wtoute taryenge go & take my horse & ryde theder as ye batayle shall be. & yf god gyue me the vyctorye yt I maye ouercome & vaynquysshe your enemye. I shall come ayen secretlye. and ye shall go ageyne to youre partyes and dwellynge place. Thys done. alexander badde Lodwyke fare well. and toke his Iourneye towardes ye Emperours courte. for to
fyght and to do the batayle with Guydo. & Lodwyk abode in Egypt in the stede of kynge Alexander. and vpon the next mornynge came Lodwyke as though it hadde be kynge Alexander. & solemply in ye face of the chirche maryed and spoused Alexanders wyfe. & helde ye feest & brydale wt grete royalte of delycate. & precyous metes. plente of all maner wynes. & dyuer∣se melodyes of instrumentes of musyke. and he made greate Ioye & chere to all the noble men. & to all other people ye there was assembled. And whan ye nyghte. was come. he wente to bedde with ye quene. & layd be¦twyxt hym and her a naked swerde. wherof she had greate wonder. but no thynge she sayd. and also he la¦ye wt hir euery nyght as longe as Alexander was out ¶ The kynge Alexander at the daye yt was prefixed & sette. came vnto ye Emperoure & sayd. O most drad souerayne lorde it is so yt I haue left my fader ryght seke. Neuerthelesse I am come for to defende myn ho¦noure & my forwarde to performe. The Emperoure sayd ye do ryght well & accordynge to a noble man. & fortune shall fauoure you in your iuste & ryght wysse quarell. And whan the Emperours doughter vnder¦stode yt Alexander was comen. anone she sent for him & whan as he was come to hyr she embraced hym. & with ioye & gladnesse she kyste hym. & blessed ye tyme that she myght see hym ayen & demaūded hym whe¦re he that hadde lefte hyr frende and louer Lodwyke Then he shewed & declared vnto hyr all ye processe & how he had left hym kyng in his realme. & toke his le¦ue
at hyr. & wente in to Lodwykes chamber. & there was no creature yt thought otherwyse but it was lod¦wyk. oonly excepte Florentyne. The next daye folow¦ynge afore er Alexander went vnto ye batayle he sayd vnto ye Emperoure in ye presence of Guydo. My mo∣ost redoubted souerayne lorde this Guydo hath false¦ly & vntruely accused me vnto your noble grace. yt I sholde be of suche aqueyntaūce wt youre doughter yt sholde be vnto ye dyshonoure of your moost noble per¦sone & hyrs. & vnto yt I swere & afferme. by this holy euaūgelyes yt she was neuer in ony maner by me in su¦che wyse knowen as he hathe to you alledged & enfor¦med. & that this daye wt the ayde & ye helpe of god I shall proue & make good vppon his body. Then sayd Guydo. yet ones I saye ayen & swere by ye holy euaun¦gelyes & by all yt god hathe made yt thou haste hadde knowlege & haste defouled ye Emperours doughter. and yt I shall make good vpon thy hede. where vpon they lepte vpon theyr coursers. & fyersly ranne togy¦der wt theyr speres yt they bothe brake & shyuered in peces. & they drewe theyr swerdes & faught longe to¦gyder. tylle at ye laste Alexander wt grete myght and strengthe at one stroke smote of Guydoes hede. and sent it vnto ye Emperours doughter wherof she was ryght gladde. & bare it vnto her fader & sayd. Fader beholde the hede of hym yt you & me hath falsely defa¦med. whan yt the Emperoure perceyued ye vyctory. a¦none. he sent for Alexander whome yt he beleued had¦de ben Lodwyk & sayd. O Lodwyke this daye youre
honoure & my doughters ye haue saued. ye shall stan¦de & be the more in my grace & fauour. & what soeuer he be that hereafter more defame you he shall for euer stande in my indygnacyon. Alexander answerd. god helpethe & saueth theym yt trusteth in hym. & alwayes wreketh ye blode vndeffectyue or innocent. But now my mooste redoubted lorde of one thynge I requyre you. at my departynge fro my fader I lefte hym sore seke yt it wyll lyke you for to lycence me to go & se how it standethe wt hym. & yf yt it be ony thynge amended I shall incontynent come ayen. Then the Emperour sayd that pleaseth me well. but ye maye in no mane¦re wyse leue me for fro hensforth I can not be without your presence. Alexander toke leue of ye Emperoure and bad hym fare well. & rode ayen vnto his realme whome whan Lodwyk sawe he made greate chere. & gladnesse. & ryghte frendlye receyued hym & sayd. O moste true frende of all frendes. tell me howe ye haue done & spedd in your iourney & nede. and what ende ye haue brought it to. Then sayd he. Goo to ye Empe¦roure and serue hym as ye haue done tofore. I haue goten you more grace and fauoure of hym than euer ye haue hadde afore tyme & I haue also smyten of the hede of youre enmye and aduersarye. Then sayd lod¦wyk. ye haue not only at this tyme saued my lyfe but many a tymes here afore. ye whiche as yet I can not deserue. but god rewarde you. & so departed & wente ayen vnto the Emperoure. & there was no man that
knewe of the absence of Alexander saue oonly Lod∣wyke. And whan as the nyght was come he wente to bedde with the quene. & anone he hadde with hyr swe¦te & frendly wordes & her embraced & kyst. Tho sayd she. ye haue made this tyme all to longe. that ye haue not shewed ony thyng of frendshyp or loue. how may this be. Thenne sayd he wherfore saye ye that. She sayd. euery nyght as I was in my bed. ye haue layde betwyxe you & me a naked swerde and ye haue neuer tasted or torned you towardes me more than nowe. And whan the kynge herd yt. he thought on ye trouthe of hys felowe & sayd vnto hyr. O my moost dere lady & quene. it was not do for none euyll wyll. but for a go¦de probacōn & for a perpetuall loue. But she thought in her selfe yt loue shall ye neuer more haue of me. but yt dyspyte she thought I shall auenge vpon the. Tho was there a Knyght yt she afore had a lytell loue and fauour vnto. & she began for to loue hym more & mo∣re. so longe tyll at ye laste they thoughte & ymagyned how they myght destroye & sle ye kyng. & therfor they gate poyson & poysoned ye kynge. soo yt yf he had not ben ryght stronge of complexyon he had deyed therof but it wrought in hym so sore yt it caused hym to be ye moost foule and horryble lepre or laser yt euer was se¦ne vpon erthe. The lordes & noble men of his realme & the quene also seynge this despysed hym & sayd. yt it behoued not a lepre to regne vpon vs. for he sholde not procure nor engendre ony fayre or clene heyres. And so he was deposed of ye dygnyte royall. & dryuen
out of his realme. ¶ In the meane tyme deyed the Emperour of Rome. & Lodwyk wedded ye doughter & after that Lodwykes fader deyed. so that Lodwy∣ke reygned bothe Emperoure & kynge of Fraunce at ones. whan kynge alexander herde that he thought in hymselfe. Nowe my felowe reygneth togyder vpō thempyre & the realme of Fraūce. to whome maye I better goo than to hym for whome many tymes I ha¦ue aduentured my lyfe. and vpon a nyght he rose vp & made hym redy & toke wt hym hys staff & claper. & yede towarde themperours courte. and whan he was come nyghe to ye yate. he set hym amonges other la∣sers abydynge ye gyuynge of ye almesse. and on a sea∣son as ye Emperoure went out of his palays. all ye po∣re lasers began to rynge theyr clapers. & ye gode kyn¦ge alexander dyd lyke ye other but there was none al¦messe gyuen to them. He taryed so longe vnto ye tyme yt themperour was set & serued at ye table. Tho went kynge alexander vnto ye yate & knocked therat. & the porter asked who was there. alexander answerd hȳ I am a pore despysed man. but for ye loue of god I requi¦re you yt ye torne not your syght fro my vysage. and yt ye wyll for ye rewarde of god do my message vnto ye Emperour. he asked what is ye mater. alexander sayd go & tell hym here is a laser that ryght horryble is to see. the whiche prayeth hym for the loue of god & kyn¦ge alexander. that he wyll graūte hȳ this daye to ete his almesse afore hym vpon the erthe in his hall. The porter sayd I wonder that ye dare desyre that of my
lorde. for why all the hall is full of lordes. & noble mē & yf they beholde you they sholde all abhorre & leue theyr mete. But for so moche as ye haue requyred me so profoūdly for ye loue of god I shall go & do youre e¦rande what so euer happen therof. & so he yede forthe afore themperour & dyd his message. whan ye Empe¦rour herde ye porter name alexander ye kynge of egyp¦te. he sayd to ye porter. go bryng hym in afore me how horryble yt so euer his vysage be. & ordeyne hym a pla¦ce afore me. yt he may ete his mete afore me in my pre¦sence. The porter brought hym in anone. & ordeyned hym a place & set hym to mete afore ye Emperour. & whan he was well refresshed he sayd vnto one of the Emperours seruaūtes. My dere frende do me thys erande to ye Emperoure. Saye vnto hym yt I praye hym for ye loue of god & kynge Alexander yt he wylle sende me his cuppe wt wyne. The seruaūt sayd for ye loue of god I shall doo it. but I beleue it wyll not be. for yf ye ones drynke of my lordes cuppe. he wyll no more drynke of ye same. neuerthelesse he dyd ye erande Anone as the Emperoure herde hym name kynge A¦lexander. he cōmaunded his cuppe to be fylled of the beste wyne & bere it vnto hym. The whiche wyne whā he hadde receyued it. he put it into hys botelle. & toke his rynge yt Lodwyke had gyuen vnto hym. & put it in to the cuppe. & sent it ayen vnto ye Emperour. and whan ye Emperoure sawe the rynge. anone he knew it yt it was the same yt he had gyuen vnto Alexander in frendeshyp. whan yt he departed fro hym. & thoughte
in his herte yt Alexander is dede. or ellys this man is merueylously come vnto ye rynge. & cōmaūded anone that the laser sholde not departe vnto ye tyme he had spoken wt hym. for in no wyse he coude haue knowle¦ge of hym nor yet reputed hym for Alexander. after that the dyner was done & ended. the Emperoure to¦ke the seke man aparte and askyd howe he came by ye rynge. Alexander demaūded yf he knewe well ye ryn¦ge. The Emperour sayd. I knowe it ryght well. Alex¦ander sayd. wote ye also to whome ye haue gyuen it Themperour sayd I wote ryght well. Howe is it than sayd Alexander yt ye knowe not me. for I am Alexan¦der to whome ye haue gyuen ye same rynge. whan the Emperoure herde yt. he felle downe to the groūde for sorowe & tare and rente his robys & clothes. & wt gre¦te syghynges and bewaylynges sayd. O Alexander ye be the one halfe of my soule. whehe is your goodlye and delycate body yt was so fayre. yt nowe so vnclene & wretchedly is enfecte he answered. this is me hapned for the grete fydelyte that ye haue done to me in my bedde. with my wyfe. whan ye layd a naked swerde be¦twyxt you & hyr. wherfore she became wrothe & hated me. that she & a knyght that afore tyme she ought hir loue vnto haue impoysened me as ye maye see. & abo¦ue yt they haue dryuen me out of my realme. & whan the Emperoure herde that he for loue toke hym abou¦te ye necke & kyste hym & sayd. O my moost entyerlye beloued brother. I sorowe to see you in this grete syk¦nesse & mysery. wolde god I myght deye for you but
my mooste dere frende. suffre pacyently a lytell tyme tyll yt we haue sente for all ye physycyens & wyse may¦sters in physyke to haue theyr counseylle & aduyse. yf there be ony remedye or hope of recouerynge of your helthe. & yf it be possyble for to helpe you. we shall ney¦ther spare Empyre lordshyps nor other good tempo¦rall to make you hole & soūde. In the meane whyle he was brought into a fayre chamber rychely appareyl led & appoynted of all maner thynges yt were requy∣syte & necessarye for his ease & helthe. & in all haste he sente his messangers by all partyes of ye worlde. for ye experte & moost wyse physycyens yt myght be foūde Of whome within a moneth were come & assembled before ye Emperoure .xxx. ye whiche were ryght exper¦te & subtyll in yt scyence. To whome themperour sayd My welbeloued maysters I haue a frende yt greuou¦sely is infecte wt a lepry. whome I wolde ryght fayne were heled & made soūde. & no thynge theron to spare neyther golde ne syluer ne all ye other goodes yt I ha∣ue in this worlde. but I wolde gyue it to recouer hys helthe. The maysters answered & sayd all yt euer is possyble to be done by physyke yt ye shall sone vnder∣stande after yt we haue seen the persone. & forth wt as they had seen hym. & perceyued ye cause & mater of yt infyrmyte they iuged it a dysease vncurable for all ye maysters lyuynge. and whan the Emperoure herde yt he was ryght sory in hys herte. & remytted it vnto yt helpe of almyghty god callynge vnto hym relygy∣ous men. & poore people. & other deuoute persones &
desyred theym to praye to god. yt he wolde wouche∣saufe to make hole his frende ye sooner for theyr gode dedes & prayers. and he hymselfe with manye other fasted & prayed humbly to almyghty god for ye helth of his frende. Vppon a daye as kynge alexander was in his prayers. there came vnto hym a voyce saynge Yf the Emperoure wyll wt his owne handes slee hys two sones. whiche his wyfe hathe born by hym at one burden. & wasshe thy body wt the blode of them. thy bo¦dy & thy flesshe shall be as fayre, & as clene as ye flessh of the lytell chyldern, whan kynge alexander had her¦de this he thought in hymselfe. this vysyon is not ex∣pedyente. to beshewed for it is sore ayenste nature yt ony man sholde slee his owne sones for ye recoueryng of the helthe of a straūge man. The Emperour nyght & daye laye in his prayers wt greate deuocyon. & pra¦yed to god for ye remedye of kynge alexander. So yt at the laste there came a voyce vnto hym & sayd. how longe shall ye thus crye & calle vpon me whanne it is openly shewed & notefyed vnto alexander how that he shall be made hole. The Emperoure herynge that wente vnto alexander & sayd. Of all frendes ye beste & mooste true. blessed be the moost hyghe god the why¦che neuer faylethe ye call & truste vpon hym of who∣me I haue knowlege yt it is shewed vnto you howe & in what wyse that ye maye be made hole wherfore I praye you that ye wyll it openly shewe vnto me that we maye Ioye togyder. & yf ye neve ony thynge ther to that I maye do I shall fulfyll it vnto my powere,
and for your helthe gyue all yt I haue. alexander said Syr I dare not shewe to you how yt I maye be cured or heled of my maladye. for it excedethe & it is a thyn¦ge ayenste nature for to be done. therfore I wyll not shewe it to you. howe be it grete truste & confydence is in you. The Emperoure sayde alexander truste in me. for what so euer is possyble sor to be done for the recouerynge of youre helthe I shall do it & therfore hyde no thynge frome me. Then sayd alexander I ha¦ue of god knowlege yt yf ye wyll slee youre two sones with youre owne handes & wasshe me in theyre blode I sholde be hole. & therfore I haue not shewed it vn∣to you. sor me thynketh it is ayenst nature yt the fader sholde slewe his owne chyldern for ye helthe of a stra¦unge man. The Emperoure sayd saye not yt ye be a straūge man. for I loue you as I do my selfe. & therfo¦re yf I hadde ten chyldern I sholde notte spare one alyue to haue youre helthe. after that yt Emperoure watched & spyed his tyme whan ye Empresse & all la∣dyes & chambereres were oute of ye waye & whan ty¦me was he entred into ye chamber where as the chyl∣dern slepte. & drewe out his knyfe & cutte asonder bo¦the theyr throtes. & gadred ye blode in a vessell. & ther¦in he bathed & wasshed alexander & whan he was so bathed. his body & flesshe was as fayre & as clene as thought it had ben of a yonge chylde. Then ye empe∣rour had knowlege of his vyfage. & kyssed hym saȳg O good alexander nowe I see you in yt same forme whiche I haue often tymes dylected in. blessed be god
that euer I hadde thyse chyldern. by ye whome ye be holpen and made hole. & yet wyste no man of the deth of ye chyldern saue oonly ye emperoure & alexander. & whan as the emperoure sawe yt alexander was parfy¦tly heled. he sayd vnto hym. I shall ordeyne to you an honeste companye & ye shall go frome hens ten myle the next. daye sende vnto me a messager. & yt ye shew openly vnto me of youre comynge. and I shall then with all solempnyte come & mete you. & ye shall aby∣de with me vnto the tyme that we maye otherwyse. prouyde for ye recouerynge of youre realme. This coū¦seyll pleased alexander ryght well. & accordynge to ye same it was done. For on ye nexte daye came ye messa∣ger vnto the emperoure shewynge hym yt comynge of kynge alexander & whanne the empresse herde that she was ryghte gladde. & sayd vnto the emperoure. O my lorde haue ye not nowe a cause of greate ioye. that kyng alexander whome we of a longe tyme ha∣ue not seen. and yf it please you to go and mete hym with youre lordes and seruaūtes. I shall folowe you with my ladyes & gentylwymen. & yet wyste she not the dethe of hyr chyldern. Then rode they forth with a grete companye and met with the kynge alexander and whan they mette togyder. with greate reuerence and honoure they receyued hym. and with grete glad¦nesse and Ioye they broughte hym in to the palays. and whanne the tyme of dyner was come alexander was set at ye table betwyxt ye emperour & ye empresse & all the chere yt she coude make she dyd to hym. and
whan the Emperour perceyued that. he was ryghte well pleased & sayd. O myne owne Florentyne I Io¦ye aboue all thynges yt ye do & make to kynge alexan¦der soo gode chere. Then sayd she. wherfore sholde I not. is not his comynge to vs bothe Ioye & gladnesse but more to you my lorde. for this dygnyte yt ye are in by hym ye are promoted. & many tymes he hathe sa∣ued you fro ye dethe. Themperour sayd than I praye you myn owne Florentyne yt ye wyll take hede to my wordes yt I shall saye to you. Sawe ye not ye foule la¦ser. whiche the laste daye sate before oure table. and prayed me for the loue of god & kynge alexander yt I shold gyue hym drynke. she sayd. My lorde I saw hym well. a more horryble man I neuer behelde. then sayd Themperoure. I demaunde nowe this of you. I put case yt he were kynge alexander & that he in ony wyse coude not be made hole but wt the blood of your sones. the whiche ye in one daye krought in to this worlde. wolde ye not yt theyr bloode. were shed that he myght bathe hym therin to ye entente yt by the same he myght haue parfyte helthe as ye nowe se hym in She sayd my lorde wherfore demaūde ye me yt questi¦on. I saye & lete you haue knowlege for trouthe that yf I hadde ten sones I sholde gladly slee them wt min owne handes to prepare & ordeyne for hym a bayne. & sholde wasshe hym therin myne owne selfe. rather than I sholde leue hym in suche peryll. for god myght well sende vs mo chyldern. but suche a true frende we¦re as a thynge impossyble for vs to recouer or fynde.
whan themperour herde this of hyr. he was well cō∣tente & pleased in his mynde & sayd. O wyfe had ye leuer haue your chyldern dede than alexander shold be in yt sekenesse of lepery. therfore shall I open and shewe to you nowe ye trouthe of ye mater. That foule laser the whiche ye sawe was alexander that syttethe here. & by yt maner he is made hole wt the blode of our sones. & they are dede: as ye Empresse herde yt. she be¦gan to sorowe as nature wolde. all thoughe she had sayd afore yt she had leuer see hyr chyldern dede than she wolde suffre alexander in suche payne. The nou∣rysshes of ye chyldern vnderstandynge this. wt grete cryenge & wepynge went to ye nourysshery or cham∣ber of them. & grete sorowe & bewaylynge was made thrughe themperours courte for his sones. & whan the nourysshes came into ye chamber. they foūde the chyldern playnge & syngynge of ye moost blessed vyr¦gyne Mary. aue maria gracia plena dn̄s tecum. & tho went they ayen in all haste vnto ye Emperour & shew¦ed hym yt his sones were lyuynge & that about theyr throtes there as they were cutte they haue a cercle of threde of golde. & therof was grete Ioye & gladnesse in all ye conrte. & gaue thankynges vnto alyghty god & to ye blessed vyrgyne mary his moder of ye grete my¦racle. after yt themperoure wt a grete multytude and company of people gadred & assembled went wt alex¦ander in to Egypte & set hym ayen into his royalte & possessyon of his Realme & the quene wt the knyghte whiche lyued togyder in auoutry he dyd thē both to be
brent in too poudre. And whan this was all dōne. the Emperoure hadde a syster oonly whom he gaue alex¦ander vnto his wyfe. And whanne kynge Alexander had all his Realme obteyned ayen & was sette in gode reste & peas ye Emperoure wente ayen vnto his Empi¦re. & the kynge Alexander ryght wysely & maniy go∣uerned hymselfe in all his feates & actes so yt he ouerca¦me all his enmyes & rebelles. And whan he was in al his glorye. peas & myght. he hadde thought & mynde. vpon his fader & moder. by whome he was caste into the see. whiche dwelled in ferre partyes frome thens he sent to them a messager & dyd them to haue knowe¦lege yt the kynge of Egypte vpon suche a daye wolde be wt them to ete & to drynke & make good chere. and whan the messager was come too them. they receyued hym wt grete Ioye & with gyftes largely to hym gyuē sent hym ayen. saynge yt theyr seruyces sholde be re∣dy at all tymes to do ye kynge plesure. but yt coude they neuer by powerfully deserue yt he wolde wouchesauf to shewe them ye hnoure. wherto they were not wor∣thy. he for to come to them to ete & to drynke & sporte hym. The messager wente ayen vnto ye kynge. & shew¦ed how gladlye yt they wolde receyue hym. & what re∣warde they had gyuen hym. & how faythfully they we¦re & redy to do hym seruyce at his cōmaūdement. whe¦re wt the kynge was well cōtente. And whan ye daye was comen yt was prefyxed. the kynge with a fayre cō¦pany rode towarde his faders house. ye whiche as well to ye knyght his fader as to his moder was vnknowen
that he was theyr sone. whanne the kynge was come nygh vnto his faders castell. the knyght rode to recey¦ue and mete hym. & whan he come nyghe vnto ye kyn¦ge he descended frome his horse & reuerenced hym: with his knee on the erthe. but the kynge toke hym vp shortly. & commaūded hym to ascende ayen vpon his horse. & rode so togyder cheke by cheke vnto ye castell. And whan they were come theder the moder came them to mete. & felle vpon hyr knees to ye erthe & wel∣comed hym gladly. The kynge toke hyr louynly vp & kyssed hyr ryght frendly. & she sayd. My moost hono¦rable lorde ye do vnto vs vnworthy grete honour wt the presence of your persone moost-honourable. The whiche we neuer more can deserue. After yt all the me¦te was all redy. & the tyme of ye day was come to go to dyner. The fader came wt a basyn. & with an ewyr. & the moder wt a towell saynge. Syre all thynge is re∣dye. please it you to wasshe. & whan ye kyng sawe that he smyled & sayd vnto hymselfe. Nowe is ye songe of the nyghtyngale true. for my fader & my moder shol¦de gladly fulfyll as I sayd. yf yt I my selfe wolde ther¦to consente and suffre them to do it. But he wold not suffre theym for to doo too hym suche seruyce. saynge youre aege is for to be honoured and worshypped / & therfore I wyll not of it. and called vnto hym one of his seruauntes the whiche serued hym therof. Then¦ne sayd the knyght. ye wyll not suffre vs too do it for our honour. for we are not worthy therto. The kynge sayd. haue not I sayd that for your aege I forbere you
it. whan ye kynge was set at ye table. he set his moder on ye ryght hande of hym & his fader on his lefte syde & they as moche as they myght behelde his vysage & coūtenaūce. The dyner ended ye kynge entred in to a chamber. & made ye knyght wt his lady to come in to hym. & cōmaūded all other to auoyde & goo out. and whan they were thus alone. ye kynge sayd vnto them haue ye no chyldern. They answerd we haue neyther sone ne doughter. and ye kynge sayd had ye neuer no¦ne. The knyght answered. we haue hadde one sone. but he is longe agone dede. The kynge asked of what dethe deyed he. The knyghte sayd. a naturall dethe: Tho sayd ye kynge. yf I maye otherwyse knowe yt he deyed than are ye foūde wt a defawte. Tho asked the knyghte: My lorde wherfore enquyre ye thus after oure sone. The kynge answered. that do I not wtout cause. & therfore I wyll knowe of what dethe he de∣yed. & yf ye wyll not tell me I shall cause you to deye a shamefull dethe. whan they herde that they fell too groūde vpon ther knees afore hym & asked hym mer¦cye & forgyuenesse of theyr lyues. The kynge wolde not suffre them to knele. but scortly toke them vp & sayd. To that entente came I not in to your house to ete youre brede & to betraye you. but saye me ye trou¦the & ye shall be saued. for it is gyuen me to vnderstā¦de that ye haue put hym to dethe. & yf that come in iu¦gemente ye muste deye a shamefull dethe. Than sayd the knyght. lorde pardone me my lyfe & I shall shew you ye very trouthe. The kynge sayd fere not. for I
shall do you no harme. Tho sayd he. Souerayne lorde we had a sone oonly yt was wyse & lettred & ryght well vnderstande. And vpon a tyme as he stode afore vs & serued at ye table. There came a nyghtyngale yt ryght swetly songe. whoos songe he began to interprete and tell vs what it mente & sayd: This byrde syngeth that I shall become so grete & myghty a lorde yt it shall be to youre honoure & aduaūsemēt in suche wyse yt ye my fader shall be gladde to holde ye basyn wt water to was¦she in my handes. & my moder ye towell yf yt I wolde suffre it. And whan I herde yt I was sore meued & to∣ke & caste hym in to ye see for too drowne. Tho sayd the kynge what euyll myght haue come to you yf he hadd ben made so grete & myghty. me thynketh it sholde ha¦ue been youre honoure & proufyte. The knyghte sayd lorde it was no reason but a woodnesse. The kynge an¦swered: yt was a grete folysshnes of you yt ye wolde do ayenst ye ordynaūce & wylle of god. But nowe ye shall knowe for trouthe yt I am youre sone yt ye caste in to ye see. & god of his grete mercye & goodnesse hathe saued me. & by his grace hathe brought me too this astate & dygnyte. And ye fader & moder herynge yt with fere & Ioye replenysshed fell flat to ye groūde. whom he louȳ¦ly & frendly toke vp sayng fere not. but rather be glad & Ioyous for ye shall no thynge suffre but my exalta¦cyon shall be your glorye & ioye & proufyte. & kyste bo∣the his fader & moder wt grete Ioye & gladnesse. Tho began ye meder to wepe. Than sayd ye kynge wepe not but be of gode chere for in my realme ye shall be honon¦red
aboue me durynge my lyf. & toke them wt hym in to his realme where they dwelled togyder in honour & Ioye. & ended theyr dayes wt Ioye & myrthe. ¶ Here foloweth ye applycacōn of ye exāple to purpose ¶ Tenne sayd the Emperours sone. lorde haue ye vn¦derstande what I haue sayd. Themperoure sayd ry∣ght well. Tho sayd the sone. My mooste honourable & redoubted fader. all thoughe yt god hathe gyuen & indued me wt wysdome & vnderstandyng aboue ma¦ny other. ye sholde not be in appayrynge of youre ho¦noure & myght. but more for the preseruacyon of the same. So in lyke wyse ye kynges maieste which was no thynge to ye hynderaunce of his fader. but rather for his worshyp & proufyte. for as long as they lyued they were honoured in his realme. Than sayd them¦peroure. My dere sone I wyll all hole resygne to you thempyre too gouerne. for I perceyue well by youre narracōn yt ye haue to me declared. yt it is beste to me & moost for myn ease yt I leue this besynesse & labour & take me to more reste. for I am olde & feble. The so¦ne answered his fader. My lorde fader. so shall it not be. but as longe as ye lyue ye shall haue the auctoryte and myght of thempyre to do and commaunde as it apperteyneth vnto an Emperour. but in all besynes∣ses yt are labourouse I wyll alwayes be redy to my∣nystre & to serue you accordynge to my dute.

By whoos coūseyll & wysdom he gouerned the Empyre. yt he excelled all his predecessours in ry¦chesse & in doynge iustice & ryght. And his maysters loued hym aboue all other thynges in the worlde. So that many tymes they put themselfe in grete perylle & ieoperdye of ther lyues for hym. And so they ended theyr dayes in grete Ioye & honoure. and cōmended theym to almyghty god. ¶ Thus endeth the treatyse of the seuen sages or wy¦se maysters of Rome. Enprented in Flete strete in ye sygne of the sone. by me Wynkyn de worde.
