ENjoy the Angry Powers: Do, Feast away The sense of your high Crimes, & Judgment-day: Mix your Frontiniack with Lethêan Drops, And Crowne your guilty Heads with Poppy tops. Errour hath seiz'd, Oblivion seale your Soules; And as your Sinnes are deep, so be your Bowles. Let the Starv'd Country see your notous Feast, Neither with Grace, nor Peace, nor Conscience blest, Let stupid England see the Goblet Crown'd Wherein is quaff'd their Ninety Thousand Pound Per Mensem: There we may those Epicures see Who've put the Kingdome to an Atrophie. It is a Collar Day, Saint-Traytors Day, Wherein that Pseudo-Martyr Goodwyn may, Inspir'd by Lucifer, give Thanks; and can Invert the Words of out-done Iulian,
(Puny Apostate, He! oth'Lower Roome!) And say, The Galilaeans overcome: Yet dare He Text it from the Bible, Than When he both Prayes and Preaches Alchoran. There Peters, the Denyer (nay, 'tis said He, that (Disguis'd) Cut off his Masters Head) That Godly Pidgeon of Apostacy, Does buzze about his Anti-Monarchy: His Scaffold-Doctrines; and such murdering stuffe, Which yet Wounds nought but the affrighted Ruffe Of the Laps'd Aldermen; who have made good E. of Strafford was accused for saying, [It would never be well with Lon∣don, till halfe a dozen Aldermen were hang'd.] Strafford's darke Maxim, now well understood: "Twill ne'r be well with England, till we see "The Complement of Strafford's Prophesie: "The truth is still the same, the number more, "Fifteen will but serve now; Six would before. Sermon being done and Scripture, the Ruffes fall Fore CRUMWELL Bell, and Dragon GENERALL, Long Live CUSTODES; that's the Cry. What's He? In English thus, Long Live our SLAVERY. Custodes is the style, which Pluto lent In speciall Grace unto the Parliament, Puzled what Title to assume: No shame; Father and Sonnes may go by the same Name. For These this Feast is kept, while Orphans cry, And I and Lilburne are in Custody. The Anthropophagi are set: They Feed, "Let them Feed on, 'twill be their Time to Bleed. First Course is Bishops Lands; A stately Dish, Quoth OLIVER, and Cook'd unto my Wish.
Next, in a Charger, Deanes and Chapters are Plac'd against Martyn; 'Tis Mar-prelates Fare. Reach that great Oleo to the Generall, Th' Estates of poore Delinquents; Give't him All. Lenthall and St. Iohns, both, are feeding hard on A Glorious Messe; O! 'tis a generall Pardon. Prideaux is Late come in, and had almost Staying for Packet-money, kiss'd the Post. Mildmay is for his Didledam's; and ownes No Fare so choice, as that of pretious Stones. "Goodwyn and Peters at a Table sit, "Eating Sequestred Livings at a bit. But, O! Custodes raile upon the Cookes Full sore; The King's, Queen's, Prince's Lands & Duke's Are not enough, their stomachs wamble; they Feare Their Digestion, that They will not stay; A filthy Norman Hogo of a Nullum Occurrit Regi, does like Stibium pull 'um. The Iudges have, in skins of Parchment, boyl'd A Magna-Charta-Pudding; which was spoyl'd And Broke it i'th' Seithing; that nor Wild, nor Pheasant Could find one Reason in't, or ought that's pleasant. Mick Oldsworth in his Independent Clothes Is feeding PEMBROKE with a Broth of Oaths. "BRADSHAW surveys the Dishes and the Meat, "And likes All Well; but yet—He dares not Eate. Now, for a Cheese and for Digestions sake The SEALE is brought; and Atkins gives a Cake. They're Fill'd; not Satisfi'd: They're now for Wine. O for a Draught, such as black Catiline
Drank to be-ransack'd Rome! Heark! Ner's Song, Whil'st the Accursed Health doth passe along. Viner the Goblet holds, and Peters Fills; And Goodwyn Consecrates; and CRVMWELL swils: The Draught is CHARLS his bloud, a crimson wine, The Health's [Confusion to the Royall Line.] Hall, The Health goes round, Round through the Cursed "And no Man sees, THE HAND UPON THE WALL.
