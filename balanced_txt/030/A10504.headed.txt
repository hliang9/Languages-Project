TO HIS SINGVLAR frind Francis Mery marchant of the Cite of London Thomas Rainold uuisshith, al helth. THE strong obligation uuherein, throu your spe∣cial humanite, y find mi∣self right straightli obli∣gid and bound, uuil in no uuise suffer forgetfulnes of the infinite benefites daili receauid at your hands in to mi mindful mind to make eni unlau∣ful entree. But continualli calling on, & setting before mine inuuard eyes, on thone side, the uuaighti burden of bound dueti, on thouther, the feoble correspondencie of mi smal poure, engendrith in mi fantasi so perplex and douteful deliberation, that cōparing the remissnes of mi slender poure, uuith the excess of your singular meri∣tes, y can conceaue but smal hope uuith so litil force, euer to discarge me of so greate and graue a bond. Notuuithstanding, uuilling in this behalf to ensue the example of honest dettars, as ye, I am certain, do of gē∣til Creditors, uuhereas y am not able at one paiment, to aquite the total sum of mi due det, if as pour, time, pla∣ce, and occation do geue, y declare mi self, in that y mai, sumuuhat touuards, and readili uuilling, y dout not but your uuont curtesi uuil accept diligēt endeuar, in place
of a meane contentation. Vuhereas a feu moneths passid, ye bought, onli oppon mi commendation, a certain por∣tion of the Oile, surnamid Imperial, thereoppon requi∣ring me to uurite you a short memori of the most nota∣ble qualitees thereof, so soone as conuenient leasar uuold suffer me, parteli to perfurm mi promes to the inuentor of the said Oile longsith made, but cheifli glad to embra∣ce this occation, uuherebi y mought seeme to haue found sum matter, therein to shou the inclination of mi hart touuards the accomplisshemēt of eni your uertuous de∣sires, y fourthuuith toke in hand to compile, as ye see, this simple and rude treatise. The uuhiche, albeit it shal mani∣festli appere far & uuide disansuuerable, bothe to your expectation, mi desire, and also the uuoorthines of the matter, yet y trust ye uuil haue respect rather to the prompt good uuil of one, uuhiche in eueri thing to his utter, is muche fainar to gratifie, then hable, to satisfie suche his rare & approuid frind. And in your so doing, ye shal encrease in me sprite and courage, by litil and li∣til, to excogitate hereaffter sum matter more peraduen∣ture aggreable bothe to your appetite, and also mi fan∣tasi. In the meane uuhile, fare ye most harteli uuel. From Venice the first of Marche.
HONOR, saith the good old pro¦uerb, nourisshith art: whiche saiēg of no less uerite, then antiquite, if in oure aege as in times auncient were remembrid and regardid, no doute but, th' actiuite of mens witts at this present being no less liueli, and forward then, the same of them in times passid, there wold be brought furth in these our daies, as gre¦ate effects of wittie ingene, as haue ben from time to time from our aun∣ciēt predicessars successiueli hitherto receauid: who hathe so litill wordli experience that loking abrode seith not with his eyes, withi thes feu yea∣res, in al kind of arts and sciences su∣che an increase, yea perfection engen∣drid & upsprung, that almost it sea∣mith there can be no addition made to
that the late wits of men haue contri∣uid, inuentid, and throuhli furnisshid? So that the fine industrie and sharp wittines of men in those latter daies in al maner of knouledge, & experiē∣ces, haue so far and earnestli trauelid, and eache his science so renuid, & pul∣lisshid, that the excellēt effects and in∣uentions, of thes feu yeares, mai be cōparid, and estemid equiualent with the inuētions of mani hundrith yea∣res before. Examples hereof be so ma∣ni & plentitul, that were it to mi pre∣sent pourpose, y mought therewith furnisshe furth a greate uolume. But as there be diuers, whome the sight and fruition of faire fruicts do muche delight and reioice, so be there wel few, whome the care to set, or chea∣resshe the plats wherefro suche fruits mought be lookid for, doith enithing touche, wherebi it cummith to pass, that mani of whome outherwise mo∣ught
be hoopid greate aboundance of excellēt fruits and uertuous inuen∣tions, eather for lack of sufficient suc∣kor, as the ueri humor of there tree, thei can not encrease, ne til due season nourishe there fruit, but are constrai∣gnid to suffer them perisshe in the blossome, or if there good aduenture be, to attaigne unto the perfection of fruit, the same, with the blasts of en∣uie is so windshaken, that the tree of his fruit litil praise & less proffet en∣ioieth. That foule uice of ingratitu∣de, right mani apt & hable witts, from the atcheauing & entreprise of mani wurthie matters, doith daili, no doute, withold & greateli discourage, hauing ouer muche regard & respect, tow∣ards the uilite of that comon raigning deuillisshe uice. But in there so doing, as peraduenture thei mai be commē∣did for wise, circumspect, & maintai∣gnars of thereoune tranquillite and
quietnes, so yet suche priuate pruden∣dencie is open iniurie & enimite to the common welth of mankind and al posterite. Yf oure auncients wold haue ben abasshid, or witholden frō wel doing, or writing, for eni suche respects, raigning in there dais as mu∣che ingratitude as nou in ours, we shold haue found ourself at this ti∣me, in so profound darcknes & igno∣rancie of al uerite, that litill shold be the difference betuuene us and bruit beests. Treu it is, that to the said incom∣modite of Enuie be subiectid, in maner with oute exception, al suche, who with there pen, paine themself to pu∣blisshe eni kind of matter, nameli being annexid with sum noueltie or rarenes. For anon as in writing aman haue his concepts once dischar∣gid, & set at large, ful mani Iudges, & of as uariable senses & opinions doith
that pout writing furthuuith acquire; Sum wil improue it because nothing can like them but there oune: Sum, be cause thei not wel understand the matter: Outher, to seeme therebi the wisar and more skillful: But he that is so tender ouer his name that to shun and auoid the nipps of girning Enuie, wil abstaign and forbare to puttfurth eni suche talēt, whereuuith the geuer of al goodnes doith endue him, take he heade, leest whilst he sea∣kith by that meanes to seme wordli wise, he becum ungodli wickid: For somuche as it ought to be persuua∣did to al unfainid Christians, no man to be wise, to be cunning, mightie, ritche, of eni outher gifft at gods hād to haue receauid, for his oune oneli peculiar aduauntage, glori, promotion, welth, or pleasir, but thereuuithal to the utilite, commodite, & benefit of al mē, in that mai lie in him: And where
as ther be mani and mani things, we∣reof the brittel and feoble nature of mankind hath daili necessite, & indi∣gence, as wel to the saffe maintaining and upholding of his helth & wel fare, as also to the repairing & resto∣ring of the same being enithing de∣caied or emperisshid, who so can deuise or inuent eni maner of thing whereby man mai perceauer, and the better continue in good helth, or fal∣len therefro, the sonar and moore ef∣fectuousli recouer the same: Suche inuentor and deuisar in mi opinion, not onli meritith praise and cōmen∣dation of al them that wourtheli be cōprehendid under the name of man, but also in conscience is straightli bound, to publisshe it so largeli, that the utilite thereof mai be extendid & spred ouer al men: For therefore, no doute doith god enspire diuers men with sundri knouledge, that eache
with outher frindeli communicating his receauid talent, one therebi shold find himself the nearar bound & be∣holding to the outher. So that by suche unpartial distri∣bution of his manifold graces, god hath throu his diuine pollici, in a cer∣tain amite, & leege, meruelousli unitid and knit al this wide wordle to ge∣ther: Vvere it not, that one man, one Cite, one Nation, had neade of an ou∣thers cōmoditees, wisedome, counceil, help, serueis, soukar, ritches, uerili one wold contemn & neglect an outher wurs then straunge doggs togea∣ther. Considerid then, that gods bountie doith thus gather and bind us in one, throu his indifferent liberalise, who that enuieth, dispraisith, detractith an outhers gifft, malignith, despicith, re∣prouith, and doith open contumeli euen to god the geuer thereof. Nea∣ther
forcith it housmal in apparence suche qualite do seame: forsomuche as al & sum, the less withe the moo∣re, at his hands ought to be taken with like thāckfullnes: neather is eni thing to be takē as litil or smaul, that from so plentiful an hand procea∣dith: But what shold y speake of the smalnes or greatenes of eni qualite, when al that cōsistith in the accepta∣tion of mans light hed: Vve see daili certain arts and qualitees, had in the top of al estimation, there Artificers embracid, honorid, & enritchid, whi∣che notuuithstanding solitil proffite the cōmone welthe of men, that mu∣che rather thereto thei be mere perni∣tious & dammageable: wurthie, if oure Iudgement, throu blind appetite were not wholi corruptid, to be for∣gotton, unexersicid & utterli banis∣shid: wheras in the meane white ma∣ni innocentarts, auaileable toal men,
necessari, godli, uertuous, eather lie al∣together neglectid, & unesteamid, not able to ministre unto there poure practisars a scarce liuing, orels be ue∣ri slenderli regardid & scantli lookid on: So that as it is offt and trueli said, eueri thing as it is taken, and not as it is in de de. But as we see that great heaps be compilid of mani smaul handfulls, if eueri man for this part, setting aside disdaign at outhers uertue, wold cō∣tend in al his life to contriue or in∣uent one oneli feate in eni what soe∣uer science conducible to mankind, it is easie to be understandid to what encrease & absolutenes within feu yeares al maner of sciences mought attaigne: And to approoche sum∣uuhat neare to mi pretēdid pourpose, In the noble science of Phisick, as it can not be denied, but that the clar∣cks of times passid professing the
same, haue uniuersalli in eueri part thereof, so earnestli and fruitfulli tra∣uelid, that great wunder, & theruuith∣al exceading pleaser it is to behold the curiouse and ingeniouse industrie of them. One descanting oppon a nother, to inuestigate and right oute enithing mistaken or mistought by there predicessors: to explicate and cleare thigs obscureli & darkli by ou∣ther, eather throu breuite, orels rude∣nes, entreatid of before: to Compose and deuise medicines of most effi∣cacie against al maner of Maladies infesting the weake bodi of man: briefli to stable and reduce that wur∣thie science, so neare as the debilite of mans brains could approoche, unto Suche exactnes, that of a diuining & gessing nouledge it mought becum a certain & unfallible science. Euenso as wel, it can not be trueli denied, but that in this oure time god hath stea∣ridup
excellent uertuous witts whi∣che so straitli cal to examination al the doctrine and documēts lefft from the auncients, waieng, & so aduisidli¦trieng, the sincere from the contrarie, that if thei procead as thei haue be∣gun, it is like within feu yeares, that sciēce wil be so renuid, refresshid, and purgid, that thei whiche hitherto haue boren al the bruit, & haue ob∣tainid al autorite, wil leese a greate portion of there creadit, & be repu∣tid rather for good meaners, then per∣feite true teachars. This diligens not alone in the spe∣culatiue parts of Phisick is usid, but al∣so in the pradiue, daili being inuen∣tid, more effectuous, more sicure, and more expedite remedies against diuers tedious, dangerous, and hard curable diseases? Hou mani faire Simples are nou in cōmone use, whiche to oure forefathers were utterli unknouuen
& unseene: As Reubarb, Sene, Gassia sistula, Manna, Sugre, Ambte, Musk, Ciuet, Camphire, Turbith, the herbs Angelica, imperialis, with a nūbre of outher simples of excellent graces & qualitees: whiche if thei lackid, the fairist floures of Phisitions garlants were gon withal: Again, by the art of distillation, (unto the auncients ut∣terli unknouuen) hou mani faire wa∣ters, Baumes, oiles, and outher suche things haue there ben of late daies contriuid, whiche to the paurposes whereto thei were inuentid be of su∣che forse & efficacie, sum against out∣uuard diseases and sum against the inuuard that no outher Simple or cō∣post medicines, in times passid diuisid mai be to them in eni wise cōparid. For by the feate of destillation the purar parts and strength being befo∣re biried or drounid in the gross ma¦terialnes of the herbs, Rootes, gums,
seedes, wuds, fruittes or outher what soeuer simples be artificialli diuidid, & extractid in suche wise, that the water, Oile, or liqeur, affter that sort throu expert handling sublimid & distillid, in manifold wise surmoun∣tith the simple wherefro it is subli∣mid, whether ye regard the more cele¦rite in wurking, or els the greater effi¦cacie in operation. Vvhat water, Decoctiō, or the best of wines, can so speadeli confort and reuiue a parson for weekenes of spiri∣tes hauing the hart faile, as the liqueur callid quintessence, whiche is nothing els but aqua vitae, or aquacomposita,The uertu of quintessence. by extreme distillation deliuerid from al waterisshenes, resting onli a pure and exceading subtile essence, whiche can Iusteli be namid neathersire, Aer, water, nor Earth: and therefore is taken to be as il were of a sifft being or essence, different in nature from the
essence, being, or qualite of the .iiii. Elements: The same also against late surfetts engēdrid, eather throu natiue slacknes, and cold complexion of the stomack, orels by the euel qualite or ouermouche quantite of meate, hou mutche it preuailith, daili experience plainli declarith: And what outher liqeur so soone as it receauith impres∣sion and vertue of eni thing be∣ing but a while steepid therein, and the same vertue so speadili communi∣catith to the boodi that receauith it outeuuards ouer inuuards as cause mai require? Vvhat vsual oile, so suuifftli pe∣netratith, or entrith into the skin,The poure of Oleum philo sophorum. flesshe, and depth of al parts of the bodie, as the oile namid oleum philo∣sophorum: So valiantli doith dissipat discuss, disparse eni collection of cold knottie, and viscous humors, in what part of the bodie so euer thei be
found withoutfurth: so effectuousli healith old aches & pains: dissoluing & melting, the crassenes & grossenes of gluy humors: warming, & cha∣sing parts throu distemperancie of cold debilitate: with outher infinite propretees. Here also, if y listid to be long, y mought make mention of the oiles of lignum Aloes, of Nutmeggs, of Clo∣ues, Geniper, Sulphur, Eggs, & ma∣ni outher things: Vvhiche as thei be singular against innumerable infirmities, so be thei, & al that hi∣therto y haue rehersid, far and wide surmountid in al graces and excellen∣cies, of an oile, not mani yeares sith,The excellen cie of Oile Im¦perial. bi a familiar frind of mine inuentid, na∣mid for the wurthines thereof, Oile imperial. To this oile, al outher natu∣ral or artificial that thei be, vnto this dai contriuid or inuentid, be as far in∣feriors, as the coursenes of outher ba∣se
Mettalls to the purite and extreme finess of gold. But according as is saide before, as the maner of distillation of wa∣ters, and oiles, is a neuu and late inuē∣tion, to the verie auncient phisitions, vnheard of and vnknouuē, so the ma∣king of this oile imperial, hathe ben as wel to the Neuu as to the old hi∣therto vtterli, so far as y can yet ler∣ne, vnknouuen, outher then to mi sai∣de frind: Vvho, abought fiue yeares past, affter long labour, constant dili∣gence, & his no smal charges emploi∣ed ī that behalf, hauig at lēgth brou∣ght it to pass: for the accustumid fa∣miliarite betuuene vs, geuig me a cer∣tain portion thereof, requirid, that y wold according to mi simple skil in phisick, sumuuhat enstruct him whe∣reto it mought appeare to be most cōducible, and what bi reasō y could iudge the cheif qualitees thereof
shold be. Vvhen y had wel and aduisedli considerid the singular grace of thesa∣me, and receauid sufficient informa∣tion of the particulars, whereof it was composid, y gessid anon, that it could not be, but that special and no∣table effects against a wordle of di∣seases, therebi dueli vsid, shold to mankind en sue: Vvherefore ac∣cording to his request, so far as Art and reason had tought me, in wri∣ting y declarid, what commoditees were most likeli to be lokid for, bi it: And against what diseases it seamid to be most auaileable: Notuuithstā∣ding forsomuche as to iudge the ver∣tue of eni medicine onli by art and reason, without a confirmation en∣gendrid by experience, is not aluuai sure, ne voide of parel: I coūselid him not to be ouer bold, vntil suche time that by leaser, as sundrie occations
shold offer themself, reason bi practise were establisshid. Sith whiche time in deade, bothe he and outher for there parts, and y for mine, not onli in Ingland, but also in diuers outher quartars beyand the seas hauing made sufficient pro∣uffs, of the vndoutid good qualites whereuuith aboundantli it is enduid And besides that, being nueli again by the saide inuentor of this diuine oile, sollisitatid, with mi rudenes, to publisshe vnto the wordle suche suc∣cess, and veritable experience, as from time to time hath ben foūd, and tried by practice to be faithfulli true: y tho ught mi smal labor and paines to be emploied herein, to the satisfaction of mi frinds honest: demaund, and the vndouted vtilite whiche mought suc¦cede to al them, that driuen throu im∣portunite of suche like diseases, be cō∣straignid to seake for speadie and as∣surid
reamedie, shold not deserue eni discommendation, or enuious reproff of the Maleuolent, but rather the fa∣uorable acceptation of vpright and honest iudgements. Plainlie yet confessing, that in mi self y can not find so exact and suffi∣ciēt hablenes, so liueli to expresse the valeur of this excellent oile, as the wurthines thereof wold require, and mimind desire? Onli y mai, and wil auaunt mi self herein to vse suche sin cerire and singlenes of verite, that y trust none shal haue eni iust occation to accuse me of vanite, or eni priuate affection vsid in this behalf: as to ha∣ue extollid the dignite of the saide oi∣le, eni thig aboue the merits, or aboue that, the effect thereof, beīg, aright vsid; mai accordingli approue and cōfirme: And albeit the singular qua∣litees of it be greater, then mai in feu wurdes be comprehēdid & setfurth,
yet minentent is not thereof to sai al that mai be saide or writen, but onli by exemplifieng of sum portion of his infinite vertues, to open the gate, wherebi the skilful and lernid, bi the feu experiences here rehersid mai en∣tre bi them sellf into a brodar camp of farther knouledge. To thend also, that the verisimili∣tude of al that shalbe said thereof mai to the lernid the moore cleareli ap peare, here wil y trueli reherse the sum of the particular ingredience whiche to the composition of this oile do cō∣curre: withoute yet opening al the circumstance vsid abought the ma∣king of it, lest the autor thereof shold, not without a cause claime him self iniuried & wrongid therebi.The simples uuhereof Oile Imperial is made. These be the simples. First, Cloues Mace, Nutmeggs, the rootes of Set∣wale, of Angelica, Imperialis, Enula cā∣pana, Gentiana, & Petasites; the rinds
and kernels of Citrons, Oranges, & Lemmons: the wuds, of lignum Alo∣es, lignum uitae, and lignum Asphala∣thi: thes herbs dried, Origanum Cre¦tense, Diptamus Creticus: Scordion Cretense: Squinantum: folium Indū: Roosemary: Saueri: Mariorame: Herb Maudlene: the sedes of Amo∣mum, Ameos, Daucus, Basel, Semen Santonicum: Coriander, and Carui. Of al these in acertain proportion mixid and temperid together, bi long digestion, and at length with a gentil distillatiō is creatid this caelestial oile, withoute adding or adioining there∣to eniouther oile or liqeur whatsoe∣uer, as y can wel testifie hauing more then once seene the making thereof: Pondering then wel the rehersid in∣gredience as y haue them faithfulli re¦portid, he that wold aufft dout whe∣ther is were of a special efficacie, shold declare mutche his oune sim∣plicite
and ignorance in the nature of things: For whereas thei be al and eache seueralli of notable greate uer∣tue, being here conioinid, vnitid, and commixid togeather, and then of thē al so incorporatid, the foresaid oile bi singular ingene, as the liffe, perfection, sprite, quintessence and diuinar part, extract and drauuen fourth, it must necessarili comprehend in it self the whole sum of the particular vertues natural to al and eache suche simples: & that in more perfectiō & exact wi∣se then thei were before in the simples self: nooutheruuise then Aqua uite skilfulli distillid, muche surpassith the wine werefrom it is destillid, bothe in actiuite, simplicite, purite, penetra∣tion, speadi operation and diuers ou∣ther wise. So that as experience witnessith, thesame once deuidid from the wine, as the lif and soule there of, the rest re∣maining
in the bottome of the stilla∣torie, is as a boodi soules & spriteles, hauing no tast ne relless, but al vnsa∣uerie & waterisshe, therein resting no moore propriete of wine: Euenso the saide oile, as the veri hart blud & spri∣te, of these rehersid simples, obtainith in it the effects, & natural propretees of them al, in far more excellencie, thē the uery self simples had them: And that because there qualitees, ouermat∣chid, hid & allaid, with the gross ma∣terial substance, and corpulencie, can not so cleareli declare there force, nor so exquisiteli excersice there diuine o∣perations, as being by art sequestrate, diuidid, & deliuerid of al materialnes. Neather here preuailith the cauillatiō of sum, whiche mouid eather of en∣uie, or ignorancie, or els boothe, wold proue that neather this oile ne eni ou∣ther, to be so effectuous as the veri material composition of the simples
from the whiche thei be extractid, bi the examples of diuers distillid wa∣ters: of whome sum there herbs be∣ing of bitter qualite, the water parti∣cipatith nothing of that tast, but al bit¦ternes lefft with the herbe, the water destillith rather suueete: Vuherebi it mai seame euidēt that suche water le∣asing the apparent sensible qualitees, of the herb, shold also thereuuithal want the propreties due to suche qua¦litees: as is to be seene in the water of wurmwud, and the most part of al outher herbs. Hereto y ansuuere that this de∣fect in waters, folouuith muche, throu the common vndiscrete and rasshe distilling of them: whereas, were thei with more leasar and sofft tempering of the fire curiouseli hādlid, thei shold retaigne by agreate deale better, the gust & tast of there herbs, as diuers warie practisars do know: But hou∣soeuer
it cum to pass in waters, in oi∣les is an nouthar reason: forsomuche as the oile of eueri thīg is far more in∣trinsical and connatural to the sub∣stance thereof: Engendrid by a far∣ther & more exact labor & industrie of nature, in tempering, mixing, inter∣mingling, & circulating the materials or elements togeather with so mutu∣al and frindli action & passion, the one within th'outher, thereto aiding the moderation of internal and exter¦nal heate as digestar, cōcoctar, and ri∣par of al, that beīg thus once, by the∣se meanes the contrariete & ennimite of the foure Elements conciliate, and accordid togither, thei neuer affter bi eni meane can be seuerid a sundar a∣gain: So strait be thei enlinckid the one within the outher, that what vio¦lence so euer is done to them, eather go thei to geather, eatherels valientli remaigne togeather.
Oile then is the likeur most per∣manent & durable lest subiect to cor¦ruption, dissolution, dissipation: whe∣rein nature lockith & vpclosith al her iuels; In things animate, as man and outher liuing beasts, it is the treasor of there lift, wherewith there natu∣ral heater, is fed, nourisshid and main∣taignid: In plants and outher vegita∣bles it barith suche autorite, that whe¦re it most Aboundith, there is that Plant most liueli, continuith longest, withstandith best al iniuries of wea∣ther, remaignith longar fresshe and greane: as the Baie tre, the Box, the vi¦ne, the olife tre, the herbe Aloe, Rose∣marie, and mani moo. Vuhereas outher being less oilie or gummi, hauing a moore fluy, and waterisshe composition, soone fade, & wither a waie, the weakenes of the water for eueri smal distemperancie of weather forsaking the substance
wherein it was. Being then manifest, that the oili part of eache thing, is it, wherein the sprites, life, and cheif vertue of thesa∣me be conseruid and most resident; it is nothing tobe doutid but he whi¦che oute of eni plant can thesame saf∣feli withoute ouermuche violencie of fire extract, shal furth with enioie a liqeure muche more medicinable a∣gainst al diseases, then the plant self: By reason that, besides it hathe thesa∣me qualitees, it hathe them in a moo∣re simplicite & purite: Vuhat differ∣rence is betuuene qualitees annexid with tenuite, thinnes, or subtilite of substance, & the same matchid with crassenes of substāce, vnto Phisitions it is not vnknouen: Yet not al te∣nuite, thinnes, or subtilite of substan∣ce wurkith with like efficacie in the bodie of man: Aqua vite, of whome we spake before, brought by offt rei∣teration
of distillation to suche extre∣me subtilie, that no waterie part re∣maign therein, so that asponeful or sausarfull thereof beīg set a fire, it cō∣sumith hooli in to flame, withoute le¦uing eni maner of humor or water behind: Thus handlid, y sai, it is the most daintie, thin, fine, and simple li∣qeur that by mans wit can be inuē∣tid: Not with standing, eni vtter part of mans bodie being, for sum cause bathid or fomentid thereuuith, skant∣li it entre the poores of the skin, but veri swiftteli throu the smal hea∣te of the skin it smookith and drieth awai agein, leuing smal empressiō or efficacie behind it: Likeuuise against eni cold disease, or surfetts being drunck, what it cando, it doith soo∣denli & oute of hand, warming the stomack, running euery where abro∣de into the vaines, multiplieng for a time & conforting the debilitate spri∣tes
of the bodie: but suche his opera∣tion right soone ceassith & his pou∣re vanisshith auuai anon. the efficacie of oil Impe∣rial.This present oile imperial being on eni external part ēnointid remain∣gnith not without oppō the face of the skin, ne by the heate thereof smokith or consumith awaie, but speadeliper cith, & enterith the poo∣res, in maner without rubbing the∣reof on the skin: warming, opening, dilating thesame part, & being the∣reunder eni opilation, or collection of knotti cold humours, the same it vn∣doith, diuidith, meltith, dissoluith, and vtterli disparsith: making waie, & so preparing the matter, that nature, ha∣uing in her eni force mai lightli dis∣charge herself in expelling that, whi∣che before throu grossenes, withsto∣de al her poure & endeuoure: Again, the same oile receauid by eni meanes within fourth, warmith the stomack,
dissoluith ventosite, openith opilatiōs, or stoppings engendrid of cold hu∣mors; It passith also, albeit not so ha∣steli as aqua uite, into the vaines, dila∣ting it selfe ueriuuhere; caried to the raigns or kidnees, prouokith urine breakith the, stoone: Mounting or descending, in the outher vaines of the boodie, for the oili part sake it is the more familiarli receauid; throu qualitees annexid with subtilite & extreame tenuite, dissoluing and ra∣rifieng cold and vndigestid humors ther found▪ wherebi thei be made the aptar, eather to be ouercum and di∣gestid, orels utterli by swet, & outher meanes of Expulsiō to be thrust ou∣te of the boodi: Conuaied to the hart, it fortifieth and confortith the same, encreasing the natural vigeur & pour thereof: wherebi it mai the better withstand the assalts, and inuasions of eni uenemous or pestelent uapo∣urs,
by eni occations creaping the∣reto. These & infinite outher effects it wurkith in the bodie of man, as sum∣uuhat more particularli shalbe saide hereaffter, and that not slightli of passingli as aqua uite, whiche doith but as it were looke into the bodie, and sodenli bestoing it self abroode, takith his leue again, not able throu the extreme simplicite of his substā∣ce, to abide eni while the heate of the boodie, but of the same ueri soone is consumid and resoluid: but if it be re∣ceauid with ale or wine it endurith longar in the bodi, and wurkith moore sadli: The deades and opera∣tions of oile Imperial be infiniteli more constant, & stable: for bi reason of his oilines, it hathe his substance better compact, & fixid to gither, and threrefore abidith, & endurith lon∣gar while, withstanding the grea∣dines
of the boodeli heate, fortifieng and encreasing the same, becumming thereto an aide and soueraign suc∣kar, towards the vanquesshing, ex∣pulsion, and subduing of eni noisom and rebel humors; & the retempering of eni distemperid part. And albeit that being, as it is, oile, and therefore sum what of substance more crass, it mought seame, by so∣muche, to be less apt with suche ce∣lerite to be distributid into the vai∣nes, as Aqua vite, whiche is, as it we∣re, nothing els but firi aier concretid into the similitude of water; yet in this oile the foure elements, yea the grossest of them, by the benefit of nature be so subtiliatid, raffinid, and depurid, that trueli neuer hitherto eni oile hathe ben, or, in mi opinion, by the wurke of nature cā be, more sim∣ple, subtile and Aierial, Vvherebi veri speadeli it exersisith his propreties, &
soone bestouuith it self abroode. Farther whereas Odor and gud sa∣uour, concurrant with good quali∣tees is no smal commendation in eni maner of Medicine or meate appli∣cable to the vse of mans boodie, ma∣king the same the more grate, and Amiable vnto the receauar, & signi∣fieng sum special grace of mixtion to the Medicine by celestial fauor & influenceinstinctid; no outher wise then in Musick, certain concords & consonancies concurring together, engender aboue outher, a merue∣lous suueatenes of armonie & hea∣uenli melodie, rauisshing the hea∣rars in wunderful delight and reioi∣se: albeit that no man readili can al∣ledge sufficient reason wherefore su∣che concord more then outher, shold be agreable & pleasant to the eare of man: But whether the grace of gud sauour, be to be ascribid unto sum
particular and notable proportion & consonancie of the foure Elemēts, or els to sum Quintessential propre∣te, and diuine influxe, it wold breede a long prossess to discuss: Onli this of oile Imperial mai beaffirmid, that emong the oiles al, in good and uer∣tuous odor none mai be cōparid to it: a plain testimoni that therein be hid and harberid sprites of no smaul excellentie. So that whereas these mani yea∣res there hathe ben emong curious witts, greate contrauersie and que∣stion, of the high medicine, namid for his excellent efficacie, in praeseruing and prolonging the life of man, Eli∣xir vitae; althings indifferentli waied, and so comparid together, that laude and praeheminencie, mai muche mo∣re iustli be attribute vnto this rare et wurthie oile, then vnto suche oiles, waters, Aurū potabile, and outher
fancies, by diuers alledgid, proposid, and far aboue there merites exaltid and magnified: Notwithstanding to auoid al fantastical vanite, y saie, the ueri true Elixir vitae, maintaignar and prorogar of the same, is the hol∣som habite, state, compositīon, or complexion of the boodi, upholden & maintaignid with the temperan∣cie of conuenient diete; eaquabilite of natural heate, stearid vp & quickned throu necessarie and moderate exer∣sice: And with excheuing the exces of al passions or affections of the mind: ln whome these propreties be founde, it mai be wel said, the same to haue the veritrade, meane, and elixir of long and helthsum liff. But forsomuche as the blind be∣witchid wil of man, hath renoun∣cid the iust gouernance of reason, and yeldid it self as captif to the tyran∣nical iurisdiction of vnbridlid sen∣sual
and appetites, it folowith, that feu or none there be, al thouh there state or complexions be natu∣ralli neuerso firmed & good, but that throu execssiue misuse of bodili ac∣tions and appetites, it is alterid, per∣uertid, and corruptid: The natural heate, gouernar, framer, deuisar, dire∣ctor, and cause general of al opera∣tions in the bodie, eather by super∣fluite oppressid, scarcite deminisshid or euel qualite into distemperancie alterid: Vuereas then, al the cōfort strength, motion, sense, al the opera∣tions, & actions of the boodie (be∣ing besidesfurth with his apt and due membres or instruments furni∣sshid) consistith & dependith chiefeli oppō the safe and temperate main∣taining of the natural heate inclu∣did vniuersalli in al & eueri part of the bodi; by whose presence eache part is hablid to attract his conue∣nient
nutriment, & the same to di∣gest & assemble to it self, the super∣fluitees not agreable or necessari to refuce, and by conuenient meanes to expel; by whose moderation also, the vapors or sprites of life, of sense, of motion, be engendrid conseruid & made apt to Animate & steere vp the instruments of the boodie, eache to the execution of his deputid office: yff it hap therefore, that the same ea∣ther by ouer, or vnder, in quantite or qualite, becum oppressid, or decaid, that medicine whiche best, withmost expedition, & securite, can help to re∣stoore, repaire, and set on foote again the lapse or fal of the said natural heate, aiding and coadiuting it to the uanquesshing and repulsing of al ad∣uersrie causes, suche Medicine mai, and that not vnwurtheli be accoun∣tid an Elixir, or prorogar of huma∣in life.
This oure Oile, iustli callid impe∣rial, in this case is so mighti and ua∣liant, in helping and Farthering na∣tural heare, to the clearing & vnstop∣ping of al obstructions and stuffing of eni part in the bodie, in rarifieng the densite or cloosenes engendrid e∣ni where, by what occation so euer it be, in encreasing heate decaid, that his operation surmountith al praise and commendation: and therefore mai wurtheli be holden and estemid for The verie Elixir of liff: The whi∣che when ye when ye be disposid to vse aga∣inst eni disease,Oile Impe∣rial mai be amid the E∣ixir of life. eather withinfurth, or withoutefurth, not mindid to vse the same alone, if ye mix it with sum outher suche simples or composts as be aggreable to that disease, infiniteli shal the uertue of that simples or cō∣posts, by the presence of this oile, be enhaunsid & encreasid, with muche moore speade and efficacie perfour∣ming

And to thend that with the super∣fluite of mani woords the readar, be not fastidiat & ouer cloied, or there desire to be resoluid of the final and uttar vertues of the said offt mēcio∣nid oile, eni longar holden in suspen∣se, y wil hereaffter brieffli, and as it were with mi fingar superficialli po∣int vnto certain particular diseases, a∣gainst the whiche y, and outher, ha∣ue offtē foūd it singularli souueraign: not partialli describīg eueri smal cir∣cumstance to be vsid therein: for that wold becū matter of a greatar uolu∣me: and besides that argue in me a superstisious arrogancie, in that it mought seme y had so slendar an o∣pinion of outher mens iudgements, to thinck that vnleese y declarid peese by peese eueri particle, thei shold be to seeke, hou to there pourposes at eni time to applie the same: Iknou tho
y shold minse the matter neuer so smal, or enlarge it so muche as mo∣ught be, yet feu bether that without the aduise of sum discreate and ler∣nid phisition, wold in eni Impor∣tant disease entremedle therewith: Not that this Oile of it self, is litil or moore dangerous, but for this reason that the most innocent medicine in the wordle, yea oure familiar meate, & drinck, vsid oute of conuenient sea∣son, or where it were better forbo∣ren, or affter sum vnordinate sort, mai and daili do, brede displeasirs: To the expert then, that whiche before y haue al readie in this mat∣ter said, is sufficient: Not withstan∣ding for there sake whiche haue not that discourse nor exact iudgement of the sequele and consequencie of things, y wila litil broodar extend mi tale, and specifie a certain of the most notable diseases whereto this
oile is found effectuous: Firsst begin at the hed as capitain general & ouersear of al the rest of the boodi. In the hed of man,dis hed. from the sub∣stance, & the cauls of the brain, al the Synues of the bodi he engendrid, & frome thense by certain meanes, diri∣uied and sent furth vnto al outher parts of the bodi; Throu the whiche Sinue, oute of the said braines, as o∣riginal and fontain, be distribute and disparsid the spirits and vapours of sense and Mouing: without whose presence, no membre nor por∣tion of the bodi can once eather moue or feele; so that whereas the mouth and hed spring of the synues is in the hed, and the sprites opon the subtilar part of the blud engendrid do make there, ther first entrance in to the foresaid synues, throu there ca∣pacite caried eueri els where: it hap∣penith sumtime that, gross, and uis∣cous
superfluous humours, engen∣drid, and amassid or heapid in the pla∣ce, or sum pestelēt, and venemous pu∣trified humor assending frō sum in∣ferior part to the topkastel of the hed do obstruct or stopp, more or lesse, the said gates, ports & entries of the syn∣ues: Vuhereby doith ensue, that the sprits being prohibitid there accustu∣mid course, the sense of fealing & mo∣tion of the bodi, the one alone, or the outher, or bo the for a time is dimi∣nisshid or decaied. he Apople∣cia.If the Opilation & stopping be vttar and exact, cumming of cold crass humors, it engendrith the dan∣gerous disease callid the Apoplexia: wherein al bodili sense and motion be so brought a sleepe, and failid, that offt times the patient, xxiiii. hou∣res or more, lieth so senseles that it appearith the same of at liffe to be wholi destitute.
The falling sicknes also procea∣dith like causes;the falling sicknes. but the oppilation causing that disease is not so exact & extreme; wherefore thei that fal, be not vtterli priuate of sense & motion: For we see them beating there heds and bodi; And that beating of there hed, no dout is done by the instinct of nature: By reason that whereas the passage of the sprites of Motion, is not quite stopt vp, but onli that by the accesse of suche corrupt humor, there course is interruptid, and thei therebi, as it were stranglid, nature whiche alwais is industrious to saue herself in her due being, mouith the patient to bestere himself: but espe∣tialli to steer the part offēdid or gre∣auid; therebi the better & sonar to deliuer it self from encoumbrance of the wickid humor occatiō of suche disturbance: as the like maner she vsith in vometing: at what time
naturalli the stomack is prouokid to discharge it self from noisum hu∣mors occupieng that place: And also in the cough the weasand being tic∣klid, or irritate bi sum humors descē∣ding thereto, whiche, were not the present resistence of that place, wold forcebli entre in to the windpipe, to the paril of strangling the partie. Item in the Hed happenith an ou∣ther tedious disease callid the Paulsy. Vuhiche cōmōli, proceadith of cau∣ses not unlike the foresaid: houbeit not so vehement ne dangerous. And most times ensuith rather of distem∣perantie and debilite of the instrumēts of mouing, whiche be the syn∣ues, then of eni aboundance, or euil qualite or quantite of humors oppi∣lating the mouthes of the saide syn∣ues. Farther,ng in the Hed do raign the diseases callid, Caros .i. the slea∣ping
sicknes: And Vertigo, that is, the Turnsicknes, or swiming of the hed: with Catalepsis, whihe signifieth as∣tounnidnes, or Amasidnes: with di∣uers outher: Al whiche, with the rest what soeuer thei be, haue sum time there causes onli in the hed, and sum times, or rather most, take ther origi∣nal of the stomack. For, the stomack in comparison of the hed, mai be resemblid to the pan or bottome of a stillatorie; and the Hed, to the deck or lembick of the stillatori: so that, what soeuer humors or outher matter is found in the sto∣mack, thesame throu the natural he∣ate of that place resoluid in to reekes, fumes, or vapors, and the saide vapors stieng from thens and breathing up in the hed, as thei be affectid & di∣sposid in them self, so do thei affect & dispose the hed & his parts: If then suche vapors be stincking, corrupt, e∣uilsauorid,
resoluid from sum putri∣fied & rotton humors, thereopō, be engendrid in the Hed, other the Turnsicknes, the Palsie, the falling si∣cknes, or els sum outher notable grief: as Apostumations in sundrie regions of the hed: whiche when thei be ripid and broken, send furth the matter by the eares, or the noose, or the roofe of the mouthe, or eyes, or outhewise as nature findith most accommodate place & region to thrust furth suche matter: offt times also it engen∣drith stincking and rotten teathe and bretthe, with discoulorid eyes, & dus∣kid eye sight: as also trooblid wittes & euil memori. Against al these inconueniens; oi∣le imperial takin inward, beit alone or cōioignid with outher cōuenable things (as anon shalbe saide) shouith exceding efficacie: throu his holsome & aromatical odor, with correspon∣dent
qualities, cōforting the stomack, driēg vp, and sincering alputrifactiō: the uertue whereof mounting into the hed, there cuttith, deuidith, and di∣sparsith al crassnes & tenacite of hu∣mors, attenuating matters congeilid & cludderid together: opening al o∣pilations, chieff causars of the apo∣plex, palsie, falling sicknes, sleapīg sic∣knes, Astunnidnes, swiming, rin∣ging, singing, & piping in the eares; dispatchith old aches be thei ī the fo∣repart or hinder part of the hed, or ells in the sides of the hed, callid Mi∣gremes: it makith the brethe swete: it cōfirmith the Memoratiue part, dul∣lid by reason of cold, or outherwise euil disposid humors: It fortifieth the vigeur and pour of the synues: En∣creasith also the liuelines & agilite of the sprites bothe of motion & sense: clarifieth the eyesight, quickenith the sense of odor or sauour: and likewise
the sense of hearing: Stearith vp the viuacite and present readines of wit and comprehention or vnderstan∣ding. a pretious me dicine made uuith oile im∣perial.The vse of the saide oile in these cases, accompanied with outher sim∣ples hauing respect to suche diseases, as y haue offt vsid, is in this wise: Take of the floures of rosemarie, sa∣ge, betoni, ysope, Gelifloures, primro∣ses, Couslips, damask roses, of eache of these floures the waight of .vi. pēs: of the fresshist leaues of Mariorame, of winter sauerie, Terragon, penni∣rial, and swete garden Mints: of eache the waight of .iiii. pens: of the sea∣des of Peoni, of Basil, of swete Fenil, of Anise, of eache the waight of .iiii. pens: of fine Cinamome, nutmeggs, & Mace, of eache the waigth of .v. pens: And whereas al the foresaid floures can not be had at one season: let eache in his season be gatherid, & that in a
faire drie morning, affter the sun haue one half or one hole houre, shone thereopon: then on a faire linen clot∣the lai them abrode in the aier, oute of the sun to drie alitil, the space of vi. or .viii. houres: whiche done, ta∣ke the foremencionid waight of thē, and thre times as muche white su∣gre, beatē first to pouder: and in a sto∣ne mortar beate the floures and sugre together til thei be wel tēperid th'o∣ne with the outher, conserue wise: the whiche ye shal reserue in sum broode mouthid glass or galli stone pott, vntil ye haue al your flours in readines: And as hathe ben saide of the flours, so do likewise with the herbs in eueri point: As for the ou∣ther drie droges, ye shal beate them in to pouder, and after, in a stone mor∣tar with the conserue of the flours, & herbs, stamp them and mixt them perfetli in one, adding thereto, drop
after drop, the quantite of .ii. spone∣fuls of oile Imperial, continualli stee∣ring, and stamping, til al be wel in∣corporate together: This precious Electuarie, not alone against the abo∣ue rehersid diseases, but also, al outher inward diseases is most mighti and present remedi: And as the disease is greater or lessar, so is it to be vsid in more or less quantite, and offtnar or seldomar times: Being the disease greate, it is to be taken two times the daie: that is .iii. houres before diner, and .ii. hours or more affter suppar, at eache time the quantite or waight of ii. grootes: eather alone, or els with sum destillid water, or sum gud thin brotth; or if the partie be of comple∣xion veri cold, with sum maluesie, or romeni, or outher gud white wine: thus continuing the space of fortie daies: Presupposing that if the quanti¦te or qualite of the humors causars of
suche disease, do require it, that the sa∣me by the aduise of sum expert Phi∣sition shold be purgid & clensid, to thend the medicine mai the better & with more success wurk: not forget∣ting to vse therewithal, conformable & accommodate diete. hou oile im∣perial is to be taken alone.But who that listith to receaue it withoute being accompagnied with suche, or outher conserues, shal find it nothing the less vertuous in his ope∣ration; at what time it is to be taken at the foresaid prescript seasons, one quartar of a sponeful at once, with iiii. or .v. sponesulls of Muscatel, or outher swete wine, otherels with as muche of the brotthe of mutton, vele, or chicken: Sum dipp therein a mor∣sel of bred, & so eate it: supping affter it, a doosen sponefulls of thin brotthe: Outher take it with figgs, or with a li¦til clarified honi, or fū syrupe, sugre, or eni cōserue: as the conserue of rooses,
of borage, Bugloss, rosemarie, and su∣che like: there be also that rolling the pouder of liquerise in this oile, make thereof pills, the whiche thei swallou whole: eueri man as his stomack can serue him best: Not that the oile of it self is lothesum or tedious to be re∣ceauid, but forbecause therebe mani of so tender stomacks, that the same wil admit nothing ministrid in the name of a medicine, vnless it be coue∣rid with sum outher more familiar thing: Housoeuer ye deale with it, so it be conuaied in to the bodi it ma∣kith no greate matter: and that ye re∣membar to encrease or diminisshe, the quantite of it, proportionalli to the vehementie, or slacknes of the disease: As that the smallist quantite be .v. or .vi. drops: The greatist half a sponeful at once, not that in exceding the said measure there were eni peril, but be∣cause the same mai seame sufficient
for one time against eni neuer so strong & rebel disease. Thus whether it be ministrid a∣lone, otherels, according to the di∣screation of the phisition, matchid with outher agreable medicines, it bringith furth suche effect, as of eni wurthie medicine mai be lookidfor: And that not alone in cold diseases but also in the hott: For, whereas cō∣mōli there is no hot disease but that it is engendrid by inclusion & em∣prisoning of sum humors, be thei hot or cold, in al the vaines, or in sum cornar of the vains, bouwels, orou∣ther intrailes, or eni flesshie or muskli part of the bodi: where being coartid, pent, & straightnid, thei putrifie smo∣ulder, and kendel an vnnatural fire or heate, yea tho the humor before suche inclusion were neuer so cold, no outherwise then wette Hey or Strau, laid in a close house withoute
vent, & the said putrified humors as thei putrifie more and more, so wex thei hotter and hottar, by whiche heate again thei resolue in to suche reekes & fumes, that the place whe∣rein thei be in stoppid and lodgid, becumming to straight for them, thei striue, and contend to getfurth: but if al yssue be dinied them, then suche striffe, and contention, turnid into ra∣ge, and furie, fillith the pour patiēt ofttimes so ful of intollerable anguis∣she & dolor, that deathe were to be preferrid. Therfore that, whiche can vn∣stop, & set at large suche humors, by consequent curith the disease thereō ensuid: for suche furious firy hu∣mors, being once enlargid, and set at there libertie, soone dispatche, dispar∣ce, and consume thē self: thereto hel∣ping the expulsiue pour of nature (if she haue not bene to muche alreadi
oppressid) inset in eueri membre, and part of the boodi, to repel frō them∣self things noisum: For this reason a∣gainst al Intermitting agues, as the Quotidian, the Tertiā,against al a∣gues. and the Quar∣taī agues, this Imperial oile is muche excellent: because that the seueral hu∣mors, causes original of these foresaid Agues, throu putrefaction chaungid & alterid from there natural state, re∣maign pen tup and incloosid in sum spetial place, where thei cā not brea∣the, euēt them self, ne easeli get furth. Vuerefore to vnstop & enlarge al suche opilations, one houre before ye suspect the ague shal inuade the pa∣tient, geue him to drinck one quartar of a sponesul of oile imperial, with xii. or .xv. sponefulls of posset ale, or wine, or sum outher good thin brot∣the, forthwith doing what mai be done, to prouoke the partie to swet before the fit of the Ague do entre:
Iff ye list to vse the Electuari, whereof we wrote before, ye mai as wel: but in case, besides the said drinck, ye en∣noint all the ridge of the patients back, from the raigns vp wards vnto betwene the shulders, with the oile of Camomel temperid with a litil of this soueraign oile, the better shal the ague be preuentid, and the sonar shal the patient swet: This ordar being kept .ii. or .iii. times, before the assault of the fitt, no doute al the occation of suche Ague, wilbe dischargid: onless besidesfurth there be to greate disor∣dar in diete. against the pestilence.To preserue eni man from the in∣fection of the pestilence, if he take ea∣che daie, or eache outher dai, in the morning fasting, of the aboue writin Electuari, or of this oile alone, one smal quartar of a sponeful, with sum suche things as be remēbrid before, it shalbe found singular in preseruing:
But if eni be alreadi seasonīd with the plage, then twise the dai, morning and euening, with a quantite of bar∣lei water, or sum outher thin brotthe or rather with the mountnance of a walnut of gud Thriacle, or Mithri∣datum, geue the infectid half a spo∣neful of this oile, incontinentli pro∣uoking him to swet: and diet him be∣sidesfurth, as appartainith: against poi∣sons & uenōsAlso against poisons, stingings, or bitings of eni venemous beasts or mad doggs, the said oile taken as be∣fore with Mithridatum, or theriacle withstandith the venemosnes of suche sting or bite, from approching neere or inuading the hart or eni ou∣ther principal part: Is likewise con∣uenient to be ennointid oppon the place stung or bitt; or to be temperid with Emplastars vsualli made for suche purposes, wherebi there vertue retractiue shalbe made dooble: Besi∣des,
that the subtilite of the oile ente∣ring suche wund wil alter and effe∣blisshe the malice of the venime, that tho it do penetrate farther in thebo∣di, yet accompanied and matchid wi∣the the saide oile, it shal haue no pou∣re to do eni violēci to the parts whe∣re it shal pass by. for the suuo∣ning.For them that are muche disposid to poue, or swound, if, affter eni sort thei list, it be efftsones vsid, it shal deli∣uer them of that Infirmite: to them that be swounid or faintid .v. or .vi. dropps thereof withe a sponeful of white wine or Muskatel pourid in to there mouth, there temples also, & ther nosestrels rubbid therewith, re∣uiuith & callith them again to them self. against dis∣eases of the splene.Therebe whose Splene or Melt, is so obstruct and stopt with gross Melācholious humors, that neather, according to the due office of that
bouwel, it can by attracting the Me∣lancholi part, deliuer the blud ther of: neather yet expurge it self from that it hathe alreadi conceauid, the passa∣ges bothe of entrance, and yssue being obstruct and stoptup. Vuere∣bi ensuith diuers greuous disposi∣tions of the bodi: for whereas the Melancholy humor, is the dross, dreggs, & as it weere the lies, & terre∣strial part of the blud; remaining vndiuidid & vnsequestratid from the purar part of the same, it farith furth, & passith eueriwhere, with the blud, troobling, darckning, obscuring the clarite and brightnes thereof: as the purite, and clearenes of wine is defa∣cid, and discolorid, and the good rel∣less thereof destroied, when the lies hanging in the substance of it, troo∣ble the same: nether can be by sum slyght, depurid therefro, and the lies to his place, the bottome, returnid a∣gein:
Thei in whome the blud affter this sort is with suche felouship in∣fectid, be inclinid muche to al Heaui∣nes, pensifnes, withoute eni external cause: thei feale the light of there witts and sprites, obfuskat, & darck∣nid: thei abhor and hate compani, desirous of solitarines; be ful of dispa∣ire, weepe, murne, by them self cause∣les: be muche suspitious, soone take vnkindnes and displeasirs, reioice in nothing, and weri of this lif, oft desire deathe: al these, with mani mo tedius passions, folou & molest thē, who∣se blud is assosiatid, withe that sad, & black humor the Melancholi: But to greatar danger, and perillous paine be thei subiectid, whose Melt, as ha∣the ben said being obstructid, the black humor that therein restith, at certain seasons swellith, puffith, & heauith up, like soure leuen or barme, in do we: or as vineger, or strong wa∣ter
