An Herculeon Antidote against the POX. AT the end of Thread-Nee∣dle-street near the Stocks-Market, in Three Nun Alley, at the sign of the Bursten Twins, Liveth a Dutch Chyrurgi∣on, that by above Twenty years Experienced Study and Travels in most Countries of the Universe, hath attained to the knowledg of a Medicine, far Exceeding any published in England, and for its Excellent Specifick faculties, de∣servedly called the Herculeon An∣tidote. It Conquers that Mon∣strous Distemper, never leaving any Pocky steems in the Body, but totally Roots out all the Poy∣sonous qualities of it, and renders the Body as clean, as if it never had been Infected,  ∣viso, it is not got in the Bo and Marrow, for then it Requi a Confinement, and greater tro∣ble and pains to be cured. B for the Running of the Reins, Shnkers, Buboes, Ulcers, Flyin Pains, Seabs, or any new Con∣tracted Pox, this Medicine alon will Infallibly Cure, and aft such a pleasant way, your self will admire it, being so friend to nature, that it never   disturbance in the Body, it is of a pleasant tast, and participates of none of the Mercureal prepa∣rations: for I do believe, thou∣sands of people in this City of London, have been brought from a Gonorrhaea to a General Pox, only with taking Mercurial Me∣dicines, for Mercury is of that subliming quality, that it carries the venom from the place where it was first Contracted, and stops the Running, which makes men think themselves Cured, when they are furthest from it, and this is the only cause, why so many people dye dayly of the Pox in this City, all this may henceforth be prevented, with my Anteve∣nereal Medicine, which never stops the Running before the Bo∣dy is cleansed from all poysonous steems, its operation is very mo∣  Urine, nd In∣sensible piration, whereby all the heat of Urine is immedi∣ately abated, the poysonous cause throughly cleansed, and the great danger of the Pox assuredly pre∣vented, leaving the Patient at free liberty to follow his Lawful occa∣sions, either by Land or Sea: It may be taken in the hottest day in Summer, or the coldest day in Winter. If any Men or Women  Fellow, take but immediately after it a Dose or Two of this Me∣dicine, and you will never be In∣fected with any Pocky steems as long as you Live.
It is not my Intention to give Incouragement to vice (with making this Medicine publick) but that all honest Men and Women that have Lewd Bed-Fellows, may preserve them∣selves from that scandalous Di∣stemper, for we see dayly whole Families destroyed with the Pox, and all for want of a good Medicine in the beginning of the Contraction, for once being Radicated and settled upon the Bones and Marrow, it is no such easie matter to Cure it as a great many falsly pretend to, that only check the Distemper for a little time to cheat people of their Money, and afterwards of their Lives. To prevent such absurdities for the future, you will find me ready to give you a true account of the degree of the Distemper, and also put you in the best method for the easiest and securest way of a perfect Cure, and if you are too far gone to be Cured with∣out a Confinement, I can fur∣nish you with private Lodgings, and all other necessaries belong∣ing to the Cure. If any people are ashamed to come to me, or by reason of some other urgency cannot come, they may have Medicines sent them by any Messenger, sending but a little Note of their present Condition. I have also by means of my manifold Travels, Collected a great many infallible secrets for the following distempers, viz. All sorts of Ruptures or Bursten Bellies, all sorts of Agues, the Running Gout, Dropsies, Scur∣vy, Gravel, Stone, Palsies, Kings-Evil, all sorts of old Rotten Fi∣sts and Ulcers, Scald-heads, without pulling the Hair off, and an excellent remedy to fa∣sten the Teeth, Cure Putrifacti∣on of the Gums, and the Tooth∣ach: I draw Rotten Teeth and Stumps with a touch, the Fe∣male Sex that have any private Distemper, may be accommodat∣ed by my Wife. I am to be spoke withal privately, from seven a Clock in the Morning till Noon, and in the Afternoon from Two till Ten at Night. Cum Privilegio.
