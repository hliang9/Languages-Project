An Epistle to the Monthly, and Quarterly Meetings of Friends, in England and Wales, Relating to our Friends and Brethren, Sufferers by reason of the late Warrs in Ireland. London, the fifth Day of the sixth Month, 1692. Dearly beloved Friends and Brethren; WE Salute you in the Living Communion and Fellowship of the Gospel of Christ; in which we are made one People, and united into one Body, by the Divine Opperation of the One holy Spirit, that hath given us a tender Sence of each others Afflictions and Consolation; in which Sence we Pray God preserve us All to the end of our Dayes. Dear Friends, The Occasion of these Lines are to remind you of the Distressed Conditi∣on of our Friends and Brethren, pertakers of the same Grace and Faith with Us, Inhabitants of the Kingdom of Ireland, whose Suffering Case was spoken to at the last Yearly Meet∣ing, as their Circumstances then were understood, and something was ordered to be sent them for their present Relief; which accordingly we have taken care in; And since the said Yearly Meeting we have received divers sad Accounts of the great Distresses, and De∣poreable Condition, many dear Friends are in at their return out of England, &c. Fin∣ding upon their Estates neither House, Corn nor Cow, or any thing for their present Re∣lief; and some that dureing the Warrs retired into Cities and great Towns, from the fury of the Armies, were Relieved by other Friends that had something left. Now since the Warrs are over there, are gone out to Visit their former Habitations, and finds great Waste and Ruin, so that till they are put in a way to raise something for their Subsistance, their Condition seems to be more Miserable now, than in the time of Warr, tho more hope∣ful in a Year or two to be recovered, if by some speedy Assistance in this Time of their great Straights they be but helped, with some Relief to put them in a way of Improve∣ment. And in tender Consideration of these things, and also the Care referred to this Meeting, by the last Yearly Meeting, to Manage this Affaire, as we should see meet, for the further Relief of our said Friends and Brethren there, who were large in their Administring to us, when we were under our great Sufferings here in England and Wales, (tho not compareable to theirs.) And therefore, dear Friends, we desire your Hearts may be Enlarged in Bowels of Brotherly Love (especially those among You, whom the Lord hath made Stewards of much of this World's Goods) Tenderly to Commisserate, and Chearfully and Liberally to Contribute to their Wants. And we hope the Lord will enlarge Your Hearts, especially those of you that are Rich in this World, in Brotherly Love readily to contribute, through Your respective Counties: And it is recommended to the Quarterly and Monthly Meetings of Friends in England and Wales, who are desired to take Care therein, with as much convenient speed as may be, and to re∣turne the said Collections to William Mead, William Crouch, William Macket, Iohn Staploe, Cornelious Mason and Ioseph Wright, or any of them, and this Meeting will take Care readily to Remit, or send the same for the service of our Suffering Friends, as aforesaid. So committing You in this, and in all other your good Works and Services for the Truth, to the Guidance of that Universal Spirit of Christ Jesus our Lord, in whom we have Life, and Comfort, and Sweet and Heavenly Communion. We remain Your Friends and Brethren, Signed at, and in behalf of the Meeting for Suffering Friends, Steven Crisp, William Crouch, Francis Camfield, George Whitehead, William Mead, John Edridge, Samuel Waldenfield, John Vaughton, John Staploe, John Edge, Theodor Eccleston, Michael Russell, Thomas Cooper, John Field, William Ingram, George Oldner, Josiah Ellis, Walter Benthall.
