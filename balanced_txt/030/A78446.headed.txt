THE CENSURE OF THE EARL OF BERKSHIRE, By the LORDS IN PARLIAMENT. Also the great Oneals landing in Ireland, with a Commission to kill and slay the English and Scots there, and after to come into England against the Protestants here. Likewise a true Relation of the Earle of Essex his advancing forward with his Forces against the Cavaliers: With the manner of Baron Wal∣ters being taken and rescued againe by the Ca∣valiers &c. five of them being slain. THe honourable House of Parliament taking into consideration the great number of Delinquents that are now in this Kingdome, many of them sheltering themselves under his Majesties protection, and diverse others that have been lately taken and brought up to London, and imprisoned, resolved with all convenient speed they could to proceed legally against them, provided that their proceedings against them should not interrupt the great and weighty affaires
of this Kingdome; and thereupon on Wed∣nesday last, being the foureteenth day of this instant moneth of September, according to an Order of the House of Peeres, the Earle of Berkshire, being prisoner in the Tower, was brought to the Barre, and examined con∣cerning his coming into the County of Ox∣ford to a place called Watlington, with some other persons of quality, with an intent to put in Execution the Commission of Array, and to seize upon the Magazine that lay in that towne. Whereupon the said Earle plea∣ding that although he thorough the want of a right information concerning the state and condition of things as they now stand in dif∣ference betweene the King and Parliament, had most unfortunately beene drawn away from the service of the House for a time, yet he made many protestations and declarations of his most sincere and hearty desire and en∣deavour to serve the Kings Majesty and Par∣liament in any thing that might be thought acceptable; and humbly submitted himselfe to their Lordships. After which (he being commanded to withdraw) their Lordships had some private debate of the matter, and considering that it was the first action that was undertaken by his Lordship of that nature, and that he had raised no forces, he was called againe into the House, and upon
his humble submission, as aforesaid, he was enlarged out of prison, but confined to his owne house, and is to appeare againe (at the pleasure of the Lords) upon six houres summons. Upon the fifteenth day of this moneth at a Conference of both Houses, were read the examinations of foure men upon oath taken at Plymmouth, signifying that the great Oneale that hath been beyond sea many yeares, is now landed in Ireland, and hath brought over with him diverse ships laden with men and ammunition, to aid and assist the Rebels in Ireland, and that they said they had received a Commission from his Majesty under the broad Scale of England, to kill and slay all the English and Scots in that Kingdome, that should resist them: and that when they have done there, they have the like commission for England, but the Parliament have ano∣ther opinion of his Majesty, and hope that if any such Commissions are, they have been obtained by some sinister meanes without the knowledge or privity of his Majesty, Sir En∣dimion Porter (not being a sworn Officer, and one that is disaffected to the King and King∣dome) having for diverse moneths together had the custody and possession of the great seal of England.
Great cause therefore had the L. Keeper to make some excuse for himselfe, by signifying unto the Parliament, that those illegall Com∣missions and Proclamations lately sent forth under the great Seal, were not passed by him, and although in that respect he hopes for fa∣vour, yet it is probable that now he repents he had not followed the example of the Bishop of Chichester, Lord Keeper of the Great Seale in the time of Henry the third, who when the King sent to him for the Seale, he refused to deliver it to his Majesty, but resigned it up in∣to the hands of the Parliament, thinking it most proper, that those which had power o∣ver all causes, should likewise have the dispo∣sing of the Great Seale of England. But I shall not further insist upon this point, there∣fore I will return to the next particular of my discourse, because in these times men rather delight in novelties, then in antiquity, and these times require that men should rather studie how to save their heads, then to turn o∣ver books. The Cavaliers persisting in committing many great outrages in Leicestershire, Nottin∣ghamshire, and other parts of this Kingdome, the Parliament have sent Letters and Instru∣ctions to the Earle of Essex, Lord Generall of the Army, to advance his Forces from North∣hampton, to march into Leicestershire, & from
thence into Nottinghamshire, for the setling of the peace of the Kingdome, carrying a peti∣tion with him from both Houses of Parlia∣ment in behalfe of themselves and the whole Kingdome, declaring that they have no intent to levy warre against his Majesty, but desire the peace of the Kingdome, the preservation of the true Protestant Religion, the Lawes of the Land, the Priviledges of Parliament, and the liberty and Propriety of the Subject, a∣gainst those evill Counsellers and Actors that go about to violate and overthrow the same. On Saturday last, being the tenth of this instant moneth, Baron Walter, being a great Delinquent, was taken at Broadway in the County of Worcester, by the meanes of one M. Stevens, a very religious man, being chiefe, Constable, & in regard the Sabbath was then approaching, he was kept all that night and all day on sunday at the said Stevens his house: but (notice thereof being presently gi∣ven to the Cavaliers which came that night out of Oxford, they came on sunday night to the said towne of Broadway, and beset the said Stevens his house, and demanded that the said Baron should be delivered unto them: which being denied, they set upon the house, threat∣ning to beat it downe: but the said Stevens having some muskets in his house which had been taken from the lord Lovelace, began to
charge upon them out of the windowes, and killed foure or five of them, and perceiving that they could not enter the house without the hazard of many of their lives, they pre∣sently set fire on his barnes, stables and out∣houses, and burnt them down to the ground, which put the countrey into such terrour and amazement (not knowing the number of the Cavaliers, nor what strength they had, fearing lest the whole town should have been fired by them) that many of them began to intercede that the Baron should bee delivered unto them: whereupon, with condition of their departure without further injury to the towne, he was delivered unto them: after which they went towards Worcester, and have plundered many honest mens houses in the countrey, and seized on their armes: and it is credibly reported, that they have entred into Serjeant Wilds house at Droit (a worthy Mem∣ber of the House of Commons) and have plundered the same.
