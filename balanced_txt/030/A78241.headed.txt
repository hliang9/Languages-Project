THE CASE OF The Coal-Meters. THat the Coal-Meters did for a great Sum of Mony pur∣chase of the City of London the Farm-Rent of 4 d. per Chaldron for all Coals imported into London; which said Rent has been paid for Metage of Coals ever since the Reign of King John. That time out of mind the several Coal-Meters used to alienate and transfer their places, paying to the Lord Mayor a small Fine for the Per∣son to be admitted. That upon consideration of the power of alienating, the several Pur∣chasers did pay proportionably for their Places, and particularly Four of the present Coal-Meters, being induced by the aforesaid Consideration, did about Four Years since purchase their Places, which were sold by the City, to pay the Orphans, and they received above 5000 l. for the same. That the respective Coal-Meters pay an Annual Rent to the City of 80 l. apiece, and the Importation of Coals is so much lessened in time of War, that they can expect to receive little more than will discharge the aforesaid Rent. Tht the City has granted to the several Coal-Meters, that their several Executors shall receive one Years Profit after the decease of each respective Coal-Meter, to be reckoned from the day of the date of their Admission; which is altogether inconsistent with the Design of giving the Orphans an immediate Right after the Death of the said Coal-Meters. They hope therefore, it will not be thought suitable to the Wis∣dom of the Honourable House of Commons, to disturb their just Pro∣perties of Alienating, which they have purchased by a valuable Con∣sideration, having laid out their Fortunes to purchase the same for the subsistence of their Families; since the power of Alienating being taken away, the Value of the Purchase is lessened nigh one Third Part; and it seems hard to make several Families miserable, to advance a small Proportion towards the Payment of the Orphans.
