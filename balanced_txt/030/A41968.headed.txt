A BRIEF SUMME OF Christian Religion. OR, Of things most necessary for a Christians Knowledge, Practice, and Comfort. COMPOSED By THOMAS GREAVES, a Minister of the Gospel. Deut. 11. 18, 19. & ch. 6. 6, 7. Ye shall lay up these my words in your heart, and in your soul, and ye shall teach them your Children, speaking of them when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest by the way, when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. August. de trad. Symb—Simplex, breve, plenum; Ut simplicitas Audientium consulat rusticitati, brevitas memoriae, plenitudo doctrinae—It is plain, brief, full: that plainness may be an help to the unlearned, briefness to memory, fulness to the in∣struction of the Hearers. Printed at London 1656.
SEt your hearts unto all the words which I testifie among you.—For it is not a vain thing for you, because it is your Life. Deut. 32. 46, 47. I pray God that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiri∣tuall understanding: That you may walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitfull in every good work, and encreasing in the knowledge of God. Col. 1. 9, 10. MAny Testimonies of Scripture (for the fuller confirmation of the Doctrine here delivered) are in due order annexed, & ought to be diligently considered. Sometimes the same place, though but once quoted, hath reference to several parts of the same Proposition, which I thought unnecessary to iterate. All joyned together prove the whole proposition, and every branch thereof.
To the Christian Reader. THis short Treatise I chiefly designed for that Congregation, to which as a Minister, I have peculiar reference, which consisting (for the great∣est part) of plain, and unlearned people, plain∣ness, and brevity was purposely sought, and inten∣ded by me: that so being clear to their Understan∣ding, and easie for their Memory, it might be the better conceiv'd, and retein'd. The Scriptures themselves do often Summarily express the chief points conteined in them, giving us an abridgement of the Law, the Gospel, and Means of Salvation: which Precedent I have willingly followed, endeavouring to omitt nothing that is Necessary, and likewise to insert nothing but what is agreeable to those holy Writings, & received by the Ancient, and present Orthodoxe Churches I have chosen such words, and expressions as are (for the most part) used in Gods Word, and therefore of greatest significancy, and weight. I hope the plenty of Quotations will not be ac∣counted a superfluity, which I added the more copiously, at first for my own, and now for the Readers satisfaction. Better that of such there should be a redundance, then a defect, and where they most abound, I conceive there is greatest need of them, as in the 14th Proposition, where
almost every word requires a several Testimony: in this, and other places, the cited Texts may supply my very brief mention of such weighty My∣steries, which in regard of their use, and impor∣tance, deserve the ampler confirmation. Controverted Points I have laboured to ex∣press in temperate, and amicable Terms, and to present the Truth with such indifferency, and mo∣deration, as might reconcile, rather then exaspe∣rate, disagreeing Parties. To have severally expounded the Precepts of the Decalogue, would have been inconsistent with the brevity here intended, therefore I have added one Proposition (the 25th) as a general explica∣tion of all. So likewise concerning the Creed, and Lords Prayer, I desired to mention that which might be some explanation of them, yet very brief, and proportionable to the rest of the summe. Those Secrets of Gods unsearchable Decrees I have sparingly mentioned, inculcating rather the Meanes which lead us to the best assurance, and certainty here, and to a blessed fruition at last of eternal salvation. Concerning Ministers I was willing to add the 34th Aphorisme, specially for the Peoples sake, who not considering the excelloncy of that sa∣cred Office do exceedingly offend God, and gra∣tifie their enemy, the Devil, some by Usurping, most by Despising it: undervaluing one of the highest fauours, and providences of Christ towards his Church, for the building whereof
and perfecting the Saints,Eph 4. 12. (as the Apostle af∣firmes) they are peculiarly set, and assigned. The Doctrines (and most of the Expres∣sions also) being conteined in the Scriptures, I need not be solicitous to make an Apology, or give a further account. Gods Truth, whe∣ther we receive, or reject it, still reteins the same authority, and strength, and is (not∣withstanding all our Opposition and Diffe∣rences) the perfect Rule by which we must now Judge, and hereafter be judged: to which in this summe I only appeal, and re∣fer both my self, and the Reader. I confess that what I here publish, is but small, yet I cannot say that my labour, and study in composing it hath been such also: for I think that with as little pains I might have written a large volume. To make hard things plain, to joyn brevity and perspicuity, and comprehend much in little, without detriment to the sense and matter, to convey the highest things to low capacities, is a matter of great Difficulty, and industry: the very attempt whereof I hope will be favoured, though I much fail in the performance. As I, so others making experiment, will (I believe) acknowledge the words, and Observation of aArch-Bp. of Armagh in a Ser∣mon before K. Iames. 1624. Person most eminent for piety and lear∣ning (who with others hath encouraged me to publish this Treatise) to be most certain, and true, that —Try it when ever we
please, we shall finde, that to lay this groundwork rightly, will put us to the triall of our skill, and trouble us a great deal more, then if we were to discuss a Controversie, or handle a subtile point in the Schools. Thus He concerning the Dif∣ficulty of this Work, and that which he adds concerning the Necessity also, is (in our care∣less daies) to be sadly consider'd. The neglecting hereof is the frustrating of the whole work of the Ministery: for let us preach never so many Sermons to the people, our labour is but lost, as long as the Foundation is unlaid, and the Prin∣ciples untaught upon which all other Doctrine must be builded. The Consideration hereof hath chiefly mo∣ved me to this labour, and my last desire and advise to the Reader is, in the words of our Saviour, Take heed that you despise not little things,Matth. 18. 10. and intended chiefly for little ones: because, they are such without which none can truly be Great, or Eternally glori∣ous, and happy. THO. GREAVES.

The Chief Articles of Christian Belief, con∣tained in the Scriptures, and generally received by the Ancient & modern Chur∣ches of God, as doth appear by their joynt Confessions. I Believe in God the Father Almighty, Maker of Heaven and earth. And in Iesus Christ his only Son our Lord, which was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary; suffered under Pontius Pilate; was Crucified, dead, and buried; he descended into Hell; The third day he rose again from the dead: he ascended into Heaven, and sitteth on the Right hand of God the Father Almighty; from thence he shall come to Judge the quick and the dead. I believe in the Holy Ghost: the holy Catholike Church: the Communion of Saints: the forgivenesse of sins: the Resurrection of the Body, and the Life everlasting. The Ten Commandements. GOD spake all these words,1 Table. saying, I am the Lord thy God which have brought thee out of the Land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt have no other Gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven Image, nor the likeness of any thing that is in Hea∣ven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth: thou shalt not bow down thy self to them, nor serve them: For I the Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquities of the Fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me: and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my Commandments.
Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: For the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh his Name in vain Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy: six dayes shalt thou labour, and do all thy work: but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God: in it thou shalt not do any work, thou nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy man servant nor thy maid servant, nor thy cattel, nor thy stran∣ger that is within thy gates: For in six dayes the Lord made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day, & hallowed it. Honour thy Father,2 Table▪ and thy Mother: that thy dayes may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee. Thou shalt not kill. Thou shalt not commit adultery. Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. Thou shalt not covet thy neighbours house, thou shalt not covet thy neighbours wife, nor his man servant, nor his maid servant, nor his oxe nor his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbours. The Lords Prayer. OVR Father which art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name. Thy Kingdome come: Thy will be done in earth, as it is in Heaven: Give us this day our daily bread: and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespasse against us: And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from Evil; For thine is the Kingdom, the Power, and the Glory, for ever and ever, Amen.

Some special places of Scripture ex∣pressing the whole Duty of man. So Worship I the God of my Fathers, be∣lieving all things which are written in the Law,Acts 24. 14, 15, 16. and the Prophets. And have hope to∣wards God, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and the un just. And herein do I exercise my selfe, to have alwaies a conscience void of offence, towards God, and towards men. The grace of God that bringeth Salvati∣on hath appeared to all men;Tit. 2. 1. 12, 13, 14. Teaching us that denying ungodliness, and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world; looking for that blessed hope▪ & the glorious appearing of the great God, and our Saviour Iesus Christ, who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and pu∣rify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works. Ye beloved building up your selves on your most holy faith,Jude 20. 21. praying in the holy ghost, keepe your selves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.
He hath shewed thee O man what is good,Mic. 6. 8. and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and to Walk humbly with thy God Trust in the Lord,Psa. 37. 3. and do good, so shalt thou dwell in the land. Hold faith, and a good conscience,1 Tim. 1. 19. which some having put away, concerning faith have made shipwrack. This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou affirm constantly,Tit. 3. 8. that they which have believed in God, may be care∣full to maintein good works: these things are good and profitable unto men. Let ours also learn to maintein good works for necessary uses,14. that they be not unfruitfull. Add Colos. 1. 9. 10, 11, 12. Deut. 10. 12, 13. &c. Let us heare the CONCLUSION of the whole matter,Eccles 12. 13, 14. fear God and keep his Com∣mandments: for this is the whole Duty of man. For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret thing whether it be good, or whether it be evil. Io. 13. 17.If you know these things, happy are ye if ye do them.
