Truth brought to Light, OR, The Last WORDS of a DYING-MAN: Being The SPEECH of William Dillon Esquire, Executed the twenty fifth of February, 1662. for the Death of J. Web, lately killed in a Fray in Long-Acre. GOod People, I stand here a Spectacle to God, Angels and Men, sad and deplorable (I believe) to you, but in my inward Reflections on my Regenerate Estate, in my dear and blessed Saviour Jesus, full of Spiritual Hopes and Comfort. I declare my self to you all a true and constant Christian, an Apostolical Romane Catholick, and on that account, I am parti∣cularly obliged to protest that my hopes are totally and solely pla∣ced in the Al-sufficient Merits of my glorious Redeemer, from whose Merits, the Merits of Man receive their total supernatural condignity and worth. To help the compleating of the Sufferings of his own Body, in his mystical, I am come here to participate of his beloved Crosse, sanctified and dignified by his own most pre∣tious blood. I give thanks to those deserving and charitable Persons, who desired and endeavoured my longer Life, for my better Repent∣ance and amendment. But although they have failed in their Mer∣ciful Intercessions for me, there is an Advocate with the Father, even Jesus Christ the Just, whose Power is infinite, to save to the uttermost. As I infold my self in the Arms of his rich and embracing Mer∣cy, so I would be joyned with you all in his Divine, as I am in my own derived charity. I wish you all good, as I should have done that very person, if known to me, for whose Death I am condemned. God Omnisci∣ent knoweth my Innocency in that particular, being in my Con∣science so clear and free from that guilt, that to my knowledge I never touched the Man. May they have the benefit of the blood of Christ, who have occasioned the losse of mine; and God for∣give me in His, as I do them for my own.
