A full and true RELATION OF A COMET OR Blazing-STAR, That lately appeared, and was seen by many who are Eye-witnesses thereof, in this City of London, on the 28th and 29th of July last; with many weighty Observations upon the same. IN and upon the 28th and 29th of this last instant July, ap∣peared and begun to be seen (in our Horizon) a most wonder∣ful and strange Comet, or blazing-Star, of a very great mag∣nitude, and as long to the appearance as a Pike, darting North-wards, very marvellous to behold, for as though the Hea∣vens did open and shut, there was made a pretty large breach in the Cloudy Elements, whence seemed other branches like fiery streams from the main body of such, the Comet, each darting its point towards the Earth; which is the same wonder mentioned in the Domestick Intelligence, and therein is called a fiery Meteor, of a vast magnitude, that seemed to compass the whole Heavens (only the spectators could see but part thereof (the Horizon terminating their sight:) the sight of which they affirm to be on Monday the 4th of this instant August, about two of the Clock in the morning, by a Waterman, with many others in his Boat upon the Thames. This prodigeous Meteor, with the late terrible Thunder and Lightning (so audible and visible to most people) as proceeding from one and the same Cause, namely sin and offence against God, provoked thereby to testifie his Judgments against the same, are a signal token of such Gods anger or displeasure against a People or Nation, with whom by the Sword of his mouth he is come to fight, i. e. to proclaim and make open war: The Reason of which dis∣course,
especially at such a time as this (wherein Atheism and Su∣perstition do so abound, that God is made a meer mock of, in the vulgar apprehensions of a Generation thus threatned with destructi∣on) is grounded and founded upon a sutable occasion for such a sub∣ject, namely the late apparition of that terrible, horrible, and pro∣digious Comet over the City of London, in and about Drury-Lane, Lincolns-Inn-Fields, and the places there adjacent; where appeared this terrible and prodigious New Star unto many who were there gathered together on Tuesday and Wednesday nights this 8th and 9th of August, spectators of the same, especially one Mrs. Sheeres and her Family living near the Red Lyon in Drury Lane, who gives the Relation thereof, that it did not continue in their aspection at those times of its appearance but a very little season. But what may be hence signified (according to Reasons in Nature) namely, what may be the Effect or Event thereof, is left to be con∣sulted and considered (upon a more mature deliberation) by men of judgment, into those natural Causes and Reasons of things brought to pass in this lower world, what (we say) may be (on such grounds) the Event and Effect thereof. It being not our work, in this place, to dress our Language with Art, as though we had taken or were taking any Observation of the Position of the Heavens, as to its Diurnal Revolution, or the Annual Revolution of any particular Star, whence such Observations are to be made; but upon generals we give you our opinion in general terms, and not according to the art of directions in these cases observed, that as the Star so the Ef∣fects signified under the same, are of a very quick motion: Comets therefore do only foretel and threaten dangers approaching (not as Causes but Effects:) so that as the form that every thing naturally bears, as such the power of any Operation in the Constellations is accounted efficacious, doing nothing in vain: Hence is to be con∣sidered, how Nature doth imitate God, in the same manner as Art doth imitate her, as well in its way of production, as to such the form it bears. And although many have endeavoured to argue Natural Causes for what ever comes or is brought to pass in this lower world, we do thus far assent, That as God is the God of Nature, there may be and is a Natural Cause (on our part) for those things that are thus brought to pass by a Power and Providence that is supernatural; subjecting Nature in the way and course that hath a Natural Cause, secondarily moving, as well as supernatural, the fast Mover, by which the Divine Being is extraordinarily acted; according to Causes of both relating to what-ever is thus brought about, either in an ordinary or extraordinary manner: So that not to lessen any thing of Gods Works admirable or miraculous, do we argue Causes thus operating, to an end hidden from us, and best known unto the Orderer and Disposer of the Events of all secondary Causes, that primarily doth respect the first mover. For observing how industrious many Artists have been, and what pains and care they have taken to lessen any thing miraculous, or that may be accounted admirable, (of God's works) by drawing out the minds of a People after, and into Natural Observations of
Causes and Reasons (in their Opinions and Perswasions) for every thing that comes to pass (here) in this lower World; and so by attributing the Cause of all thing: to what is but meerly natural, do in the stead of God, exalt the Power and Strength of their own corrupt Reason and Perswasions (for Judgment: (We say this con∣sidering, and that such Appearances are but Effects of Causes (both natural and supernatural,) for whatever hath been produced in time and place, we do look on our selves bound to thwart and contro∣vert Atheistical Perswasions thereon: And this upon mature deli∣beration (in the consideration of what is demonstrative) we do offer, not only as our Judgment and perswasions of belief (relating to what is Doctrinal upon the Sphere wherein those Tokens are put forth) but also relating to the practick part of Moral Vertues: We having sometimes considered the reason of such Appearanees, in which we are most apt to believe, and do verily conclude them to be a pro∣digious Token of God's Displeasure and Anger against a Nation and People; (for Causes of such his Anger and Displeasure, that do lye more inwardly hidden than that they should be comprehend∣ed by any Artist in Nature;) or otherways are understood than by Subjects, capable of Instructions from the Heavens, (according to their own proper guift, how or wherein such that and those Cau∣ses are so originarily placed) the Foundation of which Faith and Belief (in these Cases) resteth on a well-informed Judgment. Furthermore we assent to their Conclusion, (in this Case) That the Causes of Form put forth (with the signal Token) are exhaled from the Earth; a loose prodigious kind of Substance, and light Airy, volatile Matter, not substantial and ponderous, (untill fixati∣on and fermentation thus made of its Operations in another Prin∣ciple) but shadowing: This Exhalation unto such fermentation and fixation of the matter and things so altogether shadowy and figurative (in prodigious Characters, and signal Tokens of such God's Displeasure and Anger) being so made by the Suns Vertue: And it being a Question, (that is material and weighty) upon our thus enquiry into Causes, (for what is made demonstrative) whe∣ther the Primary Mover be that of the Macrocosm upon the Micro∣cosm, or of the Micracosm upon the Macrocosm? Our Answer thereunto deserves as serious and weighty Considerations relating to a Conclusion point upon the whole matter; so that in the first place we deny not the Operation of that Orb or Sphere (called the primum mobile) on and over all others thereto subordinate; and more low placed under its Raptures; in which such subordinate Orb hath nevertheless its own motion, and cause of motion so placed in a lower Orb or Sphere, and as that Orb and Sphere is moved upon its own proper Poles. But whether  be an External or Internal Cause, is the main thing questioned in the peoples doubts; so that if any thing, or all things, thus moved, are concluded to be moved according to External Causes, and these made or judged to be primary over all other Powers in Nature, then are we mankind wholly and altogether over ruled or forced to act in all that is hence from and by us brought
forth; and so you may upon the same score further argue and con∣clude, That God, according to Justice, cannot Eternally destroy or damn his Creature, who hath no Power in this Estate to resist or prevent any of God's decreeings, either to Felicity or misery: but if you conclude, as certain it is, the Cause of all things to be Orignally placed inward Seed of Life, that is in every thing, even as the good man Moses writeth (concerning the Herb and Fruit-tree, whose Seed was in it self,) then the outward nature and its Bodies are to be considered meerly Passive, and but Effects only of those things that have a more inward and hidden Cause than that it should be comprehended by man-kinds Reason, of the dark Ima∣ginations and Will, (that lets fly at every thing.) And so these outward Heavens are but the Book of God, wherein we may see and read the signal Token of his Pleasure or Displeasure; and in which may be and is made demonstrative (upon an intelli∣gible Subject;) the Original Cause and root of all our Actions: And though this seems a Doctrine different from the Vulgar Apprehen∣sions of our Generations, (of the World) we question not other∣where to make out more fully the Subject of our Discourse (herein treated of) by hints at the Foundation it self; i. e. that we Man∣kind, as we are set to rule the Macrocosm, or great outward World, we had (in our Macrocosm) under the Power of Dominion, com∣mitted a Government over all other Creatures, both sensible and insensible; yea over the very Elements and Stars themselves; which we, since our fall; do rather poyson and infect, than that there was Originally placed any Poyson or Infection in them, that is now be∣come hurtful and pernicious to us, and was to become subject to him (such their Lord) in this Dominion and Authority; we, having lost in the first Adam, are to regain, in and by the power of the se∣cond Adam; otherwise our Sins provoke those Furies and Plagues that are so ready to be executed (by a severe hand) on us (the Of∣fenders) whilest we are Enemies to God's work of Reconciliation. Amen. FINIS.
