REASONS Humbly Offered for Taking Off THE ADDITIONAL DUTY, laid on East - Country Linnen, by the last Act of Parliament. I. THAT since the making the said Act, the Importation of Spruce Canvas hath not amounted to one half of what it was the last year, and several Years before. And that most of that Imported last Year, was bought before the said Act was made. II. That the Duty now demanded and taken by vertue of the said Act, amounts to above 40 per cent. on the Costs; and is so hea∣vy a Duty, that the said Canvas (being a Course Commodity) cannot bear the same, which (if continued) will amount to a to∣tal Prohibition thereof. III. That this Duty instead of augmenting the Kings Revenue, will diminish it, in as much as the Ballance of what the advance of the Duty will be, will not countervail by far what their Majesties will loose by the shortness of the Goods Imported. IV. That it will so discourage Trade, that it will in a great mea∣sure loose the Exportation of the English Woollen Manufactures to Dantzick, to which place we send more than to all the places in the Baltick Sea besides, the Returns of which are chiefly in this sort of Canvas. V. That it may be justly feared that the Dantzickers observing that we Buy none of their Canvas, will lay heavy Duties on Our Woollen Manufactures Exported thither.
