ANOTHER DECLARATION FROM BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT: Sent to His Majesty, March 22, 1641. LONDON, Printed by R. Oulton & G. Dexter. 1641.
ANOTHER DECLARATION FROM BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT to His Majestie. May it please your Majestie, YOUR Majesties most Loy∣all Subjects, the Lords and Commons, cannot conceive that the Declaration which your Majesty received from Us at Newmarket, was such as did deserve that Censure your Majesty was pleased to lay upon Us, in that Speech which your Majesty made to Our Committees there, and sent in writing to both Houses: Our Adresses therein being accompanied
with Plainnesse, Humility and Faithfullnes, We thought more proper for the removing the Distraction of the Kingdome, then if We had then proceeded according to your Majesties Message of the 20. of January, by which your Majesty was pleased to desire that we would de∣clare what we intended to doe for your Majesty, and what We expected to be done for Our Selves; in both which, We have bin very much hindred by your Maje∣sties Deniall to secure Us and the whole Kingdome, by disposing the Militia, as We had divers times most hum∣bly Petitioned; and We have not bin altogether neg∣ligent of either, having lately made good proceedings, in preparing a Book of Rates to be passed in a Bill of Tunnage and Poundage, and likewise the most Materiall Heads of those Humble desires which We intended to Make to your Majesty, for the good and contentment of your Majestie, and your People: But now, if these could not bee perfected till the Kingdome bee put into Safety, by settling the Militia; and untill your Ma∣jesty shalbe pleased to Concurre with your Parliament in those necessary things, We hold it impossible for you to give the world, or your People such satisfaction, con∣cerning the Feares and Jealousies which We have ex∣pressed, as We hope your Majesty hath already received, touching that Exception which you were pleased to take to Mr. PYMS Speech. As for your own Feares and Doubts, the ground where∣of being from Seditious Pamphlets and Sermons, We shall as carefully indeavour to remove it, assoone as: We understand what Pamphlets are by your Majesty inten∣ded, as we have bin to prevent all dangerous Tumults. And if any Extraordinary Concourse of People out of
the City to Westminster, had the face and shew of Tumult and Danger, in your Majesties, apprehensions, it will appeare to be caused by your Majesties Deniall of such a Guard to your Parliament, as they might have cause to Confide in; And by taking in White-Hall such a Guard for your selfe, as gave just Cause of Jealousie to the Parliament, and of Terrour and offence to your People. We seeke nothing but your Majesties peace, and the prosperity of your Kindomes; and Wee are heartily sorrie We have such plentifull Matter of an Answere to that Question, Whether you have viclated Our Laws? We beseech your Majesty to remember, that the Government of this Kingdome, as it was in great part managed by your Ministers, before the beginning of the Parliament, consisted of many continued and multi∣plyed Acts of violation of Laws, the wounds whereof were scarcely healed, when the Extremity of all their violations was farre exceeded by this late, strange, and unheard of breach of our Laws in the accusation of the Lord Kimbolton, and the five Members of the Commons House, and proceedings thereupon, for which we have yet received no full satisfaction. To your Majesties next Question, Whether you had denied any Bill for the case and security of your Sub∣jects? We wish we could stoppe in the midst of our An∣swer, That with much, thankfulnesse we acknowledge that your Majesty hath passed many good Bills, fll of contentment and advantage to your People, but truth and necessity inforceth us to adde this, That even in or about the time of passing those Bills some: designe or o∣ther hath bin a foote, which if it had taken effect would not only have deprived us of the fruit of those Bills, but
have reduced us to a worse condition of confusion then that, wherein the Parliament found us. And if your Majesty had asked us the third Question Intimated in that Speech, What Wee had done for your Selfe? Our Answere would have bin much more easie; That Wee have paid two Armies, wherewith the Kingdome was burdened last yeare. That we have un∣dertaken a Warre with Ireland: all which great mis∣chiefe, and the Charges thereupon have bin occasioned by the evill Councells, so powerfull with your Ma∣jesty, which have and will cost this Kingdome more then two Millions, all which in Justice ought to have bin borne by your Majesty. As for the free and generall pardon, your Majestie hath bin pleased to offer, it can be no security to our Feares and Jealousies, for which your Majesty seems to propound it, because they arise not from any Guilt of our owne Actions, but from the evill designes and at∣tempts of others. To this our humble Answer to that Speech we de∣sire to adde an information which we lately received from the Deputy Governour of the Marchant Adventu∣rers, at Rotterdam in Holland, That an unknowne Person appertaining to the Lord Digby, did lately sllicite on Iames Henly a Marriner, to goe to Ellinore and there to take charge of a Ship in the Fleece of the King of Den∣mark, there prepared, which he should conduct to Hull, in which Ships likewise he said a great Army was to be transported: And although we are not apt to give cre∣dit to Informations of that nature, yet we cannot alto∣gether think it fit to be neglected, but that it adds some∣what to our feares and Jealousies, considering with what
Circumstances, it is accompanied of the Lord Digbyes preceding expressions, in a Letter to her Majesty, and Sir Lewis Diues; and your Majesties succeeding course of withdwrawing your selfe North-ward from your Parli∣ament, in a manner very sutable and correspondent with that evill Counsell, which we doubt will make much deeper impression in the generality of your people: and therefore we most humbly desire, for the procuring and setling our and their confidence, and the other Reasons concerning the recovery of Ireland, and securing this Kingdome, which have beene formerly presented to your Majestie, you will be graciously pleased, with all convenient speed to returne to these parts, and to close with the advise and desire of your Parliament: Where you shall find their dutifull affections and endeavours, rea∣dy to attend your Majestie, with such entertainment as shall not onely give your Majestie just cause of securi∣ty, in their faithfulnesse, but other manifest evidences of their earnest desires, to advance your Majesties service, Honour and contentment, and to establish it upon the sure foundation of the Peace and Prosperity of all your Kingdomes. FINIS.
