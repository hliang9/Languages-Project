.A. VIRTVTE. ORTA. .OCCIDVNT. RARIVS. James R. crown IAMES by the Grace of God, King of great Britaine, France and Ireland, defender of the Faith, &c. To our Treasurer, Lords, auditours of our Ex∣checker, and to all our Customers and Search∣ers at any of our Ports, Havens or Creckes, within our Kingdome of Scotland being for the tyme, and to all and sundrie our others leiges and sub∣jects whom it effeirs to whose knowledge these presents shall come, or whom the samine doth concerne greeting. For∣sameikle as in ane general convention of our three Estates of our said Kingdom halden in our burgh of Dondie vpon the
xiij day of May the yeare of God 1597. yeares, vpon very good considerations, It was thought meet, statute and or∣deined, that all claith and others waires and merchandize to be brought within our said Kingdome from foraine Na∣tions should in all tyme there-after pay to vs the custome following. That is to say, twelue pennies for every pounds worth thereof: And to that effect, we and our saids Estates gaue full power and commission to a competent nomber of the Lords auditors of our Exchecker and others of our Nobilitie and Councell, to set pryces vpon the saids waires and mer∣chandizes, conforme to the whilk our Customers to be ap∣poynted to that effect should collect and vp-lift our custome thereof. And as it is well known to al men of judgment and vnderstanding that this speciall prerogatiue (amongst many others) hath by the laws of Nations bene yeelded and acknow¦ledged to be proper and inherent in the persons of Princes, that they may according to their severall occasions raise to them-selues sic competent meanes by taking of custome of wares and merchandizes transported out of their Kingdoms or broght within the samine, as to their wisdomes and dis∣cretions shall seeme expedient sufficientlie to supplie and su∣stein the great charges and expenses incident vnto them in the menteinance of their Crownes and dignities (so the same be done without prejudice of trade and traffick) Even so it is most certaine that we are a free Prince, of a Soveraigne power, hauing als great liberties and priviledges by the laws of our said Kingdome and priviledge of our Crowne and
Diadame, as any other Prince or Potentate whatsomever. And therfore may alter, raise and diminish our customes as the pryces of wares and merchandizes doeth ryse or fall. Jn consideration whereof, and because we are credibille in∣formed that diuers wares and merchandizes conteined in the A B C of our customes of our said Kingdome, are there∣in valued and rated at lower pryces then they should be, to our great losse and hinderance; and that divers of the saids wares and merchandizes are valued and rated at over heigh and deare a rate, to the great prejudice and hurt of the Merchant; and that divers wares and merchandizes both of those that are brought within our said Kingdome, and of those that are transported out of the samine are not at all valued nor mentioned in the said A B C, whereby the customes therof hath hitherto bene taken only by the eaths of the merchants awners of the saids wares and merchandizes. FOR REFORMATION whereof, and to the intent that all sic wares and merchandizes as at any tyme after the first day of November next to come shall be brought into our said Kingdome or transported forth thereof, may reasonablie and indifferentlie be valued and rated both for the true pay∣ment to vs of our custome and for the ease of the merchants, we haue latelie given power and direction to ane competent nomber of the Lords of our Councell and auditors of our Exchecker, to try and examine what reasonable and indiffe∣rent values and pryces may and ought to be set vpon ilk sort of the saids wares and merchandize; and there-vpon to
make and set downe ane Booke of Rates and valuation, to the effect our Customers may know what to take, and the Merchant know what to pay for the custome thereof. And that it may appeare what care we haue to avoid the least in∣convenient or grievance that may aryse to our people, we gaue speciall direction to the saids Lords of our Councell and Exchecker, that in setting downe of the said Booke of Rates and valuation, they should haue a speciall regarde to the set∣ting of the samine orderlie, and to forbeare to value at ane heigh rate sic commodities imported within our said King∣dome, as our poore people within the samine could not goodly want; or might giue occasion to the Merchants to raise the pryces thereof, sic as Victuall, Pick, Tar, Hemp, Lint, Iron, Soap, Tackle, Cordage, and others of the lyke nature. VVhilks Lords so appoynted by vs haue set down this present Booke of Rates and valuation accordingly, and reported the samin to vs subscryved with their hands, the Originall conteining fourtie leaues written on both the sides. VVhilk Booke we haue for the better authoritie thereof lykwyse signed with our awn hand, and haue ordeined our great Seale of our said Kingdome to be appended and hung there-vnto, and ordeins this samine Booke to remaine amongst our Records and Re∣gisters of our said Kingdom. And therfore WE WIL AND DECLARES, and for vs and our successors, decernes and ordeins that there shall be for ever after the said first day of November next to come after the date hereof, taken and re∣ceaved by our Customers to our vse twelue pennies of every
pounds worth of all wares and merchandizes conteined in the said Booke of Rates, that shall either be transported out of our said Kingdome, or imported within the samine, as for the custome due to vs for the samine wares and merchan∣dizes (wynes, gould and silver onely excepted) The impost of which wynes is particularlie set down by it selfe in ane ar∣tickle at the end of this present Booke of valuation and rates of merchandizes and goodes imported within our said King∣dome; and the custome of the said gould and silver (incase the samine shall be transported out of our said Kingdome vpon licence) is set down by it self in ane artickle at the end of this present Booke of Rates and valuation of wares and mer∣chandizes exported out of our said Kingdome. And for this effect, WE do by these presents ordein and command all our Customers, Searchers, and others hauing entresse in re∣ceit of our customes at every Port, Haven or Harberie with∣in our said Kingdome, that after the said first day of No∣vember next to come, they and ilk ane of them demand, vp∣lift, and take of all our leiges or strangers that shall happen to transport out of our said Kingdome to foraine Nations or or import within the samine from foraine Nations any of the goods, merchandizes or wares conteined in the said Booke of Rates, twelue pennies for every pounds worth thereof, ac∣cording as the samine is valued and rated in the same Booke as for the Custome due to vs, our heires and successours for the samine: And that they demand, vp-lift and take of im∣post for every tun of wyne that shall happen to be imported

And incase it shall happen any merchandizes, goods or wares either to be transported out of our said Kingdome to foraine Nations, or brought within the same from foraine Nations, whilks ar not conteined and set down in this present Booke of Rates. OVR WILL AND PLEASVRE IS that the same shall be valued by the Merchant awner there∣of or his factours, vpon their eaths of fidelitie, solemnedlie giuen in presence of our Customers, and that our custome shal be taken thereof accordinglie. And we ordaine all Mer∣chants als well our borne subjects of our said Kingdome as strangers, to obserue, fulfil and obey this our ordinaunce con∣cerning the payment of our customes, vnder the paine of in∣curring our heigh displeasure, and as they will answere to the contrarie vpon their perrell. As likwise we ordaine the Lords of our Privie Councel and auditors of our Exchecker of our said Kingdom, to direct letters for answering and pay∣ment making to our Customers of the custome of merchandi∣zes, goods and wares, and impost of wynes set downe in this present Booke of Rates and valuation dew to vs, after the said first day of November next to come in sic ample forme, and vnder the like paines as they haue bene accustomed to di∣rect letters for the like cause of before. Provyding alwise,
