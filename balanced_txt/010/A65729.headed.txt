This to be delivered to the COUNSELLORS that are sitting in COUNSEL. AS A Warning from the Lord unto them Before the Terrible day come (that warning shall be no more) before his wrath be kin∣dled, that there shall be no quenching of it. If his wrath be kindled but a little, then blessed are all they that put their trust in him: Then wo unto all them that are out of Covenant with God. By Dorothy White. LONDON, Printed for Thomas Simmons at the Bull and Mouth near Aldersgate, 1659.
UPon the seventh day of the third moneth 1659. The Word of the Lord came to me, and it stuck close in me: And again on the eight day of the same month, as I was waiting upon the Lord with his people, the Word of the Lord came to me, and it stuck close in me, about the space of two hours, saying, I will overturn, I will overturn the powers of the earth; and the word of the Lord came to me, saying, write again once more to them that are sitting in Coun∣sel, to Judges and Rulers; you rule by the powers of dark∣nesse, and your judgement is of the Prince of this World, your judgement and rule that you are setting up, will the Lord God speedily throw down; and you will the Lord God confound, that are about to establish your own lawes, whilest you are out of the Law of God your selves, and are governing, and ing in the earth by the greatnesse of your power, you go about to bring all to your Laws (as Nebuchad∣nezar the King did) But your Kingdom shall be taken from you, and the Lord will have the Government of it him∣self. All power in Heaven and earth is given unto the Son, into his hands is all government committed, and him hath the Father sealed, to be the everlasting governor of his people (the Prince of peace) that ruleth all things in righteousnesse, he shall have the everlasting dominion; new Jerusalem is come down from Heaven, and a King shall reign over the World, and at his coming shall he overturn all the powers of the earth. Now is Sion appearing in beauty, in excellency is she shining forth in the beauty of holinesse, adorned as a bride for her husband; The marriage of the Lamb is come, now is he com∣ing in power and great glory; and now is the Father raising him up to life again, that was the Lamb slain since the foun∣dation of the World, and is yet slain in the streets of spiritu∣al Sodom and Egypt, and there is our Lord crucified; But wo unto you that decree unrighteous decrees, and are yet cruci∣fying the Lord of glory; the cry of oppression is amongst you,
you have laid heavy burthens upon the righteous, and the Lord God is coming to visit for these things, he will bring down your glory to the ground, and lay your honour in the dust of the earth, he is coming to stain the glory of all flesh; the King∣dom of God is now come and coming, and his will is now do∣ing, and done in the earth as it is in Heaven, and holy is his Name, and all that are led by his spirit are led into holiness, for holiness becometh the house of God forever; It is none but the pure in heart shall see God, without holiness none shall see God; for righteousness is the Lord, & the Lord leadeth his peo∣ple into righteousness, they that are led by his grace, are led out of ungodliness, & out of the paths of the wicked, for the wicked walk in darknes, they stumble at noonday; the foolish man saith in his heart, there is no God, but they be corrupted and be∣come abominable, there is none that doth good, no not one; it is the fool that walketh in darknesse, he knoweth not God, for God is light, and in him is no darknesse at all; they that walk in darknesse are corrupted, they are become abominable, there is none that doth good, no not one; They that are in darknesse, are working the deeds of darknesse, they are bring∣ing forth the unfruitful works of darkness, but light shineth in darkness, and darkness comprehendeth it not, for the light hath the Lord God given to manifest darkness, and to lead out of darkness, and to lead out of sin; they that are led into sin, are led from the light, but the light discovers it and reproves it in secret; for whatsoever is reproveable, is made manifest by the light, all that is acted contrary to the light, is condemn∣ed by the light, immediately, and this is the condemnation, that light is come into the World, and men love darkness ra∣ther then light, because their deeds are evil; they that do evil, cometh not to the light, least by the light they should be reproved; there is no condemnation to those that are in Christ Jesus, that walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit, for condemnation hath past over them already, they are com∣pleat in Christ and renewed into his image, they are in cove∣nant with God, they are the Children of God that are born of God; he that is born of God sinneth not, neither can do, because his seed remaineth in him; he that is born of God o∣vercometh the World, and this is our victory (even our faith)
that hath given us victory over the World, and this faith standeth in the Son, and this faith removes mountains; he that hath faith but as a grain of mustard-seed, shall say unto the mountains be removed, unto the Sycamore-tree be carried into the midst of the Sea [it shall be so:] And this is the faith that standeth in the Son [that removes mountains of sin] and the fruitless tree that cumbereth the ground removed, and carried into the midst of the sea. Read within, and come to the word of faith [the word that is nigh thee, in thy heart] that the mountains of sin [within] may be removed; The fruitless tree within that hath brought forth the corrupt fruit, that hath long cumbered the ground: Come to know this fruitless tree to be removed that hath brought forth no fruit unto God, and carried away by the power of the Son of God; so that the pure may be known from that that is unpure, and that that is clean, may be known from that that is unclean, and that that is holy, may be known from that that is unho∣ly; for that that is holy is to abide in the house of God; for he dwelleth not in unclean Temples, neither dwelleth he in Temples made with hands, but his Temples are his saints, it is written that their bodies are the Temples of the Holy ghost, and this is the living sacrifice that the Lord God accepts: Re∣member that your bodies are made a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God; without holiness none shall see God; it is the living that praiseth the Lord, the dead cannot; they that are dead in sins and trespasses, they praise not God, but it is the living that praiseth him; its the Redeemed of the Lord that sings the songs of Sion, the songs of holiness; they are re∣deemed from the earth, being the first fruits unto God, they are them that follow the Lamb in the regeneration, and they are regenerated, & these are they that follow the Lamb through great tribulation, & have washed their garments in the blood of the Lamb, and they shall sit on his right hand for evermore, and they are saved by him, that are redeemed from their ini∣quities, and they are come to the perfect liberty of the Sons of God, they are led by his spirit, as many as are led by the spirit of God are the Sons of God; and they are led into all truth, out of all unrighteousness for the spirit of truth whom the father said, he would send (the comforter is come) he leadeth into all truth, he is come to convince the World of sin, of righteousnesse and
, and to bring everlasting righteousness, and to bring true judgement, and to set up true judgement again in the earth, that justice and equity may rule, that all false judg∣es may be overturned by the power of the Son of God, and all the unjust Rulers that are ruling and governing (by the Prince of this World.) Your government is from beneath; a heavy cry and oppres∣sion is found amongst you, and the Lord God of Heaven will be avenged on you: Wo from the Lord God unto you that are found to be oppressors in the day of the Lords wrath, when he shall come to take an account of your unrighteous actions, and find you guilty of oppresing the just. You are laying heavy burthens upon the righteous, and you will the Lord God plead with; and whether will you fly from the terrible God in the day of vengeance? it is not the hills nor the mountains can cover you from his wrath that sit∣eth on the throne; for a day of terrible judgement is coming upon you, for the sword of the Lord is already drawn to cut down his enemies, and to slay them before him, that would not that he should reign over them; but he will reign and bring down his enemies under him, and by his power will he be known to be King over all Kingdoms of the World; for God is coming to throw down the kingdoms of darknes, for Kingdom shall rise against Kingdom, and Nation shall rise a∣gainst Nation, and there shall be wars and rumors of wars in the earth; for Michael our Prince hath a Battel to fight with the Dragon, and the Dragon is to be cast forth [the old Ser∣pent called the Devil] for Michael our Prince is come to rule in the earth; and the old Serpent called the Devil shall be cast forth, as he said, the rince of this World cometh and hath nought in me; but Michael our Prince is come to make war in righteousnesse against the Prince of this World, and against the Kingdoms of darknesse; and at his coming the Kingdomes of darkness do war, for he is come, not to bring peace on the earth, but a sword, and to set at variance Kingdom against Kingdom, that the Kingdom of God may be set up over all; for the Kingdoms of the World, shall become the Kingdoms of God and of his Christ, and he shall rule over the Nations of the earth, and unto him shall all bow and bend, and unto him
shall all the Powers of the earth be made subject (who is the light) for now hath the terrible God appeared, and is ap∣pearing, and he is drawn neer to Judgment by him that is the light, for by him shall all be Judged, and if the light do not Justifie, then it will condemn, and this is the condemnati∣on of the world, that light is come, and the world hates it, re∣ject it, and dispises it: but wo unto you that despise the counsell of the Lord, O you despisers and wonderers and perish, I will work a work in your dayes, that you can in no wise beleeve, though men declare it unto you. How can you Believe, that receive honour one of another, And seek not the honour of God onely, and have not given honour to whom honour belongeth? for God will be honou∣red, and he is jealous of his glory, he hath given it to the Son that in him all may be honourable: But ye have dishonoured the Son that are giving honour one to another: But the Son honoureth the Father, and you have dishonoured the Son that are giving honour to the Beast: And wo from the Lord God unto you that seek honour unto your selves (whiles you are out of that which is honourable) whilest you are out of the Son of God (the light of the world, and are found perse∣secutors of him whom the Father sent a Light into the world, and in Him he is well pleased, this is my well beloved Son in whom I am well pleased (said God) he it is that the Father sent to do his will in the earth, as he said, I came not to do my own will, but the will of him that sent me, and this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should be san∣ctified through obedience, that you should obey the Son of God (the light) and life of men, this is my well beloved Son, here ye him in all things, saith the Father of Lights, for this is the gift of God, and it is perfect; every good and perfect gift commeth from above, from the Father of Lights, with whom there is no variableness nor shaddow of change; But he is the same yesterday, to day and for ever. Behold, now is the Lord God, coming, to take vengeance, on the Rebelious, that Rebels against the light of the Son of God (in themselves) that have often called them to return from the evil of their wayes, & to return from their unfruit∣ful works of Darkness: But they have not regarded the call of the Lord by the light of the Son (within them) that have
often reproved them in secret for their unrighteouss acti∣ons: But wo from the Lord God unto such that hath quench∣ed the spirit of the Lord, and are striving against him to hin∣der his work, by making unrighteous Laws, You draw the Judgments of God upon you; for a day of swift Destruction is coming upon you; A day of sorrow, anguish, and great tribu∣lation is hastening speedily upon all such as are yet strive∣ing against the Lord; wo from the Lord God to such that are found so doing, at the appearing of the Righteous Judge of heaven; whither will you fly from him in the day  of his fierce wrath, when he shall pour out his Judgments without mercy upon the Rebellious and upon the stiffnecked, that have hardned their hearts against the Lord? Therefore a warning from the Lord God unto you that are sitting in Counsell, that are setting up your unrighteous laws, made without the Counsel of God: this is the Word of the Lord God unto you (whiles you are so doing, you shall never prosper) the Lord God will over-turne by his power the counsellers of the earth thatstrive for Masterdom, to rule and govern the Nations, whiles you your selves are out of the power of God, and are not led by the spirit of God, to rule and to govern all things in ighteousness, Justice, and equity. Wo unto you that dig deep, to hide your counsell from the Lord, the Lord God will find out your Counsell, he will lay open your secret intents, he is seeing you in secret, with his all seeing eye, and he will reward you openly, a just reward, according to your works of Darkness; The Lord God is comming to rip off all coverings that are not of his Righteous Spirit, for all coverings shall be to Narrow, for all mens works shall be tryed of what sort it is, and the secrets of all hearts shall be layd open by him that is the light, then shall the workers of Darkness appear, that hath been acting contrary to the light in their consciences; Then shall they be made to confess that they have been warned in their life time by the servants of the Lord, whom they have not beleeved, neither will they beleeve if one should rise again from the Dead. But I say by the power and spirit of the living God, and
it is the word of the Lord God unto you, (that are siting in counsell) and a warning to you; That you come to Repen∣tance, and meet the Lord speedily, in the way of his Judg∣ments, (whiles there is a little space for repentance left) be∣fore the time come that Repentance be hid from your eyes, and that you are cut off from the earth. For the day of vengeance is drawn neer to all that are out of the Son of God (the light and life  men: A day of ho∣rible tempest shall pass over them, a Storm of fierce Indigna∣tion shall come upon them; Then wo from the Lord God unto them for evermore, that are found Persecutors of the Son of God, (the light of the world) for Judgment is begun all ready at the house of God, and it shall go through all, and end in the destruction of the ungodly. Given forth by the spirit of the Lord as received into his servant known by the Name of Dorothy White. In scorne called Quaker. But the time cometh that a day of Quaking shall pass over all that have not yet known Quaking, the earth shall be terribly shaken, and not the earth onely, but the Heavens also. THE END.
