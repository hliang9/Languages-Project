This Nativity proved by Accidents to be this Princes true Nativity. AGed nine years he had the small Pox, viz. in Novemb. 1647. in that Revolution ♄ was in ♊ in the fourth, in ☍ to the ☽, and the ☉ in the seventh in □ to them both, and ♂ Lord of his Radical Horoscope in ♂ with ♀ in the eighth House. Aged 12 years, his Subjects rebelled, and he had a malignant Feaver; the ☉ (who is Aphaeta) was at that time directed to the body of ☿, and he in the Radix in □ to ♂. Aged 14 years, he entered upon the possession of his King∣dom, he had then the M. C. to the body of the ☉, the Horo∣scope to the ✶ of ☿, the ☽ to the terms of ♃, and ♃ to the ✶ of the ☉, and ♂ to the △ of the ☉. Aged 16 years, he was Crowned at Rhemes, he had then the Sun directed to the eleventh House, and the ♁ to the spica ♍. Aged 19 years, he joined with the English, and took many Towns in Flanders, whereof Dunkirk was one; he had now the M. C. to the cauda ♌, the ☉ to the △ of ♄, the ☽ to the cor ♌, and △ of ♂, and the ♁ to the spica ♍ with latitude. Aged 20 years, he advanced in his Conquests; he had now the ☽ to the △ of ♂ with latitude: and under these directi∣ons in the year following he began his Treaty with the Spa∣niard, in which they discoursed about the marriage with the Infanta of Spain to this Prince. Aged near 22 years, he was married to the Infanta of Spain, he had then the Ascendant to the Antiscion of ♄, and the ☉ to the ✶ of ♀ coming up. Aged 23 years, the Dauphin was born; he had then the M. C. to the Cauda ♌, without latitude, and the ☉ to the ✶ of the ☽. Aged 24 or 25, his Ambassadors quarrel with those of Spain, about precedency, and shortly after Crequi quarrels with the Pope; he had now the M. C. to the body of ☿ in □ to ♂, the ☽ to the ✶ of ♃, and the ♁ to the ✶ of ♂.
Aged 27 years, his Mother died, and he made War with England, by which War I think he got nothing but blows; he had now his M. C. to the □ of ♂. Aged 33 and 34 years, he advanced an Army against Flan∣ders and Germany, and had wondrous success, as every one knows; he had now the ☽ to the body of the ☉, the M. C. to the ✶ of ♀ and the ☽, and to the ♁, the Horoscope to the second House, and a series of good directions to succeed; as you may see in the Table. About 35 years of age, the Emperour opposed him; the ♁ to the □ of ♀ was now in force. Aged 36 years, his Army marched as far as Hidelburg, Tureen was slain, and himself had a Frenzy; he had now the Ascendant to the cor ♏ C. L. the M. C. to the contra anti of ☿, the ☽ to the cauda ♌, and the ♁ to the □ of the ☽, and ♂ to the ☍ of the ☽. Aged 37 years, he had Fits of the Falling-Sickness, that is in the 38th Current; he had no Direction, but in his Revolu∣tion for that year ♂ was in ☍ to the ☽ from ♍ and ♓, and ♄ in direct ☍ to the degree of his Radical Horoscope, and ♃ in □ to the ☉. Aged 38, that is in 1677. and the beginning of 1678. he took Friburg and Gaunt, and made a great noise; he had then his ☉ directed to the spica ♍, with latitude. Aged 40 years and about 40 days, he had the Ascendant di∣rected to the □ of the ☉ in ♐, that is about October 1678, since which time his Fortunes have been something clouded, and the Duke of Brandenburg hath given his Forces one or two re∣markable Defeats of late.

A short general Judgment upon this Nativity. The first House. AT the Birth of this great and victorious Prince, the second Decanale of ♏ ascends the Horoscope, and ♂ Lord there∣of in ♐ in □ to ☿ in ♍: and ♃, who is in Reception with ♂ Lord of the Horoscope, is in □ to the ☽, and ♀ in ♌ a Regal com∣manding Sign; this gives him a great undertaking Spirit, desi∣rous to do great things, as well by Peace as War. ♏ ascends which is cold, and inclining to Melancholly, the Sun is in ♍ an earthy melancholy Sign; and the Moon, who is
a general Significator of the actions of a mans life, is in □ to ♃ and ☍ to ♄; ♂ Lord of the Horoscope is in ♐ a fiery chollerick Sign, in □ to ☿ in ♍ a melancholly Sign: Hence his tempera∣ture is generally Chollerick-Melancholly, Choller being the Pa∣rent of Passion and Patron of Courage, and Melancholly the Author of study, gravity, and discretion. ♏ ascending and ♂ in ♐ gives him something more than a middle stature, fat and fleshy, which is the more increased by the ☽ aspect to ♃, and he being also in so great a Reception with Mars, all his Significators strong, and in active parts of Heaven, gives a strong able body, not easily tired, especially in the hardship of War.
Of the Qualities of the Mind. BY the Qualities of the Mind I mean the effluviums of the sensitive Appetite and rational Soul, from the first of which are produced those two natural Principles of Lust and Anger, Love and Hate, and all other sensible Effects of the sensitive Appetite, to which is joined the Rational Soul, the very ipsa hominis forma Informans, by which we are distinguish∣ed from bruits, and is thought by some to have an intrinsick Plastick virtue to nourish the Embrio in the Womb. From this rational Soul proceeds two Properties; first the Intellect, which is the eye of the soul, and hath the senses for its Organs, according to the old Adage, nihil intellectu quod non prius fuit in sensu: but it differs from the senses in this; the sense is employed about materials and singulars, the other about im∣materials and universals; all the species of things it reserves to it self, and that is called memory, whose twin-brother is judgment, which is either speculative or practical: the first con∣siders things as they are things, the other as they are good or evil. Secondly, the Will, which is neither meerly passive nor meerly active, but is agitated either by Object or Thought; and it hath also a kind of a blind power, for it desires nothing un∣less it be proposed to it by the Intellect; hence that saying; Ignoti nulla cupido. The Operations and Essluviums of this sensi∣tive and rational Soul, with its Faculties and Properties, is call∣ed in English the Mind, and is a perfect Comprisal of the whole Man, or rather the thesaurus animae, collecting beams and rays from all parts of the sense and soul, and doth either improve them by Vertue, or mis-improve them by Vice, according to the Position of the Luminaries with the benefick or malesick Stars in the Radix or Nativity, and is our next business to con∣sider. Mercury in ♍ in □ to ♂ gives him a sharp piercing understand∣ing, yet something rash sometimes in his undertakings; it in∣clines
him to all manner of practical ingenuity and politick de∣signs, especially in War: the Sun casting a ✶ to his Horoscope, makes him perform all his Actions with Greatness and Princely Glory, sutable to the Qualities of his Birth; the ☽ in Conjun∣ction with ♀, and the ☉ within orbs of the ✶ of ♃, affords him divers admirable Qualifications, and so lofty a spirit, that he scorns to trample upon a Conquered Enemy. Of the Giver of Life. THE Sun must be admitted Giver of Life in this Nativity, as being in the only Aphetical place proper to him, the Birth being Diurnal, and Mercury by the same Rule must be the Alchocodon, or Giver of Years, which in this Nativity and Natives life will be about forty eight: though he will live lon∣ger, as you may read hereafter. The second House. JƲpiter Lord of the second, in so forcible a Reception with Mars in the second, is able of it self to give the Native a most admirable Fortune; but besides this, he hath the  in Conjunction with ♀, and both casting their ✶ to the part of Fortune, and the Sun in the tenth in ✶ to ♃, all which are great Arguments of advancement in Riches; and as Mars the Lord of the Ascendant is in the second, so it shews the Native shall procure it by his own endeavour; yet as the Moon is in ☍ to ♄ and □ of ♃, and Saturn also in square to ♃, and ☿ in □ to ♂ in the second, so he will have at some times occasion to be sensible of the want of Money, though his Birth hath provided him security from the long continuance of such a want. Of the third House. SAturn in the third House, and Lord of the same also, shews the Native hath not many Brethren and Sisters, however
Saturn may shew a Brother or two, he being strong there in ♒ a Masculine Sign, and he a Masculine Planet; but for Sisters I can∣not judge any. Of the Fourth House. SAturn, Lord of the Fourth House, must be the signification of the Natives Fathers, who being in □ to ♃ and ☍ to the ☽ and ♀, shews the troubles that he under-went both publick and private, in Body and Mind, so long before he dyed, which was in April, 1643. Saturn in □ to ♃ from fixed signs, may very well denote long Chronical Diseases, and the ☍ of ♀ Lady of the Eighth from the Fourth, shews the expiration thereby; the truth is, he dyed after he had lingred five years under those mis∣fortunes, according to this distance of Saturn from the ☍ to the Moon and Venus. Of the Fifth House. THis House takes notice of the Native; Children in Mar∣riage; and they are personated by Aries upon the Fifth, and Mars Lord thereof in ♐ in Reception with Jupiter in ♏, a fruitful sign, which shews the possibility of his having Children; yet because Venus, the Lady of the Eleventh, the Fifth from the Seventh, and the Moon are in Leo, a barren Sign, and both in square to Jupiter, and opposition to Saturn, so it shews him to have but few, and of those some shall dye also, because Mars, Lord of the fifth, is in □ to ☿ Lord of the fourth from the fifth, and Venus, Lady of the fifth from the seventh, is in ☍ to Saturn. The Judgment belonging to the Sixth house. MArs Lord of the sixth House, in ♐ a fiery sign in square to Mercury, who is strong in ♍, seems to threaten him with hot Chollerick Distempers, which tend to a Phrensie, a Delirium, or depravation of sense: but these Diseases will be of
no long continuance, because Mars and Mercury are both in com∣mon Signs, and in good Houses of Heaven: But what Diseases come from the Moon and Saturn will be durable and hard to be cured, and such are the Stone, Gravel in the Kidneys, crude Humours, and perhaps the Gout; and these will happen under bad Directions, and bad Revolutions, &c. But Mars Lord of the Ascendant strong, and the Ascendant it self free from all ma∣lignant Rays, will give him a strong vigorous body, by which means he will baffle Diseases by strength, exercise and courage, until age and ill Directions impair Nature, which will happen before he expires, and not long neither, according to Bonal. 755. at si planeta qui habet significare Infirmitates fuerit occidenta∣lis, erunt in ultima medietate vitae ejus, that if the Planet which signifies Diseases were Occidental, they shall happen in the last part of his life. The Judgment belonging to the Seventh House. WHen I considered Venus Lady of the seventh in Con∣junction with the Moon in Leo, a barren Sign, in ☍ to ♄ who always forbids Marriage, and ☿ in ♍ a barren Sign in □ to ♂ Lord of the Ascendant, I did wonder that this Native should marry so soon, and with so little diffi∣culty as he did: yet when I observed Jupiter in a fruitful Sign, in reception with Mars Lord of the Horoscope, and in Aspect with the Moon and ♀ although a square, it was a rational ar∣gument for the soon performance of this matter; and the Moon also who hath Dignities in the seventh is in Conjunction with Venus Lady of the same, and a general significator of Marri∣age also; hence this is sufficient to prove that he should marry once, and that early too: according to the falling of those mar∣rying Directions, the truth is, this Native did marry Maria Tiresia d' Austria, the Infanta of Spain, in the year 1660. The Natives Enemies are signified by Venus in Conjunction with the Moon near the praesepe & Aselli, in Opposition of Saturn and □ to Jupiter, and therefore for his publick Enemies a∣broad,
the Opposition of ♄ infatuates them, and possesseth them with many and strange fears, so that they are but like a Lamb in a Lyons skin, having the Name, but not the real Na∣ture of Enemies. Of the Judgment of the Eighth House. I Shall omit to Elect the Lord of death Cabalistically, and endeavour to satisfie my Reader with this, that when the Moon comes to the Body of ☿ and square of Mars, that is a∣bout 1681, or 1682, ut videas, he will be in danger of Poyson and Treachery; but because his Alchocoden doth not so soon expire, I am of the opinion he will live gloriously till the Sun, who is Hilea or Giver of life, comes by direction to the square of Saturn in Libra, at which time he will have many troubles; and that will be when he is fifty years compleat, and two hun∣dred and seventeen days, when it begins to work; and at that time he hath ♄ upon his Radical Horoscope, and Mars upon the Radical place of the Moon, which will be about March and April in the year 1689, and also threaten some danger to his life. That his death will be attended with violence, seems to ap∣pear from Mars in a violent Sign in square to Mercury, Lord of the eighth, and to the Sun also applying; and the Moon accor∣ding to her Longitude is with violent Stars in Opposition to Sa∣turn; and lastly, the Moon and Jupiter in □ square from violent parts of Heaven, and therefore God preserve this great Prince from poyson, falls, or wounds. Of the Ninth House. IT will be needless to take notice of the Religion of this Il∣lustrious Prince, but leave that as an exercise to the in∣ternal actions of Faith.
The Judgment proper to the Tenth House. MArs Lord of the Ascendant in a Regal Sign, in Reception with Jupiter, gives him a Spirit inspired with a desire of Greatness and Glory, to which we may add the ☽ in Conjun∣ction with Venus in a Regal fiery Sign; and ☿ Lord of the tenth partly, in square with Mars, will make him studious about the advancement of his Honour, and stirs up and excites his Intel∣lectuals to contrive and project the same. But above all is the Sun in the tenth, which gives wonderful and durable Honour, Sol in dome decima faelix: magnam potesta∣tem etiam in juventute significat, Origa. de Effec. fol. 699 that the Sun well placed in the tenth House gives great power, especial∣ly in the younger years; to which we may add the Sextile of Ju∣piter to the Sun, and to the Cusp of the MC almost, with the Cor Leonis a Regal fixed Star Culminant, all which are great ar∣guments of honour and splendour, and that this honour will not be momentany and decaying, but durable, even to his lifes end. The Judgment belonging to the Eleventh House. SPica ♍ in the Eleventh and the ♁ also, gives him rich and powerful Friends. Venus Lady of the Eleventh in Leo with the Moon shews them to be honourable active persons, having as great Spirits as himself; yet Venus in Opposition of Saturn, and square to ♃ makes them unable to serve him according to their desires, and that there shall distastes happen, although not designed: and as Mars Lord of the Ascendant is in square to Mercury upon the Cusp of the eleventh, so the Native will be suspicious enough of such Friends.
Judgment belonging to the Twelfth House. THE twelfth House gives Judgment of private Enemies, and Captivity, both which the Native is exempted from by the force of Starry Influence; for Venus Lady of the twelfth House is afflicted by the Opposition of Saturn and Jupiter, and Jupiter in the twelfth is afflicted by them both, so that the Na∣tives private Enemies shall be afraid to trust each other in Con∣federacy, and there is no injury so dangerous as a confederated design is: — yet here the Reader must understand, that this Judgment is meant only in his life, for at his death he is likely to suffer by treachery, and the cruel designs of unjust men: and yet I mention this not evasively, with a reservation, that when∣soever he dies it is fulfilled, but that it will take place only at the time mentioned, that is, at the Age of 42, or 49, or both. Thus we may see the ineffable wisdom of a Deity, in dispo∣sing all into a regular course of Nature, all things agreeing in order to the main design for which they were appointed; and also the great Treasury of nature how it combines and contrives the Transactions of our lives, as to Time, Quality, and Effects, therefore it is not Antichristianism nor Atheism, to own and believe a regular Fate, [for it is indeed  divinitus decre∣tum, so called from  divido, quia suum cuique divisum est,] all things acting and working having respect to their central cause; to which purpose one learnedly saith, Centrum unum om∣nium deus est. And immediately after he tells us, that there are four Circles continually rowling about it, i. e. the Mind, the Soul, nature and matter. Hence you see the Intellectuals give their attendance to that great Being, in order to the per∣formance of their duty in nature; and by how much the more glorious the mind of man is, than his body, so is the mind of Angels more glorious than they, and is indeed the perfect Rays of a Deity; and Marsilius Ficinus, after a long discourse in his Commentary upon Plato de Convivio, speaking of the quali∣fication
of the mind, and how the passions of some are commu∣nicated to some, he makes use of no other cause but starry In∣fluence, when he says, ita ut si nascente aliquo Mars in Vene∣ris domo, Libra vel tauro fuerit; propter Martis praesentiam qui tunc Natus est, acerrimis uritur amoribus, orat. quinta. cap. 8. In the Nativity of any one, if Mars should be in either of the Houses of Venus, i. e. Libra or Taurus, because of Mars his presence, he that is then born will be subject to the torments of Love, which in some Nativities I have taken notice of, especi∣ally when the ☽ is in good Aspect of Venus: and indeed it would not be hard to prove, or yet to believe Saturn, Mars and Venus to be the only Authors of all the Witchcraft in the World; yet not according to the Popular Opinion by fascination, but by a Magnetical Sympathy and Antipathy in the Actives and Pas∣sives of nature: So they are also the cause of depraved minds and vicious Actions, and that with a witness, if ☿ the picture of the Soul is not in good aspect with the Moon and Saturn, by which means Reason gains the Conquest of Lust and Passion — but of this enough—

Some few remarkable Revolutions belong∣ing to this Nativity. AND first, of the Revolution for the Suns return, Anno 1671. to his radical place, under the Influence of which he performed those great Undertakings against Flanders and Germany. This Revolution is as prodigious as the Effects, which were the then actions at that time of this Great Prince, for here the Figure is almost the same with that of the Radix, and all the Planets above the Earth (except Saturn) and he is as strong as any of them, being angular and in Reception with ♀: here
is the Sun gloriously placed in the Tenth House with Mercury in his Dignities, and the Moon and Venus in the Eleventh in Libra, and Mars Lord of the Ascendant in Conjunction with Jupiter near the Cusp of the Tenth House; and it is such a Position as is not commonly seen: I shall forbear to enlarge upon the Effects of this Figure, because the actions are so long past: and therefore let those that understand it draw a Judgment for their own use, I will proceed to the Figure of the Revolution, pro Anno 1678. The Moon in Taurus, her Exaltation in trine to the Sun in the Ascendant, and Mars who hath Dignities in the Fifth, in Sextile to the Sun there, and in Trine to Jupiter Lord of the Seventh, shew great inclination to a pacification, and a gene∣ral
peace; yet ☿ Lord of the Horoscope in ☍ to Jupiter, shews some impediment and hindrance in those Affairs, but in the end it will be perfectly effected: and so I come to the Revolution for the year 1680. This is the Revolution to operate with the Moon to the body of Mercury without Latitude, but the Figure being no ways violent, I shall forbear all further mention hereof; and pro∣ceed to the Revolution for 1681.
This is like to be an unhappy Revolution, to work with so ill a Direction; for here is ♂ Lord of his Radical Horoscope in square to Saturn, and ☿ Lord of this Horoscope is com∣bust, and both in □ to the Moon, and besides Saturn is up∣on the Radical place of the Moon, and Mars upon his Radi∣cal Horoscope in square to him, hence it is like to prove an ill Revolution, but yet not mortal, although he will be in danger this year: And so I come to consider his Revolution for the Fiftieth year of his age, beginning 1688. from Ar∣gol's Ephem.
☉ ad □ ♄ ☽ ad ✶ ♀ MC ad dom. 12. These are the Directions that will influence the Fate of this Revolution, which I am of opinion will not prove fatal, and that for these Reasons: First Saturn is Lord of no malignant House: and secondly, his square falls within the Rays of Jupi∣ter, and he strong: Thirdly, the ☽ is within the good Beams of Venus, that is her ✶ just coming up: Hence I am induced to believe, that Saturn hath not force and ill-will enough to kill at this time. But in the Revolutional Figure I confess that ♂, Lord of the Radical Horoscope, and partly of this, is combust in the
Eighth House; and the Sun, who is Fons Vitae, is also afflicted of Mars in the same House; but the ☽ is in Conjunction with ♃, and hastening to a △ of Venus and the Sun; yet as the Moon is in Conjunction with ♃ in the Twelfth House, and they both weak in a Melancholly Sign, and the Sun, Mars, and Venus are afflicted in the Eighth in ♍ an earthy Sign, so he shall be subject to Melancholly Distempers, passions, and discontents; yet as ♄ the Lord of the Horoscope is in exaltation, he will indubi∣tably survive all; for although the □ of Saturn is a malignant direction, yet according to that Aphorism of Hermes, his ma∣lignity is meliorated by the good Beams of Jupiter, which is able to save, although he were Lord of the Eighth House: ♃ sol∣vit Saturnum, & ♀ solvit Martem, Herm. Apho. 27. And Argol speaking of the Moon in a Revolution, saith, Venus & Jupiter juncti cum Luna corporis sanitatem demonstrant, Pto. Par. fol. 194. Jupiter and Venus joined to the Moon shew health and sound∣ness of body. And that those Planets afflicted in the Eighth House doth rather shew some vexation and trouble to happen to the Native about his Conquest in Flanders, or his Children, or his Wifes Dowry, or perhaps all; and not to touch his life, as some I am sure would judge from such a Position and Dire∣ction: and this is the rather confirmed to me, because ☿ is strong in the Seventh, he the only Planet angular and in Re∣ception with the Sun. But perhaps some may say he hath a bad profectional Figure for this year, he now having ♐ in his Horoscope (and there∣fore the Radical place of ♂) and the Radical place of ☿ cul∣minant, in his Medium Coeli, which I own to be an unhappy Po∣sition, and to carry a sufficient tendency of ill, were there other sequel Causes for the same; but Profections are rather Demon∣strations of the Effects of Directions, than particular Causes of any such things themselves; but I leave those things to those who are more curious. I do think this Native may in a course of Nature live till the Sun, who is Giver of life, comes to the □ of Venus, who is Lady of the seventh House in the Radix and to the square
of the Moon, who hath Dignities in that House also, and at the same time the Ascendant comes to the square of Mercu∣ry, Lord of his Eighth House, and to the body of Mars al∣so, without latitude, as may be seen by the Table of Di∣rections preceeding; and this will happen about the fifty fourth or fifty fifth year of his age. And thus much for this Nativity. Nihil sine fine.
AN APPENDIX. BY way of Appendix I will here add the Nativity of that Illustrious Prince Lewis the Daulphin of France, eldest Son to Lewis the Fourteenth, the present King of France. This Valiant young Prince was born at Fountainblean, No∣vember the first, S. N. but October the twenty second, S. V. Min. 9. P. M. 1661. to which time the right Ascention of the Sun is, Rect. Ascen. ☉ 217 4 Tempor. 2 15 Rect. Ascen. MC. 219 19 ad 90   Ascen. Obli. Ascen. 309 19 The Figure without further Operation is as followeth, to the Latitude of 49 Degrees, the Planets places not being re∣duced, but taken from Vincent Wing without Reduction.
LATITUDO PLANETARUM. ♄ 1 52 N. ♃ 1 6 N. ♂ 1 25 N. ♀ 1 9 So. ☿ 0 32 So. ☽ 3 7 N.
This young Prince having had so few Accidents, that we have not many to prove the Nativity by; and therefore the main ac∣cident that I do principally trust to, is the Horoscope to the square of Jupiter in Capricorn, a place which Jupiter perfectly hates: and about the same time the Sun to the body of Saturn in Scorpio, which Directions may very well suit to the-Accident of 1678, which was a Quartan Ague, at which time the Worship∣ful Sir Robert Talbot, Knight, and Doctor of Physick, was sent for by his Majesty of France to cure him, which he accordingly did immediately after his arrival there: how these Directions suit to the time, you may observe by the following Operations. Ascen. Obli. Ascend. 309 19 Ascen. Obli. □ ♃ 325 45 Directio quaesita. 16 26 Descen. Obli. ☉ 216 1 Descen. Obli. ♂ ♄ CL. 232 54 Arcus directi. 16 53 There have been more Directions in force, but because I can∣not be so happy as to hear of the Accident attending them, I shall forbear their Operations, and give the Reader an account when they happened, that others when they know them may apply them to their proper Causes and Effects; aged about se∣ven years, he had the Sun directed to the body of Mercury, which Direction could not chuse but be dangerous to his life. Aged about 12 or 13, he had his Horoscope to the ☍ of Mars cum Lat. this could give no durable disease, because it was with∣in the Rays of the ✶ of Saturn, and ♄ and ♂ were in △ at his birth, yet it would give some slight Feaver, &c. But when he shall be aged 21 years, his Sun comes by Directi∣on to the square of the Moon in Sagitary; this will be a dan∣gerous Direction, and will give either the small Pox, or a Fea∣ver, or both. Aged near 25, his Horoscope comes to the □ of the Sun in ♒, a place the Sun hates, this is usually a troublesome dange∣rous direction, and doth as well concern the honour as the life of the Native, and his Father.
But seeing Directions work according to the Quality of the persons passive in their Effects, and because I am not sure that this Horoscope is certainly true (although I dare be confident it is not far off from the true one) I will omit all other parti∣culars of this nature, and come to speak to things more ge∣neral. In this Nativity the Sun is Giver of Life, and Mars Giver of Years, from whence we may judge that this Native may live to a considerable age: and as Mars casteth his Trine to Saturn, Lord of the Ascendant, and the Sun casteth his ✶ to the Degree ascending, he may be generally very healthful; to which we may add the △ of the Sun and Moon, Saturn, Lord of his se∣cond, in △ to Mars in the seventh, and the Sun, Lord of the eighth, in Trine to the Moon in the second, and ☿ who hath Dignities in the eighth, is likewise in the tenth House, shew him to advance his Fortune by Marriage, and that he may pro∣bably marry thrice, if not four times, because the Moon, Lady of the seventh, is in ♓, the Dignities of Venus a fruitful Sign, and ♂ in the seventh in ♋, a fruitful Sign, and the Sun and Saturn Lord of the Ascendant in ♏ in the tenth House, the prime angle of the Figure, and a fruitful Sign also. It is generally reported, that this Native is of a very morose nature, which is well signi∣fied by ♂, who hath Dignities in the Horoscope in □ to ♃, the Author of Clemency and good Nature, and the Moon in □ to Saturn, Lord of the Ascendant, may very aptly signifie the same, especially if we consider the fixed Stars that the Sun is with, and ☿ the general significator of the mind is with the like fixed Stars, and combust of the Sun, and in Aspect neither to ♃ nor ♀. That his death will be natural, is visible by the Moons △ to the Sun and ♃, and ♂ his △ to ♄ Lord of the Ascendant, and that he will dye of a Dropsical or a Hypochondriacal Distemper, because ☿ Lord of the sixth and eighth is in Scorpio combust, and Saturn Lord of the Ascendant, and the Moon in watery Signs. The Sun in the tenth shews he will be famous and honourable at sometimes, and that in his own Country too, for his Con∣quests
will not be eminent abroad, although he will have an aspiring undertaking spirit, and aiming at great things. But Saturn in the tenth (although Lord of the Horoscope) in □ to the Moon in the second, will in the latter part of his life give him some unhappy Accident and Catastrophe to his Ho∣nour; and this is confirmed by ♂ Lord of the tenth in the se∣venth, in □ to ♃ in the ninth: why may not the Clergy oppose his honour and greatness, or some Religious War begin again in France, for Venus Lady of the ninth is in Reception with ♃, and he his real Enemy. —Nam dum pejora timentur, Est locus in voto— POSTSCRIPT. WHereas in Page the 20th, line the 14th, there is mention made of 42 or 49, this is to advertise those Readers who do not understand Astrology, that it is exprest there after the method of writing in the Speculum of Directi∣ons, which is in compleat years, so that the Effects of the Moon to the Body of Mercury and square of Mars, will continue in force from the beginning of 1681 to the beginning of 1683. and the other Direction, that is of the Sun to Saturn, is mentioned 49, the Reason is, because it is the compleat number of Degrees between the Significator and the Promittor, but being turned into time, shews it will not appear in Effect before he is fifty years and a half old—but let him get well over the two former Directions, I fear he'll find them dangerous enough. God preserve him from poyson, and the treachery of a near Kinsman of his own Name, in 1682.—This I thought good to ac∣quaint the Reader with, to prevent mistakes and clamours a∣gainst the Author.
