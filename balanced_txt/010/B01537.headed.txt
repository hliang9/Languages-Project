Unto His Majesties High Commissioner, and the Right Honourable Estates of Parliament. THE PETITION OF JAMES BAYNE His Majesties Late Mr. Wright. Humbly Sheweth, THAT when King Charles the second of Blessed Memory Resolved to build a Palace in this his Ancient Kingdom, for the better reception of Himself and Successors, when ever they should Honour the Nation with their presence. His Majestie gave Commission to your Petitioner to be Master Wright, which office he discharged with great Fidelitie; And having at the time of Building the Palace at Holyrood-house, and reparations of the Ca∣stles of Edinburgh, Stirling, & Bass an opulent Fortune of about 50000 Pounds Scots worth of timber in the Buss of Leith, as is well known to many of this Citie, and could be made appear by Irrefrageble instructions, such was his zeal for the publict, & earnest desire to carry on these works which were to the Honour and security of the Kingdom, that when there was not Money in the Theasurie to buy matterials necessary; He furnished all things so far as that his Stock could reach. And more∣over, he raised Money owing him be some Noble Persons, and Others, Viz: from the Marquess of Tweddal, his Majesties Commissioner, 7000 pounds, from the Earl of Panmure 12000 pounds, and from the Earl of Strathmore 4000 pounds, and from the Neighbours in Edinburgh, ten thousand pounds, in all 33000 pounds, which was raised in the year 1675, and the Annualrent thereof since that time, would more then double the Summ, and even after that all was exhausted, he ingadged his Credit, and ceased not to furnish what was needful, till that the Palace was compleated; But by these means he not only spent his own Fortune, but stands considerably in debt to others, he being never as yet reimbursed by his Majestie of the summs given out by him, and his case and condition being represented to the late King James, his Majestie was Graciously pleased to Recommend to the Lords of Theasurie to consider your Petitioners claim and accompts; And the Marquess of Tweddal, now his Majesties High Commissioner, the Lord Balcarras, and General Drummond being appointed by the Theasurie to visit his compts, their Lordships at that time adjusted for upwards of two thousand pound Sterling by subscribed compts, besides two thousand and five hundred pounds more of Money foresaid, which these noble persons did not then fully consider; And report of this being made to to the Lords of the Theasurie, they granted your Petitioner a preceipt for five hundred pounds Sterling: But the Revolution and change in Government hap∣pening shortly thereafter, he got no payment thereof, as the precept herewith produced does evidence, so that there is yet more nor four thousand five hun∣dred pound Sterling owing be the publict to him, besides the Annualrent thereof; By which he is reduced to most miserable straits, a most sad and lamentable condition, and more deploreable than he can express, and which can hardly be conceived by any but by him who feels its said pressure: For now some of his Creditors are in possession of his Lands within this City, yielding about eight hundred pound Scots yearly: And others having personal diligence against
him, have frequently incarserate and imprisoned him, & being liberate only upon his friends, being Caution to present him again to Prison when required, he is still in danger of being apprehended by Messingers at the instance or other Creditors; By all which he is not only put out of all Trade and imployment, and has nothing wherewith to maintain himself and prevent Starving, nor can he any wayes satisfie his Just Debts and relieve his Friends, which is no little Trou∣ble to an Honest and ingenuous Spirit; Especially considering, That your pe∣titioner is owing much, amongst others, to Widdows and Orphans, who In∣trusted him with their whole Stock, and are thereby now reduced to Beggary; And since all this Miserie is come upon him by his Zeal for advancing Works to the Honour and Safetie of the Nation, and by his being obliedged to pay Annualrent for 27500 pound Scots, which he contracted by carrying on these puBlick Works as is evident by a general Suspension herewith produced, which he obtained against his Creditors, and to which no regard is had, and by his lying out of more then 4500 pound Starling and Annualrents thereof owing him be the Publict, of which the Lords of Theasurie are most sensible, and after frequent Supplications declare their willingness to do your petitioner Justice, but alleadge they have not a Fond for satisfying him. IT is therefore humbly Craved, That Your Grace, and Honourable Estates of Parliament, would take Your Petitioners sad Case, and Circumstances to your serious Consideration, And in regard to Justice & Honour of the Nation, Ordain some Fond for paying your Petitioner the 2000 pound Starling and more already ad∣justed, the Compts whereof are Subscrived, and the 2500 pound Money foresaid justly Resting, tho not yet fully Adjusted, Together with the Annualrent of both the Summs, since the time they became due; and if all cannot be shortly payed, that in the mean time he may have some Money advanced for his pre∣sent miantainace, and the Lords of Session be authorized to grant him Suspension against his Riged Creditors upon his giving assignation to what is owing by the Publict to him for their more ready payment, That so your Petitioner may have wherewith to pay his just Debts, And what is more nor satisfies his Cre∣ditors, he may have it to maintain him in his Old Age, That no Trades-man hereafter may be discouradged to advance publict Works, when they shall see and hear how the Honourable Court of Parlament concern themselves to see the Publicts just Debts Satisfied and Payed. And Your Petitioner shall ever Pray, &c.
