The Relation of HANNAH BECKWITH, Touching the exercise of her dear S before and in the time of her sickness▪ And th ord, delivered by her a little before her Death  as could be well remembred; With a Teony concerning her. I Being very often with my ever dear and wellbeloved Sist, i th me of her sick∣ness, and being truly sensiable of the won∣derfull dealings of the Lord with her, and of his unspeakable Love to her, in her great exer∣cise to her great comfort; I called to mind, yea, it came fresh into my remembrance, what a ten∣der frame of spirit she had been off, even from her Child-hood, which I saw the Lord had not forgot, but had that regard unto it, as to reward the same into her bosom manyfold, and I can∣not forbear in the first place, in short, to make mention thereof, in order to what I have to say oncerning her exercise in the time of her sick∣ness, before the Tabernacle was laid down. She was endued with an understanding from her child-hood, and in the years of her Youth beyond the most of her equals of her age: So∣ber and Grave in her deportment nor adicted o light and needless words nor such commu∣nication as corrupts good manners, but most appeared amongst us her Sisters, and the rest of the Family, as one who had set a watch
before her Spirit, that she might not offend the Lord, nor be of evill example amongst Us; s was pittifull, and therein courtious and kind to all that stood in need, she was tenderly obe¦dient to her Parents, and affectionate kind to us her Sisters, and in the latter years of her Age▪ she was given much to a retiredness, and though carefull in the things of this World; yet as one that used the world as not using it: And as o sincerely devoted to serve the Lord, and the Kingdom which hath no end, and the righte∣ousness thereof: Not doubting but (as the Lor saw meet) other thin would be added, she w observed often in the evening when her wor was much over, to walk into the Fields, and a her return often appeared to have had a tende exercise upon her spirit in brokenness, and whe her sickness and weakness of body begun to gro upon her, and her exercise before the Lord as to another world, did inlarge in her, she got little rest or sleep, for many nights together, yet he understanding was kept cleer, and her memory sound, which she often said was a great mercy to her, and praised God for it. And on the 19th. day of the 9th. Month, 1691 She being sorly troubled with shortness of breat we did not expect according to outward ap¦pearance, she should have lived over that nigh and she also told us, she questioned whether  might live till morning or no; But in pleas
the Lord to give her some ease, and she being in Bed, desired us to raise her up, and so we having done so she began to speak of the dealings of the Lord with her, and of the many temptations that the wicked one laboured to ensnare withall, of which she said she had been sensible: She desir∣ed us that were young in yeares to prize our time, not knowing how few days we had to live; for said she, I did not think my time had been so near an end: Said again many were the temptations of the enemy, and more especially o Youth, by presenting length of days, and perswading them that its soon enough for them to trouble themselves with such a concerne, or said she, so would he have perswaded me, and many wayes was I so tempted by him, which caused my exercise to be such, as I was nearly brought to dispaire, And then said she, I sought the Lord night and day, when no Eye saw, no Eares heard, but the Lord alone, who heard my call, and caused a cry to run through me, that he had good will for me, and the Lord after gave me some comfortable assurance of my salvation: But the enemy hath been very bu∣sie, saith she, and hath surely huried me since I begun with this illness; She said it was hard to live in this World and not sin against the Lord, and said also, if it might be well with her, it were better for her to dye then to live: And with great erveney of Spirit she besought the
Lord to spare her, saying, Lord add one other day to me that I may seek thee, and that I ma feel thee, and O Lord, give me full assurance of my salvation before I depart hence: Many times saying, O Lord, let not my distempou overcome my sence till I come to a full Injoy∣ment of thee, and O Lord, I pray thee let not my desires cease, till thou answer the desires o my heart, and let nothing quench my thirst, but thy love: And so she continued in suplica∣tion to the Lord for a considerable time: And the Lord was pleased to answer her desires to the glading of her heart, and causeing her Cup to overflow: So that living praises, and Heavenly melodious sounds run through her to the God of her salvation; and so she continued in a swee and heavenly frame, many times saying, O tha I had breath to praise the Lord, O that I ha breath to praise his Name; and at many time she gave good and tender advice to Us, her Sisters desireing us to love and fear the Lord a∣bove all, and to keep in the Truth; saying, O press after it, to feel the working of it in your own hearts; And when you are in it, keep in it, and under the government of it, and heed not to deck your selves, but be meet and low, saying, None ought to pride them¦selves in any Induements, neither in Beauty not in any oher thing, because it was not their but the Lords, who gave it them, and can tak
it away when he pleaseth, saying, what is all now to me; tenderly advising us not to let any thing in this World steal away our mindes. She also spake of the state of many, and said, there are many that were grown careless, and was gotten into liberty, and such were ill ex∣amples to those that were coming up; and said there are many that comes to Meetings, and professes the Truth, that knows but little what Truth is; and said also, it did not consist only in comeing to Meetings, and wearing plain ap∣parell and the like, unless they came to feel the workings of truth in their own hearts, for said she, all such outward appearances will stand in no stead, without the love of God be inwardly felt, and enjoyed; for said she, it is an easie thing to come to Meetings, and some are ready to think that doing so, and behaveing themselves soberly before this or the other person is suffici∣ent: But said she, the Lord sees at all times, and he will have no such mockery; but said she, I bless God, I have not been guilty of seeming what I was not: But O how did her love run forth to those who were faithfull, saying they were near and dear to her, and much desired the company of such as feared the Lord, and loved the Truth, and walked therein: She wonderfully praised the love and mercies of the Lord to her; saying, it is not for my deserts, for I had nothing to ingage the Lord with, but
it is his free love to me: She often desired the Lord to give her a little ease, that she might have a more full enjoyment of him, and indeed she was so much born up over her weakness, that at many times she felt little or no pain that we could diserne, but with a mid and cheareful countinance, would say, I am well every way but for want of breath; and the Lord can raise me up if he see it good forme, and if not, I am content, I do believe which way so ever it be, it will be for my good. And she speaking of the way of truth, said it was a straight and narrow way, and not to be kept in, without a daily watch, (and said it is this days bread and not that which was fed of yesterday that will satisfie) for there are many by paths, but as Job saith; said she. There is a path which no fool knoweth, which the olterous eye hath not seen, the Lyons whelp hath not troden it, nor the fierce Lyon passed by it. But said she, although a strait way, yet it is a pleasant path, and delightsome: Oh said the here is peace in abundance, it is so sweet I could delight always to enjoy it, and to live therein, the Gold of Opher is not worthy to be compared to it; And thus continued she in a sweet frame of Spirit, her mind being wholy taken up with heavenly thoughts, saying Lord give me fully to drink of the well of water, that is within the Gate, for thou hast ravish'd my heart, and I am overcome with thy love. Oh
I long, I long; O Lord open thou the windows of heaven, and power in of thy blessings into my soul, untill there be not room enough to re∣ceive, that I may bless and praise thy name and that I may ever swim in the Ocion and streams of thy love and living praise to the Lord, with mellodious sounds aboundantly sprung from her, She did also often advise those that were with her to keep out of passion, saying, Oh have a care of passion, it hinders the prosperity of the work of God, and there is no extream in the Truth, ah it is of a meek and an heavenly quality; That afternoon before she dyed she desired the Lord to spare her another half day if it was his will, that she might enjoy him, and that she might praise him, and said I have known Christ to be my leader, and my teacher shall be no more removed into a corner, for mine eyes have seen my teacher, and mine eares hath heard a voice saving, this is the way walk in it she after desired the Lord to give her an easie passage, and that night she desired that none but Friends might sit up with her, her love be∣ing abundantly large to them. And some of us going to bed, haveing wanted our rest she ten∣derly took her leave of us, and said if she were worse, some should call, and takeing me by the hand said, dear Sister thou hast been near and dear to me and carefull of me the Lord requite thee; and be near to thee when thou comes to
lye on thy dying bed, and so near the Morning her distemper growing upon her she said I am as sensiable as any of you and I am well content to dye saying I have no doubt of my Salvation forever, I am going to dear Robert Lodge, with many more sweet expressions, which could not well be remembred, nor perfectly heard, her voice being very low, she was very sensiable to the last so far as we could observe and spoke to within a very little time wherein she drew her last breath, saying Lord take me away, Lord take me away, and presently after she quietly and comfortably passed away, out of this world, to live for ever in the World which hath no end. She was a dear Sister to me a faithfull com∣fortable companion, and help in the Lord and hard it was to me freely to part with her, if it, had been the Lords will that we might a little longer have enjoy'd each other in the body, to have been each others help, and cause of joy, but being so fully satisfied that the love and blessings of the Lord was upon her I was more willing to give her up to him who gives and takes away and can do no less but bless and praised  his holy name and return all glory and honour to him, who is everlastingly wor∣thy, blessed for ever and for evermore. And it is the servent desire of my heart that we who are left behind may so live to God and
walk in the ever blessed Truth which she testi∣fied to, to her latter end, that we may be made partakers of that rest peace and joy. Which undoubtedly she is already entered into. Hannah Beckwith. Written the 11. of the 10th. Month, 169. A Few words in Testimony concerning the Life and Death of Sarah Beckwith, Daughter of Mar∣maduke and Elizabeth Beckwith, &c. Who Departed this Life the 24th. 9th. Month, 1691. SHe was of my familiar acquaintance from a Child for I lived divers years during her Child-hood in her fathers house, she was born of beliveing parents, and under their eye and care educated in the way and profession of truth, which God Almighty in blessing doth regard: and I am well satisfied that in her own soul she was a real lover of truth from a Child, for she was diligent in comeing to Meetings, and when there very retir'd in her mind, not making a shew above what she realy was, but even as Mary did hid up things in her heart, on the Eight day of the above said Month she wa visited with the Sickness, she dyed of: in the time whereof she severall times sent for me, and the first tme I went, she said to me, Grace I am glad to see thee, thou hast been often near to me in
remembrance and love, & being in a sweet and tender frame of spirit, began to devulge her se∣crets to me, signifying that for about three quar∣ters of a year last, she had sought the Lord with her heart, both night and day, and perticularized divers times and places, wherein the Lord had very comfortably broken in upon her, and filled her heart with his love, that deeply ingaged her to praise his Name; and I being sent for the night hefore she dyed, she said, Lord give me breath to praise thy Name withall: And sever∣all Friends being about her, she said, Lord com∣fort us together this Night, and blessed be his Name, he graciously answered the desires of her soul, and made us partakers of his unspeakable kindness together, to the overcoming of us, the remembrance of which visitation, hath been often refreshing to me, even as marrow to my bones: For the Lord broke in upon her and a stream from the living fountain, Issued forth unto her, and comfortably we were made par∣takers with her of the water of Life, and the liveing food which nourisheth the soul up in God to eternal life: And many were the whol∣some expressions of advice which she gave to us all; And then turned her a side to me, and said you give me no councel, whereunto I answered, dear Sarah, thou wants not a Counceller, we are willing to hear and receive councel from thee, She answered and said it is written your eyes
shall see you Teacher, and your eares shall hear a voice, saying, this is the way walke in it: And she further added, it is a pleasant way, and after divers other comfortable expressions, which came from her, she signifying to us that she had full assu∣rance of the salvation of her soul: Her three Sis∣ters being before her, she advised them to seek the Lord, while he was to be found, and said he was found of them that sought, him and I am well satis∣fyed she spake what she, knew, and bare testimo∣ny what she witnessed: Blessed be the Lord for ever, who gave her the knowledge of himself in the face of Jesus Christ, and out of the mouth of a Babe did she shew his praise, even him whom the World knows not, nor can they praise his Name and such was the sweet and heavenly frame, that she was that night exercised in; That I was made to say in my soul, better is the day of Death to those who dye in the Lord and layeth down their heads in peace with him, then the day of their birth; and very near her departure out of this World, she said I am going to dear Robert Lodge, and you must follow, (and rest with us that loves the Lord and his heavenly appearance) and she growing very weak in body, yet strong in the Lord, being filled with love and spirituall bless∣ings, yet her Voice low, and some few of her last words could not be understood, quietly like a Lamb without spot, she departed this Life, the day and year above written.
And the 29th. of the same Month, as I was sitting in our own house at my employment an unspeakable weight fell upon my spirit, and remained with me a considerable time which occasioned a cry to run through me: Lord what is the matter, and immediatly these words run through my life, Although Sarah Beckwith be dead, yet her Memoriall shall live, and be ser∣viceable to this generation, and to generations, that are yet to come. And so to the God of all our mercies who filled the soule of this Inno∣cent, tender stripling, Abrahams Daughter, with his heavenly appearances, and devine blessings be everlasting praise and glory for ever. Grace Bins, COncerning my dear Companion Sarah Beckwith, this testimony I have to bear, I having had the knowledge of her for many years and being much with her in the time of her sickness, and also present when she departed this life and being an eye and eare witness of the love and great goodness of the Lord liveingly testified of to us from her own mouth upon her dying bed according to the dispensation of the grace of god given me I am bold to say, that she dye not as fool dyeth, that fear not the Lord, for her heart was set to serve and fear him, and
it was her earnest desire, and advice to those that were Young in years to prise their time and to seek the way of the Lord, for she gave testimony of it, to be a pleasant way; And said she was come to witness it so to be, and my desire is that we that are yet in this Tabernacle, may from a grounded experience, be brought to testi∣fy the same, and this is my beleife concerning her that she is entered into everlasting rest: Oh the heavenly expressions Which came from her in the time of her sickness, and the weakness she was under, which I hope never will be forgotten by us, but remaine within us, in our remember∣ance; She begged of the Lord that he would add to her time in this World, untill she had a full assurance of her salvation, which he did gracious∣ly answer, for she signified to us that she did not doubt of it, and she desired the Lord with much fervency of Spirit that he would give her breath to praise his Name; And the Lord heard, and answered from his Holy place, for he did not only give her breath, but a Mouth also to praise him, Oh! the Heavenly power that she was filled with and carried on in that devine and sweet refresh∣ing frame of spirit, that it was of unspeakable comfort and refreshment to the standers by, and great satisfaction to those she was outwardly relat∣ed to and near, and dear unto them every way, she was from a Child Zealously affected with the truth and the society of Gods faithfull people, and
her heart was Inclined after he best things, and she with Mary Chose the better part which shall never be taken from her and the Lord filled her with his power, and opened her mouth in Wis∣dome to speak of the Mstry; of the knowledge of the devine and best things, to the tendering of our hearts and to our refreshment, he being my In∣timate companion haveing had much society wit her I have known her often bowed down with many more for the loss of dear Robert Lodge, being a nea Neighbour to her and often in Company with him I have seen her broken into tears in Remem∣brance of him. And when she lay upon her dying bed she much desired the Company of friends, but more especially those, that were come to wit∣ness in a larger measure, the dealings of the Lord with them, both in judgment and mercy, it wa great satisfaction and comfort to her to have those with her, she breathed to the Lord for our sakes that were young in years, that we might be pre∣served, in the righteous path of holyness: I was truely glad that it was my lot to be with her and I do prise it as a mercy to me Which I desire while I live I may not forget but answer the kind∣ness of God to me therein, as that which may do me good. I am fully satisfied, that she hath laid down her head in peace with God, and is gone to her desired Haven of rest for ever, where there is joy that hath no end. And my hearts desire is, that we that are young in years, may prise o
time in this World d may be preserved om the evill thereof. That we may fear the Lord while we live, and so run our race, that at the closure of our days, we may lay down our heads in peace, when time in this world unto us shall be no more. Katherine Savill. I Hearing that my dearly beloved Freind Sarah Beckwith, My familiar and of great ac∣quaintance we being both of one and the same Meeting, became greatly exercised with sickness, It was much upon me to go visit to her, though one of the least of the flock of God I looked on my self to be: yet I haveing certain knowledge and sence upon my spirit; that Innocent Lamb (though as but a Child in years) had an unspeak∣able love to the truth, and breathings in her soul for the prosperity of it I could not be satisfied till I gave up my self to go In the love of God which I felt abounding in me towards her; And when I came near the place I can truely say, that the free and opened springs of life, did abundantly flow forth upon me, and when I came into the room where she was, I found her very Weake as to the outward, yet strong In the Lord as to the Inner man and in an heavenly frame of spirit to my great refreshment, I saw it was the great
desire of her heart to have friends to Truth in company with her, and in the time of my being there she was so raised up by the power of the Lord to bear testimony to the truth, in the au∣thority and life thereof that we that were with her did believe that sometimes she felt no sickness o pan upon her, and as (I with other Friends,) was standing by her at the bed side: the power of the Lord Sprung up in her and she opened he mouth and said, O prise the truth, O prise the truth, long for it, O long for it, and when you have received it, hold it fast let it not go. And she desired friends, especially those that were young to prise their time, and to keep in their minds to God, and value truth above all, and the eternall divine power that did accompany her when she delivered those words did so tender and break my heart, that I went out of the room a little to ease my spirit, and when I came in again I found her in the same frame of spirit mention∣ing our dear deceased Friend Robert Lodge, and in the like heavenly exercise she continued in a sound understanding, so farr as we could appre∣hend even unto the very last moment of her time in this world: and I am fully satisfied, that to imself God almighty hath taken her soul, to live and abide wih him world without end: and I fully believe that through Gods help, that Re∣membrance of her and the sweet expressions de∣vered by her, in the power of the Lord will re∣main
with me, for my advantage in the Lord, while I have a day to live that glory may be g ven to the great God, who is worthy for ever and for evermore. Alice Edge. Katherine Winns, Testimony concerning Sarah Beckwith, With a few words of advice to young Friends. THe dealings of the Lord, are Worthy to be kept in remembrance, and his tender mer∣cies, and loving kindness to his servants and hand-maids, in this our day and age to be left upon record, to future ages: In which I am concern∣ed according to my measure, In this my testi∣mony, touching a young Maid Sarah Beckwith, I being an eye and eare witness, with severall o∣thers of the exercises she was under and of the testimony she bore, through the marvellous and and heavenly power of the Lord upon her dying bed, oh the sweet, expressions that came from her, and the heavenly acknowledgements of the great love of God unto her, which was great com∣fort and sweet refreshment to those that were a∣bout her liveing praises to our God for ever, who is thus pleased to condescend to the weak capa∣citys of his handmaids and graciously  appear out
of the mouths of babes and sucklings to perfect his praise. I cannot well go by the giveing a little hint of her behaviour from her Child-hood, so far as it comes within the compass of my know∣ledge for I knew her well the having been tabled with me, she was a Child of a sound and solid witt, yet very quick, active and nimble about the year 1680 she being near Eleaven years of age, I was taken prisoner for the truth and she removed to her fathers house but shortly after she desired to see me, and to stay some time with me, though she thought I had been keept in a dark hole with∣out light, yet that did not discourage her & accor∣dingly she came to me of, which I was exceeding glad, and truely comforted for there was no woman in the Goal, but me and she became as my fellow prisoner, and companion, I took great notice and could not but admire that our close confinement did not trouble her and often since have had it in my mind considering her activity, that she should so willingly leave her companions yea her fathers house (where satisfaction as to the outward every way might have been fully offered and given her) and to take her self to such a solitary way of live∣ing with me in that Goal, which she did with chearfulness during the time of her fathers plea∣sure and hath often said since that she thought she could willingly have lived with us all her days, and after it pleased the Lord to visit her with very great weakness, through all wich he wound∣erfully
preserved her memory, though her aflicti∣on was great, and in his own good time wound∣erfully raised her up again, contrary to the ex∣pectation of most, and as she grew in strength, she grew in the inward knowledge of the dealings of the Lord, with her, as to her inner man and in in∣ward feeling of his tender mercys to her & loveing kindness which constrained her sometimes in secret and alone to sound forth liveing praises to him, when she thought no eye saw her nor eare heard her but the Lord: she was very deligent in comeing to meetings and very watchful I was she in the time thereof, I knew not that ever I saw a droosy or a carelesse mind appear in her and if at any time in any thing, she had exceeded the solide truth, it was her Heavenly Fathers pleasure to follow her with gentle chastise ment, in token of his love to her, for it is certain that whom he loves he chas∣tens, and this brought a true fear upon her and sorrow appeared in her, for offending the Lord, though she thought, that none had perceived it, yet it was clearly observed by her Mother and in bow∣edness of spirit she continued, before the Lord, till is was his pleasure to remitt, and bring her into fa∣vour with him again, where was the centure of her soul and the safe dwelling place. And in the year 1691. being near 21. years old she was again visi∣ted with a distemper of sickness very like to remove her out of this world & as it grew upon her, her Zeal for the Lord encreased, manifested largely by the
many sweet & heavenly expressions that proceed∣ed from her, some of which put  upon Record by her dear Sister, I heard she desired to see me, and I went to visit her, and stayed with her Four days, she being unwilling that I should leave her whilest she lived here, in which time she opened her minde to me, and gave me account of the Lords dealings with her, and of his tender Mer∣cyes to her, of which I was right glad, and com∣forted therewith; Her love was wonderfully drawn forth to Friends, often makeing mention of dear Robert Lodge, and others, who are in the body whom she greatly desired to see, and ma∣ny weighty truths proceeded from her, and an Heavenly concerne was upon her, for the good of all friends in generall bemoaning the states of those who had received the truth in the begining in the fresh love of it, and were grown careless having lost their first love, and taken liberty to act things contrary to truth, and those are evill examples, (said she) to those that are young. And others there are who have a more outward ap∣pearance, and reckons themselves esteemed of yet if they live not in the truth and in the in∣joyment of the love of God, it makes no matter the esteem of others will stand them in no stead. And she said there was mans righteousness, and the righteousness of God, but mans righteousness must be rent oft; and man covered with the righteousness of Christ Jesus, who saith I, wis∣dom
leads in the way of righteousness, and in the midst of the path of Judgment, teaching those that loves me to inherit the substance, and she desired that none might in the sight of good things sit down, short of the possession thereof, she greatly desired that ancient Friends might remember the visitation of the love of God un∣to their soules, in the dayes of their Youth, and answer the end of their visitation, and take heed that they feel his love to them as in the begin∣ing; And said she, some comes amongst Friends and profess Truth, yet walke not answereable there unto, but mindes the decking of themselves outwardly, more then the innocency of Truth inwardly, and this will not serve them, or do them any good, and others may get plain ap∣parrel, and come to Meetings, and appear what they are not, the Lord (said she) remove such Mockerys: She often desired Friends to love the truth, and to take heed, of loving any thing above the truth, and she often desired Friends to take heed of passion, for that hinders the work of the Lord, and to take heed of contention and and strife, envy, and wrath, for said she, that never works the righteousness of God, but agra∣vates and stirs up a wrong mind; But in a meek quiet and gentle spirit speake one unto another: and so you will overcome evill, even with the good: Much good councel and wholesome ad∣vice was given by her, but little is remembred
in comparison, considering how much did pro∣ceed from her, and said she; Oh they are happy that feareth the Lord, and obeyeth him, and lives in his truth, and she often expressed the pre∣tiousness of the love of God; And often said, how sweet it is, there is no thing to be compa∣red with it, nor had in esteem in comparison of it; I could delight always to feel, and to live in the Enjoyment of it: And when she spake of Heavenly things, it was with great reverance and comely deportement: For though she was a Maid of a notable Beauty, and comely coun∣tenance, yet much did she differ and far exceed when the Lord did open in her, and brake forth through her, yea, she was lovely indeed, and appeared as a Bride arrayed in royal Robes ready to meet her Husband and Bridegroom of her soul; And the night before her departure She called to her dear Sisters and tenderly salu∣ted them, and gave sweet counsell and whole∣some advice to them, and took her leave of them, worthy to be well observed and follow∣ed by them, and all her Fathers family, and even by all that heard her, or may hear thereof, and of her happy and comfortable end, and peace∣able departure out of the World; Even all both Young and Old, especially Young people, for whom she was greatly concerned; often pitty∣ing them, saying they were lyable to many temptations, often desireing their preservation
in the Truth often repeating these words in the truth and not above it, but under its government, ordered by it, and on this wise was she exercised in the power of the eternal God wherein she sweetly finished, her course and undoubtedly is at rest with the Lord where her joy is full, and will continue to her world without end. And it is upon me in the Name of the Lord, to advise all where these testimonys and re∣cords may come, that are young in years to take heed, that you fleight not the day of your visitation nor squander away, your precious time in vain pleasure and delights of this world, not knowing how short your time may be in it, and how soon the thread of your life may be cut: Oh that you would be prevailed with, and stirred up in your mindes, and encouraged to seek the Lord whilst he may be found, and call upon him whilst he is near, and take that good advice left upon record, to Remember your Crea∣tor in the dayes of your youth, and bear Christs, Yoke in your tender years, and the Cha∣stisments of the Lord, and his righteouss Judg∣ments love: which allways are mixed with mercy, and Sion, is redeemed through judg∣ment and her converts through righteousness, and five not the Cross of Christ Jesus, but take it up daily, and let it crucifie all your vaine desires and youthfull lusts of the flesh; an let no uncomely or untruth like attire come upon
you no wild or wanton behaviour, or fool talking or jesting which are not convenie appear in you, but let your gravity and mode∣ration appear unto all, and let your words be few and savoury, such as may minister grace  the hearer, and do not think your professi truth, or being Children of believeing Parent will serve you or Intitle you to the Kingdo of God, for in sin you are born who are in the transgression and by nature the Children  wrath, as well as others, and Esau the first b obtained not the Blessing, nor can Ishmael it heir with Isaack Sarahs Son, nor can what the Almighty hath done for you Fathers or others in the work of Regeneration and Redemptio give you a right to their Spiritual inheritance though you have a subtill enemy, perhaps w seek to perswade you, that you have good Pa∣rents, and your education is in the Truth, and you need not be so circumspect, you are b young, and that there is time enough for you trouble your selves, or your minds with thing of Divine nature, and that there are many may live well and dye well, and yet short of you profesion; but believe him not, he is a lye from the beginning, be not deceived God w not be mocked, such as you sowe, such will yo reape, for there is need for you to feell Chri Jesus for your selves, in your own bosom working redemption for you, and clensing aw
your sin, for it is said; Though Israell be many as e Sands on the Sea shore, yet it is but a remnant hereof that shall be saved, and though many were alled, yet are they but few that are chosen: And ou are sure to dye, and you know not whether ooner or later; and it is also upon Record, As he Tree falleth so it lyeth; As Death leaves Judg∣ment findes, and no unclean thing can enter the Kingdom; and if the righteous scarvely be saved, where shall the ungodly and sinners appear: And therefore, dear hearts endeavour, and that right early, to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, strive to make your Calling and Ellecti∣on sure, that when your Earthly Tabernacle is desolved, you may have a building with God, an house not made with hands eternall in the heavens, & keep on your spiritual progress in the straight way of selfe denyall; I well remember, that in my young years before I came amongst Friends, I was one that was not adicted to many evils, as some were but in a Zeal for righteouness beyond many of my equals I read much and thereby gained a great knowledge of the Scripture, litter∣ally, and therefore thought my self more secure, and safer then others and was puffed up there∣with & gloryed, therein but when it pleased the almighty, to open the eye of my understanding, I saw it was nothing but Egypts glory, and my own righteousness which was but as filthy raggs, and menstrous cloathes, and my knowledge to
be consumed and I to become a fool, that might be wise; then I waxed weary of Egyp glory, and refused to be a Child to Pharoah' Daughter; chusing rather to suffer affliction with the People of God, then to enjoy the plea¦sure of sin for a season, and all things beca to me as dross and dung in comparison of  excellency of the glory that was opened in t veiw of my mind: But when I turned my bac of Egypt. and sett my face Sion ward and tra¦velling thither Oh the many weary stepps  trode, and the many solitary teares I shed, a the many sighs and groans I uttered, for wanto full assurance of my salvation, Oh the man buffetting of the enemy my soul met with, & th Combets I under went and the many Baits an snares that were laid for me, and the ma temptations that did attend me many wayes made me sometimes in sorrow say, shall not surely one day fall by the hand of t enemy, for Satan desired to have me, an to winnow me as wheat, but the voice of my Saviour said in me, I have prayed for thee that thy faith faile not, and the Lord give me a little comfort, yea a little hope; though it was but as a lightning that shined in a dark place: And the Lord helped me with a little help in a a needfull time, and appeared in my soul, though but as a warfairing man, that turned in for a night, and made not his aboad in me,
yet this was my eragement, and the com∣t of a little rmnant that travelled with me rough the exrcise the Lord brought us into ilst he was known as refiners fire, and as the llers, ope washing away the filth of the daugh∣s of Sion refineing their dross and takeing ay their Tinn, that they might be as pure d, seaven times tryed in the fire, to come forth re and clean. And therefore Dear hearts resign freely into e hands of the liveing God, and bear his in∣gnation, because you have sinned against him d say with that good man of old, though thou ll me yet will I trust in thee, and despise not the stiseing of the Lord: And faint not when you e rebuked of him, and submitt willingly to e stroake of his hand, that he way square you, en as hewen stones; Ellect and pretious fit  lye in his Building; and that by your faith∣llness and obediance, you may become as llers in his House; and take heed of the spirit  this World, and do not intermix with it, for you do, it will draw you from your spiri∣all travel, and give you liberty to take delight  the vain pleasures therein, and let loose your esires after the honour and riches thereof: But onsider the lot of him that coveted the wedge  Goldand the Babilonish Garment, and de∣re you above all a portion of the Spirit of the ord, for some may covet Riches and honnor,
and may attain to it, yet it is an uncertain gai and if injoyed is attended with trouble an discontent, and on a suddain fade away an come to an end, but set your affections on hea¦venly things, and with the wise Merchant ma dig for the pearl that is of great price, and pa with all for the purchase of it, so will you ha heavenly treasure in your earthly vessells, wher the Mth corrupteth not, nor the Thief break throgh to steal, and that is certain and fades  away; and in the injoyment of it is the tru comfort, and great delight, though I am not a¦gainst an honest care, and right endeavours fo needfull things relateing to this life, but do en¦courage it, for in my youth I had my share,  the outward concerns of this world and I sough the Lord with tears to help me with counse and assistance in the Managment thereof, ye with supplications was I powerd forth befor him in that Concern, and the Lord assisted me to my often refreshment, yet a voice I hear within me saying, first and principally, seek th kingdom of heaven and the righteousness there¦of and other things shall be added unto th then I saw that the earthly things were to b kept in their place and the heavenly things hav the first and supreame place in me and livei praises to his Name for ever, who never said t the house of acob, seek my face in vain, for he  found of them that seek him; for as I sought hi
I found him whom my soul loved; And as I ask∣ in his Name, I received his imbraces, and e soliceing streames of his love and as I knock∣ in the pure faith, it was opened to me, to now in measure the misteries of his heavenly ingdom, and to partake of Spiritual pleasure, d Heavenly felicity, beyond what ever I ought upon or could have expected, and of e earthly things I had no want, and though  pleased the Lord, in the morning of the day, nd in the young and tender years, of a rem∣ant, for a little season, to give us the bread of adversity, and the water of affliction, and exer∣cise us in the strait and narrow way wherein he eads us; even through many tryals and great ribulations, yet did he in his due time give us he songs of deliverance, and put high prases n our mouthes, and we could often say in secret, his wayes was wayes of pleasantness, and his paths, paths of peace, yea he gave us mirth for mourning, beauty for ashes, and the Oyle of joy and gladness, for the spirit of heaviness▪ But I would not be tedious nor too long vary from my testimony touching this young wo∣man of whom I was speaking, for I can truely say she was dear to me all along, and in her exercise I Sympothysed with her, and also in her care and travell for the sake of others, she saw the narrowness of truths way and often said, it was a strait and narrow way and that too few
walked therein, but said she, there are many paths that leads to distruction and too many treads therein, she desired us that were to remai in the body after she was gone to her rest to advise Friends to keep to the innocent truth to grow up therein. And I not knowing how soon I may be dissolved, I have a little inlarge beyond what I at the first did think upon, and have as my duty to God, made some little men∣tion of my own travells and something of wha by true experience, I have learned both of the difficulties and pleasures in truth's way if hap∣ply it might be an Incouragment to the honest hearted and a caution to the outminded: Much I could write which is before meat this time but I shall forbear to add much more at this time and rest your Friend, with my love to you all my dear Friend, where this may come with fervent desires for you that you may all have an eye to the right door where enterance into life is and keep in the foot-steps of the flocks his companions, to the Word of whose grace I doe recommend you, that in your hearts to which you will do well if you take heed, for if obeyed it will teach you, and lead you into all, truth and will be unto you as a cloud by day, and as a pillar of fire by night, and if you move in the motion of it, it will be your safe conduct, through your pilgrimage and the time of your sojorning here, and will rightly order your
steps, in the truth and gird you up in your graduall groath therein, from strength to strength and from one degree of grace unto another, as dear Children of your heavenly father, delighting in all things that may honour him, and serveing him in true fear, you will die in his favour, as this Innocent damsell did, who was a faith∣full witness for truth in her day, and for righteousness and bore a liveing testimony for the Lord on her dying bed. And it is the earnest desire of my heart, that the Lord, may preserve me and all that true∣ly loves and fear him, both young and old to the end of our days, in a sensible feeling of the continuance of his love and life un∣to us, and in a true Injoyment of his living presence amongst us, and that in his true love we may be dayly concern'd for the prosperity of his truth, and the good of our own souls as this Innocent Lamb and handmaid of the Lord our welbeloved was, for whom we cannot sorrow as those with∣out hope, being well satisfied of her sal∣vation, and do believe she is now entered into everlasting rest: And peace where no temptation can reach her nor disturbance
of the enemy can disquiet her, but in the presence of her beloved to sing praises for ever: for very often was it her desire (and she often said) Oh that I had breath to praise the Lord, and he is praise wor∣thy saith my soul, O that his own work may praise, him in Young and Old to whom all praises doth belong and free∣ly is ascribed now henceforth and for ever. Katherine Winn. THe foregoing Relation and the Tes∣timonys born concerning our Dau∣ghter Sarah Beckwith, to the truth there∣of, or can testifie haveing been an eye and eare witness of the exercises she pas∣sed through and of the Dealings of the Lord with her in his great mercy and kindness upon her dying bed and how the Lord raised her up, by his Mighty power to declare thereof. To the great refreshment and satisfaction of all abo her at that time. The understanding she was endued with, and the Mouth and
Wisdome God gave her, therewith to testifie for him and h blessed truth was admired of us, and gave us cause often to sy, Who would not but fear the Lord, who gives wisdome to the simple, and a good understanding to those that fear his powerfull name, Who casts down the mighty from of their seats and exaltes those that are of a low degree. Blessed be his holy name for evermore, And touching her death we are well satisfied, that she dyed well, in peace with God and is at rest with him. And though our loss be great in parting with her, yet Greater is her gain in the world which hath o end. And although it is not our desire to have our Child any way set forth; but as it may stand with the praise of God, and that the honour of that Truth she testifyed to, and had her Conversation in: Nor to have our Names made men∣tion off therein, further then to witness to the Testimonies borne concerning her, and that the Lord may be glorifyed there∣by. Yet, in the fervent desiers that the good Councell and advice given by her,
both to Young and Old, made mention of herein. May be cordially closed with, we are concerned in this wise in the name of the Lord to advise all, to give all diligence to make their Calling and Election sure That they may be prepared and ready to meet the Lord when ever he shall call, as undoubtedly this Innocent Lamb was, who had run well in the time of her pilgra∣mage here, and fought the good fight of faith to the finishing of her course to her joy and to the obtaining the Crown and the Inheritance which hath no end. We could not be wholly silent, but in our Duty to God and in honour to truth she received and lived in, make Mention of and bear Record to Gods wounderfull appearance in his love and tender mercy to his people In this our age and day, witnessed by this his Servant and Handmaide, Who hath so marvellously appeared in her, and shewed himselfe in so Large a measure to her, and given her the knowledge of the riches of the world to come, and in such zeal and fervency of spirit to de∣clare thereof to others. That all may be encouraged to seek the Lord right early,
while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near and not neglect the day of their visitation, Nor spend their pre∣ious time about things which are below hile the one thing needfull is not ade Choice of. But in the Way that God hath cast up for his people, we may ll walk in. And in the race set before s we may so run as that we may obtain, nd enjoy that heavenly inheritance, which is laid up for all those that love he Lord Jesus Christ, and his heavenly ppearance, that God alone may have raise who is everlastingly worthy blessed or ever and for evermore. Marmaduke Beckwith. & Elizabeth Beckwith.
