To the Christian readers, and hearers, S. OF the great subscription vrged from the Pastors and ministers of the worde and Sacramentes in a great part of this land the last yeare, yee can not lightlie be ignorant. The causes of the same being either secrete, I cannot: or not con∣uenient to be published, I may not set downe. What the euent thereof wil be, God he knoweth: what it hath beene, accor∣ding to the diuersitie of mans minde, diuerslie do men thinke thereof. For some are of opinion that much hurt thereby hath redounded to the Church of God, and they think not a∣misse in diuers considerations: others, (again) wiselie do sup∣pose that it hath made not a little vnto the glorie of God, and comfort of his seruants, as whereby a ful and perfect trial of men is had, & diuers of the godlie notablie be deliuered from the manifold slanders, & wicked surmises falslie raised of them through the secret, and subtil suggestions of Satan, and his members. For, to speake first of her Maiesties authoritie in causes Ecclesiastical, (and that to offend none of Gods children, but to the consolation of manie) of al that haue bine examined, what one hath denied the same? who but most willingly, and cheerefully doeth ascribe so much as the lawes of this land in euerie respect do giue vnto her highnes? Who but hath offered, as to subscribe, so to sweare vnto that article? Who but would suffer the losse, not of goods onely, but of life also, for the maintenance of the same? And although the Papistes do write, that to grant this vnto her maiestie, is lothsome and base flat∣terie Answer to the Execut. of Iustice c. 8, p. 207., abominable and blasphemous adulation Ibi. c. 8, p. 198., shameful haeresie, and vntruth Ibi. c. 8, p. 195, against nature Ibi. c. 7, p. 159., and is not to make her next to God in her Realme, but to make her the God of her people Ibi. c. 8, p. 298.: For the next step, saie theie, (vnto diuine adoration) is to saie & beleeue, that a temporal King is aboue the Priest in causes Ecclesia∣stical, or that in a Christian common weale the next dignitie to Christ, or God is not the priest▪ but the Prince: yet can we not to auoid the aeternal displeasure of God, but thinke it, and to showe our selues du∣tiful, & loial subiects, subscribe vnto the same, hauing learned so to do out of Gods holie word. As for the supremacie chalenged by the Pope, whom (as heretofore, so dailie, but most sacri∣legiouslie) theie cal The general pastor Answer to the Execut. of Iustice c. 6. p. 131., yea, The common Father of al Christians, specialie of princes Ibi. c. 6, p. 121., yea, The chiefe priest and pastor of our soules Ibi. c. 5, p. 96., yea, The supreme pastor of Gods faithful people Ibi. c, 8, p, 193., yea, The high pa∣stor of Christs vniuersal Church Ibi. c, 3, p, 52.: and, to omit a number of such blasphemous titles, The prince of Gods people Ibi. in the pre∣face.: as we know no such praerogatiue giuen him by the word of God, so we do vtterly re∣nounce, and altogether mislike the same. And, to come vnto another Article concerning the booke of common praier, not one, that I know, hath refused simplie to subscribe vnto that neither. Though some denie not onlie that that forme, but that anie forme of publique, & ordinarie praier is to be vsed in the Church, and think it papistical, and giue out that it doth but mocke the Lorde, and the Lorde loatheth, and spueth it out of his mouth . H. vpon the 122. Psal. pub. anno 183.: though some againe write that it hath no part of the catholique seruice Howlet in his 4. reason., and cal it a Calui∣nistical Answer to the Execut. of Iustice, c. 3, p. 50., a schismatical Ibi. c, 1, p, 1., a damnable schismatical Ibi, c, 3, p, 38., an heretical Ibi, c, 2, p, 28▪ c, 8, p, 174., an abominable seruice Ibi. c. 1. p. 14., (These be the dest and charitable words of them whom, theie saie, no protestant in England is able to reproue of a∣ vntruth, or slander, railing, immodestie, &c. Ibi, c. 9, p, 212.:) yet what is that vnto vs? which of al Gods ministers that haue bine tried can iustlie be charged so much as to fauor, much lesse to maintaine those vn∣godlie
assertion? And the auctors too, who are theie? Not nightbirds? Not light hedded, and fu∣gitiue persons? Not our professed and knowen enimies? It maie not be denied, but some do with-hold their pens from approuing that holie booke in euerie point by subscription: yet are there none, I trust, that proudlie contemne it, none that dis∣dainfulie despise it, none but in the feare of God, and in pub. Churches alwaies, and onely doe vse it, and manie haue set their hands there-unto, and al, I doubt not but so would, were that which is offensiue, reformed; and that which is crooked, made streight; and that which is doubtful, made euident and plaine. Which things also are for number but verie fewe, and, therefore maie the more easilie be remoued: and remaine, for the most part, in the directions and rubricks, and therefore with lesse offence may be taken awaie. Neither doth anie minister of the word, that I heare, denie by subscription to allow the booke concerning the Articles, & summe of our faith, but what lawes do exact, or enioine most willing∣lie haue theie offered to performe. And no cause is there whie we should not so doe: the auctors of the same do moue; the soueraigne authoritie, whereby it was established, and is vpholden, doth moue; but the necessarie, and al Christian doctrine there-in comprised, doth most of al moue vs, not onlie in heart to like thereof, but with mouth also, and euerie waie to praise it, and to glorifie the goodnes of God for the same. Our fore-fathers manie of them desired to see that, though it were but secretlie, and to the hazarding of their lands, goods, and liues, which in that booke we openlie and publiquelie to our vnspeakable comfort, and profit do see maintained. Besides, it is the badge of Eng. Christians whereby we are knowen to the vniuersal worlde not onlie to agree with al the godlie that haue bine or do liue at this present in the material points of religion: but also to disagree from the Iewes, Turks, Papists, Anabaptists, and al other prophane men. So that theie, or he which shal with-drawe his hand from allowing the same, maie vehe∣mentlie be suspected to be a contemner of the sacred auctoritie of this noble realme, and of the doctrine of Christ; a dissenter not onlie from al the godlie in this land, and therfore not worthie to liue among vs: but also from the true Christians who both haue liued heretofore, and remaine in anie reformed Church at this present time; and a fauorer either of the Iewish, or Turkish, or Popish, or Anabaptistical, or some vngodlie, and cursed opinion, or other. Theis things (one of the weakest of my brethren knowne I confesse, yet through confidence in our chiefe captaine Iesus Christ, whose al power is Matth. 28, 18.) I haue vndertaken to proue in two books or treatises: the former wherof is now before you, the other in good time, if so it please God, shal come abroad, In which aduisedlie looke, and yee shal perceiue, that the Religion established by the auctoritie, and professed of al degrees in this land, is neither a false religion, as the Papists do thinke, stil tearming it (how like Christians iudge yee) vngrateful haeresie Answer to the Execut. of Iustice c. 6, p. 128., barbarous haeresie Ibi. c. 1. p. 4. c. 4. p. 71., brutish haeresie Ibi. c. 6. p, 126., cruel haeresie Ibi. c. 1, p. ., wicked haeresie Ibi. c. 6. p, 132., wild condemned haeresie Ibi. c. 5. p, 103., diuelish doctrine Ibi c. 8. p. 166., but founded and built vpon the immouable fundations which the true Apostles of Iesus Christ, and the Prophets haue laid, and therefore cannot deceiue; nor a new religion Answere to the Execut. of Iustice in the praef. &c. 3, p. 13. c. 4. p. 8. c. 8. p, 182., a newe faith Ibi. c. 8. p, 172., a newe and barbarous Go∣spel Answer to the Execut. of Iustice c. 4, p. 83., a newe haeresie Ibi. c. 8. p. 166., (as the Antichristians, and priestes of the breaden God woulde perswade, and make their credulous companie to beleeue) found-out by Zwinglius, whom they cal, The vnfor∣tunate father of our Eng. faith Ibi. c. 4, p. 80., and not extant in England aboue 5. or 6. yeres before the short reigne of K. Edward the sixt Ibi c. 3., but the most ancient, receiued euen from Christ himselfe, and his written word; nor, A wicked religion tending vnto Paganisme, & Epicurisme Ibi c. 8, p. 169., but that the man of God maie be ab∣solute, being made perfect vnto al good workes 2. Tim, 3. 17., nor at this present taught in a corner of the world by vs onlie, but with a sweete harmonie and consent of al the Churches protestant in Eu∣rope publiquelie embraced. Againe, besides that al the enimies of name, which the truth hath had from time to time euen til this verie houre be here discouered, yee shal so cleerlie and plainlie beholde, as anie thing yee maie when the Sunne gloriouslie doth show himself, that Poperie is not the onlie true worship of God Answer to the Execut. of Iustice, c, , p. 103.; that Poperie is not consonant to (God) his sacred word and wil Ibi c, 8, p, 180.; but planted by weake & wicked men; that Poperie is not the old Religion Ibi c. 2, p, 19. c. 3, p, 36, c, 9, p, 211, but a new, or more trulie a loathsome Chaos of all condemned haeresies, and antichristian opinions; and that Poperie agreeth not with the church of God in this land, or in anie other countrie or citie, almost in no one substantial & material point of Christia∣nitie,
and so is not the Catholique or con Religion Answere to the Execut. of Iustice, in the preface., as theie commonlie giue out. And therefore is to be detested: and the teachers ereof, whether Seminaries, or others, to be held accursed Gal. 1. 8, 9.: and the maintainers of the same as ch to be taken heede of, as the Arrian, Nestorian, Pelagian, and such like haeretikes that haue liued heretofore: or as the Iewes, Turkes, Anabaptistes, which trouble the world in theis daies. And therefore right▪ godly wisedome and Christian magnani∣mitie hath our soueraigne Queene, & her noble Counsel declared, in suffering the papistes, being more dangerous to the Realme, and as hurtful to the true and Catholique religion, to haue no more fauor either publiquelie in temples, or priuatelie in houses to assemble themselues toge∣ther, than the Iewes, or Turkes: the contrarie wherof as they excedingly do wish Answer to the Execut. of Iustice, c. ▪ p, .: so wee trust shal neuer come to passe, notwithstanding the maruelous opinion they haue in their Gregorie the 13. that now is Pope, who theie hope shal once be the bane of our vngrateful heresie Ibi. c. 6, p. 328.. And hauing noted these things iudge in the name of God, both what he was that incited the Emp. Charles the 5. to make warre rather against that most puissant and noble King of famous memorie (whom the enimies of their countrie saie, is Radieccati Answer to the Execut. of Iustice, c. , p. . c. 8, . 188.,) Henrie the eight for encli∣ning but in part vnto that truth, which wholie is here defended, than against the Turke Card.

Besides, forsomuch as the Papists do not onlie thinke, but also giue-out, that we are at ferce contention among our selues, let them aduisedlie consider, either howe al the Protestant Chur∣ches in Europe do subscribe vnto our Articles, or we vnto their confessions, and then tel what our dissension is. It maie be they wil saie, al reformed Churches subscribe not to euerie of our Arti∣cles. But manie do, and none denie, I saie not anie of our Articles, but not anie one Thesis, or pro∣position of anie Article common to al Christians. I grant some confessions be larger than other some are, and conteine more matter of Christianitie than others do: yet are theie not contrarie, no more than Athanasius Creed is contrarie to the Apostles, because it is larger; nor the Deca∣loge is contrarie to the moral Lawe, because it is the summe of it; nor the Commandements, Loue God aboue al, and thie neighbor as thie selfe, are contrarie to the Decaloge, because theie are the Epi∣tome of that also. Occasions maie fal out that we maie be briefe, & vpon occasion we maie vse mo words as errors be suppressed, or do spring vp. And it is to be wished, that as new errors peep out, so frō time to time new Articles by auctoritie were published, thereby to make it euident vnto the whole world both howe hurtfull theie be to the Church of Christ, and how we condemne them. Nowe, as the Papists cannot in truth saie, that we dissent from the godlie Christians liuing in other parts of the world: so maie theie not tel vs so odiouslie of diuision among our selues at home. For we, al of vs, allowe her Maiesties auctoritie in causes Eccles. and ciuil; we, al of vs, ei∣ther simplie subscribe vnto the forme of pub. praier prescribed, or humblie (which libertie the lawe giueth) desire resolution in some fewe things; we, al of vs, iointlie both embrace the Arti∣cles of the English Creed, and renounce al haeretical opinions contrarie there-unto; we, al of vs acknowledge the good things that we do enioie, and that the Church would florish much better, if that good lawes alreadie made were faithfulie put in execution, and the true discipline of Christ so greatlie, and so long wished Booke of Com∣mon praier Tit. Cation., were firmelie established, who doth not acknowledge? A thing euident enough these manie yeeres, but neuer so apparent as by this great, and late trial of the Ministers. So that this is another benefit redounding to vs thereby. Another is, that whereas the Papists would make their fauourers to beleeue (who theie thinke
wil credit al things whatsoeuer they do write) that the farre greater parte of al degrees in this land are Catholiques Answer to the Execut. of Iustice c. 8.▪ p. 171.: and an infinite number of al states neuer consented vnto those things which we do Ibi. c. , . 200.: yea, and that al the Clergie in a manner be on their sides Ibi in the pre∣face., who is either so blinde, that he seeth not; or so ig∣norant, that he knoweth not, howe a greater vntruth could neuer haue bine published? And in this respect we maie tearme it an happie trial, that euen al the Papists maie learne how to credite them in things not so apparent, when they wil not blush to giue-out which in their conscience they knowe is vntrue. For, God be thanked, not the lesser parte, but euen al the Ecclesiastical per∣sons of the Church, especialie which haue▪ bine tried, are on our side, and not on the Papistes, or else they dissemble so cursedly as no true Christian would to gaine the whole worlde. And as al the realme maie see, and must confesse thus much: so her Maiestie, and the right honorable of her priuie Counsel, do best knowe, and we may easilie coniecture, that the noble and worshipful of this Realme, chiefelie the greater and better parte, haue deuoutlie sworne, and be readie, and that by sworde stoutlie to defend not Poperie, as some seditious fellowes blowe abroad Answer to the Execut. of Iustice c. 3, p. 48., but the Religion publiquely into this lande by auctoritie receaued; and our most noble princesse & Queene Elizabeth, not that odious and most infamous Pontifex. And such as the Pastors are, such be the flocks; as the Nobles be▪ such are the Commons; and as the ruler of the citie is him∣selfe, such are al theie that dwel therein. Againe, although our common enimie Satan (which accuseth vs not onlie before man but al∣so euen before the throne of the Almightie, and that daie and night ▪  .,) so much as in him was, laboured to sowe the poisoned seedes of mortal strife and dissention among vs: I trust he shalbe deceiued of his expectation, and that which he made an occasion of discorde, wilbe turned into a cause of an holie and indissoluble concord. For holding her Maiestie immediatly after Christ in her dominions ouer al persons the chiefe gouernour; the ordinarie seruice for a religious wor∣ship of God; the Articles of our religion for the verie groundes of Christianitie, where-upon we must build or perish, what shal deterre vs from louing one another with a moste firme and Chri∣stian loue? Shal pettie and trifling thinges of no waight, or of smal importance? yea, or anie thing else that can be conceiued in heart, or expressed by mouth or penne? God forbid. And in this holie vnitie we shal the more firmelie be rooted, doe wee turne our eies from beholding one another, and consider the vnquenchable malice of our capital enimies against vs, and the cause of the same. From the abundance of their malice, they cal the holie Ministers of Christ raskals Answere to the Execut. of Iustice c. 3, p. 44. Intruders, Philistims, Wolues, Apostataes, as before was noted. And theis infamous, yea blasphe∣mous titles, theie attribute not vnto a fewe, but vnto al, euen from the poorest, and moste obscure Curate in the countrie, to the highest Praelate in the Palace. Nowe if thus they thinke, and write of vs in the time of their trial, what wil theie not tearme vs, if theie shoulde haue their wils? And theie which haue so litle respect of persons, and of gifts nowe, wil haue much lesse then. And the cause is neither for the Seruice which we haue in our Temples, which diuers Popes haue offered to tollerate euen as it nowe is without alteration (theie would neuer so do, we must think, were it either Schismatical, haeretical, or abominable, as our English of al the vainest Papistes do saie) nor for the diuersitie of our ceremonies, it is for our Faith, which is contrarie to theirs, and for their Supremacie, which we denie: yea, theie can beare al, themselues do saie Answer to the Execut. of Iustice c. 7, p. 155., and turne all to good, so long as the true Faith, and substance of Ecclesiasticall iurisdiction be not destroyed: but seeing wee haue and do both oppugne the faith, and ouerthrowe the gouernement of the Church of Rome, therfore the vilest wordes that Satan, their spiritual father, can put into their hearts, be in most poisonful manner vomited forth to hurt vs. This being so, howe ought we to loue and make of one another, who are thus hated, and by reuilings persecuted, and that for one and the same cause at this present. If that daie which theie so long-for should, as either that or some other affliction in this world for our vnthankfulnesse, or a more intollerable at the general iudgement, which is neere at hand, shal come, it will not be to our griefe that we haue beleeued, preached, and professed the trueth which the Church of England at this daie doth hold, but that we haue not liued there-after, we shal repent; and pub∣lishing the Gospel of peace, haue yet bine contentious, we shal repent; and being seruants to one and the same Lord and master, haue not onlie railed vpon, but also beaten and pursued one ano∣ther,
we shal repent; and, being watchmen, haue not bine more vigilant and resident in our pla∣ces, we shal repent; our negligence, our coldnesse, we shal repent; & if we haue either kept-out of the Lord his vine-yard, such as both for abilitie could, and for their zeale would, either implant this faith in the ignorant, or confirme it in the learned; or to the certaine destruction of them∣selues, and many others depending vpon them, either brought or kept in the idle, and idol shep∣herd, that shal we repent also, and that with teares. Theis things that we maie carefulie thinke vpon, and performe euerie of vs in our place, the God of peace grant vs for his Christ sake, to whome together with the holie Ghost be ascribed al honor, and praise, and glorie for al the good things both praesentlie imparted vpon vs, and in the life to come praepared for vs, for euermore, Amen.

The Manechies, which ascri∣bed the creation of al things vnto two Gods, or Begin∣nings, or Natures, Th'one Good; where-of ca good thinges. Th'other Euil; where-of came euil thinges. 2.

Turkes. Saie, there be moe God than one, and yet not three persons, nor of one nature, but of contrarie disposi∣tion, as the Gnostikes, Marcionites. Valentinians. Thinke, there be three Gods, or spirits, not distinguished onlie, but di∣uided also, as the Tritheites. Holde, that not à Trinitie, but à Quaternitie is to be worshipped, as the Emperour Anastasius commaunded. Graunte The name of three sondrie persons, and denie their per¦sons, as did the These did saie howe the same God was called in the holie Scripture by diuers names. And ther∣fore that the Father be∣came flesh, and suffered, because one & the same God is called the Fa∣ther, Sonne, and holie Ghost. For this cause they were called Patri∣passians. In this number was Seruetus. Noëtians, Praxeneans, Termogeni∣ans. The names, and persons of three: and yet doe depriue not onelie the Sonne, and holie Ghost of their Diuinitie, but the whole Trinitie of their properties. For they sayde there be three in heauen, the Father, the VVorde, and the holie Ghost: but the Father onelie is verie God; the VVorde is the breath of the Father, and the holie Ghost is the Spirit created by God of nothing through the VVorde. And so they spoile the Sonne and the holie Ghost of their Deitie; and the whole Trinitie of their properties. These were the Arian and Macedonian heretiques, who were called Pneu∣matomachoie, because they warred against the holie Ghost:
2. ARTICLE. Of the word, or sonne of God, which was made verie man. THe Sonne, which is the1 VVord of the Father, be∣gotten from euerlasting of the Father, the verie and eternal God, of one substance with the Fa∣ther, 2 tooke mans nature in the wombe of the blessed Virgine, of her substance: so that 3 two whole & perfect natures, that is to say, the God∣head and man-hood were ioyned in one person, neuer to be diuided, whereof is one Christ, verie God and verie man; 4 who suffered, was crucified, dead and buried to re∣concile his Father to vs, and to be a sacrifice, not only for original gilte, but also for al actual sinnes of men. The Propositions. 1. Christ is verie God. 2. Christ is verie man. 3. Christ is God and man and that in one person. 4. Christ is the Sauiour of the world.
1 That Christ is verie God with vs also 1. The Scriptures do witnesse. As it is apparent that he is The Word, Ioh. 1. 1. Begot∣ten of the Fa∣ther frō euerla∣sting▪ Psal. 2, 7. Act. 13. 33 Heb. 1, 5.

Miserably therefore haue they erred, which deny the di∣uinitie of our Sauiour Christ. As did Arius. Corinthus. Ebion. Eunomius. P. Samosatenus. As doe The Iewes. The Turkes. which say that Christ was A good man. Not God.
2. Holding the humanitie of Christ, we do agree 1. with the scrip∣ture, which entreateth of Christ his Conception Gen. 49, 10. Isa. 7, 14. Mat. 1, 18, &c. Luke 1, 26, &c. Growing, Luke 2, 40.

That Christ had a soule without sense and reason, as Apollinaris did. That Christ tooke not flesh of the Virgine Marie, as did the Valentinians. Arians. doe the Anabaptists. Fam. of Loue. That Christ tooke flesh not of the Virgine only, but by the seede of man too, as Ebion gaue out.
3. That the diuine and humane nature of Christ is vnited in one person, accor∣deth 1. With the Scripture. Iohn 1, 14. &c. Math. 3, 17. Ephes. 4, 10. Phil. 2, 5. &c. 1 Tim. 2, 5. 2.

Ausburgh art. 3. Wittemb. cap. 2. Sueuia. art. 2. Therefore detestable is the er∣ror Of Eutiches and Dioscorus, who thought the two natures of Christ were so confounded, that the na∣ture of the Word, and of the Flesh was one, and the same. Of Nestorius, who denied the two natures of Christ to be vnited, that the properties of the one, might in some sense be ascribed vnto the other: and sayde that as Christ had two natures, so he had not one but two persons. Of Seruetus, who said of Christ, that he was the Pa∣tren of al things, & but a figure of the sonne of God and that the bodie of Christ, was compact of three vncreated elements: and so confounded and ouer∣threw both natures.
4. That Christ is the Saui∣or of the world, a∣greeth. 1. With the Scripture, which testi¦fieth that Christ trulie Suffered, was cru∣cified, Died, was bu∣ried, Matth 27, 26, &c. And that 1.

Then wic¦ked are al opinions contrarie herevnto, which tende To shewe that Did suffer, a that of the Patripassians The Father in his Deitie Not the Sonne in his humani∣tie To shewe that Christ did not truelie suffer, but in imagination, as the Heretiques Cerdon, and Basilicus cast-forth. To bring the passion of our Lorde into detesta∣tion, as do the fantasies of the wicked Iacobites and Turkes. To make the passi∣on of Christ Of none effect, To put awaie but Original sinne on∣lie. As that of Popish Masses. Popish praiers. Popish par∣dons. Popish Pur¦gatorie. To showe that Christ died not for the sinnes of al men. To showe that some sinnes be so filthie, as Christ his bloud vppon true repentance cannot washe them awaie.

His soule was Commē∣ded into the hands of God the Fa∣ther, Psal 31, 5. Luke 23. 46 In Paradise: (so is it set downe as a thing wel to be obserued) & not in Hel, Luke 23, 43.

And so we are a∣gainst them. 1. Which saie, that Christ descended not into Hel at al. 2. Which thinke that Christ descended into the place of torments, where in soule he endured for a time the paines which the damned spirits doe there sustaine. 3. Which holde, that Christ went downe into Lake ymbo, to fetch from thence, as Canisius: to loose from thence, as Vaux he saith, the soules of our forefathers, which afore his death were shut vp in the close prison of Hel.
4. ARTICLE. Of the Resurrection of Christ. CHrist did trulie 1 arise againe from death, and tooke a∣gaine his bodie, with flesh, bones, and al thinges appertai∣ning to the perfection of mans nature; 2 wherewith he ascended into heauen, and there sitteth, 3 vntil he returne to iudge al men at the last daie. The Propositions▪ 1. Christ is risen from death. 2. Christ is ascended into heauen. 3. Christ wil come againe to iudge the quicke, and the dead.
1. The resurrecti∣on of Christ is 1. Proued by the Scrip∣tures. For it is euident that Christ Should arise, In th'old Testament, Psal. 16, 12. Isa. 53, 10. In the Newe Testa∣ment, by the testimo¦nie of our Sauiour Christ, Matth. 12, 40▪ Marke 9, 31. Marke 10, 34. Luke 9, 22. Did rise again▪ By his appea∣ring to Marie Magdalene, Iohn 20, 14, &c.

So that vtter∣lie false, and vnchristian is the opinion of The Sadducis, which flatlie denie the re∣surrection of anie. The Iewes, that wil not acknowledge this resurrect. of Christ. The Schuenkfeldians, that sae, howe our Sauiour after his re∣surrection was so deified, that he re∣teined no more the properties of his bodie and soule, nor the vnion of both natures, but was meerelie God. The Fam. of Loue, which take the re∣surrection of Christ to be but an alle∣gorie, and no cer∣taine historie.
2. In saying how christ with his very body ascended into hea∣uen, we declare our selues to dissent not 1. From the scriptures Psalm. 47, 5. Psal. 68, 18. Psal. 110, 1. Math. 22, 44. Math. 26, 64. Act. 1, 9. Luke. 24, 51. Rom. 8, 34. Ephes. 4, 8, 9, 10. 2. From the Creede Apostolical, Nicen, Athanasian. 3. From the Confes. of the Churches of Helue. 1. art. 11. 2. cap. 11. Basil. art. 4.

From the Vbiquita∣ries, as Papistes Certaine Germans Which doe holde that the bo¦dy of Christ is Not only in heauen, But also in earth, and that euery where Where the Sacrament is . In euery kingdome, In euery Countrey, In euery citie, In euery parish, In euery loase, In euery peece of bread, and cup of wine. 2. From the Papistes that say how Christ ascended carrying with him the soules which he losed from captiuitie, & bondage of the Di∣uel, wheras there is not one word, ei∣ther 1. In the S. Scripture. 2. In any sound Con∣fession. Olde Newe That the soules of the righ∣teous Were not afore Were then placed
. Where we say that Christ shal come again to iudge al men we agree 1. With the scripture. Acts. 10, 42. Rom. 2, 16. 2. Tim. 4, 1, 8. Iam. 5, 9. 2. With the Creede Apostolical▪ Nicen▪ Athanasian. 3.

But we re∣nounce their opiniōs which thinke That there shal be no iudgement at al, as the Atheists, & Epicures of this world, do. That The Diuels The wicked shalbe saued, as do the Origenists. That before the iudgement there shalbe a golden worlde, the godly and none besides enioying the same peaceablie and gloriouslie, as the Iewes do. That the righteous are in godly glory, & shal from hence∣forth liue euerlastingly with Christ, & raigne vpon earth, as the Fam. of Loue teacheth.
5. ARTICLE. Of the holie Ghost. THe holie Ghost, proceeding from the Father, and the Sonne, is of one substance, maiestie, and glorie, with the Father, and the Sonne, verie and eternal God. This article concer∣ning the holy ghost 1. The Scripture, Math. 28, 19. Act. 2, 4. 2. Cor. 13, 3. 2. Pet. 1, 21. 1. Iohn. 5, 7. 2. The Creede. Apostolical, Nicen, Athanasian, 3.

In say∣ing That the holie Ghost proceedeth from the Father, and the Sonne, we shew our selues not to be of the error of the Graecians, which said howe the holy Ghost procee∣ded from the Father, but not from the Sonne. That the holy Ghost is of one substance with the Fa∣ther and the Sonne, we declare our selues aduersaries to the Macedonian heretiques, who sayde the holy Ghost was a Creature, which is of another substaunce than GOD is. That the holie Ghost is of one substance, maiestie, and glorie with the Father, and the Sonne, we altogether dissent from the heresie of the Sabellians, & Tritheites, which thought the holie Ghost to be that, which God the Father, and God the Sonne were, and no distinct person from them.
6. ARTICLE. Of the sufficiencie of the holy Scriptures for saluation. HOlie Scripture 1 conteineth al thinges necessarie to saluation: so that whatsoeuer is not read therein, nor maie be proued thereby, is not to be required of anie man, that it should be beleeued as an ar∣ticle of the faith, or be thought requisit necessarie to saluation. 2 In the name of the holie Scripture, we doe vnderstande those Canonical bookes of the old and newe Testament, of whose auctoritie was neuer any doubt in the Church. Of the names and number of the Canonical bookes. Genesis. Exodus. Leuiticus. Devteronomium. Iosue. Iudges. Ruth. The 1. booke of Samuel. The 2. booke of Samuel. The 1. booke of Kinges. The 2. booke of Kinges. The 1. booke of Chron. The 2. booke of Chron. The 1. booke of Esdras. The 2. booke of Esdras. The booke of Esther. The booke of Iob. The Psalmes. The Prouerbes. Eccles. or the Preacher. Cant. or song of Salomon. 4. Prophets the greater. 12. Prophets the lesse.
3 And the other bookes (as Hierome saith) the Church doth reade for example of life, and instruction of manners: but yet doeth it not applie them to stablish anie doctrine. Such are theis following. The third booke of Esdras. The fourth booke of Esdras. The booke of Tobias. The booke of Iudith. The rest of the booke of Hester. The booke of wisedome. Iesus the sonne of Sirach. Baruch the Prophet. Song of the three children. The storie of Susanna. Of Bel, and the Dragon. The praier of Manasses. The 1. booke of Machab. The 2. booke of Machab. 4 Al the bookes of the Newe Testament, as they are commonlie re∣ceiued, we doe receaue, and accompt for Canonical. The Propositions. 1. The S. Scripture containeth al thinges necessarie vnto the saluation of man. 2. Al the bookes in the volume of the Bible, are not Ca∣nonical. 3. The 3. and 4. bookes of Esdras: the booke of Tobias, &c. are Apocripha. 4. In the newe testament, al the bookes are Canonical.
1 That the Scriptures of God are al suffi∣cient and necessarie to instruct vs vnto luation, with vs, 1 The S. Scrip∣ture, Deut. 4, 2. 12, 8. Iosh. 1, 7. Prou. 30, 5. Iohn. 20, 31. Gal. 1, 8. 2.

Wittemb. cap. 30. Sueuia, art. 1. Do witnesse. And therefore we are aduer∣saries to al such as before the worde of God, do pre∣fer their, owne Inuentions, as the Philosophers: whereof one saide of Moses. That good man maketh a trim discourse, but hee proueth nothing. Phantastical imaginations, a Did the Manechies. Doe the Libertines, Anabaptistes, Fam of Loue. Traditions, as the Papistes, which eui∣dently appeareth in that they do moste cruelie punish, and torment such as re∣fuse The wicked pre∣cepts of men; or not at al, or ouer∣slightly correct the breakers of God his com∣maundements. To keepe popish holie daies. To heare their bla∣sphemous Masse, To obserue their superstitious fa∣stings and ceremo∣nies, Statutes, or edicts, or decrees, or iudgements, or proclamati∣ons, or els whatsoeuer proceeding from the braine of man, as Macchiauel doth, and his fauorers.
2. That some bookes in the Bible are Canonical, and some Apocrypha, it hath bene graū∣ted by the best learned, and most godly of long time. And as all the reformed Chur∣ches in the worlde are of the same iudgement with vs: so in their publique confessions some haue so compted, and iudged of them as we doe. As namelie the Church in France, art. 3. Fland▪ art, 4. Therefore (to speake first of the Canonicall bookes of the olde Testament) they haue hainously offended, & defaced the glory of God, which 1. Reiected al the bookes of the old Testament, as did the Heretiques Basilides, Caporates, the Manichies. 2. Allowed some, but not al the Cano∣nical bookes of the old Testament. And of this sorte Some receaued no more but the. 5. bookes of Moses, as the Saduceis. Some receaued the Lawe on∣lie, and the Prophetes▪ as the Samarites. Some receaued neither the law nor the Pro∣phetes: as the Appelleans.
3. That diuers, yea and those bookes here mentioned are Apocrypha, we are neither the first that said it, nor they on∣ly which affirme the same. For The auncient Councel at Laodicea, can. 59. did The confessi∣ons of the Churches re∣formed in Doe France, art. 3. Fland, art. 4. Iudge them, not to be Canonical. So that they are to be taken heede of as seducers, which would thrust vpon the Church, 1. The bookes for canonical Apocrypha, within the vo∣lume of the Bible, as the Papistes would: and there∣fore accursse so manie as take them not for canonical, Conc. Trid, sess, 4. decr. de can. Scrip. 2. Anie bookes not compre∣hended in the Bible, whether they be The newe Prophetes, Barcobas, and Barcolf, of Basilides the heretique. The Phaneroses, or manifestations of Marcion the heretique. The mysteries of Manechie the Here∣tique. Isais Ascensorium, of Hierax the Here∣tique. The Gospel after The Aegyptians. The Hebrues. The 12. Apostles. Barnabas. Thomas. Nicodemus. The Actes of S. Paul. The Reuel. of S. Peter. The bookes of the Montanistes▪ Anabaptistes▪ HN. Papistes, &.
4 Although some of the auncient Doctors accepted not all the bookes comprehen∣ded within the vo∣lume of the new te∣stament for Canoni∣cal: yet in the ende they were wholy takē and receiued by the common consent of the Church of Christ in this world, for the verie word of God, as they are at this day in al places, where the Gospel is preached & professed▪ Howbeit we iudge them cano∣nical Not so much because man in the world doth so re∣ceiue and allow of them. As for that 1 The holy spirit in our hartes, doth testifie that they are from God. 2 They carrie a sacred aucto∣ritie with thē. 3 They do agree with the other books of God in the old Te∣stament. Therefore in receiuing thē wholy, not in part, we shewe our selues vt∣terly to con∣demne Such as receiued not the whole new Testament but▪ a part thereof. And these were of diuers kindes, whereof Some reiected all the Epistles of Paule▪ &c. and allowed only the Gospel after Mathewe, as Co∣rinthus the Heretique. Some re∣ceaued of the As Marcionth Heretique. Euangelistes onely Luke, Epistles of Paul only the Epistle vnto Timothie and Titus. Some alowed of al the testament, only the Act of the Apostles, as Tatian the Heretique. Such as allowed neither the whole new Testament, nor those books wholie which they receiued, as the Marcionites, who defaced al those places in the Gospel after Luke, and in the Epistles which concerned either the Diuinitie, or humanitie of our S. Christ. Such as receaue & read the new Testament, but scrape out such text therein, as mislike them, as the Turkes, who scrape out whatsoeuer they finde touching the passion of Christ, saying how it was added purposely by the Iewes, in derision of the Christians.
7. ARTICLE▪ Of the old Testament. THe 1 old Testament is not contrarie to the new, for both in the old and newe Testament euerlasting life is offered to mankind by Christ, who is the onely mediator betweene God and man, being both God and man. 2VVherefore they are not to be heard, which faine that the old Fathers did looke only for transitorie promises. 3 Although the Lawe giuen from God by Moses, as tuching ceremonies and rites, do not bind Christian men, nor the ciuil precepts thereof ought of necessitie to be receiued in any Common wealth, yet notwithstanding, no Christian man whatsoeuer is free from the obedi∣ence of the Commaundements, which are called moral. The Propositions. 1 The old Testament is not contrarie vnto the new. 2 The old Fathers looked for eternal happinesse, so wel as for temporal blessings. 3 The Law moral remaineth, though the ceremonial and ciuil be abro∣gate.
1 That the old Testament is not contrarie to the newe, it may easily be proued by many inuin∣cible arguments yet is it most apparant in that our Christ (verie God, and verie man, as aboue, p. 6▪ 7. hath beene declared) is offred vnto mankind by them both. That 1 There is one Christ, and no moc, 2. Christ is the Son of God, 3. Christ is verie man, 4. Christ was born at Bethlehem, 5. Christ was▪ born of a virgine, 6. Christ was ho∣noured of wie men, 7. Christ rid vpon an Asse vnto le∣rusalem, 8. Christ was be∣trayed, 9. Christ did suffer not for his owne but for our sins, 10. Christ did rise againe, 11. Christ did as∣cend, As 'it is apparent in the newe Te∣stament. 1. Acts. 3, 25. Gal. 3, 8. 16. 2. Acts. 13, 33. 3. Heb. 2, 12. 4. Math. 2, 1. 5. Math. 1, 23. 6. Math. 2, 11. 7. Math. 21, 1. 8.

Say that the Law as con∣trarie to the Gospel, is not to be preached, as do the Antiomies, and Ana∣baptists.

9. ARTICLE. Of original, or birth sinne. ORiginal 1 2 sinne standeth not in the following of Adam (as the Pelagians do vanelie talke) but it is the fault and corruption of the nature of euerie man, that naturallie is engendred of the ofspring of Adam, wherebie man is verie farre gone from original righteousnes, and is of his owne nature enclined to euil, so that the flesh lusteth alwaies against the spirit, and therefore in euerie person borne into this world, it deserueth Gods wrath, and damnation. 3 And this infection of nature doth remaine, yea in them that are regenerated, whereby the lust of the fleshe, called in Greeke , which some do expound the wisedome, some sensualitie, some the affection, some the desire of the flesh, is not subiect to the law of God. 4 And although there is no condemnation for them that beleeue, and are baptised: yet Th'A∣postle doth confesse, that concupiscence and luste hath of itselfe the na∣ture of sinne. The Propositions. 1. There is original sinne. 2 What original sinne is. 3 Original sinne remaneth in God his children. 4 Concupiscence euen in the regenerate is sinne.
1. Though this worde original sin is not to be founde in the Can. Scripture, yet that there is O∣rig. sin, it is cleare 1. By the S. Scripture, wherein is set downe most eui∣dentlie, thereof 1. The cause which is 1. Principa∣lie the fal of Adam▪ as Rom. 5. 15 &c. 1. Cor. 15. 22. Who fel partly By the sugge∣stion of the Diuel Cor. 11. 3. Gen. 3. 4. Through his owne free will. 2.

And also Not only to Flori∣nus & Bla¦stus, &c. who make God the Auctor of sinne; But also to al such as curi∣ously en∣quire whether God woulde haue Adā to fal; or why he stayd him not from offending
2. Original sinne Not the imitation of Adam his wicked∣nesse.

Confessi∣ons of the Churches in Helue. lat. ca. 8. France, art. 10. Bohem. cap. 4. Ausburg. art. 2. Saxon. art. 2. Wittemb. ca. 4. Our Sa∣uiour Christon∣ly exemp∣ted from the taint of this corrupti∣on. For He is the immaculate Lambe, 1. Pet. 1. 19. He did no sinne, 1. Pet. 2. 22. He knew no sinne, 2. Cor. 5▪ 21. He was tempted, & yet without sinne, Hebr. 4, 15. Now ad∣uersaries herevnto, are the Who say that Orig. sinne com∣meth by i∣mitation and not other∣wise. 1. Pelagians 2. Fam. of Loue. 3. Valentini∣ans who ascribed Orig▪ sin Not in anie sort vnto man. To the Diuel. 4. Mani∣chies, who hold that this sinne Proceedeth not from our corrupted na∣ture. Is another substance within vs. 5. Papistes, who though they graunt that the vir∣gine Marie was natural∣ly engendred of the of∣spring of Adam: yet they denie that she was guiltie of original sinne, Conc. Trid. decr. de pec. Orig.
3. That Original sin remaneth, yea in them that be regene∣rate, it is 1. Easie to be proued by the scripture, as in di∣uers places beside: so ap∣parently Rom. 7, 14▪ &c. Gal. 5, 16. Iam. 1, 14. Iam. 4, 1. . Pet. 2, 11. 2. Agreeable to the Con∣fessions of other refor∣med Churches, Confes. Heluet. 1. art. 8. 2. cap. 8 Basil. art, 2. France, art. 11. Saxon. art. 10. Therefore we do stande in this point against 1. The Papists, who say that Orig. sinne was not at al, much lesse remaned in the Virgine Mae, whence it followeth, if Orig. sinne were not in her, then  was not regenerate; if not rege∣nerate, à very dangerous, and most vnchristian doctrine doth ensue concerning her. 2. The Fam. of Loue, who affime that the elect and regenerate sinne not. For seeing Orig. sinne is in the regenerate, as the Scripture doth testifie, then do, and shall the regenerate sinne, so long as they haue within them Orig. sinne. 3. Adamites, that contend howe they are in so good à state, as Adam was afore his fal: there∣fore without Orig. sinne.
4. That Concupiscence in al men (and therefore in the faithful & rege∣nerate) is sin, is very ap∣parent. 1. In the Scrip∣ture, because 1. The holy Spirit straightly forbiddeth it Coloss. 3, 5. 1. Pet. 2. 11. It 2. Not onlie lusteth against the Spirite. Gal. 5, 17. 3. But also figh∣teth against The soule, 1. Pet. 2, 11. The law of the mind, Rom. 7, 24. 4.

In the right Christian Confession Heluet. 2, cap. 9. Saxon. art. 2. 10. Therefore we mislike their opinions, as vnsound which say that concu∣piscence is no sinne, but 1. A thing indif∣ferent, and the punishment of sinne, as do the Pelagians. Sententiaries. 2. Proceeding from sinne, and in∣clining vnto sinne; so doe the Papistes. Conc. Trid. Sess. 5. decr. depec.

10. ARTICLE. Of free wil. THe 1 condition of man after the fall of Adam is such, that he cannot turne and prepare himselfe by his owne natural strength & good workes re faith and calling vpon God. Wherefore we haue no power to do good workes pleasant and accep∣table to God, 3 without the grace of God by Christ preuenting vs, that we may haue â good wil, and woorking with vs, when we haue that good wil. The Propositions. 1. Man maie do outward and euil things, being not yet regenerate. 2. Man cannot do what good is, being not yet regenerate. 3. Man maie performe good thinges, when he is preuented by the grace of Christ, and renued by the holie Ghost.

1. ARTICLE. Of the iustification of man. WE are accounted righteous before God, only for the 1 merite of our Lord & Sauiour Iesus Christ 2 by faith, and not for 3 our own workes or deser∣uings.

Wittemb. art. 5. Sueuia, cap. 3. But so beleeue not The Atheists of this world, for they are not perswa∣ded of the life to come, not of the mysteries of mans saluation. The Pharisaical teachers, who thinke there is no righ∣teousnes before God, but ciuil and external righte∣ousnes in the sight of men. The Papistes. For they teach that Some sinnes are washed away, not by the blood of Christ, but by holy water, so called, as lesser offences. Some sinnes are pur∣ged By the fire of Pur∣gatorie. By almes giuing. By Perigrinati∣ons. By Pardons. By Masses. By fasting, &c.

Either holde that man is to be stil in doubt whether he shalbe saued, or no, as the Papists, Conc. Trid. sess. 6 c. 9. Such as do faine, that they please God, not through faith by hearing, but by reuelation, as the Manichies. Enthusiasts. Anabaptists. They whiche hold that man is iustified By Workes with∣out Faith. As did The false Apostles in Asia, 1. Tim. 1. The Interim of Ausburgh. As do the Turkes: Anabaptists. By Faith & works As did the Pseudoapostles at Hierusalem. Act. 15. As do the Papists commonly. Neither by faith nor workes, as they which contemne both a sure confi∣dence in Iesus Christ, & good virtues, & yet hope to be saued, as they say. They who defende how we apprehend not the righteousnesse of Christ by faith▪ but haue it, or Christ himselfe rather dwelling essentially within vs, as the O sianders.
3. Besides what hath bene saide that workes haue no place, nor portion in the matter of our iusti∣fication, it is euident 1. In the holy Scripture, where we do find, that Al men be sinners, and are destitute of the glorie of God: and therefore that no man can be iustified by works Psal. 14, 2, 3. Psal. 53, 2, 3. Psal. 51. 4. Rom. 5, 12. &c.

12. ARTICLE. Of good workes. ALbeit that good workes, which are the frutes of Faith, and follow after iustification, cannot put a∣way our sinnes, and endure the seueritie of Gods iudgement: yet 1 are they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ, 2 and do spring out necessarilie of a true and liuely faith, insomuch, that by them a liuely faith 3 may be as euidentlie knowen, as a tree discerned by the frute. The Propositions. 1 Good workes do please God. 2. No worke is good except it spring from faith. 3. Good workes are the outward signes of the inwarde beliefe.
1. Though God ac∣ce not man for his works ake, as hath bin proued▪ yet that good works af∣ter man his iusti∣fication please God, it is a cleere truth e∣uerie where to be seene. 1.

Brea∣king of faith to an here∣tique, &c. is al¦low∣ed. Some dreame that God is pleased with lipseruice, and outward righte∣ousnes, as the hypocritical Pharisies or Pharisaical Hypocrites.
2. Al which man doth, is not pleasing vnto God, but that onelie which proceedeth from a true faith in Iesus Christ. So wit∣nesseth 1. The Scripture Heb. 11, 6. Rom. 14, 23. Tit. 1, 15. Rom. 8, 8. Gal. 5, 6. 1.

Matth. 6, 12. Saie we are vn¦profitable ser∣uants. Luke 17, 10. Paul, We know that the Lawe is spiritual, but I am carnal, &c Rom 7. 14, &c. We which haue the first frutes of the Spirit, euen we do sight in our¦selues, &c. and haue infirmi∣ties. Rom. 8, 23. Ye cannot do the same thinges that ye would. Gal. 5, 17. 2.

13. ARTICLE. Of workes before iustification. WOrkes done before the grace of Christ, and the inspiration of his spirit, are 1 not pleasant to God, forasmuch as theie spring not of faith in Iesu Christ, 2 neither do they make men meete to re∣ceiue grace, or (as the schoole aucthors saie) de∣serue grace of congruitie: yea rather, 3 for that they are not done as God hath willed and com∣maunded them to be done, we doubt not but they haue the nature of sinne. The Propositions. Workes before Iustification 1 Please not God. 2. Deserue not grace of congruitie. 3. Haue the nature of sinne.
1. Before men do please God, nothing that man doth can please him. But men please not God being not renued by the Spirite, which as it hath bene alreadie proued: so is it 1. In the Scripture, where it is euident, that before man be regenerate, they are Which bring out no good frute of them selues. Matth. 7, 16. Not grapes but thornes. Not figs, but thi∣stles. Not good, but il trees, Matth. 12, 33. Luke 6, 43. Not liuely, but dead bowes. Iohn 15. 4. Not ingraffed, but wilde oliues. Rom. 11. 17. 23.

2. The vnregenerate, not yet iustified, haue no∣thing in them to mooue God to be gratious vnto them. As may be seene 1. In the Scripture, where wee finde that the vnregenerate, be∣ing Olde, not new creatures Ephes. 4, 22. Col. 3. 5. Enimies, (Rom. 8. 7.) not the Children of God, Seruants of God, Sinners, not godly bent, Rom. 5, 8. Infidels (Tit. 1, 15.) and not faithfull Christians Of congruitie de∣serue no grace at God his hande Hereby is ouer∣throwne the Pap. doctrine concer∣ning merites of con∣gruitie. 2.

3. VVhatsoeuer men, not yet iustified before god, do, it is sin: & this shall we finde confirmed 1.

4. ARTICLE. Of workes of Supererogation. VOluntarie workes 1 besides, ouer, and aboue Gods commaundements, which they call workes of Su∣pererogation, cannot be taught without arrogan∣cie, and impietie. 2 For by them men doe declare that they doe not onely render vnto God as much as they are bound to do, but that they do more for his sake than of bounden dutie is required: wheras Christ saith plainely, When ye haue done al that are commaunded to you, say, We be vnprofitable seruants. The Propositions. Workes of Supererogation 1. Cannot be taught without Arrogancie. Impietie. 2. Are the subuersion of the true Religion.
1. Workes of Superero∣gation, which are al volunta∣rie workes besides o∣uer, and a∣boue the commaun∣dements of God are of∣ten cōdem∣ned 1. In the Scrip∣tures where We are cō∣maunded To walke, not after the lawes of men, but according to the statutes of God, Iohn 1. 7. Ezek. 20. 19. To heare, not what man he speaketh, but what Christ doth say. Mat. 9, 7. And He teaching the duties of Christians, set∣teth before them the Lawe, and word of God (Math. 5. 15. & 22. And more than that, he doth neither ad, nor require. He sayth They worship me in vaine, who for doctrine teache the commaundements of men. Mar. 7, 7. Teach them to obserue all thinges whatsoeuer I haue comaunded you. Mat. 28. 20 My sheep Heare my voice. Know not the voice of Straun∣gers. 10. 10, 27. 5.

Therfore they which teach such works be Arrogant. Vngodly.
2. VVhere the workes of Superero∣gation are taught The Law of God is bro∣ken, that the traditions of men may bee obser∣ued. The S. Scripture must be contemned, as not suf∣ficient enough to bring men vnto the know∣ledge of saluation. God is made vnwise, in not commaunding so necessarie workes. Faith, and other spiritu∣al virtues, are brought into vtter obliuion. Perfection is imputed not vnto Faith, but vnto workes, and which is most detestable, vnto the workes not commaun∣ded but forbidden of God, ordeined by men. The Lawe of God is thought to be through∣ly satisfied; and more duties performed than man needed to haue done. They which broached, and defende these errors VVere the Pharisies. Are the Pa∣pists who besides what hath bine said, do holde that such workes Do merite remission of sinnes, and that For them∣selues For others Often∣times do driue away Diuels. Euil spi∣rits. Are tokens of the forgiuenesse of sins, so wel as Baptisme; yea deliuer from the wrath of God, so wel as Christ. And so they pre∣fer their owne workes before The word of God. The Sa∣craments. Faith. The death of Christ. And ther∣fore may Their do¦ctrine  called  doctrine of Diuels. The tea∣chers be held accur∣sed.
15. ARTICLE. Of Christ alone without sinne. CHrist 1 in the truth of our nature was made like vnto vs in al things, sinne only except, from which he was clearely voide, both in his life and spirit. He came to be the Lambe without spot, who by sacrifice of himselfe once made, should take away the sins of the worlde; and sin, as S. Iohn sayth, was not in him. 2 But al we the rest, although baptized, and borne againe in Christ, yet offende in many things, and if we say, we haue no sin we deceaue our selues, and the truth is not in vs. The Propositions. 1. Christ is truly and perfectly righteous. 2. Al men besides Christ, though regenerate, be sinners.
1. That Christ was pure from sin, it is a∣bundant∣lie to be seene. 1. In the Scrip∣ture. For He was without sin Conceaued. Matth. 1, 20. Borne. Luke 1. 35. He appeared to loose, but not to fulfil the workes of Satan. 1. Iohn 3, 8. He li∣ued And was tempted, yet without sinne. Heb. 4, 15. And did no sinne. 1. Pet. 2, 22. And knewe no sinne. 2. Cor. 5, 21. And had no sinne in him. 1. Iohn. 3. 5. He died à guiltlesse man, euen by the testi∣monie Of Paul. Rom. 5, 6. &c. Of Peter Act, 3, 14. 1. Pet. 3. 18 Of Ste∣phan.

Matth. 5, 17. That he ouerthrewe all religion, and moued the people vnto re∣bellion. Luke 23. 5. Such were the Scribes. Pharisees. High Priestes.
2 Al men be∣sides Christ, are sinners. A truth most appa∣rent 1. In the Scripture, which te∣stifieth how al men be either Vnregenerate; & they be vnrigh∣teous (alredie proued aboue, pag. 46, 47) and sinne in al things (con∣firmed, pag. 48.) Regene∣rate; and there are not with∣out sinne Original; reade pag. 31, 32. Actual, see pag. 43. Be∣sides con∣firmed is it 2. Eccles. , 20. 1. Tim. 1, 15. Gal. 5, 17 1. Iohn. 1, 8. 2. In the confessions of the godly, especialie In Ausburgh. art. 20 In Saxonie. art. 3, 8. Oppugned is this truth by sondrie aduersaries which hold, that besides Christ, o∣thers either haue bine, or be per∣fectlie righ∣teous, such be The Papistes. The Mani∣chies. The Catha∣rans. The Donatists. The Pelagians The Familie of Loue. The Marcio∣nites. The Adamits. The Carpocra∣tians. Whereof some haue thought As the Papists, that The vir∣gine Ma∣rie was pure from al sinne, both Original. Actual. S. Francis hath fulfilled euerie ote of the booke of God. That they could not sinne so much as in cogitation, as the Manechics. Catharans. That theey haue bin so perfect that they could iustifie other men at their pleasures, as the Donatists. That they needed not to say, as Christ commaundeth, Forgiue vs our trespasses, &c. except it were on the behalfe of o∣thers. For they cannot sin. Of this opinion are the Pelagians. Fam. of Loue. That they are so pure, euen as Yea more holie than Paul, Peter, &c. such are the Marcionites Adam, and Eua before their fal, as the Ada∣mi. I. Christ himselfe, as the Carpocratians.
16. ARTICLE. Of sinne after Baptisme. NOt euerie deadlie 1 sinne willinglie committed after baptisme, is sinne against the holie Ghost, and vn∣pardonable. Wherefore, the graunt of repentance is not to be denied to such as fal into sinne after Bap∣tisme. 2 After we haue receiued the holie Ghost, we may depart from grace giuen, and fal into sinne, and by the grace of God, (we maie) rise againe, and a∣mende our liues. And therefore they are to be con∣demned, which saie, they can no more sinne, as long as they liue here, 3 or denie the place of forgiuenes to such as trulie repent. The Propositions. 1. Euerie sinne is not the sinne against the holie Ghost. 2. The verie regenerate maie fal, and yet rise againe. 3. None are vtterlie to be cast of, which vnfainedlie repent.
1. Euerie sin willinglie committed after rege∣neration, is not the sin against the holy Ghost, and there∣fore vnpar∣donable; as maie be seene 1. In the Scrip¦ture, where we finde though e∣uerie sinne of it owne nature de∣serue dam∣nation: yet that there is A sinne Stripes. Luke 12, 46. Which shalbe puni∣shed with fewe, Which shalbe puni∣shed with manie A sinne 1. Iohn 5, 6. Vnto death, Not vnto death, A sinne against which shalbe for¦giuen, The Fa∣ther The Son The holie Ghost; that neuer shalbe forgiuen Matth. 12, 31. Mar. 3, 39. Luke 12, 10. 2. In the publique confessions of the Church of God at Heluet. 2, cap. 8. Bohem. cap. 4. Saxon. art. 10. Diuerslie hath this doctrine bine in∣uaded. For Some haue thought al sinnes to be like, as the Stoikes. Pelagians. ouinians. Some taught howe none of the godlie fathers, and nations from the beginning of the worlde, vntill the 15. yeare of Tiberius the Emperour, though earnestly theie did repent, were saued, but were punished alike with vtter confusion, as Manes the Heretique. Some giue out that al euerla∣stingly be con¦demned, which depart out of this world Afore theie are baptized, as the Papistes. Afore theie come vnto yeares of discretion; as the Heracites.
2. That the verie re∣generate maie fal, and yet rise a∣gaine, is à true do∣ctrine 1. Graun∣ted vpon the Scrip¦tures. For in them we do e∣uidentlie see That fal They maie Partlie by the ad∣moniti∣ons Of Christ vnto The man hea∣led of the pal∣sie. Iohn 5, 14. The adultresse. Iohn 8, 11.

That be¦ing fal∣lē, they maie rise againe, by the Exhortations of the Angel vnto the chur∣ches of Reuel. 2. Ephesus, Perga∣mus. Thyatira, Exam∣ples Of Peter, who denied, and yet afterwarde confessed Christ. Of al the Disciples, which fled (Matth. 26, 56.) and yet came againe. But sub∣scribe herevnto wil not The Catha¦rans. The Nouati∣ans. The Iouini∣ans, The Anabap∣tistes. The Fam. of Loue. Who thinke that the people of God be rege∣nerate into a pure and Angelical state, so that they be defiled with no contagion of sinne. The Papistes simplie. For though they graunt that the godlie maie rise againe from sinne: yet they denie that they can so do without their Sacrament of Pe∣nance; which is an error. Conc. Trid. sess. 6. can. 29. 2.

3. Such as do fal, & yet returne againe by vn∣fained repen∣tance vnto the Lorde, are to be receaued as mēbers of the true Church. And this is ve∣rified 1. In the Scrip∣ture. For there is it That God Would haue al men to be sa∣ued Matth. 11, 28. 1. Tim. 2, 4. Is readie to receaue the peni∣tent, Luke 15. 7. Luke 19, 41. Iam. 5, 20. 2. Pet. 3, 10. 1. Iohn 1, 9. Reuel. 2, 5, &c. Doth refuse none that returne vnto him by repentance, as ap¦peareth in th'example Of the prodi∣gal childe. Luke 15, 20. Of the debitor Matth. 18, 26, &c. That vpon repentance man must receaue, & comfort them which haue gone astraie. So did Paul wil The Galathians to re∣store the weake. Gal. 6, 1. The Corinthians to com∣fort the man which had committed incest. 2. Cor. 2, 7, &c. Philemon to receaue One simus. Phil. vers. 12. 2. In the Christian confessions of the godlie in Heluet. 2, cap. 14.

The Nouati∣ans. The Anabap∣tistes. That saie, how being once re∣generate, sinne is cut awaie, as with à rasor, so that they can∣not sinne, nei∣ther neede to repent. The Messali∣ans. The Fam. of Loue. The desperate, whose sinnes be either so manie, or so grieuous, that they think how God he nei∣ther can, nor wil forgiue them.
17. Article Of Predestination and Election. PRedestination 1 to life, is the euerlasting 5 purpose of God vvhereby, 2 before the foundations of the vvorld vvere laid, he hath 3 constantlye decreed by his councel secrete to vs, to deliuer from curse & damnation 4 those vvhome he hath chosen 5 in Christ out of mankinde, and to bring them by Christ to euerlasting 5 saluation, as vessels made 5 to honor, 6 vvherefore they vvhich be endued vvith so excellent a be∣nesite of God, be called according to Gods purpose by his spirit vvorking in due season, they through grace obey the calling, they be iustified freely, they be made sonnes of God by adoption, they be made like the image of his only begotten snne Iesus Christ: they vvalke religiously in good vvorkes, and at length by Gods mercy, they attaine to euerlasting felicitie. As 8 the godly consideration of prede∣stination and our election in Christ is ful of svveete, pleasant & vnspeakable comfort to godly persons, & such as feele in themselues the vvorking of the spirite of Christ, morte∣fying the vvorks of the flesh, & their earthly members, & dravving vp their mind to high and heauenly things, as vvel because it doth greatly establish and confirme their faith of eternal saluation to be enioyed through Christ, as because it doth feruently kindle their loue tovvards God: so, for curious and carnal persons lacking the spirit of Christ to haue continually before their eies the sentence of Gods predestination, is a moste dangerous dovvnfal, vvhereby the diuel doth thrust them either into desperation, or into rechlesnesse of most vncleane liuing, no lesse perilous than desperation. 9 Furthermore, vve must receiue Gods promises in such vvise, as they be generaly set forth vnto vs in holy scripture, 10 and in our doings that vvil of God is to be follovved, vvhiche vve haue expressely declared vnto vs in the vvord of God. The Propositions. 1. There is a Praedestination vnto euerlasting life. 2. Praedestination hath bine from euerlasting. 3. They which are praedestinate vnto saluation cannot perish. 4. Not al men, but certaine are praedestinate to be saued. 5. VVhy some are elected, and not others. 6. Who they are which shalbe saued. 7. VVhat are the effects of Praedestination. 8. The vse of the doctrine of praedestinatiō, both to the godly & wicked. 9. VVhat may keepe men both from desperation, & also frō securitie. 10. In our actions the word of God, which is his reuealed wil, must be our direction.
1. That amōg men some be prede∣stinate vnto life, it is a truth most apparent 1. In the Scripture 1. By the te∣stimonie Of Christ him∣selfe Math. 10, 20. 20, 23. 22, 14. 24, 22. 25, 35. Luke 12, 32. 17, 34. Iohn. 6, 37. 10, 26, &c. Of the Euangeliste, Luke, Act. 13. 48. Apostle Paul Rom. 8, 29 &c. 9. 10. 11. 1. Cor. 1. 27. 2. Cor. 2. 13. Ephes. 1. 2. By the ex∣ample of The Creatures Man Angels, Math. 25, 41. ude, vers. 6. The two Bre∣theren Habel Kain Gen. 4. 4. Heb. 11, 4. Isaac & Ismael Rom. 9, &c. Iaakob & Esau Mal. 1, 2, 3. Rom. 9. 13.

The two men in the Fieldes, Math. 24. 40. The two women at the Mill. Math. 24. 40. Al wicked: and yet of them some be receaued into the fa∣uour of God, and some reie∣cted. Erre there∣fore doe they which stand in o∣pinion That some are apoin∣ted to be saued, but none to be damned. That some in soul, but in soule and bodie toge∣ther none shal be sa∣ued, as the Pseuda∣postles. Carpo∣cratiās. Valent. Cerdo∣nites. Mani∣chies. Hiera∣cites. Monta∣nists. 2. In the publique writings, and confession of the Churches militant.
2. Predestination beganne not in time, but before al times. So is it 1. In the Scripture Matth. 25, 34. Rom. 16, 25. 26. Ephes. 1. 4. &c. 2. Tim. 1, 9. 2. In the publique confession of the godlie in Heluet. 2. cap. 10. 11. Basil. Art. 1. France, art. 12. Whereby it appeareth how those Sophi∣sters be deceiued, who, because God is not included within the compasse of anie time, but hath al things to come as present continually before his eyes, doe ae, that God he did not in the time long passed onely, but stil doth in the time present likewise predestinate.
3. They which are prede∣stinate vnto life euerla∣sting can-not fal awaye from God for altogi∣ther, sayth 1. The Scripture Math. 16. 18. Math. 24, 24. Iohn. 6, 37. Iohn. 10, 28, 129. Rom. 8, 30. &c.

Then wander doe they from the truth, which thinke That the very elect may fal vtterly from grace & be dam∣ned. That the number of those which be predestinate, may both increase and be dimini∣shed. So did the Pelagians.
4. As wee graunt there is a Pre∣destination and that before al worlds, of men who must en∣ioy euerlasting life: so we do saie not that al men, but cer∣taine be predestinate vnto sal∣uation. And so doth 1. The word of God Luke, 10, 20. Luke, 12, 7. Iohn, 10, 14. 2. Tim. , 10. 2. The Churches refor∣med in Heluet. 2. cap. 10. Basil. Art. 1. France, art. 12. Fland. Art. 16. What they are therefore ap∣peareth, which saie that Not cer∣taine, but al shal be saued, yea the verie As the Orige∣nistes. Libertines Catabaptis Diuels Damned Al men be elected vnto euerlasting life, Furthermore they are not to bee liked that curiously wil enquire what the num¦ber of them is that shalbe saued, or dam∣ned.
5. The causes why some are predesti∣nate vnto life, are set downe most plainelie . In the Scripture, wher may be seene 1. The cause efficient to be th'euerlasting purpose of God Rom. 8, 28. Rom. 9. 11. Ephes. 1, 5. &c. 2. Tim. 1, 9. 2. The cause formal, God his infinite mer∣cie Exod. 33, 19. Rom. 9, 15. 3. The cause material, the bloud of 1. Christ Act. 2, 38. Act. 3, 20, &c. Act. 10, 43, &c. 1. Cor. 15, 22, &c. Ephes. 1. 3. &c. 1. Tim. 2. 5. 1. Pet. 1, 18, 19. 4. The cause final, or end, why both God the Father hath lo∣ued, and Christ thus suffered, namelie The glo∣rie of God Ephes. 1. 6▪ 12. Prou. 16. 4. Isa. 5. 16. The sal∣uation of man Rom. 8, 29. Rom. 9. 21. 2. In the publique writinges of the Churches militant with a sweete consent according to this article, And this condem∣neth the impietie of al those which thinke That God doth not predesti∣nate man of his mercie, but that man doth predestinate himselfe by his merites. That God behelde in euerie man whether he would vse his grace well, and beleeue the Gospel, or no; and as he sawe a man wel affected, so he did predestinate him. That beside his will there was some other cause in God why he choase one, and cast off another: but this cause and reason was hid from vs. That men are predestinate vnto life, if they doe beleeue; But Predestination is not conditionall, but certaine. For they which are elected in Christ shall, and if they liue, must and wil beleeue. That God is partiall, and vn∣iust, for chusing some, and re∣fusing others; calling manie, and electing but fewe.
6 Though true it be the Lorde knoweth all, & euery of his e∣lect: yet hath he reuealed vn∣to vs certaine notes and to∣kens, whereby we may see, & certainly know whether we be of that numer, or not. For such as be or∣dained vnto e∣uerlasting life, if they liue 1. They be cal∣led vnto the knowledge of saluation, by the preaching of the worde. 2.

8. The con∣sideration and do∣ctrine of predesti∣nation, is 1. To the godly ful Sweete, Plea∣sant, Com∣forta∣ble. Because It great¦lie con∣firmeth their faith in Christ. It doth feruent¦lie kin∣dle their loue to¦ward God. So saith 1. The scrip∣ture. Rom. 8 18, 31. &c. Ephe. 1. 15, &c. 1. Cor. 15, 14, 15, &c. 2. The Church of God in al places. 2.

That the seales of the coue∣nant be appoin∣ted to al in gene∣ral. For Concerning Bap∣tisme, Al are to be baptised, Matth. 28, 19. Mark. 16, 5. Tou∣ching the Lorde his sup∣per, Christ faith Of the bread, Take, eate, this is my bo∣die. Of the cup, Drinke ye al of it. Matth. 26, 26, &c. 1. Cor. 11, 23. &c. 4. That as the diso∣bedience of Adam brought condemnation vpon al men: so the bloud and obedience of Christ is able, and al sufficient to washe away al sinnes, and that of al men. 5. That none euer yet did flie vnto the mercie of God by vnfained repen∣tance, but he was re∣ceaued into fauor: so among others was Dauid after his a∣dulterie. Manasses after his idolatrie. Peter after his apo∣stacie. The theefe hanged with Christ, euen at the last gaspe. The Ninuis after many▪ and greeuous offences committed So that as theie are not to be heard, which do saie The numer of the elect is but smal, and seing we are vn∣certaine whether we be of that com∣panie or not, we wil proceede on as we haue be∣gonne: That God is an accep∣tor of per∣sons, and so vniust in choosing some, and refusing o∣thers: So is it the parte of al, and euerie man, Not to refuse the mercies of God, as generalie: so most gratiouslie offered vnto al men. Not to despere in espect either Of the great∣nes Of the multi∣tude Of his sins. Not to prouoke the Lorde to execute his vengeance through prophanenesse of life, and securitie.

And that wil to Not which is concealed from vs, of God his omnipotencie, whereby he is minded to go∣uerne at his pleasure the things by him selfe created. Of this wil is mention made Psal. 115, 3.

19. ARTICLE. Of the Church. THe 1 visible 2 Church of Christ, is a congregation of 3, 4 faithfull men, in the which the 5 pure worde of God is preached, and the Sacraments be dulie ministred, according to Christes ordinance, in al those thinges that of necessitie are requisite to the same. As 6 the Church of Jerusalem, Alexandria, and Antioch haue erred: so also the 7 Church of Rome hath erred, not only in their liuing and maner of ceremonies, but also in matters of faith. The Propositions. 1 There is a Church of Christ, not onely inuisible, but also visible. 2 There is but one Church. 3 The visible Church is a catholike church. 4 The word of God was, and is before the Church. 5 The markes and tokens of the visible church, are the due and true admi∣nistration of the Word and Sacraments. 6 The visible Church may erre both in doctrine and conuersation. 7 The church of Rome most shamefully hath erred both in life, ceremonies, and matters of Faith. 8 There is no saluation without this church, and therefore euerie man is firmely to ioyne therevnto, and neuer to depart there from by schisme, and contention.
1 A true saying is it. The Lorde, and hee onely, know∣eth who are his. For to man the Church of christ is part∣ly 1 Inuisi∣ble; which are all th elect, who are or shall be ei∣ther 1 In Heauen, triumphing. 2 In earth figh∣ting a∣gainst the Flesh World Diuell These as mē¦bers of the Church, are sayde to bee inuisible, not because the men are not seene, but for that their faith and consci∣ence is not perfectly known vnto vs. 2 Visible, where∣of some are 1 For God. 2 Against God.

2. When we doe saie That the Church is Visible, Inuisi∣ble, That there is à church VVeast, Easte, Greeke, Latine, Italian, English We think not that Christ hath di∣uers chur¦ches, but that the Church Is di∣uerslie taken, Hath manie parti∣cular Chur∣ches (as the sea manie armes) contai∣ned in it.

4. Seeing the vi∣sible Church of Christ is à Congregation of men (either in th'eies of God, or at the least in the iudgement of the godlie) faithful: it fol∣loweth that the word of God must be before the Church, fo 1. Time▪ Be∣cause the word is The seede: the faith∣ful The corne Luke 8, 1 The chil∣dren. 1. Pet. 1, 23 The rocke, or foun∣dation; the faithful the house Matt. 16, 1. Ephes. 2, 0. 2.

Of this iudge∣ment are the Churches re∣formed, as ap∣peareth in their confes. Heluet. 1, art. 14. Heluet. 2, cap. 13, 17. Bohem. cap. 1, 8. France, art. 5. Flan. art. 3, 7. Saxon. art. 1, 11.

5. There is the visible Church, where 1. The pure worde of God is syncerely preached. 2. The Sa∣craments instituted by Christ are dulie admini¦stred. And so saie not we one∣lie, but besides 1. The scrip¦ture; wher in we find that à note of the vi∣sible Church is the 1. VVord prea∣ched, Luke 8, 21. Iohn 8, 47. Iohn. 10▪ 27. Gal. 1, 8 1. Thes. 5, 20. 1. Iohn 4, 2, &c. 2. Iohn verse 9. 2.

But be∣cause discipline in part, is in∣cluded in th'o∣ther markes mentioned, both we, and in effect, al other Churches re∣formed, ouer∣passe it in this place, as no to∣ken simplie of the visible Church. Nei∣ther do we tie the Church so strictlie to th'other signs, that we thinke al those to be without the Church, and Antichristians, which neither doe heare the worde orderlie preached, nor receiue the sa∣craments; if so be they would, and can neither heare th'one, nor receaue th'other: at which time the Church is not visible, but in∣uisible, as in the time of ty∣ranny, and cap tiuitie. On the other side we renūce, as alto∣gether Anti∣christi∣an, the opini∣ons 1. Of the Papists, who al¦leage for to∣kens of the true Church Anti∣quitie, Vnitie, Vni∣uersali∣tie, Succes∣sion, Mira∣cles. Reue∣lations. But these are not so, Because theie are not deriued from the verie nature of the Church, but are meerelie external. Because they are tokens aswel of the false, as of the true Church. Because theie are not good, except there be warran∣ted by the worde of God. Because it was fore tolde by the Spirit of God, that the com∣ming of Anti∣christ should be with all power, signes, and lieng wonders, &c. 2. Thes. 2, 9, &c. 2. Of some, which make dis¦cipline, and that their owne too, such an essentiall argu∣ment of the visible Church, as theie thinke where that is not, though both the Word, and the Sacraments be rect¦lie ministred and receaued, there 1. The Magistrates are Tyrants. 2. The Ministers are false prophets 3. No Church of God is. 4. Antichristianitie doth reigne.

7. Iustly is the Church of Rome condē∣ned of vs, and of al re∣formed Chur∣ches. Because not on∣lie it hath er∣red, but stil cur∣sedly doth offend 1. In life. for there The harlot hath a better life, Than she that is a Romans wife. Al things are vendible. A man may be what he wil, sauing a godly man. 2.
