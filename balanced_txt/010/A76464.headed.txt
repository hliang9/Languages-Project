The Best Nevvs from York, that ever came to the two Cities of London and Westminster. WHeareas some malignant Parties have (with specious shewes and pretences of Loyaltie) made the hearty and unfaigned love and fide∣lity of thi Honourable Citie of London to the Kings Maiestie not so well confided in as formerly, to the withdrawing of the Kings sacred Person, whose presence did like the Sun in the Celesti∣all Orbe, give radiant and vivificating splendor to this great Metropolis: and seeing that in his Maiesties absence, there hath been such a generall decay of Trading, and a cessation of all Manifactures, whereby the common sort of People have beene exposed to much necessity, and having wanted meanes and maintenanee for their present subsisting, although this in it selfe considered can have relation to no other cause, but from the Kings pleasure to transport his Person to Yorke, besides the impression of feares and iealousies which have tooke pos∣session not onely in the mind of the weakest, but in the cogi∣tation of those of cleere apprehensions and sound iudgements, that the alienation of mutuall affection and confidence be∣tweene the King and his great Counsell can produce nothing but a distraction in the Kingdome, and such effects as they are
affraid to mention or behold with their understanding, but through the prospect of precedent times, as in the Reigne of Richard the Third, when there was such a great disaffection and contestation betweene the King and his Parliament. The face of the Times being growne pallid with care and unutte∣rable griefe and discontent to discerne with an Ataxie and dis∣order in the harmonious concord of the happy Goernment of this Kingdome perturbed by some malicious Machiavells, and pernitious Councellors: And whereas the King hath im∣mur'd and clouded Himselfe from reflecting on his Sou∣therne Subiects with his usuall and comfortable beames of favour, to the discouragement of his great and Honoura∣ble Counsell of PARLIAMENT, and the encouragement of the bloody, superstitious, and execrable Rebells in Ire∣land, who daly comit most inhumain massacres on the Prote∣stants, and besides where there hath beene such a continuall in∣tercourse of Declarations continually imprinted and published to vindicate the Kings Maiesty from all aspersions of any sini∣ster intent in raising any Armes in the North, or to have any Designe against his loyall People and Integrious Parliament, though his preparation of Ammunition and Forces indeavored to perswade the hearts and affections of his People to the con∣trary. It hath now pleased God by whose diuine providence the Circumvolutions of all terrene sublunary maters is turned about to the manifestation of his love and favour to this Na∣tion, and to the expression of his owne mighty Power, to worke an unexpected alteration in the Kings Heart and In∣tentions. For, whereas before hee had beene often sollicited by ma∣ny and sundry humble Petitions that it would please his Ma∣iesty to accord with his Parliaments proceedings, and to soli∣citate & make happy his Subiects by affording them the graci∣ous possession and fruition of his presence, by returning to his
loyall City of London disconsolate in his long discontinu∣ance from thence, Hee is now by the earnest advice and per∣swasion of some great Personages won and enclined to prove and demonstrate by reall actions that which so long and with so many reiterated Declarations hee hath so often professed; namely, the mainteining the true Protestant Religion and the peaceable Government of this Kingdome, according to the Fundamentall Lawes thereof, and hereupon having ta∣ken matters deeply into his consideration, and weighed in the Ballance of Iustice and Iudgement the great hazzard he should runn by engaging this Land into the combustions of a ciuill discord so much desired by the Malignant party and now fully beleeveing that the Love of his loyall Subiects is the strongest gurd of defence that can be raised both for security of his own Royall Person, and the prosperity of his Realmes and Domi∣nions; His Maiesty haveing duely considered these aforesaid reasons, if fully and absolutely determined forthwith to relin∣qish the the City of Yorke, and all his former Intentions of raising Armes, whereby his Loyall Southerne Subiects were instigated nourish many iust feares and Iealousies of the event and pupose in raising such unnecessary Forces, and to give their mindes more Large and Satisfactory contentment, hee is gratiously resolved to take off all disguises of war which did so disanimate and affright his Loving Subiects, and make it appeare by actuall Declarations that hee will endeavour to assimilate his Royall Father of blessed Memory, and to shew himselfe as hee is in his owne gracious thoughts a peaceable and pious King, and for the further conformation hereof, hee is purposed forthwith to renovate the Ioy and happines of this distracted discontented City, and to give them a testi∣mony to secure their present feares, by his gracious returning and coming back to the City of London, that so the rumors and reports of any Warrlik actions and designes may bee ex∣tirpated
and suppressed, all matters setled in a quiet and peace∣able condition by his gratious and loving corespondence with his loyall Parliament and People who are ready to hazard their lives and fortunes for his Maiesties safety and protection; and this concurrence in affection with his Parliament and people will no doubt bee the impulsive cause to produce many happy and auspitious effects: for as his Maiesties returning to Lon∣don will be a great ioy and consolation to all his faithfull and affectionate Subiects, so will it be a disanimation to the ma∣lignant party, when they shall perceive that all their evill councells hatched with such profound pollicy, and grounded on nefarious Principles cannot produce such a disturbance to the Common-wealth as they coniectured, nor detaine the Kings Maiestie in the Northerne parts by irritating and provoking His gracious disposition to confront and op∣pose His People and Parliament; who doe and ever shall account it the Highest and Noblest end of their endeavours, to shew their willingnesse and alacrity in obeying and ser∣ving the Kings Maiesties iust and Legall commands, nei∣ther can they conceive and imagine a greater and fuller ioy, exhilirating and swelling into an exultation of glad∣nesse, then when they apprehend what felicity the Kings Ma∣iesties most gratious Vnion and correspondent relation with his Parliament may opperate in the affections of his Subiect, and the felicitating of many great Affaires, which now bleed for want of expedition and due prosecution it being a ve∣ritie as well in Politicall matters as Morall, that where there is no progression in State matters, there must needes bee a re∣gression. And besides these aspicious effects, which would result by the Kings Maiesties gracious conversion to his Parliament, and reversion, or returning again to his City of London; what sublimated Speech or high expressions of the most refined
mellifluous Oratory, can delineate those earnest desires which doe enflame the affections of the Citizens to behold the ani∣mable and gracious aspect of his Maiesty, in whose counte∣nance fiercenesse and Maiesty are mixt together, to attract good subiects to an humble familiarity, and to strike a terror into the bad: If there bee great demonstrations of ioy and excessive reioycing when friends long divided and separated, doe by the indulgence of Fortune occurre and meet againe, or when friends are alienated in affection, if after their reconci∣liation, their combination in love grow the stronger, may it not hence much more bee concluded, that the Kings Maie∣sties long absence from the City of London, shall make the City more ioyfull for his returne: while their hearts make loud acclamations of reioycing for his forsaking Yorke, as he intends to doe, and comming to London. For the Kings Maiesty is (as it were) the Cripheus and Sun of Maiesty, that doth warn and cherish the hearts of his sub∣iects with his presence, and therefore it is no wonder that the City of London doth with such ardency of affection desire to be sensible of the animating beames of his favour, at a meere distance; and that Yorke might not surfeit with his liberall benignity, and continuall residence, while London the anci∣ent Seat of the Kings and Princes of this Land is left forsaken by his Maiesty, then which there can be no greater griefe; for they knowing their loyall intentions to his Maiesty, to equi∣perate, if not exceed any of his loyall Subiects, cannot chuse but be much disanimated by the Kings Maiesties sequestring himselfe from his ancient Court of residence; but now after mture deliberation and earnest perswasion, his Maiesty is fully resolved to give such countenance to his subiects of the City of London, as their demerits in all age for their loyal∣tie and fidelitie hath deserved, and to shew that his with draw∣ing himselfe from London, was rather the effect of evill coun∣sell
then any distrust or certainty conceived against them grounded vpon any apprehension feares, grounded vpon any tumultuary carriage or demeanor at Westminster, his Maiesty, his Maiesty, in token of hearty reconciliation to his Parli∣ament and People, and thereof is purposed with all expedi∣tion possible to revisit the City of London. And thereby give them ample testimony and confirmation, that regnantiam ira amoris redinte gratio est, the absence of Kings renovates the af∣fection of Subiects, and makes their returne more welcome, there being nothing more desired then His Maiesties returne to London. The Queenes Letter. ROyall SIR, Though I have beene a long time absent from you in Person, yet am I still and ever will be present with You in affection. No distance of place can divide our hearts, nor any length of time can lessen the reall and unfaigned love that is equall betweene us. My hearts desire is to see You, and once more to behold a happy Vnion betweene Your Maje∣stie and your Parliament. FINIS.
