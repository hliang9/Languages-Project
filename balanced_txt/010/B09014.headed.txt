royal coat of arms W R HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE DIEV ET MON DROIT Anno Decimo Gulielmi III. Regis. An ACT for Confirming and Establishing the Administra∣tion of the Goods and Chattels of Sir William Godol∣phin Knight, deceased. MOST humbly shew unto Your most Excellent Majesty, Your most Dutiful Subjects, Francis Godolphin Esq; and Charles Godolphin Esq; and Elizabeth his Wife (Your said Suppli∣ants Francis Godolphin, and Elizabeth the Wife of the said Charles Godolphin, being Administrators of the Goods and Chattels of Sir William Godolphin Kt. deceased) That divers good Laws have been made to prevent the Con∣veying Estates of the Subjects of this Realm for the Maintenance and Support of Superstitious Uses. And whereas Sir William Godolphin Kt. a Subject of this Your Majesties Kingdom of England, who Lived at Madrid in the Kingdom of Spain, being there surrounded by Fryers, Priests and Jesuits as he lay Bedrid, was influenced to consent to an Act before a Publick Notary, on or about the Thirtieth of March, One thousand six hundred ninety six, whereby it was signified, that Four Persons named therein (viz.) Don Mathias de Escolar Abbot of the Basillians, Geronimo Guerrero Procurator General of the Jesuits, Don Balthasar de Cabredo a Secular Priest, and Don Antonio de Cendoya a Lawyer, should be his Te∣stamentarios, which Designation is thus explained in the Instrument (viz.) To the end that as soon as he the said Sir William Godolphin departed out of this Life, they should Make and Constitute his Last Will and Testament, expressing therein the Gifts, Legacies, Foundations of Memories, Good-works, Patronages and other Dis∣positions which he the said Sir William had Communicated to them, to be disposed of in such Manner and Form as should appear to them the said Testamentarios, to be most Requisite and Convenient, giving to each of the said Four a Legacy in the said Instrument, and certain Sums for Superstitious Uses, adding Two other per∣sons (viz.) Francis Arthur and Bruno Bernardo de Quiros, to be joyned with the former Four, to Execute the Will which should be made after his death by the said Four for the Good of his Soul, which was declared his Universal Heir in the said Instrument, thereby Revoking, Disannulling and Making Void all other Wills, Codicils, Powers to make Wills, or any Dispositions, which he the said Sir William Godolphin might have made heretofore either by Word or Writing, or in any o∣ther Form, to the end they might have no Force, nor avail in any Court of Ju∣stice or otherwise, and desiring that Power should be fulfilled and executed, and the Will which should be made pursuant thereunto, as his last and determined Will, in such Form as might make it most available in Law. And whereas after the passing the said Notarial Act, (viz.) about the latter end of June in the same year,
the said Sir William Godolphin proposing to make his Last Will Nuncupative or Te∣stamentary Disposition, did then declare several Legacies he would give to cer∣tain of his Relations in England, which Legacies were by his order set down in W iting, and Read to, and Acknowledged by him to be his Last Will, and which has been since proved by the Oaths of Three Witnesses, Sworn by Commission out of the Prerogative Court of Canterbury, and Administration of all the Goods of the said Sir William Godolphin granted to the Two Principal Legatees, viz. Francis Godolphin and Elizabeth Wife of Charles Godolphin (being also the only surviving persons next of Kin, in equal degree to the said Sir William Godolphin) with the said Testamentary Disposition annexed in the Words following: (viz.) Memo∣randum, That in or about the latter end of June or beginning of July, in the year of our Lord, One thousand six hundred ninety six, Sir William Godolphin Kt. then residing at Madrid in the Kingdom of Spain, and in the place of his usual ha∣bitation there, being then sick of the sickness whereof he Died, but being of sound and perfect Memory, having an Intent to declare and make his Last Will Nuncupative or Testamentary Disposition, did order and direct Don Anto∣nio Cendoya to put down in Writing these following Legacies to be the Gifts, Le∣gacies and Bequests of him the said Sir William Godolphin, in that his last Will; and the said Sums of Money and Legacies were accordingly wrote down, at the Will and Request of Sir William Godolphin by the abovesaid Don Antonio Cendoya, and afterwards the said Writing, which contained and Specified the several Gifts and Legacies following, was Read to the said Sir William Godol∣phin, and Approved and Declared by him to be his Last Will; the which Gifts, Legacies and Bequests above mentioned, which Sir William Godolphin owned to be his Last Will, are as follows, (viz.) Imprimis he Gave and Bequeath∣ed to his Nephew Francis Godolphin Esquire, all his Lands in England, and also to his said Nephew Francis Godolphin Seven thousand Pounds Sterling, besides to each of his Four Children, viz. One Son and Three Daughters, One thousand Pounds Sterling: Also he gave to his Neece Mistress Elizabeth Godolphin, Wife to the Honourable Charles Godolphin Esquire, Four thousand Pounds Sterling, and likewise to the said Charles Godolphin her Husband, One thousand Pounds Sterling; and to his Uncle Master Francis Bluet Two hundred Pounds Sterling. All which Last Will, Gifts and Bequests were Wrote down and Read to the said Sir William Godolphin in the Spanish Tongue, and were Approved, Agreed unto, and Owned by him as his Last Will in the Spanish Tongue; likewise in the Presence of us who were desired to take Notice thereof: All which we Testifie upon Oath, Witness our Hands this Eighteenth day of September (New Stile) Anno Domini, One thousand six hundred ninety six, Thomas Gray, John March, Lewis Cavelero; Sworn, Signed and Executed in Presence of us William Thomas, Jezreel Jones, Samuel Allston. And whereas according to the Laws of this Realm, no Man can give Power or Authority to another, to make his Will for him after his Death; And if it were otherwise, the Estates of such of His Majesties Subjects, who-should happen to dye beyond the Seas, would run great Hazard of being Alienated from the right Heirs and Relations of the said Persons, under Co∣lour of such delegated Authority; and yet nevertheless forasmuch as some Per∣sons who have been Trusted in the Management of the said Sir William Godol∣phin's Estate in England, have with several others Imployed therein beyond the Seas, used great endeavours to set up the said Notarial Act, and a Pretended Will or Disposition, made, or supposed to be made after the said Sir William Godolphin's Death, under Colour of the same. And whereas by such Pretext, the Le∣gal Administrators of the said Sir William Godolphin have been hitherto delayed, and hindred in Recovering his Estate, whereby to discharge the several Legacies in the said Testamentary Disposition, as well as to Possess themselves of the Residuary Part, which being not otherwise disposed of by the said Sir William in his Life time, of Right belongs to them as next of Kin. For Remedy therefore in the Premisses, may it please Your most Excellent Majesty, that it may be Enacted and Declared: And be it Enacted and Declared by the Kings most Excellent Majesty, ☞ by and with the Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and the Commons in this present Parliament Assembled, and by the Authority of the same, That the Clauses in the said Notarial Act of the Thirtieth of March, One thousand six hundred ninety six, whereby any Powers or Authorities are pretended to be given to the persons in the said Notarial Act Named, or any of them, or any others, to make the said Sir William Godolphin's Will after his Death are Null and Void, and shall be Deemed and Taken to be Void and of none Effect; And that the other Clauses in the same Notarial Act mentioned, whereby the said Sir William Godolphin Declares his Soul his Universal Heir, are likewise Null, Void and of none Effect in Law.
