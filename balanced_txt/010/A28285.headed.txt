THE Longitude not found: OR, AN ANSWER TO A TREATISE, Written By Henry Bond Senior, shewing a way to find the LONGITUDE BY THE Magnetical Inclinatory NEEDLE. WHEREIN Is proved, That the LONGITUDE is not, nor cannot be found by the Magnetical Inclinatory NEEDLE. By Peter Blackborrow, Gent. Licensed March 14. 1677/8. Ro. L'Estrange. LONDON, Printed for Robert Harford, at the Sign of the Angel in Cornhil, near the Royal Exchange. 1678.
THE PREFACE. WHen I first met with Mr. Bond's Book, I was in good hope to have found the Work answerable to the Ti∣tle, the Author being reputed (not without de∣sert) skilful in Mathematical Learning: But when I found his Doctrine want De∣monstration, (an Excellency in the Mathe∣maticks above all other Sciences Inseparable, for what is Truth therein, may always be demonstrated to be so) I began to doubt that (instead of so useful a Discourse, as he pre∣tended to) he might not only be deceived himself, but might also mislead others in the search thereof. This made me take upon me the Exami∣nation
of the Work, which I profess to have done with that care and integrity, which is necessary in such an Ʋndertaking: And I do unfeignedly declare, that I am sorry (for the Authors sake) to find his Propositions unsound, and his Examples incertain. But let Truth be always True, the whole Founda∣tion of his Work is only an Airy Imaginati∣on, and the Superstructure is made up of false Suppositions, and impossible Conclusions. A short Prospect whereof I have inserted here (for instant sake) from his own Exam∣ples, leaving the fuller Demonstration there∣of to the ensuing Treatise. First, the Author pretends, that the Mag∣netical Poles are distant from the Poles of the Earth, by an Oblique Angle; which Angle is proved to be a false supposition, and cannot be demonstrated upon the Globe. But if it should be granted him, that the Magnetick Pole were 8 d. 30 m. from the Pole of the Earth, in the year 1580. then it is proved that the Magnetical Poles are found to be so by the Variation that was at Vaygats, and London in the year 1580. So that the Mag∣netical Pole must be as various as the Varia∣tion;
in regard it cannot be found without it. Then the Caroline Table being Calculated by the distance of the Magnetical Poles, from the Poles of the Earth, is useless, in regard it is proved, that the Magnetick Pole is as various as the Variation. And in the next place the Author pretends to find, that the Magnetical Pole of the Me∣ridian of London, is gone to the Eastwards from his Observation made at Ballasore; and here he produceth the Longitude by the Practical Part of the Mathematicks at Sea by Journal, to correct his Observations by the Inclinatory Needle. Mr. Bond begs the Question: Let the Angle W P N be 6 d. 00 m. that the Magnetical Meridian is gone to the Eastward, when it is proved to be 37 d. 59 m. So likewise in the case of Cape Charles, and in the Straits of Magellan (and all places Westwards of the Meridian of the Lizard.) Mr. Bond begs the Question: Let S K P F represent the Meridian of the Lizard, which is 4 d. 12 m. to the Eastwards of the Mag∣netical Colure, as appears by his Demonstra∣tion, which Angle at Cape Charles, is found
to be above 50 d. and not 4 d. 12 m. and the Angle at the Straits at Magellan, is found to be above 38 d. 00 m. and not 4 d. 12 m. I have omited to put down Mr. Bond's De∣monstration to prove his Errors, in regard it would produce many Cuts: but those that would be better satisfied, may take the same Method I used in the Case of Ballasore, where Mr. Bond says let the Angle W P N be 6 d. that the Magnetick Pole is gone from the Meridian of London; when the Angle is proved to be 37 d. 59 m. And farther it is proved, where two places differing in Latitude, under one and the same Meridian of the Earth, that the Angle at the Pole doth alter, whereas all places, under one and the same Meridian, have one and the same Longitude. And whereas Mr. Bond has altered the Meridian of the Azores, and has made Lon∣don the Meridian, from whence Longitude shall begin at: Longitude 00 d. 00 m. It is proved from Mr. Bond's own Observation, that London should have Longitude. Then the Magnetical Inclinatory Needle is not in proportion to the Meridian of London, or
any certain Meridian of the Earth. And last of all, the Author supposeth the Magnetical Poles in the Air, some small distance from the Earth, which (as he says) may be a great reason of the Motion of the Earth, and to that end, he has drawn his Spheres accordingly: But I have proved that Mr. Bond's Question between Ballasore and London, is to be demonstrated from the Globe of the Earth: So that all Questions that have the like Matter, have the like Demon∣stration: then why should we fancy the Mag∣netick Poles in the Air? And farther I have added a small Trea∣tise, proving by several Observations, and Demonstrations, that the Earth is the Center of the Starry Heaven; and that it has no Motion upon its Axis; and for any one to pretend the Earth to have a Motion from West to East, it is only imagination; for there is no Observation to prove it. I know there are many men of a contrary opinion; but I would have such men to produce Obser∣vation and Demonstration to prove the con∣trary. I shall say no more in this place, but refer
to the Work it self; where if I have also erred, I shall gladly receive admonition from the Learned; but if I have not, I hope my Na∣tive Country will not take it unkindly, that I have discovered a dangerous Error, which (if followed, and relyed upon) would have been of fatal Consequence. Peter Blackborrow.
THE LONGITUDE Not found by the Inclinatory Needle. In Answer to Mr. Bonds first Question, in finding the Distance between London and Vaygats; and from thence to find the Di∣stance of the Magnetical Pole, from the Pole of the Earth. LOndon Latitude 51 d. 32 m. North, London Longitude 00 d. 00 m. Vaygats Latitude 70 d. 00 m. North, Longitude 58 d. 00 m. Westwards of the Meridian of London, to find the Distance between London and Vaygats L V, and the Angle P L V, and the Angle P V L. In this Triangle we have P L, the Co-latitude of London 38 d. 28 m. and P V, the Co-latitude of Vaygats 20 d.
00 m. And the Angle L P V 58 d. 00 m. the difference of Longitude by Journal between Vaygats and London; to find L V, the Distance 31 d. 57 m. and the Angle P L V, 33 d. 14 m. and the Angle P V L 94 d. 30 m. And from the Angle L P V, Mr. Bond draws an Arch as P M V, and makes that an Angle of 8 d. 38 m & the An∣gle P, M, V, L, an Angle of 85 d. 52 m. and then Mr. Bond draws another Arch as L M, and makes the Angle P L M, an An∣gle of 11 d. 15 m. and the Angle M L V, an Angle of 21 d. 59 m. Here place the first Figure. If Mr. Bond would make it a proporti∣on in his Angle to draw two Arches from the Pole of the Earth, unto the Meridian, and Parallel of Vaygats; as P V, and P M V, then he should have drawn another Arch in∣to the Meridian and Parallel of London; from the Pole of the Earth, besides that of P L. For as Mr. Bond would separate the Va∣riation of Vaygats 8 d. 38 m. from the An∣gle
geometrical diagram Fig. 1
P V L 94 d. 30 m. and make the An∣gle P M V, 8 d. 38 m. and the Angles P M, V, L 85 d. 52 m. by another Arch from the Pole of the Earth. So likewise should Mr. Bond have sepa∣rated the Variation of London 11 d. 15 m. by another Arch from the Pole of the Earth into the Meridian, and Parallel of London at L, in regard the matter given requires the same Demonstration. And whereas Mr. Bond draws two Ar∣ches from the Pole of the Earth, unto the Meridian, and Parallel of Vaygats; it is very improper, for no Arch can be drawn from the Pole of the Earth unto the Meri∣dian, and Parallel of Vaygats; but what was drawn from the Pole, as P V 20 d. 00 m. the Co-latitude of Vaygats, which Arch is the nearest Distance unto the Pole of the Earth. And for the Arch P M V, it makes a greater Distance than the Co-latitude of Vaygats, by 00 d. 18 m. therefore Mr. Bonds Angle is a false Supposition, for one and the same Meridian and Parallel of the Earth, can have but one Arch or Meridian
from the Pole of the Earth, and that is the nearest Distance. But Mr. Bonds pretence is to find the Distance of the Magnetical Poles, from the Pole of the Earth; and he saith, in the year 1580, the Variation was 11 d. 15 m. at London, and at Vaygats 8 d. 38. m. and the Co-latitude at London 38 d. 28 m. and the Co-latitude at Vaygats 20 d. 00 m. and the Difference of Longitude 58 d. 00 m. So from hence it may be observed, that the Distance of the Magnetical Pole, from the Pole of the Earth, is found, from the Vari∣ation that was at London, and Vaygats in the year 1580. So that the Magnetick Pole must be as various as the Variation, in regard it cannot be found without it. Mr. Bond had better to have begg'd the Question, let the Magnetical Poles be Di∣stant 8 d. 30 m. from the Pole of the Earth: For his Angle cannot be demonstrated up∣on the Globe.
geometrical diagram Fig: 2.
In Answer unto Mr. Bonds Question, be∣tween Ballasore and London. I Sail from the Meridian and Parallel of London South-West-wards of Good-hope, and then North-East-wards into North Latitude 22 d. 30 m. the Magnetical La∣titude or Inclination 32 d. 10 m. the Magnetical Co-latitude in the Caroline Table 72 d. 33 m. and the Distance of the Magnetical Pole from the Pole of the Earth 8 d. 30 m. I demand how far the Mag∣netical Meridian is East or West of the Meridian of London? Here place the second Figure. To Demonstrate this Sphere upon the Globe. THe Brass Meridian, in which the Globe moves, is the Meridian of London; so bring any Meridian upon the
Globe to the Brass Meridian; and from the Poles make a Mark upon the Meridian of the Globe, just under 8 d. 30 m. of the Brass Meridian, for the Magnetick Pole. So take 72 d. 33 m. the Magnetick Pole Distant from the Parallel of 22 d. 30 m. No Latitude from the Equator; and fix one point of your Compasses in the Mag∣netical Pole 8 d. 30 m. turning the Globe Eastwards, until 72 d. 33 m. will cut in the Parallel of Ballasore 22 d. 30 m. just under the Brass Meridian of the Globe, so make a Mark, and let the Globe stand, then is L N the Magnetick Pole Distant from the Meridian of London 72 d. 33 m. and L S is the Co-latitude of Ballasore 67 d. 30 m. and N S is the Distance of the Magnetical Pole, from the Pole of the Earth 8 d. 30 m. and the Angle L S N, is what the Magne∣tick Meridian is gone from the Brass Me∣ridian, or the Meridian of London, and I D is the Magnetick Latitude 32 d. 10 m. and L A is the Latitude of Ballasore 22 d. 30 m. By this Demonstration you may see the Distance of the Magnetick Poles, and the
Magnetick Co-latitude, and the Co-lati∣tude of the Place will hold their De∣monstrations in Proportion to the Poles of the Earth; then why should we fancy the Magnetick Poles in the Air? Upon the Sphere M, Q, N, O is the Me∣ridian of the Magnetick Poles, and Q O is the Magnetick Equator, and E W is the Equator to the Poles of the Earth, and M L N is the Magnetick Meridian, crossing the Brass Meridian, or the Meridian of London, in the Parallel of 22 d. 30 m. So is S N the Magnetick Pole Distant from the Poles of the Earth, and L S is the Co-la∣titude of Ballasore, and N L is the Magne∣tick Pole Distant from the Meridian of London 72 d. 33 m. in the Parallel of 22 d. 30 m. and S L P is the Meridian of London, and not the Meridian of Ballasore, yet I place L in the Parallel of Ballasore, in the Meridian of London, in regard I did take the Inclination of the Inclinatory Needle in that Parallel. For it is supposed, if I would find the Difference of Longitude from London; I have Sailed into unknown Parts, and ob∣serve
and find my Latitude, and my Mag∣netick Latitude; and now I would find how far I am East or West of the Meridi∣an of London: So I ought not to say S L P, is the Meridian of Ballasore, in regard I am to find it; but to make S L P the Me∣ridian of London, from whence I came; so the Magnetick Co-latitude will be in pro∣portion to what the Magnetick Meridian I am in, is from the Meridian of Lon∣don. So is L S the Co-latitude of Ballasore 67 d. 30 m. in the Meridian of London; and S N, the Distance of the Magnetick Pole, ftom the Pole of the Earth 8 d. 30 m. And L N is the Magnetick Co-lati∣tude 72 d. 33 m. Now the Angle at the Pole N S L, will be found 125 d. 00 m. that the Magnetick Meridian of Bal∣lasore is, from the Meridian of Lon-don Eastwards, which should be the Magnetick Meridian of Ballasore at B, from the Me∣ridian of London L, the complement of 125 d. 00 m. out of 180 d. is the Angle A S W 55 d. 00 m. that the Magnetick Me∣ridian is West of the Meridian of London.
The Angle is drawn from the Sphere: the Work follows. geometrical diagram Fig: 3   d. m.   LN, 72 33   NS, the residuum Sine 08 30 083029 SL, the residuum Sine 67 30 003438 The Sum of the sides 148 33   The half Sum 74 16½   The Sine of the first difference 65 56 995993 The Sine of the second difference 6 46 907124 The Sum     1989584 The half Sum     994792
994792 the sine thereof is 62 d. 30 m. the double thereof is 125 d. 00 m. the An∣gle at the Pole of the Earth N S L, which should be the Difference of Longitude: But since Mr. Bond makes London the first Meridian, from whence Longitude shall take its beginning, as in the Question be∣fore, Ballasore should have Longitude 125 d. 00 m. East of the Meridian of London; let the Table of Longitude say what it will, for the Table of Longitudes is no other than the difference of Meridians by Jour∣nal: But if I find the difference of Longi∣tude by the Magnetick Co-latitude, and the distance of the Magnetick Pole, and the Co-latitude of the place, it should correct what has been laid down by Jour∣nal; for I do not take what has been laid down by Journal to be true, in regard there is no certain Observation to lead us to it: For if London be not the Meridian, from whence the Magnetick Co-latitude takes its beginning towards the Magnetick Poles; then the distance of the Magnetick Meridian from the Meridian of London, cannot give the difference of Meridians.
Mr. Bonds way to prove what the Mag∣netick Meridian is gone to the Eastwards, is thus: First, he knows his Magnetick Co-latitude at Ballasore, and the Co-la∣titude of the place, and the distance of the Magnetick Pole; and so finds the di∣stance of the Magnetick Meridian, from the Meridian of London 125 d. 00 m. so then finding 125 d. 00 m. doth not an∣swer the Longitude by Journal; he pro∣ceeds to find what the Magnetick Meridi∣an is gone to the Eastwards: thus, he gives the Co-latitude, and the distance of the Magnetick Pole, and the Longitude by Journal 119 d. 12 m. and to this he adds 6 d. which makes 125 d. 12 m. the distance of the Magnetick Meridian, to find the Magnetick Co-latitude: This is but turning the Question. So that you must know your Longitude by Journal 119 d. 12 m. before you can find what the Magnetick Meridian is gone to the Eastwards. Mr. Bonds way is thus: Substract 119 d. 12 m. the Longitude by Journal, from 125 d. 12 m. the distance of the Magne∣tick
Meridian, from the Meridian of Lon∣don, and you have 6 d. 00 m. that the Magnetick Meridian is gone to the East∣wards: So by this Mr. Bond produced the Longitude by Journal, to correct the distance of the Magnetick Meridian, from the Meridian of London. Mr. Bond must know that Longitude by Journal in all the World is laid down by Judgement; and then how rare is it for any one man, who hath been at any one Port in the World, somewhat remote, that hath found it in the very same Meridian, in regard of the many accidents that at∣tend the Practical part of the Mathematicks at Sea? And then how is it possible to know the Longitude I am in, by the distance of the Magnetick Meridian? If I must first know the Longitude by Journal, which I cannot prove to be certain, and so correct the Observation by it, so that by this way of practice, the Inclinatory Needle is of no use; for the Magnetick Latitude, with the other proportions before, should give the Longitude without the help
of a Journal to correct his Observa∣tion. The next thing we are further to consi∣der of is, how Mr. Bond finds what the Magnetick Meridian is gone to the East∣wards of Ballasore. We may observe from Mr. Bonds own Sphere and Words; let the Angle W P N, be 6 d. 00 m. but this Angle W P N is not to be passed by, with a let it be so; but it must be found in proportion to the several sides, and Angles given in the Sphere. First I shall give the Co-latitude of Ballasore 67 d. 30 m. P B, and the Angle B P N 125 d. 12 m. and the Mag∣netick Co-latitude 72 d. 33 m. to find the Angle P N B.
Now to find the Angle P N B. geometrical diagram Fig: 4       d. m. As the Sine of the side NB, 997953 72 33 Is to the Sine of the Angle N P B, 991229 54 48 So is the Sine of the Side P B, 996561 67 30 To the Sine of the Angle P N B, 989837 52 19 So the Angle P N B, is found to be 52 d. 19 m.
Now let fall the Perpendicular in the foregoing Angle, as P W; so with the An∣gle W N P 52 d. 19 m. and the side P N 8 d. 30 m. we are to find the Angle W P N, which Mr. Bond saith, let it be 6 d. 00 m. The Work follows. geometrical diagram Fig: 5.     d. m.   As the Sine of P Q, 81 30 999520 Is to the Tangent of Q T, 37 41 988785 So is the Radius P A, 90 00 1000000 To the Tangent of A. g. 37 59 989265 So that A. g. 37 d. 59 m. is equal to the Angle A. P. g. or to the Angle W P N, 37 d. 59 m. de∣manded.
Now in the foregoing Angle, substract the Angle W P N, 37 d. 59 m. out of the Angle N P B 125 d. 12 m. and you have the Angle W P B, 87 d. 13 m. And from hence it may be observed, that the Angle W P N, is 37 d. 59 m. and not 6 d. 00 m. that the Magnetick Meridian is gone to the Eastward, and the Angle W P B, is 87 d. 13 m. and not 119 d. 12 m. by Journal. So that Mr. Bond has committed a gross error in offering to beg the Question; let the Angle W. P. N. be 6 d. 00 m. and the Angle W P B, be 119 d. 12 m. when it is contrary to all Demonstration and Practice in the Mathematicks, as it is proved in the foregoing Question. So that by Mr. Bond's Practice, he would make the Longitude by Journal to be the certain difference of Meridians, since he corrects his Observation, from the Longi∣tude by Journal, by substracting 6 d. 00 m. from the Angle at the Pole 125 d. 12 m. to make it equal to the Longitude by Jour∣nal 119 d. 12 m. and then what need is there of finding the Longitude by the In∣clinatory
geometrical diagram Fig: 6.
Needle, when it is found by Journal, or to find what the Magnetick Meridian is gone to the Eastwards, when we have it by imagination; let the Angle W P N be 6 d. 00 m. that the Magnetick Pole is gone from the Meridian of London, when it is 37 d. 59 m. The Sphere on the other side, is ac∣cording to Mr. Bonds own De∣monstration, to prove the fore∣going Work. Here place the Sixth Figure. And before I proceed any further, I shall make one Observation between the Me∣ridian of London and Bourdeaux. Bour∣deaux being but 20 Minutes Eastwards of the Meridian of London: See Mr. Bonds Tables of Longitude. The Magnetical Latitude 69 d. 26 m. Bourdeaux Latitude N° 45 d. 16 m. the
Magnetick Co-latitude 36 d. 54 m. the di∣stance of the Magnetick Pole, from the Pole of the Earth 8 d. 30 m. to find the Angle of the Pole of the Earth. The Demonstration of this Sphere upon the Globe, is according to my former. Here place the seventh Figure.   d. m.   N L, 36 54   S N, the residuum Sine 08 38 083029 L S, the residuum Sine 44 50 015178 The Sum of the Sides 90 14   The half Sum of the Sides 45 07   The Sine of the first Difference 36 37 977558 The Sine of the second Difference 00 17 769417 The Sum     1845182 The Sine of the half Sum 09 41 922591 Which 9 d. 41 m. being doubled, you have 19 d. 22 m. for the Angle at the Pole
geometrical diagram Fig: 7
of the Earth, then substract 6 d. from it, as in the case of Ballasore, Bourdeaux be∣ing Eastward of the Meridian of London, and you have 13 d. 22 m. for the difference of Longitude, between London and Bourde∣aux, which is 13 d. 00 m. more than the truth by Journal. See in Mr. Bonds Tables of Longitude. And from hence you may observe, that the Magnetical Needle, or Inclinatory Needle, cannot give the Magnetical La∣titude in proportion to any one Meridian of the Earth. In Answer to Mr. Bond's Question, upon Cape Charles, comparing it with the new Isle of Providence in the same Meri∣dian. FIrst, of Cape Charles Latitude 37 d. 39 m. the distance of the Magnetick Pole, from the Pole of the Earth 8 d. 30 m. the Magnetick Co-latitude 49 d. 18 m.
to find how far the Magnetick Meridians are East and West of the Meridian of London. The Demonstration of this Question upon the Globe, is the same way as in the first Question. Here place the eighth Figure. M Q N O, is the Meridian of the Mag∣netick Pole, and S N is the distance of the Magnetick Pole, from the Pole of the Earth 8 d. 30 m. and L S, is the Co-lati∣tude, 52 d. 21 m. And L N is the Mag∣netick Co-latitude 49 d. 18 m. The Work follows.

So the Angle L S N, being found 65 d. 56 m. that the Magnetick Meridian is to the Westward of the Lizard, whose Complement is the Angle L S C 114 d. 04 m. that the Magnetick Meridian is to the Eastward of the Meridian of the Li∣zard. But I observe the Co-latitude of the Magnetick Pole in its proportions, does not make out the Longitude in Mr. Bonds Tables to the Meridian of London by 04 d. 4 m. But, I suppose, Mr. Bond did make
choice of the Meridian of the Lizard to be the Meridian in propotion to the Magneti∣cal Co-latitude at Cape Charles, in re∣gard the Magnetical Co-latitude at Cape Charles, would not give the Magnetical Meridian in proportion to the Meridian of London. And here we are to observe, if the Magnetical Co-latitude, with the other proportions, in one and the same Meridian of the Earth, will not give the fame An∣gle at the Pole in all Parallels, that cross that Meridian, then the Inclinatory Nee∣dle cannot perform the Work of finding the Longitude, in regard you cannot tell where to find the Magnetical Meridian, in proportion to any one Meridian of the Earth. Now we are to prove, that the Angle at the Pole does alter in one and the same Meridian of the Earth, from Mr. Bonds Observations by the Inclinatory Needle, when according to truth every Meridian keeps its Longitude from the Poles in all Parallel.
Cape Charles, and the New Island of Providence, are both under one and the same Meridian. See Mr. Bonds Tables of Longitude 70 d. 00 m. Westward of the Meridian of London. Now suppose I was at the new Island of Providence, and should observe and find it in the Latitude of 25 d. 25 m. N°. and should find the inclination of the Inclina∣tory Needle 48 d. 39 m. and in the Caro∣line Table, the Magnetick Co-latitude 60 d. 24 m. and the Magnetick Pole di∣stant from the Pole of the Earth 8 d. 30 m. to find the Angle at the Pole of the Earth L S N.
geometrical diagram Fig: 9   d. m.   L N, 60 24   S L, the residuum Sine of 64 35 004421 N S, the residuum Sine of 08 30 083029 The Sum of the Sides 133 29   The Sine of the half Sum 66 44½ 996316 The Side opposite to the Angle, substract 60 24   The Sine of the difference 06 20½ 904264 The Sum     1988028 The Sine of the half Sum 60 36 994014 The Complement of 60 d. 36 m. is 29 d. 24 m. the double thereof is 58 d. 48 m. for the Angle at the Pole of the Earth L S N.
Now substract 58 d. 48 m. the Angle at the Pole, that the Magnetick Meridian of New Providence makes with the Meridian of the Lizard, from 65 d. 56 m. the An∣gle at the Pole, that the Magnetical Meri∣dian of Cape Charles, makes with the Me∣ridian of the Lizard, and you have 07 d. 08 m. that the Magnetical Meridians or Angles at the Pole do differ in the same Meridian of Cape Charles, when ac∣cording to truth every Meridian keeps its Longitude from the Poles of the Earth in all Parallels. So that the Magnetical Co-latitude un∣der one and the same Meridian of the Earth, doth alter the Angles at the Pole, and then the Magnetick Co-latitude, un∣der one and the same Meridian of the Earth, is not in proportion to the Meri∣dian of the Lizard, or any certain Meridi∣an of the Earth.
Another Observation between London and Amsterdam, comparing it with Antwerp, being in the same Meridian of Amster∣dam. See Mr. Bonds Tables of Longi∣tude 4. d. 37 m. Eastward of the Meridian of London. AMsterdam Latitude 52 d. 40 m. the Magnetick Latitude 74 d. 22 m. and in the Caroline Table the Magnetick Co∣latitude is 29 d. 16 m. and the distance of the Magnetick Pole, from the Pole of the Earth 8 d. 30 m. to find the Angle of the Pole of the Earth. Here place the tenth Figure. L S, the Co-latitude of Amsterdam, and N L, the Magnetick Colatitude, and S N is the distance of the Magnetick Pole, from the Pole of the Earth. Now suppose I was at Amsterdam, and should observe and find it in the Latitude
geometrical diagram Fig: 10
of 52 d. 40 m. and should find the Incli∣nation or Magnetick Latitude 74 d. 22 m. and in the Caroline Table, the Magne∣tick Co-latitude to be 29 d. 16 m. And the Magnetick Pole distant from the Pole of the Earth 8 d. 30 m. So that by the fol∣lowing Work, I find the Angle of the Pole of the Earth to be 16 d. 30 m. then we are to substract 6 d. 00 m. as in the case of Ballasore, that the Magnetick Meridian (as Mr. Bond saith) is gone to the Eastward, and there remains 10 d. 30 m. for the dif∣ference of Longitude betwen London and Amsterdam: Whereas in Mr. Bonds Ta∣bles of Longitude he makes but 4 d. 37 m. Longitude Eastward of the Meridian of London, which being substracted out of 10 d. 30 d. there remains 5 d. 53 m. over and above the difference of Longitude be∣tween London and Amsterdam: So that the inclination of the Inclinatory Needle, with his Co-latitude, is not in proportion to the Meridian of London, or any certain Meridian of the Earth.

So having found the Angle at the Pole of the Earth, in the Meridian and Parallel of Antwerp to be 12 d. 58 m. I substract 12 d. 58 m. the Angle at the Pole of the Earth, from the Angle at the Pole of the Earth in the Meridian and Parallel of Amsterdam 16 d. 30 m. and there remains 3 d. 32 m. that the Angles at the Pole of of the Earth differ under one and the same Meridian of the Earth. For as all places under one and the same Parallel of the Earth, are in one and the same Latitude,
so have all places under one and the same Meridian of the Earth, the same Longitude from the Azores, or any other Meridian, from whence you will make the difference of Meridians to begin at. So that if there was any truth in the Observation, from the Inclinatory Needle, it should give the Angles alike at the Pole; when you are under one and the same Me∣ridian of the Earth.

the Angle at the Pole of the Earth, so the Angle at the Pole of the Earth is found to be 29 d. 6 m. So I add 4 d. 12 m. as in the Case of Cape Charles. Portsmouth be∣ing West of the Meridian of London, and it gives me 33 d. 18 m. the difference of Longitude between the Meridian of Lon∣don, and Portsmouth. And Mr. Bond makes but 01 d. 00 m. for the difference of their Meridians. See his Tables. Lastly, we may observe from Mr. Bonds Observation taken in London by the Incli∣natory Needle, whether London be the Me∣ridian, from whence the Magnetical Lati∣tude or Inclination, with the Co-latitude in the Caroline Table, and the Co-latitude of London, with the distance of the Mag∣netick Pole, from the Pole of the Earth, will give London to be the Meridian, from whence the Magnetick Co-latitude, with the other proportions, shall give the An∣gle at the Pole of the Earth, to be 6 d. 00 m. that the Magnetick Pole is from the Meridian of London Eastwards, as Mr. Bonds faith in the case of Ballasore. But if the Angle appear to be more or less
than 6 d. then the Inclination of the Incli∣natory Needle, is not in proportion to the Meridian of London; so that London cannot be said to be the Meridian, from whence Longitude shall begin at.

The Complement of 83 d. 51 m. is 6 d. 09 m. the double thereof is 12 d. 18 m. the Angle at the Pole of the Earth L S N. Here place the thirteenth Figure. So is L N, the Magnetick Co-latitude 30 d. 11 m. and L S is the Co-latitude of London 38 d. 28 m. and S N, is the Mag∣netick Pole distant from the Pole of the Earth 8 d. 30 m. so that the Angle at the Pole of the Earth L S N, is found to be 12 d. 18 m. in the Meridian and Parallel of London, then substract 60 d. 00 m. from 12 d. 18 m. as in the case of Ballasore. That Mr. Bond saith the Magnetick Pole is from the Meridian of London, and you have 6 d. 18 m. for the difference of Longitude in the Meridian of London; whereas Mr. Bond saith London has no Longitude: See his Tables. So that Mr. Bond must be under a very great mistake in making the Magnetick Inclination of
the Inclinatory Needle at London, to be in proportion, unto the Meridian of Lon∣don, from whence Longitude shall begin at. When according to his own Observa∣tion by the Inclinatory Needle in Lon∣don, with the Magnetical Colatitude in the Caroline Table, and the Co-latitude of London, and the distance of the Mag∣netick Pole, from the Pole of the Earth, London should have Longitude 6 d. 18 m. having given the Allowance Mr. Bond requires, as in the case of Balla∣sore. The truth is the Inclination of the In∣clinatory Needle, is not in proportion unto the Meridian of London, or any cer∣tain Meridian of the Earth, whereby the difference of the Meridians may be known by the Inclination of the Inclina∣tory Needle. To sum up all; Mr. Bond pretends to find, what the Magnetick Meridian is gone to the Eastward, as in the case of Balla∣sore, by saying let the Angle W P N be 6 d. 00 m. that the Magnetick Pole is from the Meridian of London. Whereas
the Angle W P N, according to the pro∣portions of the Sides and Angles, contained in the Angles P. B N, is 37 d. 59 m. and not 6 d. 00 m. that the Magnetick Pole is gone to the Eastward of the Meridian of London. And the Angle W P B is 87 d. 13 m. and not 119 d. 12 m. by Jour∣nal. Likewise it is proved, that all places in one and the same Meridian of the Earth, do alter their Angles at the Pole, from the Observations of the Inclinatory Needle, when according to truth all places, under one and the same Meridian of the Earth, should make one and the same Angle at the Pole, otherwise the difference of Me∣ridians cannot be found. Likewise it is proved from several places near unto the Meridian of London, and in the Meridian of London, that the Angles at the Pole of the Earth, is no way in pro∣portion unto the Meridian of London, or that London is the Meridian from whence Longitude shall take its beginning in pro∣portion to the Inclination of the Inclina∣tory Needle. So that the Inclination of the
In∣clinatory Needle is no way in proportion unto any certain Meridian of the Earth, from whence all Meridians should take their Distance. For these Reasons the Longitude cannot be found by the Inclinato∣ry Needle.
Here follow Mr. Bonds Caroline Tables of the Complements of the Magnilatitudes to eve∣ry Five Minutes of Inclination of the In∣clinatory Needle, from the Magnequa∣tor unto 84 d 01 m. of Magnilatitude, and 87 d. 00 m. of Inclination.

Longitude 00 00   Inclination 73 47 North. To prove the Earth the Centure of the Star∣ry Heaven, and not to have any Inclinati∣on towards the Poles, as Copernicus would have it. THe Earth by observation keeps its Parallels with the Starry Heaven all the year, with∣out alteration; for by observation, that Star that is in the Equinoctial part of the Heaven, is always in the Equinoctial part of the Earth; so like∣wise, take all the Stars in their s everal Parallels to the Poles from the Equinoctial, and you will find they keep their Parallels with the Earth for ever. We need not go to the Equinoctial part of the
Earth, to prove the Earth to keep her Parallels with the Equinoctial part of the Starry Heaven: For, observe in this Parallel or Latitude of London 51 d. 30 m. the Amplitude of any Star in the E∣quinoctial, either upon his Rising or Setting, and you shal find his Amplitude to be East or West of you for ever, in this Parallel or any other. Likewise observe the Meridian Altitude of any Star in the Equinoctial, in this Parallel or Latitude 51 d. 30 m. and you shall find his Meridian Alti∣tude to be the Elevation of the Equinoctial for ever, in this Parallel or Latitude. And by daily observations we find the Sun to alter his Amplitude, and Meridian Altitudes, and Parallels with the Starry Heaven and Earth. And we find the Starry Heaven to keep his Parallels with the Earth always, in regard the Stars keep their Meridian Altitudes and Amplitudes with the Earth, without alteration. But if we should admit the Sun the Center of the Starry Heaven, and the Earth should have her Declination towards her Poles; then the Sun must be always in the Equinoctial part of the Starry Heaven; and the Sun must have the same Ampli∣tudes, and Meridian Altitudes, with the Stars in the Equinoctial, in all Parallels: And then the Sun, and all the Stars in Heaven, should have a daily Calculation of the Declination of the Earth, as the Earth shall alter her Parallels, by Inclining or Declining towards her Poles. But it is proved by observation, that the Sun doth not keep his Parallels with the Starry Heaven, therefore the Sun cannot be the Center of the Star∣ry

Heaven; in regard the Sun is not always in the Equinoctial part of that Heaven, and the Sun hath not the same Meridian Altitude, and Amplitude, and Parallel, with the Starry Heaven in the Equi∣noctial, but twice in the year, and that is as the Sun Inclines and Declines from one Tropick to another. And it is proved by observation, that the Equi∣noctial part of the Starry Heaven is always in the Equinoctial part of the Earth, for the Meridian Altitude of the Stars in the Equinoctial, is the Ele∣vation of the Equinoctial in all Parallels. Now there is a necessity, that the Declination of the Sun should be Calculated for every day in the year, in regard of his Declination towards his Pole, 23 d. 30 m. which is the cause the Sun alters his Parallels and Amplitudes, and Meridian Altitudes, every day. But for the Starry Heaven, its Declination or Distance from the Equinoctial is the same for ever, and keeps it Parallels with the Earth. Another Example from the Sun, to prove the Earth the Center of the Starry Hea∣ven. MOst Mathematicians hold, that when the Sun is depressed below the Horizon 15 Degrees, that Twylight appears upon the Horizon; the
