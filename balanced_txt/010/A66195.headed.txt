And to the end that all Persons might be the more willing to Accept and Receive the said Bills in all manner of Payments, It is thereby also Enacted, That there shall be annexed unto, attend and go along with the said Bills, an Interest after the Rate of Five Pence a Day for every One hundred Pounds contained therein, and so Proportionably for a greater or lesser Sum, which said Interest shall be Paid or Allowed to the Person who is last Possessed thereof, to the Day he Pays the same into the Exchequer, or to any Receivers or Collectors, for any Aids, Taxes, Revenues or Supplies whatsoever. And that no Interest might be Allowed on the said Bills for any longer time than the same should be Vnanswered unto Vs, It is En∣acted, That the Person who Pays the same into the Exchequer, or to any Receivers or Collectors, for any Aids, Taxes or Revenues, shall, at the time of ma∣king such Payment, put his Name to the said Bill, and Write the Day of the Month; to which Day the Collector, or other Person who Receives the same to Our Vse, shall be Allowed again the Interest that he shall have Allowed thereupon. And when any of the said Bills, which in pursuance of the Act last men∣tioned shall be Received at the Exchequer, Custom-House, Excise-Office, or General Letter-Office, or by any of Our Receivers or Collectors, or for any Re∣venues, Taxes or Supplies, shall be Applicable to the Satisfaction of Talleys and Orders of Loan, or to any other Vses or Payments whatsoever, and by reason thereof are not to be immediately Cancelled at the said Exchequer, or in any other Publick Office, then the respective Cellers in the Receipt of Our Exchequer, and the Receivers General or Cashiers of the Customs, Excise and Post-Office, or any other Receivers, upon their Issuing or Paying out the said Bills, shall Sign the same, and add the Day of the Month, and so toties quoties until the said Bills shall or may come or be Paid into the Exchequer, on Account of the Proper Funds or Supplies (upon which they are or shall be first Issued out) to be Cancelled.

And it is by the said Act Pro∣vided and Enacted, That until such time as We by Our Royal Proclamation, to be Issued by the Advice of Our Privy Council, should be Plea∣sed to Publish and make Known, That the said Commissioners of Our Treasury, or any Three or more of them, or the High Treasurer for the time being, should (by such Covenants or Agreements made with Persons of Ability, as aforesaid) have sufficiently secured and made provision, That all Persons who at the said Receipt of Exchequer, or at any the said Publick Offices, should have any of the said Bills for satisfaction of their Talleys or Orders of Loan, or for any other Payments whatsoever, may have such Bills Exchanged for Ready Money, the said Bills to be made forth for the said Fifteen hundred thousand Pounds, or any part thereof, should be Current only for the Aids, Taxes or Supplies Granted or to be Granted for the Service of the War for the Year One thousand six hundred ninety seven, Exclusive of the said Aid of Three Shillings in the Pound, according to the Tenour and true Meaning of the said former Act in that behalf; And that after the said Proclamation should be Issued, and not sooner, the said Bills so Authorized to be Issued, as aforesaid, should Pass and be Current for all Revenues, Aids, Taxes, Supplies or other Payments to Vs, according to the true Meaning of the last recited Act; Any thing therein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, as by the said several Acts relation being thereunto respectively had, may more fully appear.
