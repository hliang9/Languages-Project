THE DECLARATION Of the Nobility, Gentry, Ministry and Com∣monalty of the County of KENT. Together with the City and County of Canterbury, the City of Roche∣ster, and the Ports within the said County. HAving with sadness weighed the multiplied calamities wherein we are at present involved, how friendless we are Abroad, and how divided at home; the loud and heart-piercing cries of the poore, and the disability of the better sort to relieve them; the total decay and subversion of Trade, together with the forfeiture and loss of the honor and reputation of the Nation, and (what is more dear to us then all these) the ap∣parent hazard of the Gospel through the prodigious growth of Blasphemies, Heresies and Schism, all which own their birth to the instability of our Governors, and the unsettle∣ment of our Government. Lastly, how in all these, an universal ruine threatneth us, and wil (if not timely prevented) doubtless overwhelm us. We thought it our bounden duties, both as Christians, out of tenderness to our Religion; as English men, to our Countrey; and as Friends, to our selves and our Relati∣ons, to represent and publish to the world our just griefs for, and our lively resentments of this our deplorable condition, and to seek all lawful and probable means to remedy and redress the same. Wherefore having the leading Examples of the renowned Cities of London and Exeter, together with the Coun∣ties of the VVest, before our eyes; and the clamours and out-cries of the People alwaies in our ears, (whereof the one encourageth, and the other enforceth us to this our Declaration) we thought that we would not be silent at such a time, when our silence would speak us to be either Assentors to our own ruine, or Abettors of such procee∣dings as have neither Law nor Equity to support them. VVe therefore, the Nobility, Gentry, Ministry and Commonalty of the County of Kent, together with the City and County of Canterbury, the City of Rochester, and the Ports within the said County, do by these Presents unani∣mously Declare, That our desires are for a Full and Free PARLIAMENT, as the onely probable means, under God, to lead us out of this Maze and Labyrinth of confusions in which we are at present engag'd; that is, that the old secluded Members, so many of them as are surviving, may be readmitted into the House, and that there may be a free Election of others to supply the places of those which are dead, without any Oath, or Engagement pre∣vious to their Entrance, these we shall own as the true Representatives of the People; these we shall with our Lives and Fortunes, to the utter most of our power, assist, and with all cheerfulness submit to, and acquiess in whatsoever they shall Enact or Ordain. Thus concluding, that all publick spirited men, and good Patriots, wil with all readiness join and concur with us in a matter of so universal concernment, and that we shal find Opposition from none but such as prefer their own pri∣vate Interests, and temporal respects, to their Religion and laws of the land; we shall as boldly subscribe our Names as we do heattily declare our Desires. ADVERTISEMENT. THe forward zeal of some well-disposed persons, to express their Cordial and unanimous Concurrence with their Country-men of the several Counties and Cities of England; having caused a Declaration imperfect, in a very weighty and ma∣terial Clause thereof, to be Printed and published, in the name of the County of KENT, &c. It was thought fit, that the genuine and true Copy of the said Dclaration should be set forth, as it was intended to be presented to the Speaker, and to the present great Arbitrator of the Nations peace and hapiness, General Monck; but through the mis-informations of some unquiet spirits, (who while they may have leave to accuse, will leave no man innocent, nor the State without trouble) the persons of many Gentlemen are secured, and others threatned, by a great force marcht into the Country, the Presentation was necessarily omitted, and the Names and Subscriptions not exposed to publick view, for reasons very obvious and evident.
