HIS MAJESTIES SPEECH, In the House of COMMONS, 4o. Januarii 1641. LONDON: Printed by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent Majestie: And by the Assignes of JOHN BILL. 1641.
HIS MAJESTIES SPEECH In the House of Commons, 4o Januarii 1641. Gentelemen, I Am sorry for this occasion of coming unto you: yester∣day I sent a Serge∣ant at Arms upon a very important occasion, to ap∣prehend some that by my com∣mand were accused of high Trea∣son, whereunto I did expect Obe∣dience, and not a Message. And
I must declare unto you here, that albeit no King that ever was in England shall be more carefull of your PRIVILEDGES, to maintain them to the uttermost of his power then I shall be; yet you must know, that in cases of Trea∣son no person hath a priviledge, and therefore I am come to know if any of those persons that were accused are here; for I must tell you, Gentlemen, that so long as these persons that I have accused (for no slight crime, but for Trea∣son) are here, I cannot expect that this House can be in the right way that I do heartily wish it: There∣fore I am come to tell you, that I must have them wheresoever I finde them; well, sithence I see all
the Birds are flown, I do expect from you, that you shall send them unto me as soon as they return hi∣ther: But I assure you, in the word of a King, I never did intend any force, but shall proceed against them in a legall and fair way, for I never meant any other. And now sithence I see I cannot do what I came for, I think this no unfit occasion to repeat what I have said formerly; That whatso∣ever I have done in favour, and to the good of my Subjects, I do mean to maintain it. I will trouble you no more, but tell you, I do expect as soon as they come to the House, you will send them to me, otherwise I must take my own course to finde them. FINIS.
