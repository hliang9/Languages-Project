To the Honourable the House of Commons, FOR Raising of Monies. It is humbly offered, IF in Your Wisdoms it be thought fit, That from and after the Twenty fourth Day of June 1699. for and during the Space of Five Years, whoever shall happen to Die within the said time without lawful Issue living at the time of their Death, the Twenti∣eth part of their Estate, after an Allowance made for Payment of all their just Debts, be appropriated to the Publick, and the Value thereof paid within one Year after the Decease of the Party: And whoever shall defraud, to pay double what Convicted of, one half to the Publick, and the other half to the In∣former. It is presumed, That this may be a good Fund for One Million at Seven per Cent. to pay both Principal, Interest, and incident Charges thereon within Five Years, the time limited; and being a Contingency on a Benefit accruing to some Persons at the same time, will not be grievous, especially to the Poor. This, together with the Regulation thereof, is with all Submission proposed to this most August Assembly, by a Well-wisher to the Publick, and Bridgwater-Square, February 3d, 169/9. Your Honours Very humble and Faithful Servant, Wm. BOND.
A PROPOSAL FOR Raising Monies.
