An Alarum to the City and Souldiery, God grant they may not neglect it. Gentlemen, and fellow Souldiers, AT this time, when our Ruine and Destruction is upon us, there is no place for many words. The Fifth Mo∣narchy men are Arm'd, Officer'd, and every way in a Readiness, upon the word given them, to sur∣prise and suppress the Army, to Fire the City, and to Massacre all considerable People of all sorts, whom they suspect averse to what they impiously designed. Feake hath lately  them the Alarum in Print: Sir Henry Vane is Chief in the Design, and lately said in confidence to a Friend, This Army was any way to be suppress'd; for otherwise, they should not be permitted to sit long. The Parliaments new Militia, and their Listings in several Coun∣ties, is in order to no other Design. If God gives you not eyes to see the destruction that is even at your dores, or if you see it, you want hearts and courage to prevent it, it then seems the Decree is gone out against you. You have your Warning, and we have done our Duties. Beware Tuesday next; we say, Beware. June 6. 1659.
