By the King, A PROCLAMATION OF PARDON. JAMES R. FOrasmuch as several of Our Subjects have been Seduced to take up Arms, and contrary to the Laws of God and Man, to joyn themselves with Foreigners and Strangers, in a most Vnnatural Invasion upon Vs, and this their Native Country, many of whom We are perswaded have been wrought upon by false Suggestions and Misrepresentations made by Our Enemies: And We desiring (as far as is possible) to re∣duce Our said Subjects to Duty and Obedience by Acts of Clemency, at least resolving to leave all such as shall persist in so wicked an Enterprize, without Excuse, Do therefore Promise, Grant and Declare, and by this Our Royal Proclamation Publish Our Free and Absolute Pardon, to all Our Subjects who have taken up Arms, and joyned with the Prince of Orange and his Adherents, in the present Invasion of this Our Kingdom, Provided they quit and desert Our said Enemies, and within the space of Twenty Days from the Date of this Our Royal Proclamation, render themselves to some one of Our Officers Civil or Military, and do not again, after they have rendered themselves as aforesaid, return to Our Ene∣mies, or be any way Aiding or Assisting to them: And they who refuse or neglect to lay hold of this Our Free and Gracious Offer, must never expect Our Pardon hereafter, but will be wholly and justly Excluded of and from all hopes thereof. And lastly, We also Promise and Grant Our Pardon and Protection to all such Foreigners as do or shall come over to Vs, whom We will either Enter∣tain in Our Service, or otherwise Grant them (if they shall desire it) freedom of Passage, and li∣berty to return to the respective Countries from whence they came. Given at Our Court at Salisbury the 22th Day of November 1688. In the Fourth Year of Our Reign. God save the King.
