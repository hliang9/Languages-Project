TO THE RIGHT HONOVRABLE SIR ROBERT KER of Ankerhome, Knight, Gentleman of his Ma. Bed-Chamber. Honourable Sir, WHen the Lord was to give unto his people the Tables of the Law, the second time, he commanded the people to stand at the foot of the Mount, Aaron, Nadab,Exod. 24.2, 3, and 18. and Abihu, and the seventy Elders of Jsrael, to worship a farre off in the middle of the Mount, and that Moses should ascend to the top of the Mount, & enter within the cloud; These three represented very well the three estates of the Church: they who stood at the
foot of the Mount, resembled the Iewish Church; Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, & the seventy who ascended to the middle of the Mount, resembled the Christian Church; and Mo∣ses who ascended to the top of the Mount, and entred into the cloud, resembled the glorified Church; and the Fathers say of those three, that the Iewish Church was in extimis, and and that the Christian Church is in atrijs; and that the triumphant Church is in intimis; that is, the Iewish Church was in the utter court; the Christian Church is in the middle court, and that the glorified Church is in the inner court. Let us make a comparison betwixt the Iewish Church standing at the foot of the Mount, and the Christian Church which standeth in the middle of the Mount, and we shal see a great difference betwixt them two. First, let us compare them in the Priesthood, Melchizedeck and Aaron.Heb. 7.3. Melchisedeck had nei∣ther beginnng of his dayes, nor end of life, he was borne before the flood, and none who lived after the flood could tell when he was borne, and he lived five hundreth yeares after the flood; so that he seemed neither to have beginning nor end of dayes; but the Priest who were after the order of Aaron, be∣hooved to deduce their genealogies, and of
whom they were descended,Nehem. 7.64. or else they were secluded from the Priesthood.Eleaz. in Num. 4. Second∣ly, the Hebrewes say, when the Tabernacle removed, that Eleazar the Priest carried the oyle for the Lampes in his right hand,Luc. 4.8. and 28.45. and the anointing oyle in his left hand, the in∣cense in his bosome, and the meat offering upon his shoulder. Eleazar was but a figure of Iesus Christ the Highpriest in the Christi∣an Church, who giveth grace,Ioh. 1.16. Revel. 8.3. 1 Timot 2.5. Ephes. 5.26. 1 Cor. 5.7. the oyle of the Spirit, for the understanding of the Scrip∣tures, who putteth the odours of sweet in∣cense to our prayers; and lastly, he presenteth the Church as a pure meate-offering to his Father. Next let us compare the people un∣der the Law with these under the Gospell; first, their rites were carnall rites, consisting in these, touch not, taste not, handle not, and even as Fathers forbid their little children to eate of such and such things, or handle them not, they specially restraine their basest senses; but when their sonnes are come to maturity and age, they forbid them to hearken unto evill, or looke unto evill, they restraine their noble senses especially; so because the Iewes were but infants, he trained thē up this way, forbidding them to touch, taste, or handle, but he forbiddeth the Christian Church, things of
greater moment; againe, let us compare them them in holinesse; under the Law, holinesse was written but upon the forehead of the Highpriest, but under the Gospell, the Pro∣phet Zachariah saith, that holinesse shall bee written upon the horse bridles, to signifie the great measure of holinesse that should bee in the Church under the Gospell. Thirdly, compare them in the measure of their love; under the Law every seventh yeare they were to let their land rest, and to pardon their deb∣tors, and to give a full remission to them: but see how farre the Gospell exceedeth the Law in this, Peter asked of Christ if he should par∣don his brother seven times, as the Iewes par∣doned their debtors the seventh yeare; what answered Christ to him? thou shalt not par∣don seven times, nor seven times seven times, but seventy times seven times; and as farre as the Iubile exceeded the seventh yeare, as farre shall your charity exceede the Iubile, that is. to seventy times seven times. Fourthly, com∣pare them in the measure of their know∣ledge; their measure of knowledge under the Law was very small, all things were covered and wrapped up to them, when they carried, the brazen Altar in the Wildernesse,Numb. 4.13. they covered it with a purple cloath. When they
carried the Arke, it was covered with three coverings, with a vaile, Badgers skins,Numb. 4 6. and a cloath wholly of blew. So the table of the Shewbread had three coverings, all was co∣vered save onely the Laver, and Moses face was covered to them with a vaile, when hee came from the Mount; the Priests bare the things which they might not see, To signi∣fie a concealing of a part of the mysteries of the Gospell, afterwards to be revealed;Coloss. 1.26. so the people saw but through a grate,Heb. 9.1. but now the Temple of God is opened in the heaven, and there is seene in his Temple the Arke of the Testament; they stood a farre off,Revel. 11.19. things which are hid and obscure, are said by the He∣brewes to be far off,Deut. 30.14. and things wch are cleare and manifest, are said to be neare at hand; thus we see how farre the Gospell exceedeth the Law; but yet we are not to vilifie and count basely of those ceremonies, for the holy Ghost hath registred the least instrument and the basest things in the Sanctuary, and David gave to Salomon a patterne of the table, Candle∣sticke, Lampes, flesh-hookes and bowles, 1 Chron. 28.11, 17. It may be said perhaps that they had some use then,2 Cot. 5.10. but old things are past away, and all things are become new, what use then can they have in the
Church now; they have no use for significa∣tion now in the Church, or to fore-shadow things to come, seeing Christ the Body him∣selfe is come; yet they have many other good uses, first, we should delight to looke backe to see the antiquitie of them, for even as men delight to behold the cloathes and Armour of their predecessors which they wore long agoe; So should we delight to see the cloathes in which Christ was wrapped in his infancy, and the Cradle in which Christ lay. Second∣ly, this should teach us to be thankefull to God, that we have so cleare a light under the Gospel, which they had not under the Law; it was a great benefit to learning, when the ob∣scure Hieroglyphicks in Egypt were changed into letters, and the darke and mysticall wri∣tings of Plato, were changed by Aristotle into a cleare and plaine forme of writing; farre greater is the benefit that the Church hath now, when the Lord hath changed these fi∣gures and ceremonies into the cleare light of the Gospell. Thirdly, these doe let us see that God will performe the rest of his promises as he hath fulfilled all these types already, and lastly, they let us see the miserable estate of the Iewes, who cleave still to these ceremo∣nies as yet. Hierom compareth the Iewes be∣fore
Christ came into the world, to these that eate the flesh, and he compared Christians under the Gospell, to those who eate the marrow, but he compareth the Iewes after they had rejected Christ to the dogges who gnaw the bones, cleaving onely to the killing letter, but not seeking to Iesus Christ the quickning Spirit. And now Sir, I dedicate this part of my labours to you, that it may remaine a note of my thankefulnesse for your favours to me. I know Sir, that ye will make better use of it, then most men in these dayes doe with such Treatises, casting them by, and rather reade any trifle, than that which conduceth to the informing of the soule to God-ward, yea preaching it selfe they are weary of, except perhaps some new mans odde elocution invite them for a fit, but by and by they looke after a new straine, as it were for new fashions of cloathes. But I know Sir your breeding craveth another thing of you, who was bred up under so wise and religious a mother, who for the educatiō of her children, was another Monica, as your selfe and your vertuous sister, Mistris Kathe∣rine, are sufficient proofes. I cannot passe by her name upon this occasion, whose life and death was to mean instruction. Good cause
have you to keepe that methode, as yee have begun it in your eldest sonne, so to prosecute the same with your many hopefull children which GOD hath given you by your Noble match, which is one of the best borne Ladies of this Land, who dignifieth her birth by her Christian, humble, and godly life. Sir, beleeve me that godlinesse is more true Ho∣nour to you than your birth, although you be never so well descended, and to be more esteemed, than the place which yee have about our Gracious King, and more than all morall vertues whatsoever, which are but splendida peccata, without piety; your Honour and worldly credite are but trifles compared to this, they cannot keepe a man alive in this world, nor doe him any good in the world to come,Eccles. 12.3. for this is the whole man, this makes up a complete man, and he is but the shadow of a man that wants this:Psal. 34.7. The Angels of the Lord pitch round about them that feare him, and de∣liver them, and hath any man in this Court gotten more remarkeable deliverances than you have, I am sure ye will not let these bene∣fits of the Lord slip out of your minde, reade often the sixty two Psalme,Heb. 12.20. and meditate upon it. The God of peace that brought againe from the dead, our Lord Iesus, that great Shepheard of the
sheepe, through the blood of the everlasting covenant, make you perfect in every good worke to doe his will, working in you that which is pleasing in his sight, through Iesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Now, for these my labours, if they serve for any Christian use in the Church, I am sa∣tisfied, and that I may doe so, I humbly pray to God, and shall still for your prosperity, Your Honours still to be com∣manded in the Lord, Iohn Weemes.

Additions. Pag. 171, the Lord gave his people the morall Law and the ceremonies; and the Gospell; when the cere∣moniall Law was given, it derogated nothing from the morall Law, there was nothing abrogated or changed in the first Law, or subrogated in place of the morall Law, but when the Gospel came in, the ceremonies were abrogated, et superinducta est spes melior. Pag. 137, 35. Some Lawes are naturall and ceremoniall, some are judiciall and ceremoniall, and some are meere cere∣moniall; naturall and ceremoniall, where the ground of the Law is naturall, and the ceremony annexed, the ceremony being taken away the naturall part may stand. Example, the father was bound to give his sonne a dou∣ble portion, because he was his strength, and because he was a type of Christ; take away the type, the morall part standeth. So where the Law is Iudiciall and cere∣moniall. Example, Cities of refuge were appointed to save the mankiller, and he was to abide there untill the death of the Highpriest; take away this ceremony, and Cities of refuge may remaine. Thirdly, where the law is ceremoniall and Iudiciall, a Magistrate cannot make the ceremoniall part, a part of the Iudiciall; Example, this was a judiciall and ceremoniall Law, that the male∣factor should be hanged upon a tree, and that he should be cut downe before the night, because he defiled the land, a magistrate may cause hang a theefe now, but he cannot cause hang him as accursed or not suffer him to hang all night, because he defiled the Land.
EXERCITATIONS DIVINE. Of the Ceremoniall Lawes which are an∣nexed to the Commandements in the first and second Tables. EXERCITAT. I. Of the reducing of the Ceremonies of the Law in generall unto the Com∣mandements. THe Apostle Paul willeth Timothy to hold fast the forme of sound words which he had heard of him, proprie cap∣sule in uibus singu∣la monetarum genera ordine certo disponunt ut in promptu singula habeant cum opus fuerit. 2 Tim. 1.13. In the Syriack it is, Hhora foramina, a speech borrowed frō Merchants who have severall boxes or holes wherein they put their severall sorts of Mo∣ney. So should Divines have proper places of refe∣rence
to which they should referre their severall heads. Amongst the rest it is not the least skill to referre the Ceremonies of the Law rightly, to their owne com∣mandements, and digest them in their severall pla∣ces. Thomas. 1:2. quest. 101. Art. 4.The Schoolemen divide the ceremonies in foure sorts, in sacrificia, sacramenta, sacra, & observantias, In Sacrifices, Sacraments, holy things, as the place, the time of their worship, &c. and ordinances which they did observe, although all the ceremonies may be re∣reduced to these foure heads, yet we must follow ano∣ther order, and reduce them to the Commande∣ments. First, some ceremonies cannot be reduced to one Commandement,Some ceremonies be∣long to all the Com∣mandements. but they belong to them all, as to weare fringes upon their garments, is a ceremonie that cannot be referred to one Commandement, because it served for the keeping of all the Commandements, Num. 15.39. And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that yee may looke upon it and remember all the Commandements. So Deut. 21.23. He that is hanged is accursed of God, this ceremonie belongeth to all the Commandements, as the Apostle applyeth it to the breach of the whole Commandements, Gal. 3.10. and 13. Some ceremonies be∣long to two Comman∣dements.Secondly, some ceremonies belong to two Com∣mandements, as the purification of a woman after her child-birth, is a ceremoniall Law which signifieth that they did conceive their children in originall sinne, and therefore had neede to bee purged and purified after their birth. Now because originall sinne is condem∣ned in the first and last Commandement, therefore this ceremoniall Law is annexed to them both: origi∣nall sin is condemned in these two Commandements, for in the other commandements where the full con∣sent and act of sinne is forbidden, it is not forbidden.
Thirdly, some ceremonies, in divers respects,Some ceremonies in divers respects belong to divers commande∣ments. may be referred to divers Commandements, as Levit. 17.14. Yee shall eate the blood of no manner of flesh; as they were to abstaine from blood in reverence of the blood of Christ, which was to be shed for them, then it be∣longeth to the second Commandement, as the rest of the significative ceremonies; but as they were to ab∣staine from blood because the life was in it, it was cruelty to eate it, and in that respect it belonged to the sixt Commandement. So Num. 18.21. and 24. and behold I have given the children of Levi all the tenth in Israel for an inheritance. Now as the priests gathered the tithes, and received them from the people for serving at the Altar, it was a dutie required of them in the second Commande∣ment; therefore it is sayd, the tenth shall be theirs for their service which they serve, even the service of the Ta∣bernacle of the Congregation; but as the people payed these Tithes to the Priests, it is a duty required in the fift Commandement, to honour them. So Deut. 21.17. He shall give the first borne a double por∣tion of all that he hath, This ceremoniall Law, as the el∣dest sonne was a type of Christ, is a dutie of the second Commandement, to give him the double portion; but as he was his fathers first borne, to keepe the families distinguished, that they should not bee confounded in the Tribes, it is a duty required in the fift Comman∣dement; because parents should provide for their children. Lastly, these ceremonies generally for the most part are referred to the second Commandement.
Ceremonies belonging to the first Com∣mandement. EXERCITAT. II. Of the purification of the woman after her child-birth. Luk. 2.22. And when the dayes of her purification ac∣cording to the Law of Moyses were accomplished, they brought him to Ierusalem to present him to the Lord (as it is written in the Law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb, shall be called holy to the Lord) and to offer a sacrifice, according to that which is sayd in the Law of the Lord, a paire of Turtle Doves, or two young Pigeons. How this ceremoniall Law pertaineth to the first Commandement.IT may seeme strange to some, how this ceremoniall Law should belong to the first Commandement; but this is not strange; for our conception in sinne is condemned in the Commandements; but it is not con∣demned in any of the Commandements where the act and full deliberation of the minde is forbidden; there∣fore the negative part is especially condemned in the last Commandement, and the affirmative is comman∣ded in the first Commandement, which requireth the purity of our nature, that we may love the Lord with all our heart; and so the child must crave pardon for his sinne, Psal. 51.5. and the mother here must offer her sa∣crifice for her selfe and her child. Two sorts of uncleane∣nesse, the greater and the sser.The mother when she conceived and bare a female, she was uncleane in her great uncleannesse seventeene
dayes, and in her lesse uncleannesse shee was uncleane threescore and sixe dayes, Levit. 12.4. When she conceived and bare a male she was un∣cleane in her great uncleannesse seven dayes, and shee was in her lesse uncleannesse thirtie three dayes. Ver. 5. The reason why she was longer uncleane when shee bare a female, than when she bare a male,The reason why the mother was longer un∣cleane when she bare a female than when she bare a male. was not mo∣rall, because the woman sinned first and not the man; but the reason of this is naturall, because the male is sooner quickned in his mothers bellie, and mooveth more quickly by reason of the greater heat, and dry∣eth up sooner the humidities than the female doth; the female againe is more slowly quickned by reason of the greater cold and humiditie, and therefore the mother had a longer time prescribed to her for her purificati∣on. The mother when shee was purified,The mother offered for her selfe and her child when she was purified. shee was to of∣fer a sacrifice for herselfe and her child. Some hold that shee was to offer a sacrifice for her∣selfe, and not for her child; and therefore they read the words this wayes, When the dayes of her purification are fulfilled for a sonne or for a daughter; shee shall bring a lambe of the first yeere for a burnt offering, &c. But the Text seemeth rather to be read this wayes, When the dayes of her purification are fulfilled; for a sonne or for a daughter she shall bring a lambe of the first yeere for a burnt offering.Mary offered a sacrifice for herselfe and for her sonne. And the practise of Mary the Virgin confir∣meth this, that day that she was purified shee brought a paire of Turtle Doves, or two young Pigeons, and offered them to the Lord for herselfe and for her child. But it may be sayd, Luk. 2.22. Cum impleti essent dies  and when the dayes of her purification were fulfilled, and not of their purification. is put for , here, according to the Hebrew
phrase, and so it is in the Syriack, for the Hebrews put the plurall number for the singular,The Hebrewes put the plurall number for the singular, and the singu∣lar for the plurall oft times. as Iud. 12.17. He was buried in the Cities of David, that is, in one of the Ci∣ties of David, so Matth. 27.44. the Theeves railed upon him, that is, one of the Theeves railed upon him, So Ionas 1.5. he went downe into the sides of the ship, that is, to one of the sides, So Psal. 1.3. A tree planted by the rivers of wa∣ters, that is, one of the rivers. So likewise they put the singular number for the plurall number as here, the dayes of her purification,The child was uncleane as long as the mother was uncleane. for the dayes of her and his purifi∣cation. For so long as the mother was uncleane, the child who suckt her was also uncleane; and Christ who was subject to the Law, although there was no morall uncleannesse in him, yet he was legally uncleane all this time, untill his mother was purified, and this serveth for our great comfort, that hee became uncleane legally, to take away our morall unclean∣nesse. But if Christ was uncleane all this time, how could he be circumcised the eight day? Christ was but in his great uncleanenesse untill the seventh day, as his mother was; and therefore he was circumcised the eight day: but the females who were not circumcised, were uncleane untill the foureteenth day. It may be asked, why Mary offered a sacrifice for her purification, seeing she conceived not her child in ori∣ginall sinne, and this sacrifice was appointed as a reme∣die against originall sinne? As Christ who knew not sinne yet became legally uncleane for our cause; so he would have his mother also for her legall uncleanenesse to offer that sacrifice, which all other women were bound to offer, who were both legally and morally uncleane. The Conclusion of this is, as Elisha when he cured the
unsavory waters of Iericho did cast salt into the spring of the waters, 2 King. 2.21. So we must crave of God, that he would first purge the bitter roote of originall sinne, before he come to purge our other sinnes. David craved pardon of the Lord for this sinne, Psalme 51.5. EXERCITAT. III. Of the place of Gods worship. A ceremoniall appendix of Commandement II. Deut. 12.5. But unto the place which the Lord your God shall chuse out of all your Tribes to put his name there, even unto his habitation shall yee seeke, and thither shall yee come. THe places which served for the worship of God,Places for worship approved or comman∣ded by God. were either places commanded by God, or ap∣proved by him: places commanded, as the Tabernacle and Temple, places approved by God, was their Sy∣nagogues and places of prayer; their Synagogues, Psal. 74, 8. they have burnt up all the Synagogues of God in the land, their place of prayer was called , in the Syriack, Domus orationis, a house of prayer, Act. 16.13. And on the Sabboth day we went out of the City by a river where prayer was wont to be made. The Tabernacle and Temple were Loci ut sic,Locus ut locus ut sic. as the Schoolemen speake; their Synagogues and  houses of prayer, were but Loci ut loci, therefore they might not sacrifice in them, but when they worshiped in them, they turned alwayes their faces towards the Temple.
The Tabernacle which was the first place comman∣ded for the worship of God, was a type of heaven, Psal. 15.1. Lord who shall dwell in thy Tabernacle, and when they could not have accesse to the Tabernacle, they thought themselves but like the wandring Arabians, appellative hic sumitur a  protraxit, we reade not that Daevid ever dwelt in the tents of Kear therefore it should be translated, as in Kedar. that knew not God nor his worship, Psal. 120.5. Woe is me that I sojourne so long, dwelling as in the Tents of Ke∣dar. This Tabernacle was divided in three parts, the ho∣liest of all, the holy place, and the court of the peo∣ple. The holiest of all signified heaven, the second place signified the state of the old Law where the Priests en∣tered in daily and offered for themselves and the peo∣ple, and the court of the people signified the Church here below. The people might not come into the court of the Priests.The people might not come into the holiest of all; but Esay 56.7. My house shall be called the house of prayer, he applyeth this both to the Iewes and Gentiles, which Christ applyeth to the Iewes onely in the Temple of Ierusalem, and the Prophet speaketh in prototype, as Christ in type: the Proselytes might not come into the court of the Israelites, they stood but in Atrio Gentium, in the court of the people, but Esay foretelleth that the Gen∣tiles shall have as free accesse to the house of God, as the Iewes, because his house is the house of prayer, and this Salomon foretold, 1 King. 8.41. If a stranger come from a farre country to call upon thy name, then heare thou in heaven, that is, grant that they may have as great ac∣cesse to thee as the Iewes have. When Herod built the Temple, he wrote an inscrip∣tion upon the gate of the court of Israel, that no stran∣ger should enter in there under the paine of death; but now this inscription is changed, that whatsoever stran∣ger he be that doth not enter into the house of the
Lord, shall dye the death: before,The Levites might not goe into the holy place. the people might not enter into the court of the Priest; but now wee are all Kings and priests to God, 1 Pet. 2.9. before, the Levites might enter where the people might not goe, they might goe into the court of the Priests, but not into the holy place; but now all the people are the Lords Levites, Mal. 2.8. appellative hic sumitur quia habet ה praefixum. Yee have corrupted the covenant of Levi, saith the Lord of hostes. Levi here is put for the whole people, and therefore they have as great accesse now as the Priests had. Before, none might enter in∣to the holiest of all, but the High priest once in the yeere, Heb. 9.7. but now all have accesse to the throne of grace, Heb 4.16. Rom. 5.2. The Tabernacle and the Temple were alike in many things, first in the forme,A comparisen betwixt the Tabernacle and Temple. for the Tabernacle was a pa∣terne to the Temple. Againe there was no light in the holiest of all in the Tabernacle;In what things they were alike. So neyther in the holiest of all in the Tem∣ple, and the signification was this, Rev. 21.23. and the City had no neede of the Sunne, neyther of the Moone,How the Lord is sayd to dwell in a cloud. to shine in it, for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lambe is the light thereof. In the holiest of all there was no light, and the High priest when he entred into it kindled smoke, and he saw nothing, because the Lord dwelleth in a cloud, Psal 18.11. he was not able to behold the shecina or glory that dwelt in the holiest there was no externall light that came there, but the Lambe was the light, and when we shall be glorified wee shall not see that inaccessible light in which hee dwelleth. So in the holyest both in the Tabernacle and temple there was no light but the light of the Candlestick,no light in the Temple but that which the lampe gave. for there were no windows in the Temple to give light to it, and it was compassed round about with Chambers that it could have no light.
1 Sam. 3.3. And ere the lampe of God went out in the Temple of the Lord where the Arke of God was, and Samu∣el was layd downe to sleepe. Then it may seeme that they had other light, than the light of the candlestick. Before the lampe of God went out, that is, before the lampes were changed by the Priests, and new lights ad∣ded; and the signification of this was, the Church should be directed by no light but by the light of the Word, 2 Pet. 1.19. We have also a more sure word of Pro∣phesie, whereunto yee doe well that yee take heede, as unto a light that shineth in a darke place, untill the day dawne, and the day starre arise in your hearts. The Court of the Priests was not covered.There was a court for the Priests both in the Taber∣nacle and Temple, and it was not covered above, to signifie, that the Church here, hath more of the light of nature than of the light of grace, Againe, the Tabernacle and Temple had the like im∣plements both in the Holiest, and Holiest of all. And last, the Tabernacle and the Temple served for the same use for Gods worship. In what things the Ta∣bernacle and Temple differedNow let us see wherein they differed. First, the Ta∣bernacle was moveable, and the other was fixed; the moveable Tabernacle signified our estate and condi∣tion here, and the Temple which was unmoveable signified our estate in future glory. The Tabernacle had not the court of the Gentiles.Secondly, the Temple was much more large than the Tabernacle; the Tabernacle had not the court of the Gentiles as the temple had, there was but one gol∣den candlesticke in the Tabernacle, and ten in the Tem∣ple, 1 King. 7.49. So in the Tabernacle was but one bra∣sen Laver, & in the Temple there were ten: so there were but two Cherubims in the Tabernacle, but foure in the Temple. Lastly, the Tabernacle indured not so long as the Temple did; and when the Tabernacle had no use, it was layd up in the Temple.
The Conclusion of this is,  the Tabernacle gave place to the Temple: So both the Temple and the Taberna∣cle gave way to Iesus Christ, who was both the true Tabernacle and Temple, and of whom they were but types. EXERCITAT. IIII. Of the Arke. A Ceremoniall Appendix of Command 2. Exod. 25.17. And thou shalt make a Mercie seate of pure Gold, &c. vers. 22. and there I will meete with thee, and I will commune with thee from above the Mercy seat, betwixt the two Cherubims which are upon the Arke of the Testimony. THe Arke was that place from which the Lord gave his answers to his people,The divers names given to the Arke.  adytum quasi Oraculum vel loquuto∣rium dictum quod deus indo responsa daret. & therefore it is called Debhir, his speaking place, 1 King. 6.23. and it was a type of Christ, by whom God speaketh to his Church, and it was called his strength, Psal. 132.8. and 78.61. and his glory, 1 Sam. 4.20. and the King of Glory, Psal. 24.7. and the place of the soles of his feete, Esay. 43.7. and his foote∣stoole, Psal. 99.5. How is it both called the place of the soles of his feete, and his glory? Because all which is in God is glorious, there is no base thing in him. If the feete of those who preach the Gospel be beautiful, Rom. 10.15. much more all that is in him is beautifull and glorious.
The Arke called the propitiatorie.The Arke is called the propitiatory, Rom. 3.25. 1 Ioh. 2.2. which covereth our sinnes, and it covereth the Tables of the Law that it should not rise up against us to condemne us, divinitas, gloria divina inter ho∣mines habitans a  habitare. Shecina, or the majestie of God dwelt upon this Arke, it was called shecina, from Shacan, habi∣tare, and it signified Christ dwelling with men, Reve. 21.3. Zach. 2.10. The Cherubims stood upon the mercieseat with their faces looking downeward towards the propitia∣tory, and Peter alludeth to this, 1 Pet. 1.12. which things the Angels desire to looke unto,Why the Cherubims looked downeward. the Angels looke downe to the propitiatory, but they looke not one to∣wards another; For then they should have had their faces towards shecina, the glorious majestie which they could not endure to behold; and here is our comfort, that we may behold God in Christ, when the vaile of his flesh is put betwixt us and him to cover his majestie, for otherwayes he were a consuming fire and we could not behold him. The Lord commanded them to bow before the Arke,The people were com∣manded to worship be∣fore the Arke. and to worship at his footestoole, Psal. 99.5. the rea∣son was; because the divine majestie dwelt there. The Lord dwelt in the cloud, in the pillar of fire, in the rocke, and in the bush, Deut. 33.16. for the good will of him who dwelt in the bush. So the Lord is with his sa∣crament, so the Lord appeared in majestie, and so he dwelt amongst us in the flesh here. They were not to bow before him when he appeared in his types, as in the cloud, in the bush, and in the fyre; neyther when hee manifesteth himselfe in his Sacraments,They worshipped be∣fore the Arke because the glory of the Lord dwelleth there. but when hee manifested himselfe in the flesh, and united our na∣ture hypostatically to his God-head, here wee are to worship him: and so when he appeared in glory and majestie above the Arke betwixt the Cherubims, they were bound to worship him, and when he appeared
in the Temple, Esay. 6. The Lord had a threefold Arke, first,A threefold Arke a fluctuant Arke, as that Arke of Noah. Secondly, an ambulato∣ry Arke which was the Arke in the Wildernesse, and before the Temple was builded, and thirdly, the fix∣ed Arke in the Temple. The fluctuant Arke of Noah signified the tossed and troubled estate of the Church in the world here, What the Arke of Noah signified. it is represented also by the ship in which Christ and his Apostles were; this ship was mightily tossed, and Christ was sleeping in the meanetime in the ship, the Disciples cryed out and bad Christ awake, for they were ready to perish, and Christ awoke and calmed the storme; the fluctuant Arke is like the Church tossed to and fro, and Christ in the meane time seemeth to be sleeping, yet he hath a care that the barke perish not. The second Arke was that which Moyses made, arca and it was the ambulatory Arke, this Arke remained in the Tabernacle from the dayes of Moyses untill the dayes of Eli,The places whereunto the Arke was caried after it was separated from the Tabernacle. and then they brought it out against the Philistims, where it was taken by them, 1 Sam. 4.11. After that the Philistims had taken it, they caried it to their five Cities, Ashdod, Gath, Ekron, Eskalon and Gaza, 1 Sam. 5. and there it remained in the countrie of the Phi∣listims seven monthes, 1 Sam. 6.1. but when the Lord plagued them, they sent it away upon a new cart to Bethshemsh, but the Lord smote the men of Bethshe∣mesh also, because they looked into the Arke, therefore they sent for the men of Keriath-jearim to fetch the Arke, So they brought it to Keriath-jearim where it remained in the house of Aminadab, in the hill, 1 Sam. 7.1. and from them it was caried into the house of Obed-Edom the Gittite, 1 Chron. 13. and from thence to Davids house at Ierusalem, where hee made a Tent for it, the
Arke was never in Gibea, for that was in the Tribe of Benjamin; neyther did Aminadab dwell in Gibea, but Kiriath-jearim, which was in the Tribe of Iuda; this error that it was in Gibea arose of this because they tran∣slated gibhgna, mons, appella∣tive hic sumitur & non proprie. Gibea, a proper name, whereas it should be translated A hill, appellativè, and Aminadab dwelt in this hill, 2 Sam. 6, 2.3. The Arke is sayd to rest in the Temple.The third Arke was Salomons Arke which he setled in the Temple of Ierusalem, the same in substance, but wandring before; it had more Cherubims than it had when it was in the Tabernacle, there were but two Cherubims in the Tabernacle, but foure in the Temple. And now it is sayd to rest, 1 Chron. 23.25. The Lord God hath given rest to his people, and in regard of the un∣stayednesse of it before Moyses sayd to the people, yee are not yet come to your rest, Deut. 12.9. Why the staves were not taken from the Arke in the Temple.But it is to be observed, that when it was setled in the Temple, the staves which caried it were not taken away; although they were hid and did not appeare, as they did when the Coathites caried it, yet the ends of the staves were seene out in the holy place before the Oracle, 1 King, 8.8. this was done to let the Iewes understand, that if they abused this Arke, the Testimonie of his presence, and put their trust onely in it; that the staves were rea∣die to be pulled out againe to carry it from them. The Conclusion of this, although the Arke was the pledge of Gods presence to the Iewes, and sanctified the places where it came, as Salomon sayd, The places are holy whereinto the Arke of the Lord hath come, 2 Chro. 8.11. yet it was but the furniture of a worldly sanctuary, Heb. 9.1. and under the Gospel to be done away, that men should say no more the Arke of the covenant of the Lord: at that time they shall call Ierusalem the throne of the Lord, Ier. 3.16. the Church then shall be his Arke, and he shal sit upon it, because it shall be sanctified, & all shal have accesse to the holiest.
EXERCITAT. V. Where they worshipped when the Arke and Ta∣bernacle were separated. A ceremoniall appendix of Command. 2. 1 King. 3.4. And the King went to Gibeon to sacrifice there; for that was the great high place, a thousand burnt offerings did Salomon offer upon that Altar. MOyses Tabernacle was removed from Shilh,The Tabernacle remo∣ved from Shilo after the Arke was taken out of it. Psal. 78.60. He refused the Tabernacle of Shiloh; and it seemeth to have beene transported at that time, when the Arke was taken out of it, and the Philistims had overcome the Israelites, 1 Sam. 4.11. It was removed from Shilo, Iere. 17.12. But goe yee now into my place which was in Shilo; where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it, and Psal. 78.67. Moreover he refused the Tabernacle of Ioseph, and chose not the Tribe of Ephraim, but he chose the Tribe of Iudah: the Mount Sion which he lo∣ved, that is, hee rejected Shiloh which stood in the Tribe of Ephraim, and the Tabernacle of Ioseph, because Ephraim was Iosephs sonne. The Tabernacle was transported from Shiloh to Nob,The Tabernacle caried to Nob. a Citie of the Priests unto which David did flie; from thence it was transported to Gibeon, a Citie in the Tribe of Benjamin, where it remained untill Salomon brought it to Ierusalē, 2 Chro. 1.3. And Salomon & al the Congregation with him went unto the high place which was in Gibeon;Salomon brought the Tabernacle to Ieru∣salem. for there was the Tabernacle of the Congregation of God, which Moyses the servant of God had made in the Wildernesse.
From thence Salomon brought the Tabernacle of the Congregation into the Temple of the Lord, 2 Cor. 5.5.6.7. And the Priests brought the Arke of the covenant of the Lord unto his owne place; but the Tabernacle, as the Hebrewes say, was layd up without any more use. When the Arke and the Tabernacle were separated, whether might they worship in any other place then be∣fore the Arke or the Tabernacle? Who might sacrifice in other places then at the Arke or Taberna∣cle.These who had an extraordinarie warrant, as Sa∣lomon, David, and such, sacrificed in other places; as Samuel sacrificed at Rama, and David built an Altar in the threshing floore of Arauna the Iebusite, and sacrifi∣ced there; and the Hebrewes say, Aram privatam non esse licitam nisi Prophetis. Sometimes the sacri∣fice, Priest and place are changed.In extraordinary sacrifices yee shall see sometimes the place onely changed, as in Samuel and Davids sacri∣ficing; sometimes the Lord changed the place, the sacrifice, and the Priests; he changed the sacrifice when Gideon had prepared a Kid for a feast to the Angell, the Kid was onely to bee offered in a sacrifice for the sinne of the Prince,Gideons sacrifice. Leviticus. 4.2. yet hee offered the Kid here; then no sacrifice was boiled before it was offered; but this was boiled first, and then offered; then he offered the bread for the meat offering, and the broth for the drinke offering: and the Priest was changed, the Angell was the Priest, and Gi∣deon was the Levite; and last the place was changed. The Lord who is the lawgiver, and giveth lawes to men, and not to himselfe, he may change time, place, and person as he pleaseth. What are we to thinke of Salomons sacrificing in Gibe∣on, 1 King. 3.3. And Salomon loved the Lord walking in his statutes, as David his father, onely hee sacrificed and burnt incense in high places. Salomon sacrificed upon the brasen Altar which was
in Gibeon, as his father did, 1 Chr. 1.30.Salomon sinned not in offering in Gibeon. this is not set downe as a blemish to Salomon, as if he had done any thing otherwise then his father; for he loved the Lord, and walked in his statutes as his father David: est particula re∣strictiva, non exclusiva vel exceptiva. and rak here is not particula exceptiva vel exclusiva, but onely restrictiva; that is, he sacrified in no other places, but onely in the place where hee saw his father sacri∣fice. What are we to thinke of the peoples sacrificing in the high places before the Temple was built, 1 King. 3. onely the people sacrificed in the high places; because there was no house built unto the name of the Lord in those dayes. Three sorts of those who sacrificed before the Temple was builded.Some answer that there were three sorts of those who sacrificed in those dayes, first, those who sacrificed to the true God in a place appointed by him; second∣ly, some sacrificing to the true God, but in a place not appointed or allowed; and thirdly, some sacrificing to Idols in a place not appointed by him: and they make the people sacrificing in high places because the Tem∣ple was not built yet, to be worshippers of the second sort;The high places in the Scriptures usually are taken in an evill sense. but if we shall looke in what sense the high places are taken usually in the Scriptures, we shall finde that they signifie a place where they worshipped false gods. What Altars are these, Psal. 84.3. which David speak∣eth of when he saith, yea the Sparrow hath found a house, and the Swallow a nest for her selfe where she may lay her young ones, even thine Altar; Seeing no uncleane thing was permitted to enter within the Temple; and the Hebrewes write, inhibens corvum that there was cole gnorebb a scar-crow set up upon the Temple to fright the foules, that they might not come neare it. What Altars are meant that David speaketh of.By the Altars here, are meant the Altars which were built in the high places to the Lord by the Prophets,
before the Temple was built; for as yet Salomons Tem∣ple was not builded: or it may be sayd that David spake this by the spirit of prophesie, of the Altars in the time of the captivitie, when the Swallowes built their nests in the ruins of the Altars. What Altars doth Elias meane of, when hee saith, they have destroyed thine Altars, seeing now there were no Altars in the high places, which were the Lords Al∣tars? They have destroyed thy Altars, that is, all the meanes of thy worship;By Altars is meant the meanes of Gods wor∣ship. or if we take the Altars literally, it may be understood of those Altars built by the Pro∣phets extraordinarily after the Temple was built, as Elias built an Altar in mount Carmel. The Iewes adde farther, that all the times that they sacrificed upon these Altars, they sacrificed a female and not a male, 1 Sam. 7.9. vajagnalehu, & obtulit ipsum; but the critickes of the Iewes, the Masoreth readeth it va∣jagnaleah, that is, they offered a female upon these Al∣tars, and not a male. It was a fault to offer in the high places after the Temple was buil∣ded.Offering of sacrifice upon the high places was found fault with after the Temple was built; Iehosaphat is blamed for this, that he tooke not away the highplaces, 1 King. 22.43. and likewise Asa, 1 King. 15.14. because he tooke not away the high places; but the Lord com∣mended Ezekiah much for taking away the high places, yet Rabsache blamed him for taking away these high places and Altars, Esay 36.7. The Conclusion of this is, the Lord by degrees with∣drew his typicall presence from the Iewes, first, he se∣parated the Arke and the Tabernacle, secondly, the Arke from the Temple, thirdly, hee destroyed the Temple, that they might looke onely to him who was both the Arke, the Tabernacle, and the Temple.
EXERCITAT. VI. Of the situation of the Citie of Jerusalem. A ceremoniall appendix of Command 2. Psal. 48. Beautifull for situation, the joy of the whole earth is mount Sion, on the sides of the north the City of the great king. IErusalem was compassed about with Hils and Val∣leyes, the Hiles were Gareb, Calvarie, Gihon, Aceldamae,The Hils compassed Ierusalem. Olivet, the Valleyes were the Valley of dead Carkases, Tyropaeum, the Valley of Iehosophat or hinnon, or the Kings dale. The Citie it selfe stood upon foure Hils,The Hils upon which Ierusalem stood. Sion to∣wards the south; Akra towards the north, upon which Salem stood; Moriah betwixt Sion and Akra; and Beze∣tha betwixt Akra and Moriah; and betwixt Sion and Moriah lay the great gulfe of Millo. Vpon every one of these hills there is some notable thing to be observed:Some memorable things done on every one of the Hils. upon mount Gareb all the Lepers were put, therefore it is called, the hill of Scabbes, Iere. 31.39. upon mount Calvarie Christ was crucified; up∣on Gihon Salomon was anoynted King; In Aceldama was the potters field which was bought with the price of the just one, for the buriall of strangers, Amos 2.6. Act. 1.19. upon mount Olivet Christ was taken up to Hea∣ven. Vpon mount Sion stood the fort of the Iebusites,The Citie of David stood in Sion. which David taking in afterwards, called it the Citie of David, there he built his house. In mount Akra stood the old Citie Salem, where Melchizedeck dwelt, and it is called
Akra from hakkara, obviam veniens. obviam venit, because there hee met Abraham and blessed him when he returned from the slaughter of the Kings,In mount Moriah Abra¦ham would have offe∣red his sonne. Gen. 14.19. Vpon mount Moriah Abraham would have offered his sonne Isaac, Gen. 22 and here the Angell stood with a drawne sword in his hand above the threshing floore of Arauna the Ie∣busite; and upon this mount afterwards was the Temple of Salomon builded. The new towne of Ierusalem stood in Be∣zetha called the upper Mercat.In Bezetha was builded the new towne of Ierusalem, called forum inferius, in respect of forum superius that was in Sion. To the north of Bezetha and Akra stood the new towne builded by Hezekiah which he compas∣sed round about with a wall called murus tertius, for the first wall was builded by David round about Sion, even to the Sheep-gate; the second wall was builded by Salomon round about Bezetha, and joyned with the first wall at the Sheepe-gate; the third wall was buil∣ded by Hezekiah joyning it to the old wall of the City Salem, and compassed round about mount Akra to the water gate, where it joyned with the second wall. The gulfe Millo.Millo was a deepe gulfe lying to the north of Sion, & to the south of Moriah; this gulfe Salomon filled up when he builded his owne house, the Queenes house and the house of Lebanon. Mount Sion in which the City of David stood, was called the upper towne, and the rest that were towards, the north of it, Ierusalem superior.  Ierusalem inferior. Salem and Bezetha, were called the nether towne, and to this the Apostle alludeth, Gal. 4.25. Ierusalem which is beneath, and Ierusalem which is above; Ierusalem which is above signified anogogical∣lie the triumphant Church, but allegorically the free children begotten within the covenant of grace; and Ierusalem below signified the children of the bond wo∣man; and for this cause it is put in the duall number
Ierusalaijm; because it consisteth of two Cities which the Greekes call . So Iacobs armie is called mahanaijm, consisting of two armies, one hea∣venly, another earthly; to these two Salomon compa∣reth the Church, Cant 6.13. what will yee see in the Shu¦lamite; as it were the company of Manaham, or two armies, shee consisted partly of Citizens in the triumphant Church, and partly of Citizens in the militant. Ierusalem is sometimes called Sion,Ierusalem is sometimes called Sion, and some∣times Moriah. and sometimes Moriah, and Sion is called, the hill of God, Psal. 68.15. that is, an excellent hill; for the Hebrewes wanting the superlative, they supply it by adding the name God, by which they understand that which is most excellent and great in that kind, Psal. 80.11. The trees of it were like the Cedars of God, that is, excellent Cedars, So 1 Sam. 18.10. the evill spirit of the Lord came upon Saul, that is, a very evill spirit. So Ierusalem is called the daughter of Sion, that is, Sion herselfe, as the Sonne of man, that is, a man. When Ierusalem and Sion are set together,Ierusalem and Sion put together for the more earnest expression. they are so to be understood, as a repetition of the selfe-same thing for the more earnest expression, as Zach. 9.9. O daughter of Sion, O daughter of Ierusalem, here the explaining of the one word by the other, carieth a great weight with it. So Psal. 92.9. For loe thine enemies, O Lord, for loe, thine enemies, O Lord, shall perish, that is, they shall surely perish. Moriah is also taken for all the hils whereupon the City stood, Gen. 22.2. Goe to the Land of vision, that is,Moriah taken largely for all the hils in Ierusalem. to the land of Moriah, but Abraham seeing that excel∣lent vision, vers. 14. of which Christ spake, Ioh. 8.56. Abraham rejoyced to see my day, he appropriated the ge∣nerall name, particularly to this mountaine, and called it Moriah. How is David sayd to bring the head of Goliah to
Ierusalem, 1 Sam. 17.54. seeing he had not taken in Ieru∣salem a long time after? That part of Ierusalem which stood in the tribe of Benjamin was taken in by Saul before, and to this part David brought the head of Goliah; but the other part was possessed still by the Iebusites untill David was crowned King both over Israel and Iuda, and the first victory that he got after he was crowned King over both Israel and Iuda, was over the Iebusites. Ierusalem is called the midst of the earth, Ezek. 38.12. in the originall Tabbur, vmbilicus, me∣taphorice Locus editus. why Ierusalem is called the midst or the navil of the earth umbilicus, because it stood upon the hils, as the Navell doth in the Bodie; by this is un∣derstood that parable of Gaal, Iudg. 9.37. Behold people came downe from the Navell of the earth, that is, from Ie∣rusalem, hence all the Regions round about Ierusalem take their denomination from the situation of it,Other countries take their denominations from the situation of Ierusalem. Psal. 89.12. the north and the sea thou hast created them, and it is called the north in respect of Ierusalem. So Psalm. 107.3. From the East, and from the West, and from the North, & from the sea. Here the mediterranean Sea in the Scriptures is put for the South in respect of Ierusalem; therefore the situation of the heavens is not taken from the body of man in the Scripture,The situation of the heavens is taken from the Lord dwelling be∣twixt the Cherubims. as the Philosophers say, but from the Lord dwelling betwixt the Cherubims in the west end of the Temple of Ierusalem; who sitteth be∣twixt the Cherubims, est vespera occa∣sus  est locus campestis, et pluraliter  Coeli: hinc est quod quidam verte∣runt Equitat super ad Occasum: Alii, Insidet amoenitatibus: Alii, E∣quitat super Coelos. looking alwayes towards the East, and then his right hand was to the South, and his left hand to the North, Psal. 68.4. extoll him, qui equi∣tat super ad occsum, who rideth upon the West; because the Cherubims stood in the west end of the Temple. The Conclusion of this is, Ierusalem being in the center of the earth, and the line of the Gospel going out from it to be preached through the whole earth, to gather in the Church of the Gentiles to the Iewes, whereby they might make a compacted Citie; therefore glorious
things are spoken of it. So Ier. 3.17. All the Nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the Lord to Ierusalem, in the originall it is, Venikevu, They shall run in a line; linea corum. for the Gospel went out from Ierusalem, the sound there∣of went to the ends of the earth, Psal. 19.5. in the originall it is, the line thereof: for Ierusalem was as the center, and the lines went from the center to the ends of the whole earth, and the same way that the lines went out from it: So shall all Nations returne by the same lines, and bee gathered in to Ierusalem which is above. EXERCITAT. VII. In what Tribe the Temple stood. A ceremoniall appendix of Command. 2. Ezek. 43.12. This is the Law of the house, Vpon the top of the mountaine the whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy: behold this is the Law of the house. THat we may the better understand to what Tribe the Temple of Ierusalem did belong,Why the Tribes were kept distinct. we must marke that the Lord commanded in his Law that neyther the Tribes, their possessions, nor generations should be con∣founded; to the end, they might know of what Tribe Christ should come, who was to come of the seede of David according to the flesh: therefore he caused to di∣vide the Land into Tribes, Num. 36.2. and he comman∣ded that they should not dispone of their possessions eyther amongst themselves, or to strangers; therefore if a poore man for poverty had morgaged his possessi∣on, the Lord appointed the yeere of Iubile that it might returne to him againe that yeere, Levit. 15.10.
To which Tribe the Temple belonged.Now Iuda having gotten his lot, and Benjamin his (for upon these two Tribes the Temple did stand) the que∣stion is, to which of these it did belong? for sometimes it is given to the Tribe of Iuda, Iosh. 15.63. as for the Ie∣busites the inhabitants of Ierusalem, the children of Israel could not drive them out, verbum contrarie significationis but the Iebusites dwell with the children of Iudah at Ierusalem unto this day, In the origi∣nall it is, Iarash, exhareditare, to cast them out of their possessions.The Temple ascribed to the Tribe of Benjamin. Sometimes to the Tribe of Benjamin, Iudg. 1.25. Iosh. 18.20. and Nehe. 11.24. Ierusalem could not belong to them both alike, for mount Moriah standeth betwixt the upper and lower Citie, the upper belong∣ed to the Tribe of Iuda, and the lower to Benjamin, but to which of the Tribes doth mount Moriah belong? it seemeth to be ascribed to the Tribe of Benjamin by the testament of Iacob,Why Benjamin is cal∣led a ravening Woolfe. as the scepter to the Tribe of Iuda; for Iacob saith in his testament, Benjamin shall ra∣vine as a Woolfe: in the morning he shall devoure the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoyle, Gen. 49.27. by which is signified the Altar upon which the sacrifices were burnt, and the blood powred out at the foote of the Altar: for the Priests killed the sacrifice in the morning, and divided the spoyle, that is, the things which they had gotten from the people, they divided amongst themselves at night; they call the Altar the ravening Woolfe, and the Priests the dividers of the spoyle. The Temple ascribed to the Tribe of Iuda.Againe the Tribe of Iuda vendicateth the Temple to them, Psal. 78.67. he refused the Tabernacle of Ioseph, and chose not the Tribe of Ephraim; but chose the Tribe of Iuda, the mount Sion which he loved, and he built his san∣ctuary like high places, like the earth which he hath establish∣ed for ever, meaning the Temple, which was builded in this Tribe. But that we may decide the question, we must marke that the Temple was builded upon mount Moriah,
2 Chron. 3.1.The Temple was buil∣ded upon mount Mo∣riah. this mount Moriah was divided from mount Akra by a great valley, but in the time of the Macchabees they filled up this valley, that they might joyne the Citie to the Temple, and made the top of mount Akra lower, that they might see the Temple in the Citie. The upper and the neather Citie were divided by a great valley which Iosephus calleth Tyropoeon,How the upper and neather Citie of Ieru∣salem were divided. & in the Scriptures Millo. If the line be drawne through this valley, then it leaveth Sion towards the South in the Tribe of Iuda, and mount Moriah with Salem and Akra towards the North, in the Tribe of Benjamin, but if the line be drawne through the valley which was fil∣led up by the Maccabees, then mount Moriah is con∣joyned with Sion in the Tribe of Iuda; for the Temple was builded in the threshing floore of Arauna the Iebu∣site; and the Iebusites dwelt upon mount Sion: there∣fore the division by this valley cannot shew us in what Tribe the Temple stood; So that we must search out another line, which separateth the Tribe of Iuda from Benjamin; which line being to the north of Iuda, must be upon the south of Benjamin, the two extreames of this line are set downe, Iosh. 15.5.The line which divided Iuda from Benjamin reached from the dead Sea to the Mediterra∣nean Sea. where he describeth the borders of Iuda; the cast part of the line tendeth towards the dead Sea, at that part where Iordan entereth into it, called Lingua maris; and the west part of the line tendeth towards the great Sea, called the mediterranean Sea; these are his words; For the east border was the salt Sea, even to the end of Ior∣dan, this was the dead Sea where Sodome and Gomorra stood, And their border in the north quarter, was from the bay of the Sea at the uttermost part of Iordan, Iosh 15.5.The line commeth from En-rogel thorow the valley of Hinnom to the tongue of the Sea. This was towards the east, the line was stretched forth to∣wards the west to En-rogel wch is a fountaine in the val∣ley of Hinnom where the valley Tyropoeon endeth. Now
if yee will stretch out the line from the fountaine of En-rogel to the tongue of the Sea, it must be drawne through the valley of Hinnom, to the north of mount Sion, and then it is subjoyned, vers. 9. (speaking of Mo∣riah) and the border was drawne from the top of the hill unto the fountaine of the water of Nephtoah, which is over a∣gainst Hinnom towards the west, and to the valley of Rephaim towards the north, for Iosh. 18.16. maketh mention of two valleyes, one towards the east of the Citie, called Hinnom, upon the west of which lieth the hill Moriah and the Temple; the other valley is called the valley of Rephaim or of Gyants, lying towardes the west and south of mount Sion, then the north part of that valley must stretch towards mount Moriah, and the line which divideth the Citie and the mountaine thereof to wit Moriah, in two parts, must touch the val∣ley of Rephaim towards the north,The line goeth directly over the top of Mount Moriah. the same division is set downe, Neh. 11.24. So that Benjamin had the north side of this line, and Iuda the south, and the line stretching over the top of mount Moriah, it went through the mid∣dle of the Temple, and through the holiest of all; so that the one halfe of the Temple stood in the Tribe of Iuda,The line goeth through the midst of the Tem∣ple, the holiest, and holiest of all, and betwixt the Cheru∣bims. and the other in the Tribe of Benjamin; the one halfe of the Arke in the one Tribe, and the other in the other; and of the foure Cherubims, two stood in one Tribe, and two in another; and God himselfe sitting betwixt the wings of the Cherubims is sayd to dwell (cethephau) betwixt his shoulders,How God is sayd to dwell betwixt his shoul∣ders. that is, in Ierusalem where the Temple stood in the very borders of Iuda and Benjamin. humerus vel extremitas alicu∣jus rei. Catheph signifieth the borders or mar∣ches, as if he should say, he shall dwell in the very outmost borders of Iuda and Benjamin. Now for the better understanding of these things which haue beene spoken before, marke this figure following.
West. North. East. South.
And for this cause it was that Salomon had in his throne twelve Lions upholding it, but on the seat where he sate and leaned his armes, there was a Bullock and a Lyon; the Lyon for Iuda and the Bullock for Benjamin: by which was signified;Why Salomons Throne had a Bullock and an Oxe. when ten Tribes should bee rent from his crowne, that Iuda, and Benjamin should cleave together and uphold the Temple; both Iuda and Benjamin went in captivitie together, came home to∣gether, and builded the Temple together. The Conclusion of this is, the kingdome and the priesthood should never be separated; for most of the Priests dwelt in the lower citie in the Tribe of Benjamin and the kingly Scepter was in Iuda the upper Ci∣tie. EXERCITAT. VIII. Of the Temple of Ierusalem. Commandement 2. 1 King. 8.30. Hearken thou to the supplication of thy servant, and of thy people Israel, when they shall pray towards this place. THe Lord made choise of this Temple, not so much for himselfe as for his people;The Lord causes to build the temple not so much for himselfe as for mans cause. for God dwelleth not in houses made with hands, Act. 7.48. God fitting himselfe to mans capacitie, doth as a Prince useth to doe; for as a Prince maketh choise of some great Citie for his residence; so doth the Lord make choise of Ierusalem:The Lord compared to a Prince in his princely house. therefore it is called the Ci∣tie of the great King, Matth. 5.36. and as a prince hath his palace within a great Citie; so hath the Lord his Tem∣ple
within Ierusalem; and therefore it is called the place of his habitation, Psal. 76.2. and as a Prince hath his pa∣lace distinguished in so many courts: so was the Temple of Ierusalem: and as they have their furnished Tables; so the Lord hath his Altar for his Table, Mala. 1.7.The Lord had his Ta∣ble and appointed times, as it were, for dinner and supper. and and his appointed time for dinner and supper, were the morning and evening Sacrifices, Psal. 50.10. Every beast of the forrest is mine, and the cattell upon a thousand hils. If I be hungry I will not tell thee. This Temple was called the throne of his glory, Iere. 14.21. So the perfection of beauty, and the joy of the whole earth, Lament. 2.15. So the place of his rest, Psal. 132.14. and 1 Chro. 6.41. It was divided into three parts, and therefore,The Temple divided in three parts. Iere. 7.4. useth a threefold repetition to note these three parts of the Temple. The first was the holiest, the Seventy call it ,Divers names en to the holiest. it is also called Oraculum; Exod. 25.22. and it called San∣ctum Sanctorum, the holy of the holiest, because it was separated from all profane uses, Heb. 9.14. and because it was holy, the Highpriest who went into it, behoved to sanctifie himselfe before hee went into it, and hee was a type of Christ, who was holy, blamelesse and unde∣filed, and separated from sinners, Heb. 26.7. The second part of the Temple was called  vel Sanctum, and here the Priest did foure things, first,What things the Priests did in the holy place. hee trimmed the lampes and lighted them, secondly, hee cleansed the Altar, thirdly, he prepared the Table for the shewbread, and fourthly, he offered incense. Before they entred into the holy place,The two Pillars what they signified. there stood two great pillars, Iachin and Boaz, Stabilitie and strength, 1 King. 7.21. which signifieth the indurance of the spi∣rituall Temple the Church, that the gates of Hell should not prevaile against her, Matth. 16.17. So they signified the Apostles, who are called pillars, Gal. 2.9. and likewise all
Christians, Reve. 3.12. him that overcommeth will I make a piller in the Temple of my God. What things were done betwixt the porch and the Altar.Betwixt this porch and the Altar the Priests hum∣bled themselves, and wept in the day of humiliation, Ioel. 2.17. it was in this place that Zacharie was stoned to death, 2 Chro. 24.21. So here stood five and twenty men, with their backs towards the Temple, and their faces to∣ward the East, and they worshipped the Sunne, Ezek. 8.16. and there was the court of the people, and last the court of the Gentiles, where the Proselytes stood when they were converted, this was farthest from the holiest of all; therefore it is sayd, that the Publican stood afarre off, Luk. 18.13. meaning from the holiest, it was out of this place where Christ drove away the buyers and sel∣lers, and the entrie to this was called the beautifull gate, or Salomons Porch, Act. 3.2. Why the court of the Gentils was left out.This court of the Gentiles was to be left out and not to be measured, Reve. 11.2. but the court which is without the Temple, leave out, and measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles, this was done to signifie the multitude of the Gentiles that were to be called, that this court could not containe them. A comparison betwixt the first and second Temple. FIrst, both the first and second Temple were builded by Iewes and Tyrians; the first Temple, 1 King. 5.18. and Salomons builders, and Hirams builders did hew them,The Iewes and Tyrians were builders of the first and second Temple. &c. So the Tyrians helped to build the se∣cond Temple, Ezr. 2.7. and they signifie the diversi∣tie of gifts which are requisite for the building of the Church, and that people of all Nations shall have ac∣cesse to the Church. The second Temple was built after the manner of the first, the patterne of the first Temple was shewed to
David, and he shewed to it to Salomon.The second Temple was built after the man∣ner of the first. So the patterne of the second Temple was shewed to Ezekiel, and hee shewed it to Zerubbabel. The glory and splendor of the first Temple farre exceeded the second:The outward beautie of the first Temple ex∣ceeded the Glory of the second. the first Temple was all built of hewen and polished stone, but not the second; and where it is sayd in the Gospel that the Temple was adorned with goodlie stones and gifts, Luk. 21.5. that is meant onely of Solomons Porch, & that part which look∣eth towards mount Olivet, for Christ fate upon mount Olivet when they shewed him that goodly sight; but the rest of the Temple was not of such polished stone. Secondly, the glory of the first Temple,The Temple is called gold. it was all gilded within, and therefore it is called gold, Lament. 4.1. How is the gold become dimme? How is the most fine gold changed? the stones of the Sanctuary are powred out in the top of every streete, but there was no such gilding in the second Temple. Thirdly,The first Temple was built without noyse, but not so the second. there was no hammer heard in the building of the first Temple, but there was much noyse heard in the laying of the foundation of the second Temple, Ezra. 3.12. and in the building of it, for with the one hand they wrought in the worke, and with the other hand held a weapon, Nehem. 4.17. Fourthly, the first Temple was filled with a cloud,Many things wanting in the second Temple which were in the first. but not the second. In the first Temple there came a fire from heaven to kindle the Sacrifice, but not in the second; the Arke and the holy oyle were not in the se∣cond, there were many more Prophets in the first than in the second; the second Temple was often de∣filed by the Greekes, by the Romans, by Antiochus; but not the first, Yet the glory of the second Temple farre exceeded the glory of the first, Hag. 2.9.The second Temple exceeded the first Tem∣ple in glory. The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former, saith the Lord of
hosts; for in this place I will give peace, saith the Lord of hosts. In place of the gold in the first, was Iesus Christ in the second Temple, in whom are hid all the treasures of wisedome and knowledge, Coloss. 2.3. In place of the poli∣shed and hewen stones in the first Temple,How the second Tem- exceeded the first. was Iesus Christ in the second Temple, a living stone, and his members, as lively stones, are built up a spirituall house, 1 Pet. 2.4.5. The glory of which was in the first Tem∣ple left it; but the glory of the second Temple, Iesus Christ, promiseth to bee with us unto the end of the world. Salomon who built the first Temple fell away to Idolatry, but Zerobabel who built the second Temple fell not to Idolatry; the first Temple had the holy oyle; but in the second Temple came Iesus Christ, who was anointed with the oyle of gladnesse above his fel∣lowes, Psal. 45.7. Now because of all these priviledges of the second Temple above the first, therefore Christ is sayd to come to his Temple, Malac. 3.1. A comparison betwixt the Temple and Christ. All that was in the Temple were types of Christ.EVery thing which was in the Temple, was a type of Christ; the vaile was a type of his flesh, Heb. 10.20. the golden Altar, of his intercession, Reve. 8.3. and the brasen Altar, of his passion. Because this Temple was a type of the bodie of Christ, Ioh. 2.19. destroy this Temple, and in three dayes I will raise it up. Therefore no man might carry a vessell through it,The reverence that was had to the Tem∣ple being a type of Christ. Mark. 11.16. No man might walke upon the top of it, therefore when the Divell tooke Christ up and set him upon it, and his slaves who tooke Iames the Apostle and threw him downe from the top of it, they did that which was altogether forbidden to the Iewes.
A comparison betwixt the Temple and Heaven. THe Temple was made in weight number and mea∣sure, Ezek. 43.10. expendit numero, pondere & measura. and this word is applyed to the Heavens, Ezek. 40.12. to teach us to make an anago∣gicall application from the Temple to the heavens; and therefore the Temple is called Heaven, 2 Chro. 6.30. Psal. 11.4. The Lord is in his holy Temple, the Lords Throne is in Heaven. There was a controversie betwixt the Samaritans and the Iewes, whether the Temple of Ierusalem,The contention be∣twixt the Samaritans and Iewes for the place of Gods worship. or the Temple of Samaria was the place of Gods worship. Christ endeth this controversie, Ioh. 4.21. when hee saith, The houre commeth, when yee shall neyther in this mountaine, nor yet at Ierusalem worship the father. And to shew how that Ierusalem should be no more the place of Gods worship, first he separated the Arke from the Tabernacle; secondly, the Arke from the Temple;God remooved from the Temple by de∣grees. and then shortly afterwards he destroyed the Temple. Ieremiah complayneth in his time, that the Lord was like a stranger in the Land, and as a wayfaring man, that turneth aside to tarrie for a night, Iere. 14.8. A wayfaring man that tarrieth but for a night in an Inne, hath but little care of it: So the Lord began now to bee a stran∣ger, and to take little care of this Inne his Temple, where he was wont to lodge, and now he was to for∣sake it for ever. The Conclusion of this is, there is now no appoin∣ted place for the worship of God, nor ever shall bee; therefore the Iewes, who have the veile upon their hearts, are very blind, who hope yet, that the Tem- of Ierusalem shall be built againe. When they pray, they ever turne their faces towards the Temple of Ierusalem; and when they see a new house builded, they marke
the white wall with a blacke sticke, a con∣traction which is  nigrum super album, Recordare vastationis. and they leave a little space wherein they write those words, nigrum su∣per album, and under this they write, recordare vastatio∣nis; they marke the white wall with a blacke sticke, to signifie, that they mourne, because Ierusalem is not built as that new wall is built; and they pray the Lord to remember the destruction of Ierusalem, and to have pitie upon it, and they say, Psal. 137.4. If I forget thee, O Ierusalem, &c. EXERCITAT. IX. Of the Cherubims. A ceremoniall appendix of Command. 2. Exod. 25.18. And thou shalt make two Cherubims of Gold: of beaten Gold shalt thou make them, in the two ends of the Mercie-seat. THey are called Cherubims from the Hebrew word Racabh to ride, Cherubinus  equitare.  Seraphin angeli quia celeritate & aspectus splendore quasi flammantes & ignei visi sunt a  ussit. because the Lord did ride betwixt them, Psal. 18.10. He rode upon a Cherub, and he sitteth betweene the Cherubims, Psal. 99.1. therefore they are called Mercahhak hashekina, the Chariot of Gods Majestie. They are also called Seprahim from Saraph to burne, because the Angels his Ministers are a slaming fyre, Psal. 104.4. and the fyrie Angel or the Seraphin touched the lips of the Prophet Esay with a live-coale which hee had taken with the Tongs from off the Altar, Esa. 6.6. The first place that we reade of these Cherubims, is,
Gen. 3.24. He placed at the east end of the Garden of Eden Cherubims and a flaming Sword. And hence it is probable that the history of Genesis was written after that the Tabernacle was erected in the wildernesse, for Moyses writeth of them, as of things heard and knowne a∣mongst the people. They are painted as young men and not like boyes or children,The Angels are painted as young men. and so the Angels appeared in the likenesse of young men, Mark. 16.5. And entring into the Sepul∣chre they saw a young man sitting on the right side cloathed in a long white garment. They are made in a comely forme and wel favoured,They are painted in a comely forme. whereas the Divell (although he can transforme him∣selfe into an Angel of light) appeareth usually in terri∣ble and evill favoured shapes, corvus atramentum diabolus therefore there is but one word in the Syriacke both for the Raven, Inke, and for the Divell; because he appeareth blacke like the Ra∣ven.The Cherubims had not foure faces but foure shapes or habits.  fignificat aspectum, formam vel habitum. They are not painted with foure faces, as it is com∣monly holden, for panim, facies, Eze. 1.10. is not taken for the face, but for the forme or habite. Luk. 9.53. And they did not receive him, because his face was, as though he would goe to Ierusalem, that is, his habite; hee lookt as though hee would goe to Ierusalem. So the Cherubims in somethings they lookt like man, in their faces; they went streight up as having legges and thighs, then they were like the Lion in something, in their necke and brest like the crest of the Lion; and like the Eagle in their wings; and like the Calfe or the Oxe in their feete. Therefore those are mistaken who thinke that they had foure faces, and from them the Egyptians borrowed their Sphinges, 1 Macchs. 3.48. And they layd o∣pen the booke of the Law wherein the heathen had sought to paint the likenesse of their Images, that is, they sought to paint their Images like the Cherubims; the man in the
Cherub hath the face, because man of all visible crea∣tures is the most understanding, and is Lord over the rest. What their wings signified.They had wings to signifie their readinesse and pro∣tection, and David alludeth to this, Psal. 17.18. Hide me under thy wings, and the King of Tyrus is called a Cherub, because of his protecting the people that were under him, Ezek. 28.14. When one forme of the Cherubims is expressed all the rest are under∣stood.When a Cherub is described by any of these foure, all the rest are to be understood. Example, 1 King. 7.29. And on the borders that were betweene the ledges, were Lions, Oxen, & Cherubims; [And] here, is exegeticum, and not copulativum, that is, he made Cherubims which had the likenesse of Oxen and Lyons. They had sixe wings, with two they covered their faces, and with two they covered their feete, and with two they did flee, and it is probable that the Cheru∣bims in the Tabernacle and Temple had sixe wings al∣so, although they did not flie, two to cover their faces, two to cover their feete, and two stretched out: their feete was covered,The Lord would have the Cherubims covered and not to appeare naked. the Lord would not have them to appeare naked; therefore yee shall see when they ap∣peared to men they appeared cloathed, Act. 1.10. Two men stood by them in white apparell. So Mark. 16.5. and the Prests are commanded to put on breaches, when they come before the Lord, to cover their naked∣nesse. Lev. 10.26. Ezek. 24.18. The wings are put for their hands.They are made with wings, and, in that vision of Eze∣kiel, with hands under their wings, Eze. 1.8. but where they are described with wings, and no mention made of their hands, then their wings served them for hands, and so the Hebrews put a wing for a hand, Psal. 7.4. If there be iniquitie in mine hands, in alls vel manibus meis. in the Hebrew it is becaphai, in my wing. And they appeared in these formes, quae notant Chri∣sti
trophaeum,The divers formes of the Cherubims signifie Christ glorious triumph. which sheweth Christs triumph and victo∣rie; who was borne as a man; killed as a Calfe; rose like a Lyon; and ascended like an Eagle: and so in the revelation made to Iohn, were foure beasts full of eyes be∣fore and behind and the first beast was like a Lyon, and the second beast like a Calfe, and the third beast had the face of a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying Eagle, Revel. 4.7. Now let us observe the difference betwixt the Che∣rubims in the Tabernacle and the Cherubims in the Temple;The difference betwixt the Cherubims in the Temple and Taber∣nacle. there were but two in the Taberna∣cle, and foure in the Temple; those who stood in the Tabernacle looked downeward with their faces to∣wards the propitiatorie, but two of the Cherubims which were in the Temple, and stood upon the ground, looked with their faces to the entrie of the Temple, and they had their wings stretched out, not as their wings which stood upon the Arke in the Tabernacle; and the signification was this, that now their charge was to be extended, and the Gentiles were to be called to waite upon them also. Againe,Difference betwixt the Cherubims which Eze∣kiel saw, and them in the Tabernacle and Temple. marke a difference betwixt the Cherubims in Ezekiels vision, and these in the Tabernacle and Tem∣ple. In Ezekiels vision they are described full of eyes, but in the Tample and Tabernacle they are not so de∣scribed: they are described full of eyes,  to signifie that the Lord whom they attend is full of eyes, and seeth all things. Those Cherubims in Ezekiels vision moved, but these in the Temple and Tabernacle stirred not; when these moved, they moved forwards but never backe∣ward or in a circle, they stood still at the commande∣ment of the Lord or went forward at his comman∣dement. In Esaiahs vision they cryed holy, holy, holy, is the Lord
of hosts, Esa. 6.13. but in Ezekiels vision they made but a sound or a noyse. What an Angell is.Of this which hath beene sayd wee may describe a Cherub or an Angell after this manner. An Angell is a creature most understanding, most strong, most swift, and most obedient. First, they are most understanding, therefore they have the face of a man, and they are full of eyes, to teach us that they exceede man in know∣ledge, men are but ratiocinantes creaturae, and they are intelligentes creatura, they learne hoc post hoc, sed non hoc ex hoc, as men doe. Why was the blood then commanded to be sprink∣led upon the Lintels of the doores of the Israelites in Egypt, but to teach them to passe by their houses, as we are led by the Signe to know the house? The blood was not sprinkled upon the Lintels of the doors for the Angels cause, that they might be led to know the houses by this signe, but it was to confirme the Israelites that the Angels should not destroy them. The second property of Angels is their strength, re∣presented by the Lyon, Robustissimi. and therefore they are called the strong ones, Psal. 78.25. one of them killed an hundred fourescore and five thousand in one night, 2 King. 19.35. The third property of the Angels is their sweetnesse represented by the Eagle, one Angell killed all the first borne of Egypt in one night, Exod. 12.29. The fourth propertie is their obedience represented by the Oxe, therefore we pray, thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven, Matth. 6.10. The Conclusion of this is, this doth minister great comfort to the faithfull, that they have such ministering spirits attending upon them continually,The children of God have protection by the Angels. to keepe them in all their wayes; Alexander the Great slept soundly one night when the enemie was neare by him; and be∣ing
asked how he could sleepe so soundly; he answered, because Parmenio waked: vigilantes. So may the children of God lye downe in peace and sleepe, Psal. 4.8. because they have gnirin, the watchfull ones attending them, Dan. 4.17. Salo∣mon had sixtie valiant men of the valiant of Israel having all swords because of feare in the night, Cant. 3.7. but the chil∣dren of God have more strong and valient ons wai∣ting upon them, so that they neede not be affrayd nei∣ther in the day or in the night. EXERCITAT. X. Of the golden Candlesticke. A eremoniall Appendix of Command 2. Exod. 25.31. And thou shalt make a Candlesticke of pure Gold, of beaten worke shall the Candlesticke be made; his shaft and his branches, his bowels, his knops, and his flowers shall be of the same. THe matter of which this Candlesticke was made, was pure Gold, and it had a shaft, branches, bowlse, knops and flowers. The pure gold signified how excellent the word of God is, Psal. 19.10. more to be desired are they then gold,The signification of the Candlesticke. yea then much fine gold. We are not curiously here to seeke the difference of the knops, branches and flowers, but onely to rest in the generall, that the Candlesticke signified the Word. The Candlesticke had seven branches, it signified
the divers gifts bestowed upon his Church by the word,The branches of the Candlesticke signified the divers gifts bestow∣ed upon the Church. and Iohn alludeth to the seven branches of this Candlesticke, Revel. 1.13. And in the midst of the seven Candlesticks one like the Sonne of man cloathed with a gar∣ment; this was but typus arbitrarius, or an allusion; for the golden Candlesticke was not made to be a type of the seven Churches in Asia, but it is onely an allusion to it. So Prov. 11.30. The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, here is an allusion onely, that it is like to the tree of life. The oyle in the Taber∣nacle was pure oyle.The oyle which was in this Candlesticke was pure oyle, Levit. 24.2. Command the children of Israel that they bring unto thee pure oyle Olive, beaten, for the light, to cause the lampes to burne continually: aurum, hic est oleum, sic dictum, quod purm splendidum & nit idum fuit & sine mixtura. This pure oyle is called golden oyle, or gold for the puritie of it, Zach. 4.12. because the oyle was bright, cleare and glistering like gold. So Iob. 37.22. Gold commeth out of the north, that is, faire and cleare weather. It was beaten oyle, to signifie with what paine and travell the word is prepared, and with patience preached and made to shine in his Church. No Waxe might be burnt in these lampes, because Honey was uncleane, therefore Waxe was uncleane; Honey might be in no Sacrifice, because it fermenteth, Levit. 2.11. So no Waxe might serue for light. So there was no silke in the Tabernacle, because the Worme which maketh silke was an uncleane thing. baccae  spicaeThe Prophet Zacharie in a vision saw two Olive branches empyting themselves thorow the two golden pipes into the Candlesticke, and they are compared to two eares of corne,What the two Olive trees were in the visi∣on of Zacharie. because they were full of Olive berries, as the eares were of graines. These Olive trees were the cause of the preservation of the Church, and the cause of the maintenance in the Candlesticke.
The two annointed ones which stand before the Lord of the whole earth, vers. 14. Targum paraphraseth them to be Zerubbabel and Ioshua, who represented the Church and commonwealth. The Lord commanded to make snuffers of pure gold for the snuffing of the lampes,The snuffers of gold what they signified. and snuffe-dishes to re∣ceive the snufle; he would have the snuffe taken from the light, to signifie that he would have the word kept in sinceritie and puritie; and hee would have the snuffers of gold, to teach them to be blamelesse and ho∣ly, who are censurers and correctors of others; and he would have the snuffe-dishes of gold, to teach them that the covering of the offences of their brethren was a most excellent thing. Lastly, in what manner the Priests dressed the lamps;The manner how the Priests trimmed the lampes. when the lampe was out, he lighted it, and when it was not out, he dressed it; when the middlemost lampe was out, he lighted it from the Altar; but the rest of the lampes every one he lighted from the lampe that was next; and he lighted one after another, to signifie, that one Scripture giveth light to another; & they say in the Talmud, that the cleansing of the innermost Altar was before the trimming of the five lamps; and the trim∣ming of the five lamps before the blood of the daily sacrifice; and the blood of the daily sacrifice before the trimming of the two lamps; and the trimming of the two lamps, before the burning of incense. That the Priests should order and trimme the lamps,The signification of the trimming of the lamps. signifieth how Christ and his Ministers should conti∣nually looke unto the purity of doctrine and preaching of the light of the Gospel from evening to morning, in the darke place of this world, untill the day dawne and the day starre arise in our hearts, Reve. 1.13. 2 Pet. 1.19.
EXERCITAT. XI. Of the Table of the shewbread. A ceremoniall appendix of Commande. 2. Exod. 25.23. Thou shalt also make a Table of Shittim wood, &c. vers. 30. And thou shalt set upon the Table shewbread before me alway. THe Lord commanded to make a Table, and to set twelve loaves upon it. The loaves represent the Church.First, the Church is represented by loaves here; as many graines make up one loafe: so many beleevers make up one Church, 1 Cor. 10.17. for we being many are one bread. The loaves made of fine flower.Secondly, these loaves were made of fine flower, and not of barley which was a base graine, and there∣fore used in no other sacrifice but in the offering for jealousie, Num. 5.15. So Gideon represented by a barley cake, Iudg. 7.13. and I bought her for so many Homers of Barley, Hos. 3.2. but the Wheate was most excellent graine, and the flower of the Wheat was most excellent bread, Deut. 32.14. he made them eate the fat of the kid∣neys of Wheate. The twelve loaves represented the twelve tribes.Thirdly, there stood twelve loaves upon this Table, to represent the twelve Tribes who came of the twelve Patriarchs:The Tribes were repre∣sented by many things. these twelve Tribes were represented by many things, by the twelve stones set up in Iordan, and so by the twelve stones set up in the land of Canaan, So by the twelve stones set upon the breastplate of Aaron, and upon his shoulders in onyx stones. So by
Canaan divided into twelve parts; and from them the twelve Apostles in the New Testament and the new Ierusalem built upon twelve foundations, Revel. 21.14. These twelve loaves stood before the Lord;Why called shewbread. there∣fore they were called panis facierum or propositionis, and they signifie that the Church is alwayes the object of the eye of God, and therefore he saith, set up no Idoll, gnal panai, in my presence.Why the bread was removed every Sabbath. They were removed every Sabbath, and new loaves put in their places; to signifie the renuing of the gra∣ces of God to his Church. None might eate of these loaves,Who might eate of the shewbread. but the Priests who served in their course that weeke, and their children; the Priests daughter did eate of this bread when she was a widdow, and returned home to her father againe, Levit. 22.18. So we being maried to the Law, and it having dominion over us, Rom. 7.1. we were out of our fathers house, and might not eate of his holy bread; but being dead to the Law, Rom. 7.4. and divorced from our sinnes, as widowes, we may come home to our fathers house, and be partakers of the holy things. The Priests so long as they were in this holy service,The legall sanctificati∣on of the Priests. and eate this holy bread, they were not to keepe com∣pany with their wives; for this was a part of their cere∣moniall uncleannesse, Exod. 19.14. Moyses commanded them to wash their cloathes, and not to come at their wives. This abstinence, 1 Sam. 21.How David asked the shewbread. is called via munda a cleane way; and to eate in this uncleannesse, is called via pollu∣ta: When David in necessity came to Ahimelech the Priest to aske bread for him and his men, the Priests had no common bread to give them, but this holy bread: this bread the Priests sayd they might not eate of it, if they were in via polluta, and their vessels not sanctified: by via polluta is meant here to keep company
with their wives, and by the sanctification of the ves∣sels is meant the sanctification of our bodies,Our bodies called our vessels. for our bodies, are called our vessels, 1 Thessalon. 4.4. That euery one of you should know how to possesse his vessell in sanctification & honour. And that this is the meaning, it is cleare by Davids answer, when he saith, they have abstai∣ned from women this three dayes, 1 Sam. 21. In their necessity David and his men might eate of this shewbread although they were not Priests; and it had not beene lawfull for them to have eaten of this bread if they had had any other bread; but if they had beene uncleane this way, they might not have eaten this bread at all: so that there were some sorts of le∣gall uncleannesse greater than others. The Church of Rome erre in drawing argu∣ments from the Levi∣ticall ceremonies.The Church of Rome from this place goes about to prove, that ministers, because they handle holy things, should abstaine from mariage; as the Priests were to abstaine from their wives when they were to eate this holy bread, and so they ground many other of their ordinances upon the Leviticall Law, as none might be a Priest that had any irregularitie or defect in him, as defectus natalium, a defect in his birth, as if he had beene a bastard: or defectus persona, a defect in his person, and a number such, which are legall ceremonies, and bind not the Church now.Castitas abjuga conjuga. There is duplex castitas, ab∣juga & conjuga; abjuga is that sort of chastitie, when a man liveth chastly out of mariage; conjuga when hee liveth chastly in mariage, Heb. 13.4. mariage is honorable in all, and the bed undefiled, and if they would conclude any thing out of this place, it would but inferre thus much, the Priests abstained from this holy bread but twise in the yeere, because there were foure and twen∣ty courses of them, and they served but weekely, and so long as they served they abstained from their wives, this will not inferre their conclusion: therefore those
who serve under the Gospel should live altogether un∣maried.What argument may be drawne from the Priests mariage. This argument might be rather inverted a∣gainst them this wayes, the Priests under the law were maried: therefore the Priests under the Gospel may marry. And lastly, theologia symbolica non est argumentativa, those conclusions hold not which are deduced after this manner from types which are not destinate types. The Conclusion of this is, the Lord looketh upon his Church continually; therefore the Church should looke backe againe to him continually; and as the Angels behold the face of God continually in glory, Mat. 18.10. So should the Church behold the face of the Lord in his word, as in a glasse, 1 Cor. 13.12. and as Zedekiahs Courtiers had this credit, to see the Kings face alwayes, 2 King. 25.19. So the Church should studie to see the face of the Lord continually. Secondly, if such legall cleannesse was required of the Priests when they came to eate the shewbread, much more is morall holinesse required in us, when we come to eate the holy bread in the Sacrament. EXERCITAT. XII. Of the Altar. A ceremoniall appendix of Command. 2. Exod. 27.1. And thou shalt make an Altar of Shittim wood five cubits long and five cubites broad, &c. THere were typicall Altars under the Law, and the mysticall Altar Iesus Christ, signified by them un∣der the Gospel.
Two Altars.The typicall Altars under the Law were the Altar of burnt offering, and the Altar of incense; the Altar of burnt offering under the Law in the Wildernesse was built of earth,The matter of the Altars. in the Temple it was made of wood o∣verlayd with brasse; and the Altar of incense was made of wood overlaid with gold. Why the Altar in the Wildernesse was made of earth, and not of hewen stone.The Altar of burnt offering in the Wildernesse was made of earth, and the Lord would have it made of earth onely, because he would not have it permanent, to remaine after they were gone out of the wildernesse; and he would not have it made of hewen stone, to sig∣nifie, that mens inventions doe but pollute the worship of God, Exod. 20.25. Moyses Altar and Salo∣mons, in what they agree.The Altars of Moyses Tabernacle, and Salomons Temple were the same in matter, and forme; Moyses made his of Shittim wood, and Salomon made his of Cedar wood; and the substance was all one, although different in colour, and name onely. They differed in their bases, height, breadth, and length.They differed in their bases, the proportion was dou∣ble; there were two bases of the Altar in the Taberna∣cle, and foure in the Temple. Secondly, they differed in height, there was a triple proportion, three, and ten, Moyses Altar was three cubits high, and Salomons Altar was ten cubits high. Thirdly, in length & breadth, there was a fourefold proportion; the Altar of Moses was five cubits long, and five cubits broad; and the Altar of Salo∣mon was twenty cubits long, and twentie cubits broad. Salomon made all the vessels of the Temple except the Arke.Salomon made all the vessels that pertained to the house of the Lord, the Altar of gold, the Table of gold whereupon the shewbread was, and the Candlesticke, 1 King. 7.48. but he made not a new Arke, because Christ who was re∣presented by the Arke, is the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever, Heb. 13.8. Why doth not Ezekiel, when he describeth the new Temple, make mention of the Arke and the Candle∣sticke,
as he doth of the Altar and the Temple it selfe at large? Because there was not an Arke to be in the second Temple, Why Ezekiel maketh no mention of the Arke and Candlesticke in the second Temple. and the light of that Candlesticke was not lighted with fire from the heaven, as in the Tabernacle and first Temple; and thus the Scriptures in wisedome doe passe many things; and out of the silence of the Scriptures we may learne sometimes; as when the Scripture passeth by Melchizedecks father and his mo∣ther: So when the Scripture setteth downe the curses at large upon mount Ebal,Why the curses in the Law are expressed, and the blessings concealed. and the blessings are concea∣led; to teach us, that the Law curseth us for the breach of it, and that the blessings are reserved for the Gospel, Matth. 5. The golden Altar had a crowne round about it, as the Arke of the Testimonie had, and the Table of shew∣bread. There arose foure hornes from the crowne of the Altar,The hornes of the gol∣den Altar, what they signified. every one in the forme of a broach small in the top, which signified the strength which was in Christ, who was able to overthrow that lord with two hornes, Dan. 6.8. and all the hornes of the wicked, Psal. 75.11. It had a hole like a window in the east side,The place where they emptyed the Altar of the ashes, was not towards the holiest of all. to take out the ashes which fell through the grate, as the brasen Altar, and this was upon the east side of the Altar, and not towards the holiest, to signifie that impurity should be farre from the holiest of all. This golden Altar was called the Table of the Lord, Mala. 1.7. The Apostle, Heb. 9.4.why the Apostle mak∣eth no mention of the golden Altar, but onely of the golden censer. maketh mention of the golden censer onely, and not of the golden Altar; and this he doth to signifie that this was the last period of the Levi∣ticall service to be done away; for the last thing which the Priest did when he came out of the Temple, was to hold up incense with his censer. The Highpriest when he went into the holiest of all
once in the yeare, he left the golden censer there for the whole yeare,Why the Highpriest left the censer in the holiest of all. Heb. 9.4. to signifie that this Leviticall service was to be layd downe, and that Christs inter∣cession indureth for ever; and the Apostle passeth by all these things without the vaile, to signifie that the ce∣remonies without the vaile were to be abolished. The Angell appeared to Zacharias when he was offering incense.At the right side of this Altar the Angell appeared to Zacharias, Luk. 1.11. and first he appeared to him at the time of incense, when all the rest of the ceremoniall service was ended, and when he had done all things which were requisite in the first Tabernacle; as dres∣sing of lamps, sacrificing, putting bread upon the Table every Sabbath; to teach us, that now Christ was to come when the ceremonies were drawing to an end. Why the Angell appe∣red to Zacharias the fa∣ther of Iohn the Baptist.Againe, he appeared to Zacharias who was the father of Iohn the Baptist, to signifie that now Christ was neare comming, because Iohn, Zacharias sonne, his fore∣runner was now at hand. Why he appeared to Zacharias an inferior Priest.Lastly, he appeared to Zacharias an inferior Priest, and not to the Highpriest, to signifie that Iohn should be but a servant, and one that should not thinke himselfe worthy to loose the latchet of Christs shooes. The signification of the brasen Altar.The Altar for the burnt offering was covered with brasse, and it signified Christs passion, as the golden Altar signified his intercession; and as none might goe to the golden Altar to offer incense, but he who might goe to the brasen Altar and offer sacrifice; so we have no mediator of intercession but he that is the mediator of our redemption. This Altar was a large Altar in Solomons time, twentie cubits in length and twentie in breadth: when there was a great sacrifice upon this Altar it was filled to the corners,  and Zachariah alludeth to this, they shall be filled like bowles, and as the corners of the Altar, Zach. 9.15. When the Sacrifice was accepted of the Lord, they
tooke this for a signe that it was all turned to ashes,A signe of the accepta∣tion of the Sacrifices and they prayed, the Lord turne thy sacrifice to ashes, Psal. 20.3. This Altar had hornes as the golden Altar had;The Sacrifice was tyed to the hornes of the Altar. and they that were to offer a sacrifice, delivered the beast to the Priest, and he tyed it to the hornes of the Altar, and from hence he tooke it to the north gate and killed it, and then the Priest cut it in so many quarters, and laid it upon the Altar and burnt it,  and David alludeth to this, Psal. 18.27. Bind the sacrifice with cords, even unto the hornes of the Altar. There was one border about the Altar above, and another at the foote of it,The blood of the beasts sprinkled upon the Altar and powred under the Altar. and there was a great ditch about the Altar where the blood of the beasts was powred, which were killed; this blood was brought from the north gate and sprinkled upon the hornes of the Altar, and it ran downe to the foote of the Altar, into that ditch where the rest of the blood was powred, and it was all carried through secret passages to the brooke Kidron, and Iohn alludeth to this, Revel. 6.9.  I saw under the Altar the soules of them that were slaine for the word of God. The border went round about the foote of the Altar, that no man might fall into this deepe ditch where the blood was powred. So the Lord commanded them to make battlements about their houses, for the safety of men, Deut. 22.8. and so there was peribulum or a wall round about the Temple to save the people that none fell over, because it stood upon a hill. The Lord placed the brasen Altar in the midst of the Court, but AhaZ tooke it out of the owne place,How Ahaz remooved the brasen Altar. and set it upon the north side of the Altar of Damascus, 2 King. 16.14. even in that place where the Idoll of jealousie was set up at the north gate, Ezek. 8.5. and here the glory of the Lord appeared at his owne Altar,
when he testified unto them by his apparition, that hee was to leave his Temple for their Idolatry, Ezek. 8.4. this vision of Ezekiel was in atrio gentium, in the court of the Gentiles; but when the Lord was to give sen∣tence against them, he came to the threshold of the doore, Ezek. 10.4. Why Salomon sacrificed in the middle of the Court.Because this brasen Altar was not large enough to containe all the sacrifices, therefore Salomon hallowed the middle of the court, where he sacrificed the rest of the sacrifices, 1 King. 8.64. David and Salomon being Prophets and immediatly directed by the Spirit of God,David and Salomon ad∣ded many things which were not in the Taber∣nacle. added somethings which were not in the Taber∣nacle, as David for conveniencie caused the Priests to enter in the service of the Tabernacle when they were twentie five yeares of age; whereas the Priests be∣fore did not enter in their ministerie to serve in the Tabernacle, untill they were thirtie yeares of age. So Salomon for conveniencie hallowed the middle court for the sacrifices, because the brasen Altar could not containe all the sacrifices at that time, being an extra-ordinarie sacrifice. Somethings added in the Temple for signi∣fication.Secondly, something was added in the Temple for signification, as Salomon added two Cherubims in the Temple which were not in the Tabernacle; to signifie that the Gentiles were to be called, and that the mini∣sterie of the Angels should be extended to them. Something added in it for order.Thirdly, something was added for order, as David divided the Priests in foure and twentie orders; but none of the Kings of Iudah else did the like, neyther Iosias nor yet Hezekiah; because they were not Pro∣phets, as David and Salomon were. Whether should any Altar be retained now in the Church or not. The Fathers call the Table of the Lord an Altar by allusion. The fathers by allusion called the Table of the Lord an Altar, but when they speake this, they meane not
properly of an Altar; but onely they call it so, because it carieth a remembrance of that sacrifice once offe∣red. There are foure sorts of Altars; typicum, mysticum,Foure sorts of Altars. metaphoricum, & falsum; the typicall Altar, was that un∣der the law; mysticall, as Iesus Christ, Heb. 13.10. Wee have an Altar whereof they have no right to eate which serve the Tabernacle; metaphoricall, as the fathers call the Table an Altar; and the false Altar, is the Romish Altar, upon which they would offer Christ daily, and crucifie him anew againe. The Conclusion of this is, Christ our Highpriest differed farre from the Leviticall Priesthood, he sitteth at the right hand of God when hee presenteth our prayers and offereth them up unto the Lord, whereas the Priests stood at the Altar under the Law when they sacrificed, but they who offer him daily anew againe in a sacrifice for the quicke and the dead, doe bring him in standing, as though his priesthood were not above the Leviticall priesthood. EXERCITAT. XIII. Of the Sacrifices in generall. A ceremoniall Appendix of Command 2. 1 King. 8.62. And the King and all Israel with him offe∣red Sacrifice before the Lord, &c. IN their Sacrifices they offered beasts and fowles,What they offered in their Sacrifices. the beasts were the Ram, the Lamb, the Bullocke,
and the Goate; the fowles were the Turtle dove, the Pi∣geon, and the Sparrow in the sacrifice of Lepro∣sie. The beasts which were to be offered to the Lord, be∣hooved to have no blemish in them; Maculatum. in the originall it is mum, which the Seventy translate , which is, worthie of blame; Immaculatum, , that is, without blot,What is meant by blemish. Levit. 26.16. The man that hath any blemish shall not offer to the Lord; then he explaineth what he mea∣neth by blemish; when they offered the lame, the blind, the sicke: and contrary to this is that which wee call Immaculatum, Cant. 1. Thou art faire my spouse, and there is no blemish in thee, that is, there is no deformitie in thee: mum here is not taken for a spot, as though a spotted beast were uncleane: for then the Badgers Skins which covered the Tabernacle had beene uncleane; the Bad∣ger is called shesh, because it hath sixe spots upon it, as the Hebrewes marke. They might offer nothing that was defective, or wanted any member,Nothing which was defective or superfluous in the parts of it might be offered. Levit. 21.25. Bovem aut ovem su∣perstuum aut diminutum, that is, if it had a member more, or wanted a member, they might not offer it; there∣fore the Hebrews say, that when they offered Bullocks, they were Buls and not Oxen; because no beasts might be offered to the Lord which were lacking in their parts, Levit. 22.23. and as an Eunuch might not serve before the Lord: so neyther might an Oxe be offered to the Lord. Therefore shor, bos, the Chaldee paraphrast ever paraphraseth it thor, taurus The blemishes that hindered a beast from being a Sacrifice.The Iewes marke that there are fiftie blemishes which disable a beast from being a sacrifice, five in the eares, three in the eye lids, sixe in the mouth, eight in the eye, three in the nose, twelve in the members of generation, sixe in the feete, foure in any part of the bo∣dy, and three beside over all the bodie: and moreover
the beast might not be sacrificed untill it had beene eight dayes old, Levit. 22.27. so if it had lien with one of another kind, Levit. 19.19. or if it had killed a man, Exod. 20.28. or if it were the hyre of a whore, or the price of a dogge, Deut. 23. None of these might be offe∣red to the Lord. Every Sacrifice when it was sacrificed to the Lord,Eevery Sacrifice was changed when it was offered, it was changed from the use in which it was before, and there was destructio rei oblatae. If they were living things, they were killed; if they were liquid things, they were powred out; and if they were solid things, they were brused, and burnt as corne: now in the masse the Papists cannot tell what destruction is there, whe∣ther there be physica mutatio there or not: therefore they cannot tell whether it be a sacrifice or not. That which was living was killed and cut downe,The living Sacrifice was cut downe thorow the backebone. per spinam dorsi thorow the chaine bone of the backe;  and the Apostle alludeth to this, Heb. 4.13. all things are na∣ked and  opened unto the eyes of him with whome we have to doe, that is, cut up as the Sacrifice, and layd naked before him;  and Christ alludeth to this cut∣ting up of the Sacrifice, Matth. 24.51. , he will cut him asunder, and give him his portion with hypocrites. If they be not sacrifices now to the Lord, he will cut them like sacrifices in his wrath. Thirdly, every Sacrifice was salted with salt, Levit. 2.13.Every Sacrifice had salt ioyned with it. And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with salt; neyther shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt. So Marke 9.49. every sacri∣fice shall be salted with fire, this might seeme at the first an improper speech,When things are com∣pared we must marke dilligently wherein the comparison stan∣deth. for if we marke not wherein the comparison standeth, we may mistake it, Cant. 5.13. thy lippes are like the Lilie; If the comparison bee not rightly marked we may easily be deceived, for the com∣mendation
of the lips of the Church, Cant. 4.5. was that her lips were like Scarlet, then to make them white like the Lilie were impertinent: therefore the comparison is here in the smell, as before it was in the colour: so Num. 12.10. Miriam was leprous as the snow, the snow is not leprous, but the comparison standeth in the colour, she was white in leprosie like the snow. So the compa∣rison betwixt the fire and the salt is not in the seaso∣ning; but in the eating out of the corruption, and if they will not this wayes be salted, the Lord will salt them with another sort of fire,  with that burning fire of his wrath; they who will not quite these sinfull members, hand, foote, and eyes, and who give offences to their brethren, shall be salted with fire, but the children of God as they are baptized with this hea∣venly fire and water; so they will be salted with this salt and fire. They might have no leaven in their sacrifices, Levit. 2.11. except in some few offerings of thanksgiving, Levit. 7.13. to signifie that the Lord would gratiously accept of our service although mixed with many in∣firmities which in his mercie he pardoneth in Christ, 1 Ioh. 8.9. But in all other sacrifices he forbiddeth both honey, and leaven; he forbiddeth honey as well as leaven: the ground of this is naturall, because honey fermenteth as leaven; this leaven figured sinne of all sorts both in doctrine and manners, Luk. 12.1. Matth. 16.6. 1 Cor. 5.8. purge out the old leaven, that is, corruption in man∣ners.
A Table of the Sacrifices.In the burnt offering the fat and the blood the Lords, the flesh all burnt, and the skin the Priests. The Priest got no part of that sin-offering whose blood was sprin∣kled upon the golden Altar. In other sinne offerings where the blood was sprinkled but upon the brasen Altar, the fat and the blood were the Lords, and the flesh belonged to the Priest. The sin offering had no meat offering or drinke offering. In the peace offering the fat and the blood the Lords, the breast and the right shoulder the Priests, and the rest be∣longed to the offerer. In the meatoffering a hanfull of the flower, a little of the salt, oyle, incense, and wine offe∣red, and the Priest got the rest. Sacrifices of praise soe were to beaten before the Lord, some in Ierusalem, and some at home. The offering of Iealou∣sie had no incense in it. No Sacrifice without Salt. Sacrifices are eyther of reconciliation. burnt offering the daily sacrifice for the whole people. particular for The Priest. The Prince. The People. Sin offering for Ignorance. Error. thanksgiving peace offering of Vowes. Voluntarie purification. Iealousie. Leprosie. Nazarets. Consecration. praises for things past delive∣rance. present dedica∣tion. to come preser∣vation. Meat offering. Drinke offering. Eares of Corne. Fine flower. Baked in the Oven. Frying pan. Fornace. First fruites. First borne. Tythes. Wine. Added to the Sacrifices. Salt. Oyle. Incense.
EXERCITAT. XIIII. Of the Sacrifices in particular, and first of the burnt offering. A ceremoniall appendix of Command. 2. Levit. 1.2. If his offering be a burnt offering, &c. THere were some sacrifices which were comman∣ded by the Lord, and some which were volun∣tarie sacrifices, as free will offerings, and such. The sacrifices which were commanded, ordinarie and instituted by God, were five, First, the burnt offe∣ring commanded here in Levit. 1. Secondly, the meat∣offerings in Levit. 2. Thirdly, the peace offerings, Fourthly, sinne offerings in Levit. 4. And lastly, tres∣passe offering in Levit. 5.15. Of the daily Sacrifice.Their daily burnt offering was a Lambe offered mor∣ning and evening,Why it was called continuall. and this was furnished at the char∣ges of the common treasurie of the Temple, and not by any particular man. It was called Sacrificium juge, the continuall Sacrifice, because it was offered twise every day without intermission, and although other things have this word tamid, continuall, joyned with them as the continuall bread, Num. 4.7. the continuall incense, Exod. 30.8. put for the daily Sacrifice. the continuall meat offering, Num. 8.16. yet com∣monly the daily burnt offering is meant here, as Dan. 8.11. and by him (hattamid) the daily was taken away, that is, the daily sacrifice. The burnt offering was a sacrifice which was all burnt to ashes except the skin and intrals, Holocaustum a  ascendere  Sacrificium to∣tum igne consumendum interdum iungitur cum  ut Psal. 51.12 et significat perfectum sacrificium a  per∣fecit, absolvit. it was called gnolah from gnalah ascendere, and it was called ignitum
Iehovae, quia igni consumendum, because it was all to bee burnt with fire, Levit. 1. and it had calil joyned with it, Psal 51. which commeth from calal to consume: calil is nor the adjective joyned to gnola, for they disagree in gender but calil here signifieth mincha, or the meat offe∣ring which was joyned to the burnt offering. In this burnt offering they were to offer a Bullocke,What was offered in the burnt offering. a Ram, a Lambe amongst the beasts; or a turtle Dove or young pigeon of the fowles, and it behoved to be a male and not a female, and likewise it behoved to be without blemish, to signifie that puritie and per∣fection which was in Christ, and our perfection in him, Heb. 9.13. How much more shall the blood of Christ,What the burnt offe∣ring signified. who through the eternall Spirit offered himselfe without spot to God, purge your consciences from dead workes to serve the living God? It behoved to be of the best things and the choise of the flocke, to teach us to honour God with our substance, Prover. 3.9. and to serve him with a perfect heart, 1 Chro. 28.9, When they offered their sacrifices they kept this order. First,The order which they keepe in brning their sacrifices. after the beast was killed and layd upon the Altar to be burnt, the offerer brought fine flower mixed with salt and oyle, (for they might not mixe the flower with water) and this part of the Sacrifice was properly called Immolatio,Immolare. then he gave this to the Priest who layd it upon the head of the Sacrifice, & this was called mactatio by the Latines, that is,Mactare. magis aucta & victima macta. Thirdly, the Priests powred wine upon the Sacrifice which was to be burnt; and this was cal∣led Libatio, and the Apostle alludeth to this,Libare. when hee saith, 2 Tim, 4.6. I am libor, now I am ready to be offered up. Fourthly, Incense was superadded to these,Suffire. and this was called Suffitus,  and the Apostle alludeth to this, Ephe. 5.2. Christ hath given himselfe for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweete smelling savour. Lastly,
when the Sacrifice was burning, they offered their spi∣rituall Sacrifice with it,Litare. and this was called Litare, pre∣cibus à Deo aliquid impetrare, they prayed unto the Lord that he would accept of their Sacrifice; therefore their Sacrifices were called Sacrificia vociferationis, Sa∣crifices of shouting, Psal. 27.6. Of the meat Offering. What was offered in the meat offering.THe meat offering consisted of things without life, as of fine flower, oyle and incense, Levit. 2.2. things which were necessarie for the use of man were offered here to the Lord, as bread to eate, wine to drinke, salt to season, oyle to cure, and incense to delight the smell. So Christ our meat offering is all these to us. Mincha accessorium perse. They had two sorts of meat offering, Mincha acees∣sorium & mincha per se. Mincha accessorium was that which was alwayes joyned with another Sacrifice, and a handfull of it was burnt, and the rest was the Priests; but that which was Mincha per se which was offered for the Priests, was wholly; burnt and not ea∣ten, Levit. 6.23. The flower in the meat offering was the best flower.The floure which was offered in the meat offering behooved to be simila pura, fine flower, without any branne; which signified the pure estate of Christ and all Christians in him. There was oyle powred upon it, and the Apostle al∣ludeth to this, 2 Cor 1.21. He that established us with you in Christ, and hath anoynted us, is God. So 1 Ioh. 2.27. the annointing which yee have received of him abideth in you. It had incense joyned with it, and the Apostle allu∣deth to this, Ephes. 5.2. Christ hath given himselfe for us
an offering and a Sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling sa∣vour. Sometimes it was baked, and sometimes fryed in a pan,  and David alludeth to this, Psal 45.2. My heart hath fryed or boyled a good matter. Every Sacrifice had this Mincha joyned with it,The meat offering of∣tentimes put for all the Sacrifices. ex∣cept the sinne offering, and therefore oftentimes it is put for any Sacrifice, as Psal. 20. The Lord remember all thy [mincha] meat offerings, that is, all thy Sacrifi∣ces. Of the peace offering. THe peace offering was a Sacrifice of thanksgiving for the saftie of the offerer,A part of the peace offe∣ring due to God, a part to the Pri sts, and a part to the offerer. & one part of it was due to God, one to the Priest, one to the offerer, Amos 5.5. I will not accept of the fat of your offerings, that is, of your peace offerings: David called this fat the burnt offerings of fatlings. That which was the most excel∣lent in every thing the Hebrewes called it the fat, as adeps frumenti the fat of the corne; medulla tritici, the marrow of the wheate, Ecclus. 47.2. as the fat was taken away from the peace offering, so was David chosen out amongst the children of Israel;  here he maketh a comparison be∣twixt David and the fat of the peace offering, all the peace offering was the Lords, yet all was not offered to him, but a part was given to the Priests, and a part to the people, but the fat was fully burnt up to the Lord. So the zeale of Gods house burnt up David, as the fat of the Sacrifice. The fat was due onely to God,The fat was the Lords. the peoples part was but a leane part; but under the Gspel, Esay. 25.6. I will make the people a feast of fat things and full of mar∣row, the people might eate none of the marrow under the Law.
Whether might the people eate of the fat of the beasts which were not sacrificed, as of those which they killed at home? The Lord forbiddeth them to eate the fat of what∣soever beast, Lvit. 3.17. It shall be a statute for ever throughout your dwellings,The fat of the Sacrifice might not be eaten or used to any other use. that yee eate no fat nor blood. The fat of the beasts which were not sacrificed might be taken to any other use, but they might not eate any of it, Levit. 7.24. the fat of the beast that dieth of it selfe, or that which is torne, may be used in any other use, but ye shall in no wise eate of it. The feast of the peace offering.The rest of the peace offering was divided betwixt the Priest and the people, and they made a feast of it, 1 Sam. 9.24.  and Salomon alludeth to it, Prov. 17.1. better is a drye morsell and quietnesse therewith, than a house full of Sacrifices with strife.The Sacrifice put for the feast afetr the Sacri∣fice, Antecedens pro eonsequente. The Sacrifice here is put for the banquet which was after the Sacrifice, and it was this which David meant of, when he sayd, there is a yeerely sacrifice there for all the familie, 1 Sam. 20 6. that is, a feast after the Sacrifice. The breast and the shoulder due to the Priest.The breast and the right shoulder of the peace offe∣ring was due to the Priest; and the rest was due to the offerers; it is sayd of the sonnes of Eli, that they sent their boyes, and pulled the flesh out of the Caldron, 1 Sam. 2. that is, they would not be content with that which was due to them, the breast and the shoulders; but they would have the peoples part also, and they would not stay untill the fat was offered to the Lord, 1 Sam 2.15. How did the cooke set the shoulder before Saul to eate of it, seeing it was the Priests part, 1 Sam. 9.24. The right shoulder was the Priests onely. Why the Priest got the shoulder.The Priest got the breast and the shoulder; hee got the shoulder to signifie that he caried the burden of the
people;Why he got the breast. can I carry all this people upon my shoul∣ders (saith Moyses) Num. 11.11. Wherefore have I not found favour in thy sight, that thou layest all the burden of this people upon me? and he got the breast to signifie his compassion and love to the people, Num. 11.12. Have I begotten them, that they should say unto me, carie them in thy bosome. Esay. 40.11. He shall feede his flocke like a sheep∣herd, and hee shall gather his lambs with his arme, and carie them in his bosome, and leade these that are with young. The Highpriest carried the names of the twelve Tribes upon his breast, to signifie his compassion;Why the Highpriest carried the names of the Tribes upon his breast and shoulder. and he carried their names ingraven in Onyx stones upon his shoulders, to signifie that he carried the burden of the people: Eli when he looked upon Hanna, and saw her lips moving, he sayd she was drunke, 1 Sam. 1.13. here there was no pittie in the Priests breast to the poore woman, but 2 King. 4.26.Elisha a man of pittie. Elisha had more pittie in his breast, when he sayd to Gehazi, run now I pray thee, and say, is it well with thee? and when shee came to the man of God she caught him by the feete, but Gehazi thrust her away, but the man of God sayd, let her alone, for her soule is vexed within her: Churlish Gehazi had no pittie upon the poore woman, but there was much pittie and compassion in the heart of Elisha the man of God. The peace offering was divided betwixt God,Why God, the Priests, and the people, had a part in the offering. the Priests, and the people; God got the chiefe part, be∣cause he it is who pardoneth the sinne. The Priest got his part, because he is the instrument to make intima∣tion of this pardon; and the people got their part, to teach them to bee thankefull for the remission of sinne. God got his part, and the people got theirs, what a comely thing was this to see the Lord sitting at his Table, Mala. 1.7. therefore the fat of the Sacrifice is
called his bread, Levit. 3.11. and Num. 28.2. and to bee  inviting his children to dine with him, hee will not eate his morsels alone, Iob. 31.17. what a comely thing was this to see his children standing like Olive plants round about his Table, Psal. 128.3. and how pleasant was it to see brethren dwell together in unitie,God sate as it were the Master of the feast, in the peace offering. Psal. 132.1. and their father sitting at the head of the Table. The Heathen sayd of old that  erant  sine patre, that the feast when it wanted the father it wanted the head. A bad division of the peace offering.The peace offering was divided betwixt God and the Priest, and the people, but the whore sayd, Prov. 7. that she had her peace offerings by her, and shee invited her lover to them: was not this a strange sharing or division for God to get a part, the Priest to get a part, and the whore, and the whoremonger to get a share; but the Lord will not share with such. This feast which was adjoyned to the Sacrifices was a feast of joy,The feast joyned to the peace offering was a feast of mirth. Deut. 16.15. Iud. 21.19. wherein they dan∣ced, and it figured our spirituall mirth and joy for our redemption by Christ. The Idolaters kept this feast to the golden Calfe which they should have kept to the Lord. When they offered their spirituall Sacrifices with their externall Sacrifices, then the Lord was much de∣lighted with them, and he saith, I have eaten my honey and my honeycombe, I have drunken my wine and my milke, Cant. 5.1. and he tooke such pleasure in these feasts, that he invited the Church his spouse to come and eate, O friends drinke, yea drinke abundantly, O beloved. But when their Sacrifices wanted the inward Sacrifice, then the Lord sayd, that they offered but flesh unto him, Hose. 8.13. putridi facti sunt. then hee loathed them but as rotten flesh, Nehelahhu, putridi facti sunt, Psal. 14.3. they are become rotten and stinking, and he continueth in the metaphor;
they are like wine that hath lost the tast, which is called vinum fugiens: omnis re∣cessit, vinum sugiens. when these outward Sacrifices wanted the inward, see how unpleasant they were to the Lord, Esay. 1. I am full of the burnt offerings of Rams, and the fat of the fed beasts I delight not in, nor in the blood of Lambs, of Bullocks, or of Goates: then he commeth to his smell,Outward Sacrifices without the inward are offensive to all Gods senses. vers. 13, Incense is abomination to me, then to his touch, vers. 14. your new moones and your appointed feasts I am wearie to beare them, then to his hearing, when yee make many prayers I will not heare them, then to his sight, ver. 15. I will hide mine eyes from them. Their Sacrifices were offensive to all Gods senses. Of the sin-offering. THe burnt offering was for all sinnes in generall, Iosephus Lib. 3. Antiq. Cap. 10. the peace offering was a thanksgiving for sinnes re∣mitted, and the sin-offering was for sinnes committed, for which they craved pardon; the sin-offering was ei∣ther hhataah or asham, the first the Seventy translate , and the second , the first were , and the second . The Sacrifice which was for the sinnes of ignorance or , might ascend or descend, that is it was more or lesse according to the worth of the offerer, Levit. 5.7. the poore might offer a pottle of flower; and the rich were to offer according to their ability: but in the offering which was for a willing sinne, the Sacrifice did neither ascend nor descend, it was alike in all. So in the punishment of sinne, in some sinnes the punish∣ment ascended and descended, Exod. 21.28. if a man had kept a pushing Oxe, and he had killed a man, he was to dye for it: or the punishment might descend,Sacri∣ficium ascensionis. descensionis. if a summe of money was layd upon him, then he might redeeme his life; here the punishment was ascending and
descending: but if a man had killed a man willingly, then the punishment non ascendebat aut descendebat, but he was to die for it. In the sin-offering there was no oyle or incense, ney∣ther in the Sacrifice of Iealousie;No Incense in the sin-offering, or in the offering of Iealousie. because there was nothing acceptable to the Lord in these Sacrifices. Observe that there was a Sacrifice for originall sinne, Leviti. 12. in errore. there was a Sacrifice for sinne of error (bishgagah, in errore) and there was a Sacrifice for sinnes of ignorance; but there was no Sacrifice for wilfull sinnes,There was a Sacrifice for all sinnes except for wilfull sinnes. Heb. 10.36. for if we sinne wilfully after that wee have received the knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more Sacrifice for sinnes: Christ prayeth for sinnes of ignorance, Lord forgive them, for they know not what they doe, Luk. 23.34. Let us pray then with David to keepe us from presumptouus sinnes, that they have not dominion over us, Psal. 19.13. There are severall sorts of Sacrifices prescribed for severall sorts of sinners as for the Priest,Sacrifices according to the persons. for the Prince, and for the whole people, and for a private man. For the Priest was a young Bullocke without ble∣mish,The Sacrifice for the Priest. which he offered for himselfe, and here we are taught, if the Highpriest under the Law might erre, then the Pope may erre as Pope; what priviledge hath hee to bee exempted from error more than the Highpriest had?The Highpriest might erre. and if they say, because hee is the Highpriest under the Gospell, therefore he cannot erre, but now there is no Highpriest under the Gospel but Ie∣sus Christ, Who by his owne blood entred once into the holy place, having obtained eternall redemption for us, Heb. 9.12. If the Highpriests sinne made the people to sinne; he was to offer a Bullocke, Levit. 4.3. observe the phrase, Lehashmath, in reatam populi. that is, if he make the people sinne by his evill example, so Ioab sayd to David when he caused him to number the people, why wilt thou be (leha∣shamah)
a cause of trespasse to Israel, 1 Chro. 21.3. Secondly, for the whole people,The visible Church may erre. and they were to offer a young Bullocke, Levit. 4.13. which was the same with the Priests Sacrifice; and here observe,The sinoffering of the whole people. that the whole visible Church may erre, otherwayes the Lord would not have appointed a Sacrifice for the er∣ror of the whole people. The Sacrifice of the Priest and the Sacrifice of the whole people was one, to teach us, how great the sinne of the Highpriest was. Seeing the sinne of the Highpriest was as great as the sinne of the whole people, what is the reason, that the people were more severely punished than Aaron who made the golden Calfe? Aaron did it through infirmitie, Why the people more severely punished than Aaron for making the golden Calfe. but the people did it willingly and wittingly. Thirdly the Sacrifice of the Ruler was a male of the kids of the Goates, and the Sacrifice of any particular common man was a female of the kids of the Goats, Levit. 4.23.28. Why doth the Lord set downe severall sorts of Sa∣crifices for sinnes done of ignorance; and but one sort of Sacrifice for sinnes done of errour. Solon was commended that he made no Law for him who killed his father; he thought none would bee so wicked as to commit such a fact, and he was thought to have done more wisely in that,Why the Lord set downe but one sort of Sacrifices for all sinnes done wittingly. not to inhibite that which had not beene practised, lest hee should seeme not so much to forbid this sinne, as to incite men to it by his prohibition; So the Lord would not set downe severall sorts of Sacrifices, and Lawes for se∣verall sorts of willing sinnes; lest the corrupt nature of man by these inhibitions should take occasion to sinne the more, he setteth downe but one sort of Sacrifice for all sinnes of knowledge, the servant who knoweth his
masters will and doth it not shall be beaten with many stripes, Luk. 12.47. the vessels that could not be purged by fire were broken, Levit. 7. Two sorts of sinne offerings.There were two sorts of sin-offerings. First those sin-offerings, whose blood was not carried into the holy place, & sprinkled seven times before the vaile upon the golden Altar, but was onely sprinkled upon the brasen Altar, and of these the Priests might eate, therefore the Priests are sayd to eate the sinnes of the People, Hos. 4.8. that is, the Sacrifice for sinne. So Moyses was an∣gry with Eleazar and Ithamar,What sinoffering the Priests might eate and what not. because they did not eate the sin-offering; then he explaineth what sin-offe∣ring it was, Levit. 10.18. Behold the blood of it was not brought in, within the holy place, yee should indeede have eaten it in the holy place as I commanded you. But the sin-offering whose blood was carried in with∣in the holy place, the flesh of it was caried without the Campe and burnt, and the Priests might eate none of that, Levit. 6.30. The allegoricall, tropo∣logicall and anagogicall application of the sin-offering.The carrying of the sin-offering without the campe had an allegoricall application, a tropologicall appli∣cation, and an anagogicall application. The allego∣ricall application was this, that Christ should suffer without the gate of Ierusalem; the tropologicall signi∣fication the Apostle maketh, Heb. 13. if the Iewes stand to the ceremoniall Law, they cannot be partakers of the blood of Christ, and he reasoneth this wayes. The people got nothing of that which was burnt without the gate, according to the Leviti∣call Law, Heb. 13 11. But Iesus Christ the sin-offering was burnt without the gate. The Iewes who stand to the ceremoniall Law, have no part in Christ.Therefore if the Iewes stand to the Leviticall Law they can have no part in Christ. And here the Apostle reasoneth with them out of
their owne grounds, as Christ doth with the Sadduces out of the five bookes of Moyses, which they onely admitted, Matth. 22.23. The anagogicall applycation is this, that we have not here a permanent Citie, but seeke for one to come, Heb. 13.14. They were commanded to lay their hand upon the head of the sin-offering, Levit. 4.Why they layd their hand upon the head of the Sacrifice. to signifie that they laid over their sinnes upon the beast, which was a type of Christ who was made (asham) an offering for sin, Esay. 53.10. and the Apostle, 1 Cor. 5.21. he made him to be sin for us, who knew no sinne, that is, the guilt of our sinnes was imputed unto him; he was not made a Sa∣crifice onely for our sinnes, but he was made sinne for us; marke here a double opposition, first, he who knew no sinne, was made sinne; Secondly,Christ was made sinne for us and then a Sa∣crifice. that we might be made the righteousnesse of God in him: now it cannot bee sayd, that he who knew no sacrifice was made a Sacrifice for sinne, that we might be a Sacrifice of righteousnesse to God in him; but this wayes, he who knew no sinne was made sinne, that is, our sinne was imputed to him, that we might be accounted as righteous before God in him; and therefore although this by consequence be inferred, that he was made a Sacrifice for our sinnes; yet it is not the proper meaning of the place; after that the guilt of our sinnes was layd upon him, then he was made a Sacrifice for our sinnes. And here we have a notable place to cleare that im∣puted righteousnesse, which is imputed unto us;Christ righteousnesse imputed to us as our sinnes were imputed to him. as the beast when it was killed, the guilt was laid upon it typically, which had no sinne in it; So all our sinnes were imputed to Christ who had no sinne in himselfe; and we reason thus, as our sinne was imputed to Christ who had no sinne in himselfe: So Christs righteous∣nesse is imputed to us who have no righteousnesse in our∣selves.
But they say that Christ was not capable of inherent sinne, as we are of inherent righteousnesse. We are not capable of inherent righteousnesse.We are no more capable of inherent righteousnesse to justifie us before God then Christ was capable of in∣herent sinne; our sanctification is not perfect sanctifi∣cation, which is able to stand before the Lord to justifie us. Of the trespasse offering. A Trespasse offering was a Sacrifice for sinnes of omission, or sinnes of ignorance, these sinnes were , pallium. Levit. 5.15. if a soule commit a trespasse and sinne through ignorance, in the Hebrew it is, timgnol magnal, as if a man were blindfolded with a cloke cast about him, for megnil is a cloke, these sinnes the Apostle calleth , errors done of ignorance, Hebr. 9.7. Agere ex ignorantia ignorantor. But here we must distinguish betwixt sinnes done of ignorance, and sinnes done ignorantly. This Sacrifice was for sinnes done of ignorance, but not for sinnes done ignorantly.difference of sinnes done of ignorance and sinnes done ignorantly. Sinnes done of ignorance were those which proceeded meerely of ignorance; but sinnes done ignorantly, were those sinnes which were com∣mitted ignorantly, but ignorance was not the cause of them, as when a man in drunkennesse killed a man, he doth it ignorantly, but not of ignorance, because he wilfully was drunken, which drew on his ignorance; here his drunkennesse & his ignorance were essentially joyned together, but there are other sinnes which are but accidentally joyned together, as drunkennesse, and whoredome, for all that are drunk commit not whore∣dome, neyther all that commit whoredome are drunke.
EXERCITAT. XV. Of the Priests apparell. A ceremoniall appendix of Command 2. Exod. 28.2. And thou shalt make holy garments for Aaron thy brother, for glory and beautie. THe Priests were cloathed in linnen when they ser∣ved in the Sanctuary, Ezek. 44.17.The Priests might we are no wooll in the Sanctuary. And it shall come to passe, that when they shall enter in at the gates of the inner court, they shal be cloathed with linnen garments, and no wooll shall come upon them, while they minister in the gates of the inner court, and within. First,  they had linnen breeches to cover their nakednesse, Christ is he that must cover the shame of our nakednesse that it doe not appeare, Reve. 3.18. they had linnen coats reaching downe to their feete; linnen sig∣nifieth righteousnesse in the Scripture, Revel. 19.8. therefore David prayeth Psal. 132.9.  Let thy Priests bee cloathed with righteousnesse. When they were in the Sanctuary they wore onely linnen, and out of the Sanctuary they wore wooll,The Iewes called a worldly minded Priest the man with the wool∣len cloathe. the Iewes had a proverbe, when they saw a worldly min∣ded Priest, they used to say, there goeth the man with the woollen cloaths, because he minded nothing his linnen cloathing, his Sanctification and righteous∣nesse. These cloathes reached downe to their feete, and therefore Christ our Highpriest appeared having  and cloathed with a garment downe to the feete, Revel. 1.13. Moreover they had a linnen girdle which signified truth and constancie in Christs administration, Esay. 22.
21. And I will cloath him with thy robe, and strengthen him with thy girdle,  it signifieth likewise the constancie, truth, and perseverance of Christians, Ephe. 6.14. stand therefore having your loynes girt about with truth, the garments were common to the Highpriest with the rest of the Priests. The Highpriest had some ornaments that were pro∣per to himselfe, first a robe of blew with bels, an Ephod of Gold, blue, purple, scarlet, and fine linnen, a breast∣plate, a Miter of sine linnen, a plate of pure gold upon his forehead. The Highpriest had garments proper to himselfe, therefore in the second Temple when the Highpriests wanted the annointing oyle, when they saw the High∣priest, they sayd not; there goeth the annoynted of the Lord; multiplicatis vestibus. but there goeth the man with the many cloaths, merubha begadim. He had a broydered girdle which he wore about his paps, therefore Christ is sayd to be girt about the paps with a golden girdle,The Priests might not weare their girdle but about their breasts. Reve. 1.13. So the seven Angels came out of the Temple having their breasts girded with golden girdles, Reve. 15.6. and Ezek. 44.18. the Priests were for∣bidden to gird themselves in the sweating places, that is, about their loynes. But it is sayd, Esay. 11.5. righteousnesse shall be the girdle of his loynes, and faithfulnesse the girdle of his reines, therefore it may seeme that he wore his girdle about his middle. Righteousnesse was the girdle of his loynes, and fathfulnesse the girdle of his reines,Why Christ was girt about the loynes and reines. to signi∣fie, that there was no concupisence in Christ here, or sinfull lust; and he was girt about the paps with a gol∣den girdle to signifie that his heart was holy and pure without sinne. He had a plate of gold upon his forehead, and holi∣nesse
to the Lord written in it, and therefore he was cal¦led the Saint of the Lord, Psal. 106.16.The plate of gold. This plate had holinesse to the Lord written in it, but Zachariah pro∣phesied that holinesse to the Lord shall be written upon the bridles of the horses, Zach. 14.20. that is, there shall be such holinesse under the Gospel that the meanest shall have holinesse written upon his forehead, as the Priests had under the Law. These priestly ornaments signified Christs Kingly,The signification of the Highpriests garments. Priestly, and Propheticall office, his Kingly office was typed by his Crowne which he wore, his Priestly office was signified by the breastplate upon which he carried the names of the twelve Tribes, and Vrim and Thum∣mim; the Priest did two things, as the Apostle speak∣eth, Heb. 5.1.  & , things which per∣tained to God, and things which pertained to us: the things which he did from God to us, were represented by Vrim & Thummim, and the things which he did from us to God were represented by the breastplate w,herein he carried the twelve stones, and his propheticall office was signified by his bels. The priestly garment was put upon Aaron by Moyses;The disaraying of Aa∣ron, what it meant. and yet Moyses is commanded to strippe Aaron of them, and disaray him. The taking off of his garments, and putting them upon Eleazar, signified the taking awas of his office and giving it to another. So when Eliakim was cloathed with Shebnas robe, Esay. 22.15. it signified that his office should be taken from him, and given to Eliakim. So the stripping of Aaron signified the disanulling of the Priesthood for the weaknesse thereof, Heb. 7.14. and when he was stript of his Priest∣ly garments for his sinnes wch he had committed, Num. 20.12. he and all the people were taught to expect a better Priesthood of the same of God who is perfected for evermore, Heb. 7.28. and this priesthood was conti∣nued
from Aaron to Eleazar, and from him to Phinehas, and had no end untill Christ came, who was a Priest after the order of Melchizedeck, the true Eleazar, the helpe of God. The garments which the Priest wore when he went into the holiest of all.The Highpriest had other garments which he wore when he entred into the holiest of all upon the day of expiation, he was all cloathed in white, and having fi∣nished his service that day, he layd aside these cloathes and never wore them any more, and Aaron shall come into the Tabernacle of the congregation, and shall put off the linnen garments which he put on when he went into the holy place, & shall leave them there, Lev. 16.23. The Highpriest layd aside all his ornaments that day when he went in∣to the holiest of all, to signifie unto us, that the Leviti∣call Priesthood was to be laid aside, and also that Christ would give up his Kingdome to his Father, 1 Cor. 15.24. that is, he would not exercise the function of a mediator any more in the Church, and that he would give up his personall kingdome, but not his eternall king∣dome. The Sacrifices and ce∣remonies under the Law had relation to Christ.All the Ceremonies and Sacrifices under the Law had relation to Christ, they were but the shaddow, and he was the body. To his conception.First the Nazarite must be sanctified in his mothers wombe, to signifie that Iesus the true Nazarite should be conceived without sinne in the wombe of the Vir∣gin. To his natures.Secondly, his two natures were signified by the Goate that was killed, and the scape-Goate, and by the two Sparrowes, the one killed, & the other let goe. So by the Angels ascending and descending upon the Ladder, the Angels ascending signifying his Godhead whom they all ascend to honour; and descending to minister unto him as man. To his birth.In his birth Mary offered for herselfe and for her
Sonne, to signifie that he became legally uncleane for us to purge our uncleannesse. His offices, King, Priest, and Prophet,To his offices. typed by the Highpriests garments and ornaments. His death by the Sacrifices,To his death. and his lifting up upon the Crosse by the brasen Serpent, his buriall by Ionas living in the Whales belly three dayes, his resurrection by the firsts, and therefore he is called the first fruits of them that slept, 1 Cor. 15.20. and the fifty dayes be∣twixt the first harvest and the gathering of the full har∣vest, signified the fifty dayes betwixt Christs resur∣rection, and the comming downe of the holy Ghost up∣on the Apostles. EXERCITAT. XVI. The Lord would not have his Priests use the customes of the Heathen Priests. A ceremoniall appendix of Commande. 2. Exod. 20.26. Thou shalt not goe up by steps upon mine Altar. THe Israelits learned Idolatry in Egypt, and their Pappes were brused, Ezek 23.3. and the Prophet Iere∣miah calleth Egypt a very faire Heifer, Cap. 46.20. who was lascivious and wanton, following Idolatry, and therefore was called, great in flesh, Ezek. 16.26. sive  aestro exagitor, aestro velut immisso concito ab  asilus, aestrus, metaphorice stimulus. And Israel followed Egypt who was like a backesliding heifer, Hos. 11.6. the Seventy translate it, , like a Heifer stung with Hornets, who runneth here and there: so did they
after their Idols; therefore he threatneth, that he will feede them as a lambe in a large place, that is, he would send the ten Tribes to captiviie, where they should have libertie enough to run as they pleased. The Lord would not have them to imitate the beastly Priests of the Moabites.When the Israelites were comming out of Egypt, tra∣velling towards Canaan, the Lord forbiddeth them to follow the beastly Idolatry of the Moabites, to discover their nakednesse, as their Priests did; and for this cause that they should not goe up by steps, or degrees upon the Altar; for their cloathes were short when they travelled through the Wildernesse with the ambula∣tory Tabernacle, and if they had ascended by steps upon the Altar, their nakednesse might have beene seene. Priapus what.This filthy Idolatry of the Moabites was the wor∣shipping of Baal-peor who was also called Priapus. This Priapus was a young man in Hellespont, who was expelled out of the countrie as a corrupter of the youth. He went into Greece, where afterwards, beastly & filthy persons made a god of him,Priapus the God of the Moabites. The Moabites made choise of him also for their god, and he was called Baal-peor, because he was made with his nakednesse discovered. this Idoll was also called miphlezeth, 1 King. 15.13. Horrenda statua, and Idolum pudoris, Hos. 11.9. and 9.10. and like unto this worship was that worship of Tammuz, Ezek. 8. with their  and . The Moabites choose a filthy God like unto themselves.Was not this strange that they could imagine that their gods and their goddesses were such? but we are not to admire this; for even as the Atheist, that hee may sinne the more securely, fained to himselfe that there is not a God: so the uncleane and filthie man ima∣gineth a god like unto himselfe, Psal, 50.21. because I kept silence thou thoughtest that altogether I was such a one as thy selfe they who write of the Ethiopians, say, that they paint the Angels blacke, and the Divels white; they paint the Angels blacke, because they are blacke
themselves; they thinke the blacke colour the most comely colour, and the white the most uncomely co∣lour. So these filthie Moabites made choise of a god like unto themselves; and as their god Baal-peor was a filthie god, so were his Priests filthie Priests, in shewing their nakednesse. The more modest amongst the hea∣then thought it a filthie thing to shew their nakednesse, and therefore they sayd,Caro pro pudendis, honestatis causa. in scaenam sine subligaculo nemo prodeat, and as they had a filthy god, and filthy Priests; so they had a filthy Sacrifice, they offered an Asse to Priapus, which was a beast of great flesh, Ezek. 23.20. Afterwards this filthy Idoll was called by the La∣tines Deus hortorum,Priapus called Deus hortorum, and why. because they used to commit such filthinesse in gardens; and therefore they used this word hortum in re amorum, when they spake of filthy and unchast lust. Quod meus hortus habet, sumas impune, licebit, Si dederis nobis, quod tuus hortus habet. And when they would insinuate their filthy lusts, they say, laegere olera, legere nuces, legere poma. Propertius. Cum quibus Idaeo legisti poma sub antro, and so Virgilius. Malo me Galataea petit, lasciva puella. The Lord commanded his Priests to weare , side garments reaching to their feete, and also bree∣ches under them. The Moabites are called the people of Chamos, Num. 21.30. and Ier. 48. hence commeth the Greeke word , and the Apostle alludeth to this, Rom. 13.13.. , not in rioting, and drunkennesse. The Conclusion of this is; Spirituall adultery is pu∣nished with bodily whoredome, because they changed the glory of the uncorruptible god, into an image made like to
corruptible man, and to birds, and fourefooted beasts, and creeping things; wherefore God gave them also to unclean∣nesse, and to vile affections, Rom. 1.23. EXERCITAT. XVII. That a woman might not weare a mans apparell. A ceremoniall appendix of Command. 2. Deut. 22.5. The woman shall not weare that which per∣taineth to the man. THe Lord knowing how prone his people were to Idolatry, made a partition wall betwixt them and the Gentiles; and he would have them opposite to the Gentiles in their ceremoniall worship. Ʋide Analyses Iunij in Levit.First, the Egyptians eate onely swines flesh; therefore ye shall be opposite to them, ye shall not eate the flesh of the Hogge; they worshipped the Oxe and the Sheepe, therefore yee shall eate them, and sacrifice them. Secondly, in their apparell; the Priests of Isis did weare linnen, and wooll, therefore yee shall weare lin∣nen onely or wooll onely, and not linsey wolsey. The Iewes opposite to the Gentiles in the manner of their worship.Thirdly, the Egyptians had  to save them from evils, therefore the Lord commanded his people to weare phylacteries. Fourthly, in the manner of their worship; they when they worshipped they looked towards the sunne rising, but ye shall be contrary to them, and turne your faces towards the Arke, which stood in the west end of the Temple. It is a question whether this belongeth to the seventh Commandement or to the second. The most hold,
that it belongeth to the seventh Commandement,This is rather an appen∣dix of the second com∣mandement than of the seaventh. to teach men and women modestie; but if we will con∣sider the words of the Law more neerely, and the pra∣ctise of the heathen, it may seeme rather to be an ap∣pendix of the second Commandement;In more nebuchim parte, 3. for this word . abhomination, is spoken usually in the Scripture of Idolatry, & Maimone sheweth, that it was the manner of Idolatrous men to stand with the imbrodered gar∣ments of women upon them, before the starre Venus, and the women put upon them mens armour, and stood before the starre Mars, and therefore it may seeme that the Lord expresly forbiddeth the woman to put upon her [Celi] the armour of a man:Why women forbidden to put on mens armour. and if it were for∣bidden onely to eschew filthinesse, why would the Lord forbid women to put on mens armour, and the men to put on womens cloathes rather then the mans cloathes, putting Celi and Shimlath. And Iulius Firmi∣cus writing of the Idolatrous customes of the Assyrians, saith, that they worshipped Venus,Men worshipped Venus with womens cloaths, and women in mens armour. and that it was not lawfull to the Idolatrous Priests to worship her, nisi effaeminent vultum, & virilem sexum ornatu dedecora∣rent; unlesse they changed their countenance, and fai∣ned their sexe, and disgraced themselves,The ceremonies made a distinction betwixt the Iewes and Gentiles. putting on womens apparell upon them. And the Lord in all these ceremonials made a di∣stinction betwixt the Iewes and the Gentiles, rather than betwixt the male and female. Circumcision distinguished the males from the fe∣males, therefore the partition wall of the ceremonies distinguished the male from the female, as well as the Iew from the Gentile. Circumcision distinguished the people of God from other people;The females circumci∣sed in the males. but it distinguished not the male from the female; for the females were circumcised in the males, Gen. 34.14. we cannot give our sister to one that is
uncircumcised; the ceremonies were instituted then to make a distinction betwixt the Iewes the people of God, and the Heathen. Commandement III. EXERCITAT. XVIII. Of the Nazarites vow. Num. 6.2. When eyther man or woman shall separate them∣selves to vow a vow of a Nazarite, &c. THere were three sorts of things separated to the Lord, first the land every seventh yeare was sepa∣rated to him: Secondly, the first fruits were Nazarites to the Lord, in the originall it is, ginnebhe nezirecha vuae separationis, (as the Seventy translate it) or sanctificationis tuae (as the Chaldee paraphrast hath it) and thirdly,Three sorts of things separated to God. was nazareatus personae a separation of persons to God. A separation of persons againe was eyther of men or women, Num. 6.2. women Nazarits, as Sampsons Mo∣ther was a Nazarit,Naza∣reatus terra fructuum personaram. when they vowed themselves this wayes Nazarits, they were sayd [Iaphli] to doe some admirable or rare thing. admirable esse.So Nazarits according to their ages, as they were adul∣ti,Nazaraus adultus juvenis. prvulus. Iuvenes or parvuli; young men, as Amos, 2.11. they gave the Nazarits wine to drinke, or little ones, as Samuel. Nazaraus seculi dierum. Nazarits againe were eyther Nazaraei saeculi or Naza∣raei diaerum; Nazaraei seculi were those who were perpe∣tuall Nazarits and might not be redeemed, nor change their vow; such as were Samuel Sampson, Iohn the Bap∣tist and Iames, as Clemens testifieth, these Nazarits some of them were separated to the Lord by the vow of their
mother, as Samuels mother vowed him a Nazarite from his conception, min nagnaro, as soone as he stirred in his mothers bellie. The Child shall be a Nazarite from the wombe to the day of his birth, Iudg. 13.7. that is, a  movere from the time of his con∣ception, and from the time of his birth; but when it is sayd, Act. 3.2. he was lame from his mothers wombe, here both the time of his conception and his birth are com∣prehended. So Galat. 1.15. who separated me from my mo∣thers womhe, that is, from the time that my mother con∣ceived me. So Psal. 22.10. I was cast upon thee from the the wombe, that is, from the time that she conceived me. So Iere. 1.6. Psal, 58.3. the wicked are estranged from the womb they goe astray as soone as they be borne, here from the wombe signified the time from their conception. Nazzaaei dierum were those who vowed themselves a time onely, but after the time was expired, they were no more Nazarites. The vow of the voluntary Nazarit lasted but thirty dayes, as the Iewes gather;Mamone of his treatise of entring into the san∣ctuary, Cap. sect. 8.14. Absolon polled his head the thirtieth day of his vow, so did the voluntarie Nazarite, say they, and the inferiour priests shaved their heads every thirtieth day. Those who were separated to be Nazarits were commanded to absteine from three things; first from wine, secondly, from touching of the dead; and third∣ly, that no rasor should come upon their head to cut their haire. They are commanded not to eate the kernell of the raisin; secondly, not to eate the raisin It selfe; and thirdly, not to drinke the wine, as they might drinke no wine, so neither might they drinke ex maceratis vuis quas  or secundaria vina vocat Plinius; So they might drinke no vineger, the Seventy,  as made of apples, dates, &c. so a vino hordei, as Athenaeus calleth it.
They were commanded to absteine from wine and strong drinke; wine here is put before strong drinke, Scriptura enim nominat genus quandoque post speciem,Regula. the Lord saith, Amos 2.11. he raised up of their young men for Nazarits, but vers. 12. they gave their Nazarits wine to drinke, they should have learned abstinencie from the Nazarits, but they intised the Nazarits to drinke wine, contrary to the Law. The use that we may make of this is first to shew us that it is a sinne to be partaker of another mans sinnes, Psal 50.18. when thou sawest a theefe then thou consentedst with him, and wast pertaker with the adulterer. Secondly, not onely to be partaker, but approve the same, Rom. 1.32. thirdly, it is a greater sinne to be examples to others in sinne, as Iud. 11. woe be to them for they have gone in the way of Cain, but it is the greatest sinne of all, to provoke others to sinne, as here they provoked the Nazarits to drinke wine, and gave them wine to drinke. Secondly, they were commanded to absteine from the dead, and not to come neare their fathers, brethren or sisters, if they were dead; if a man dyed suddenly by them, they were defiled; and if they touched but one who touched the dead, they were defiled; the same holinesse was required of them, that was required of the highpriest to absteine from the dead. Maimone in his treatise of mourning, cap. 3.The Iewes say, if the Highpriest had lighted upon a dead bodie in the way, hee might defile himselfe and bury the dead, being alone, and none to helpe him: So they say, if an inferiour Priest and a Nazarite were wal∣king together, if he had beene but Nazaraeus dierum, he was to burie the dead, because his holinesse was not perpetuall; but if he had beene a perpetuall Nazarite then the inferior Priest was to bury the dead, and not he, because as great purity was required in the perpe∣tuall
Nazarite, as in the Priest concerning the dead. Did not Sampson sinne being a Nazarite by touching of the dead bodies, and taking off their cloathes? He did this by the singular direction of the spirit of the Lord; so he dranke of the water which flowed out of the law bone of the Asse, and eate of the honey which was in the dead Lion, which were al unclean by the law. The heathen Priests learned of them not to touch the dead,Seneca consolatione ad Marcian. cap 15. the Flaminian Priests might not put shoes upon their feete of the leather of that beast which dyed of it selfe, and if a Priest happened to have a funerall orati∣on before the dead corpes, he used to stretch a vaile betwixt him and the corpes, that he might not see it, Non licebat Flamini Diali tibias funebres-audire, nec locum in quo bustum erat, ingredi: A Flaminian Priest might not heare the sound of the pipes which were at burialls, neither might he come into that place where there was a grave. The third thing was this, that no Rasor came upon their head: they suffered their haire to grow,, intonsi therefore they were called , & they were called , vel intonsi, and if they were voluntary Nazarits, no Razor might come upon their heads untill the vow was expired, and then their haire was cut and cast un∣der the Altar, & burnt: but if they were perpetuall Na∣zarits, there came never a razor upon their head, but their haire was onely cut about, and this was cincta caesa∣ries; Dalila cut off Sampsons haire, yet he ceased not to be a Nazarit; for the Angell said, that he should be a Na∣Zarit unto his death. The haire was a signe of strength, and as long as Sampson kept his haire, hee kept his strength; and God threatning to weaken the estate of his people, useth this similitude, that he will shaue the haire with a razor. Esay. 7.20. In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor.
When the voluntary Nazaret vowed a vow for thir∣ty dayes, and in the meane time defiled himselfe, by touching of the dead; if the whole time had beene spent to one day, and then if he had touched any uncleane thing, all these former dayes were reckoned nothing to him (Iob. 3.6. [Naphal] fugient, aut dilabentur: Onkelos, inutiles erunt,Perire diem ad embolis∣mum pertinet. or let let them be reckoned amongst the intercalar dayes which were not numbered amongst the dayes of the yeere) and he was to begin his vow anew againe: so it is in the course of our sanctification, when we haue gone on a while in it, and then fall into some great sinne, in that case we are to begin our sanctificati∣on anew againe. Act. 7.42. O yee house of Israel, have ye offered to me slaine beasts, and sacrificed by the space of forty yeeres in the Wildernesse? They offered to the Lord sun∣dry times in the Wildernes according to his ordinance; but because now they fell to worship Idols, therefore the Lord reckoned the former sacrifices, as though they had not beene offered to him. When the Israelites had travelled to the confines of Moab to Kadesh-Barnea, they fell a murmuring there a∣gainst the Lord, therefore the Lord brought them backe againe, after that they had passed sixteene stationes. Num. 33.20.35, To the red Sea in which they were bap∣tized, 1 Cor. 10.2. So when we fall from the Lord, we are to returne backe againe to our Baptisme and first vow. And he came and dwelt in Nazaret, that it might be fulfilled, which was spoken by the Prophet. Matth. 2.23. And he shall be a Nasarit to the Lord. How were these two accomplished in Christ, he was called both a Nasarit, and a Nazarit. Christ was a Nazaret, the true branch of the roote of lesse,Nazaraus vot, Naza∣renus habitatione. and he was a Nasarit truly separate to the Lord; and Satan acknowledged him to be  Luc. 4.
As Sampsō was , sanctified to the Lord in type;. he was both  et  est , sanctus, and he was  oriundus ex Nazaret, and in the title of Christs Crosse there was an allusion to that plate of gold which was upon the forehead of the high Priest, and therefore Aaron was called the Saint of the Lord, because he had holinesse to the Lord written in his forehead; that plate of gold was called Nezer, it had written upon it , which is . Exod. 30.39. It was written, that is, ingraven in the plate, Christ was that true Nazarit holy, blamelesse, and undefiled; we are to marke, that the Seventy to facilitate words, and to make them the more easie to be pronoun∣ced, write the words different from the Hebrew, as they say, Samaria for Shemron, so Solomon, for Shelo∣moh, so Nasareus for Nazareus, & the devil being well ac∣quainted with all languages, could cal Christ  putting [S] for [Z] so in the inscription upon the Crosse they call him that Nasarit or Nazarit. But Christ did drinke wine therfore he cannot be cal∣led Nasarit, but Nazarit onely. He was not a legall Nasarit, for he fulfilled that in his forerunner Iohn the Baptist; but he was the true Nasarit separated from sinners; the Iewes in contempt called Christ a Nazarit, and so Iulian the apostate called Christ a Galilean, because Nazarit stood in Galilee, and it was for this, that the Christians were called at the first Nazaraei, but afterward their name was changed at An∣tioch, and they were called Mesichijm, Christiani. From the cutting of the Nazarits haire, they brought in shaving of the heads in the Christian Church, and they said, that long haire signified superfluity in man∣ners; hence came this speech afterwards, Tonso capite fieri monachus; judaizing in this point.
Commandement. IIII. EXERCITAT. XIX. Of the Passeover. Levit. 23.5. In the fourteenth day of the first moneth is the Lords passover. How the Passeover per∣taineth to the fourth Commandement.THe passeover as it was a sacrifice, and a sacrament, it is an appendix of the second Commandement; but the time of it set downe here is an appendix of the fourth Commandement. The word [Passeover] taken diversly.This word [Passeover] is taken sundry wayes in the Scripture; First, for passing over, because the Angell passed over the houses of the Israelites, and destroyed them not, Exod. 12.11. It is the Lords passeover, Secondly, Passeover is taken for those actions which were done a∣bout the passeover, as killing the lambe, sprinkling of the blood, eating of it, and such, Matth. 26.17. Third∣ly, for the feast which was annexed to the Passeover, 2 Chro. 35.11. They killed the Passeover and the Priests sprinkled the blood, &c. This was for the feast of the Passeover. Fourthly, for the Lambe killed at the Passe∣over. Matth. 26.19. And they made ready the Passeover, That is, the Lambe which was killed at the Passeover, so Marc. 14.12. They killed the Passeover. Lastly, for the time of the Passeover, as Luc. 22.1. They had in this Passeover unleavened bread, a Lamb, bitter herbes, and a cup in which they did drinke.
First, they had unleavened bread,The unleavened bread called the poores bread. this unleavened bread was panis pauperum, the poores bread, Deut. 13.6. Yet the Lord taketh this unleavned bread for the Sa∣crament; it was a great change,Why they had unleave∣ned bread in the Passe∣over. when Moses rod which was the shepheards rod, was made the rod of the Lord; so this was a great change, when he tooke the poores bread, and made it this bread of his Sacrament; they were commanded to eate the bread in remembrance of their hastening out of Egypt, when they had no lei∣sure to ferment it; but Christ changed it to another sort of remembrance, to be a memorall of his death in the Sacrament. 1 Cor. 11:24. Doe this in remembrance of me. It must be unleavened bread, for leavened bread sig∣nified either Hypocrisie or malice; David calleth a wic∣ked man, A leavened person. Psal. 71.4. So a leavened heart. Psal. 73.21. So Matt. 16.6. Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and 1 Cor. 5.7. Purge out the old leaven. Then they eate it with bitter herbes,Why eaten with sowre herbes. to put them in remembrance of their affliction in Egypt; and Ieremiah seemeth to allude to this. Lament. 3.15.Allusion. He hath filled me with bitternesse, he hath made me drunken with worme wood. Whether was the cup in the paschall supper, a Sacra∣mentall Cup or not? Not, Whether the Cup in the Passeover was a Sacra∣mentall Cup or not. for there is no mention made of it in the institu∣tion, the Lord commandeth to take a Lambe, unlea∣vened bread, and bitter herbes, but not a word of the Cup; wherefore this cup was but their common Cup, in which they used to drinke. It may be said,  that the Master of the familie blessed this Cup. This was not constitutiva sanctificatio, but invocativa:Sancti∣ficatio. Constitutio. Invocatio. it is constitutiva invocatio, that maketh it a Sacrament, accedat verbum ad elementum, et fiet Sacramentum (saith
Augustine) and when it wanteth the word of institution then it cannot be a Sacrament; it is true that Christ transferred this cup,Many things that are common, changed to a holy use. and made it Sacramentall under the Gospell: but it was not sacramentall under the Law, it was onely a common cup, the water which they dranke out of the Rocke was a Sacrament to them, 1 Cor. 10.4. and it was also common water, for their beasts drunke of it. So this was but a common Cup to them, but Christ made it Sacramentall, somethings againe which were Sacramentall to them, were common at Christs Sup¦per, as the eating of bitter herbes. Last, it was not a Sacramentall Cup, for the blood of the Paschall Lamb signified the blood of Christ; there are not two things appointed in the Sacrament to signifie one thing. What things were pro∣per to the Passeover in Egypt, and what proper to it in Canaan.Things proper to the Passeover in Egypt, were first, they eate the Passeover in their severall houses when they were in Egypt; but afterwards they were bound to eate it in Ierusalem onely. Deut. 16.5.6. 2 Chro. 35. Secondly, in Egypt the blood was sprinkled upon the Lintels of the doores; but afterwards it was sprinkled upon the Altar. 2 Chro. 35. and then the Master of the house caused to bring backe the Lamb to his house, and eate it with his family. Luc. 22.7.8. Thirdly, in Egypt they stood when they eat the Pas∣chall Lambe, with their loines girt, and their staves in their hands, to signifie that they were to make haste, a∣way,  and Esay alludeth to this, Esay. 52.12. For yee shall not goe out with haste, nor goe by flight; but when they came to Canaan, they sate when they eate the Passeover. Their sitting at the Passeover was not a sig∣nificative Ceremony. Whether was their sitting a significative ceremony, or not, when they eate the Passeover in Canaan? Seven memorable Passeovers. Not, it was onely after the custome of men when they sit to eate meat. There were sundry memorable Passeovers. The first
in Egypt, the second in the Wildernesse; the third in the dayes of Ioshua; Cap. 5.10. the forth in the dayes of He∣zekiah; 2 Chro. 30. the fift in the dayes of Iosiah, where there was not such a Passeover holden from the dayes of the Iudges that judged Israel, nor in all the dayes of the Kings of Israel. 2 King. 23.22. The Sixt, after they returned from the captivity. Ezra 6.9. The last Passeover was that which Iesus kept with his Disciples. Luc. 22. where he put an end to the Passeover, and instituted his owne Supper in the place of it. Whether was the Lambe which was killed at the Passeover, a Sacrament or a sacrifice? The most hold that it was not a sacrifice, and their reasons are these. First, it might be killed by others than by the Priest, therefore it was not a Sacrament. Secondly, Exod. 8.26. It was abhomination for the Israelites to sacrifice in Egypt, but the paschall Lambe was eaten in Egypt; therefore the paschall Lambe was not a sacrifice. Thirdly, a Sacrament differeth from a sacrifice, for in a sacrifice we offer to God, and in a Sacrament wee receive from God; the Paschall Lambe was a Sacra∣ment; therefore it could not be a sacrifice. Fourthly, that which was eaten of the sacrifice, was eaten onely in the Temple; but the Paschall lambe was eaten out of the Temple, therefore it was not a sacrifice. Now for answer to the first, after that they came out of Egypt, and the priesthood was setled, the Priests one∣ly killed the sacrifice, and sprinkled the blood, and the Lambe was then caried home. Secondly, It was abhomination to sacrifice in Egypt,Maimone in Corban Peshang, cap. 1. . it was an abhomination to the Egyptians to see beasts killed there, because they worshiped beasts as their Gods; but it was not abhomination before the Lord; for feare of
the Egyptians they would not sacrifice there, they might have sacrificed there as well as they killed the Paschall Lambe there, it was a thing lawfull in it selfe. We must distinguish two things in the paschal Lamb, it was both a Sacrament and a sacrifice; the sprinkling of the blood in the Temple was a sacrifice, the eating of the Lambe at home in their severall houses was a Sacrament; and so as it was a sacrifice, they offered; and as it was a Sacrament, they received. Reasons proving that the Paschall Lambe was a sacrifice.Reasons proving that it was a sacrifice are these: First, 2 Chro. 30.1. Hezekiah gave Commandement that all the people should come to the house of the Lord at Ierusalem to keepe the Passeover, Wherefore should he have commanded them to come to the house of the Lord to eat it, if it had not been a sacrifice? if it had been onely a Sacrament it had beene enough to have bidden come to Ierusalem to eate it. Secondly, 2 Chro. 35.11. And they killed the Passe∣over, and they sprinkled the blood, it was the blood of the sacrifice that the Priest sprinkled. Iosephus de bello Iudaico. lib. 6. cap. 45.Iosephus writeth, that Cestus Florus, when he would shew to the Emperor the multitude of the Iewes that were in Ierusalem at the Passeover, he desired the Priests that they might get the number of the people; and how did the Priests find out the number of the people? he saith, by the number of the Lambes which they killed at the Passeover, and then they reckoned how many were in every familie at the eating of a Lamb, and so they found out the number of the people; it was the Priest then that killed those Lambes, and none else. The Paschall Lambe a figure of Christ.The Paschall Lambe was a figure of Iesus Christ: the Paschall Lambe was taken the tenth day, and separated untill the fourteenth & at the evening of the fourteenth it was killed: Iesus Christ, the true Paschall Lambe, Came sixe dayes before the Passeover to Bethania. Ioh. 12.1.
and the morrow after he went to Ierusalem, where they met him with branches of palme trees, and this was five dayes before the Passeover, then he stayed foure dayes in Ierusalem, and was killed in the day of the Passeover at night, and thus he accomplished the cere∣monies of the Law. Whether did the Iewes and Christ eate the Passeo∣ver upon the same day, or not? Christ observed the true day,Whether Christ kept the Passeover that same day which the Iewes kept. in the end of the four∣teenth day, and the beginning of the fifteenth, he eate it betwixt two evenings; but the Iewes transferred the day, and eate it in the end of the fifteenth day, and be∣ginning of the sixteenth; and therefore when Christ eate the Passeover, it was the day of the Preparation to the Iewish Passeover, although indeed it was the true Passeover, Iohn 17.62. When the Passeover preceded the Sabbath, they used to transferre the holy actions of that day to the Sabbath, that two feasts may not fall together, and they did their common worke upon that day, which should have been done upon the Passeover, and reserved the holy actions to the Sabbath follow∣ing; and it was upon this day that they crucified Christ. They kept this translation of feasts,Why they transferred their feasts to the Sab∣bath. lest the feast of Lots should have fallen, 2, 4, 7. Lest the feast of the Passeover should have fallen. 2, 4, 6. Lest the feast of the Pentecost should have fallen. 3, 5, 7. Lest the beginning of the new yeare should have fal∣len. 1, 4, 6. Lest the day of expiation should have fallen. 1, 3, 6. They observed this translation of the feasts, because they had certaine feasts which fell upon these dayes, that two feasts should not fall together, as the three
feasts of Dedication, the foure fasts mentioned in Za∣chariah, and the feast of Lots. When the divers keeping of the Passeover began.This diversity was not kept so long as the first Tem∣ple stood, whence arose it then? it seemeth to have ta∣ken the beginning from the divers beginning of the moneth, for when they reckoned their moneth from the apparition which was doubtfull and uncertaine; hence it came to passe, that the beginning of the moneth was not alwayes at the selfe-same period; for the last day of Adar might fall out so, that it should be the beginning of Nisan; and therefore the San∣hedrin, appointed that the full Moone should be the thirteenth day, which according to the verity was the fourteenth; this diversitie arose of this, because of the divers apparitions of the Moone, so they kept the preparation to the Pascha diversly. Great dissention be∣twixt the Easterne and Westerne Churches for keeping of the Passe∣over.When the Apostles have so clearely determi∣ned that matter, that no man should bee condem∣ned or judged for not keeping these dayes, yet Satan came and did sow his Cockle and his Darnell, and rai∣sed dissentions in the Churches, betwixt the Easterne and Westerne Churches, about the keeping of the Passeover; the Easterne Churches alledged that Iohn and Philip celebrated the Passeover in memory of Christs Supper, for they kept diem , in the four∣teenth day of the Moneth, but the Westerne Churches alledged that Peter and Paul kept the Passeo∣ver upon the first Lords day after the fourteenth day of the moneth, upon which day they kept diem . Pius Bishop of Rome ordained the Passeover to be kept on the Lords day.Pius Bishop of Rome, in the yeere of God, 147. gave out an Edict, that the Pascha should be celebrated by all upon the Lords day; yet those in Asia cared not much for this Edict, and there arose hot contentions on both the sides: Polycarpus Iohns Disciple came into Rome to settle this contention, and he appointed that every one
should celebrate the Pascha as they were wont, yet this contention was not buried, for the Easterne and Westerne Churches left not off one to write against another. Victor the Bishop of Rome in a Synode holden there,Victor his Statute con∣cerning the Passeover. ordayned that the Pascha should be celebrated there upon the Lords day from the fourteenth day of March, untill the twenty one of that moneth. Those of Caesarea Palestina, Pontus, and Achaia, embraced this Edict, yet others stood out against it, and said they would keepe it according to Iohns tradition, wherefore Victor ex∣communicated all the Bishops in Asia: Yet, Irenaeus Bishop of Lions, Polycarpus Schollar, setled the matter, un∣der this condition that every one should celebrate it after his owne forme.The contention be∣twixt the Easterne and Westerne Churches wakened againe. This peace lasted not long, for in the yeare of Christ 318, the contention was wakened anew againe, which Constantine the Emperour tooke hardly out, exhorting the Asiatickes not to be partakers with the Iewes who crucified Christ; but they would not obey the Empe∣rours letters, for they said, they kept not the Iewes Passeover, but the new Passeover instituted by Christ; But a Councell being convened at Nice for the repres∣sing of the heresie of the Arrians, it was appointed, that through every Church of the Empire,The decree of the Coun∣cell of Nice. the Pascha should be celebrated upon the Lords day by all. The Councell for finding out of the Pascha, appoin∣ted first, that it should be celebrated after the twenty one day of March, for at that time the vernall Equinox was upon this day, and the Pascha should be celebra∣ted after the Equinox, Secondly, that after the twen∣ty one day of March, they should looke still to the fourteenth day of the moone, and after this day should the Passeover be kept upon the Lords day, and to find out the time of the Moone, they composed the sicle
of the golden number, for wheresoever in the Kalender the golden number is found of that yeere, there is the new Moone; and although these rules were sure at the Councell of Nice, yet they hold not now, for the Equi∣nox is not now fixed upon the twenty one day of March, but ever anticipateth it, for now it is on the tenth of March: but now these who reckon to the Passeover, looke to the first new Moone, after the first day of Lent, and the first Sunday after, beginneth the Quadragesima, and the seventh Sunday after is the Pas∣cha. The Iewish feasts went backeward.Marke that all these Iewish feasts being reckoned by the Equinoxe, they goe backward from the day upon which they were first instituted; when the Passeover was instituted at the first, it fell upon the twenty seventh day of March.When the Passeover was institute, the E∣quinoxe was upon the 27 day of March. At the Councell of Nice, the Equinoxe, turned backe to the twenty one day, on which the Passeover was kept; and now, it is turned backe to the tenth day. If the Passeover should be kept now accor∣ding to the Equinoxe, it should be kept the tenth of March. The reason why the Equinoxe varieth so, is because in the space of every hundreth and sixe yeares,Why the Equinox vari∣eth. At the Creation the Equinox was upn tho 3 day of April. the whole Spheres come from the South to the North, by motion of the Firmament one degree, the world being created upon the third of Aprill, which was the Equinox then, now it is turned backe to the tenth of March, and if the world were to continue so long, it would turne to the tenth of Ianuary: By this the Lord would teach the Iewes, that all their feasts have taken an end; but the Sabbath continually goeth forward, for it shall fall this yeare upon the first of Ianuary, it will fall upon the second of Ianuary the next yeare, and so forth; but the feasts goe backeward, that which falleth upon Saturday this yeare, shall fall upon Friday the next yeare; and as the Planets have a contrary
course to the first mover, going backeward, whereas the first mover goeth forward; so these feasts going backeward, turne to nothing, but the Sabbath going still forward, shall end in that eternall Sabbath. The conclusion of this is, these feasts being so altera∣ble and moveable, it was a foolish contention betwixt the Easterne and the Westerne Churches about the keeping of the Passeover. EXERCITAT. XX. Of the Pentecost. A ceremoniall appendix of Command. 4. Levit 23.15. And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the Sabbath, from the day that yee brought the sheafe of the wave-offering, seven Sabbaths shall be compleat, &c. THe Pentecost is called the feast of weekes, because there were seven weekes betwixt the morrow after the Passeover; and it is called the Pentecost, from , fifty, and in Hebrew, Haghashibignoth, There were sundry memorable things reckoned by the number of fifty in the Scriptures; Many memorable things by the number of fifty. as fifty dayes from their comming out of Egypt, unto the giving of the Law. The Dough which they brought out of Egypt, lasted thirty dayes, for the Manna descended the sixe∣teenth day of the second moneth; now betwixt the fifteenth day of the first moneth, when they came out of Egypt, to the sixteenth day of the second moneth, are just thirty dayes, after that time within fifteene dayes, they came to Sinai, that maketh forty five dayes; then the Lord commanded them to sanctifie themselves
three dayes, annd that maketh forty eight dayes; then the second day after that, the Law was given. So there were fifty dayes betwixt the morrow after the Passeo∣ver and the Pentecost: So there were fifty dayes after Christs Resurruction, and the comming downe of the Holy Ghost upon the Apostles: so in the fiftieth yeare was the Iubile. The errour of the Sa∣maritans, in reckoning of the Pentecost.There were seven weekes from the morrow after the Passeover to the Pentecost; the Samaritans mistaking the word Sabbath, they kept seven Pentecosts in one yeare, therefore they were called Hebdomaditai. They began to reckon the Pentecost from the mor∣row after the Passeover, which they called , and the first Sabbath after the , was called . Christ rose upon this , and as there were fifty dayes betwixt , and the Pentecost; so there were fifty dayes betwixt Christs Resurrection, and the comming downe of the Holy Ghost. The Angell stirred the poole at the Passeover.At the Pentecost, the man which had an infirmitie thirty eight yeeres, was cured, Ioh. 5.5. For it is said, verse 4. That an Angell went downe , at a cer∣taine season; and the Hebrewes say, lemognad hase, and the Helnists say , (following the Hebrewes) at this season, that is, at the Pentecost; , here is ta∣ken distributivè; so Mat. 27.15. The Angell came downe at their feasts, when many people were met to∣gether at Ierusalem; conferre, Ioh. 4.36. with cap. 5.1. At that Pentecost the Angell but came downe, but at the great Pentecost the Holy Ghost came downe. When the Barley Har∣vest began.Vpon the  was the beginning of their Harvest, and then there were but handfuls of Barley brought in (therefore at the Passeover they read the History of Ruth, in the dayes of the Barley Harvest, Ruth 1.22. In the beginning of the Barley Harvest; the Chaldee Pa∣raphrast
paraphraseth it at the Pentecost.) But at the Pen∣tecost, the full Harvest was gathered in; their first Har∣vest was of their Barley, of their basest Graine onely; but the full Harvest of their best Graine, the Wheate, was at the Pentecost. Christ said, Ioh. 4.35. Say ye not,  there are foure Moneths, and then commeth Harvest? Be∣hold, I say unto you, lift up your eyes, and looke on the Fieldes; for they are white already unto Harvest. But although the Harvest was great, yet there were few Labourers, Mat. 9, 37. Here is an excellent allusion betwixt the Pentecost, when their Cornes were ripe, being the time of their full Harvest, and the comming downe of the Holy Ghost, for at the Pascha there was little Harvest, but at the Pentecost all the regions were white: so be∣fore the holy Spirit came downe, there was but a small Harvest; but when the Holy Ghost came downe,The Apostles gathered that which the Pro∣phets had sowne. there was a plentifull and a great Harvest; and at the Pente∣cost they gathered that which the Prophets had sowen, Iohn 4.38. Yee reaped that wherein yee bestowed no la∣bour. Christ is called the first fruits from the dead,Christ the first fruits from the dead. 1 Cor. 15.20. as a handfull of the first fruits, sanctified the whole field of Corne that was growing; so Iesus Christ, the first fruits from the dead, sanctifieth all those who are lying in the Grave to rise againe by his power, even when they are in the dust of death, Psal. 22.15. The day of the Pentecost was called ,The Pentecost had but one holy day. as the last dayes of the Passeover, and the feast of Tabernacles were called gnazereth, holy dayes, there was but one holy day of the Pentecost; but the first and the last dayes of the other great feasts were both holy, and yet the Pen∣tecost was the most excellent Feast of all, for then the Comforter came, and the gift of the Holy Ghost came downe plentifully upon the Church. Lastly, observe the phrase, Act. 2.1. When the dayes
of the Pentecost were fulfilled,The Scriptures speake of things as done, whn they are but in the act of doing. that is, fulfilling, So Ier. 25.12. And it shall come to passe, when seventy yeares are ac∣complished, that I will punish the King of Babylon, and that Nation, saith the Lord; Seventy yeares were not cōplete here, for in the seventieth yeare they returned from the captivity; so here, when the dayes of the Pente∣cost were fulfilled, that is, upon the very day of the Pen∣tecost, when it was fulfilling. This word gnazareth is usually restrained by the Iewes to the last of the Pentecost, and it is translated by the Seventy, Amos 5.21. , which word Paul useth, Heb. 12.23. for a generall Assembly. EXERCITAT. XXI. Of the Feast of Tabernacles. A ceremoniall appendix of Command. 4. Levit. 23.33. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speake unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day of of this seventh moneth, shall be the Feast of Tabernacles for seven dayes unto the Lord. God instituted many things to put his people in memory of his judge∣ments and mercies.THe Lord would not have his people forgetfull, nei∣ther of his mercies, nor of his judgements; of his mercies, Therefore he commanded them to keepe the Passeover in remembrance of their deliverance out of Egypt; he gave them the Law fifty dayes after they came out of Egypt, therefore hee would have them to keepe the Pentecost; he fed them with Manna, there∣fore he commanded the pot with Manna to be reserved; they dwelt in Tabernacles, or Boothes, all the time that they were in the Wildernesse; therefore he comman∣ded
them to keepe the feast of Tabernacles, lest they should forget his benefits, Psal. 103, 2. Forget not all his benefits. So he will not have them forget his judge∣ments, therefore he commanded the Censers of Na∣dab, and Abihu to be nailed upon the Altar, to be a me∣moriall unto the children of Israel, Num. 16.39.40. The feast of Tabernacles was instituted,why the feast of Taber∣nacles was instituted to put them in remembrance that they were but Pilgrimes in the Wildernesse, and had not a permanent dwelling there. Their first station in the Wildernesse after they came out of Egypt, was Succoth, a Boothe, or a Tabernacle; Tabernaculum Tentorium, est etiam proprium nomen loci a tiguriissic dicti a  texit, obtexit. and they had fortytwo Stations in the Wildernesse, from the first, to the last, and all this time when they were in the Wildernesse, they had nothing to dwell in but Tents and Boothes, so that here they were but Pil∣grimes upon the earth; as their fathers were before them. Psal. 39.19. Because our life is a pilgrimage, there∣fore David saith, I am tossed up and downe as the Locust. Psal. 109.23. The Locust is now here, now there: so is the life of man tossed to and fro; and Micah saith, A∣rise and depart, for this is not your rest. Micah. 2.10. Observe how the Lord doth Minister comfort to his people, shewing them a sure dwelling,Comforts which God giveth to his children dwelling in their taber∣nacles here. and a place of rest for their transitory Tabernacles; we dwell in thes bodies, but as in a Tabernacle, but this is our com∣fort. 2 Cor. 5.1. We know that if our earthly house of this Tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of GOD, an house not made with hands, eternall in the Heavens. When the Patriarches dwelt in Canaan, they dwelt in Tents and Tabernacles. Heb. 11.9. But their comfort was, They looked for a City which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is God. Heb. 11.10. When they tra∣velled in the Wildernesse with the ambulatory Arke, this Tabernacle the Lord refused, and his glory depar∣ted
from it: but in place of it Christ himselfe, , Dwelt amongst us as in the Tabernacle of his flesh. Ioh, 1.14. where the Shecinah or Divine Majesty dwelleth for ever. This was the Tabernacle which the Lord made and not man,. Heb. 11.9. Lastly, although the grave be called domus saeculi mans long home. Eccle. 12.5. Yet our bodies doe rest there, but as in a Taberna∣cle for a while, Act. 2.26. Our bodies rest there but for a short time, and he hath prepared another City for us to dwell in. This feast of Tabernacles was said to be kept seven dayes, Levit. 23.34. And the Evangelist saith, Vpon the last and great day of the feast Iesus stood up. Ioh. 7.37. This was the most solemne day of the feast, this day they kept festum laetitiae legis, the feast of joy, because they ended the reading of the Law this day; and the next Sabbath, they called Sabbath berefith, because they began againe to read the booke of Genesis, and they read three Haphtaroth or Sections that day, the first was Haphtaroth elle pekudi lejom shenishel succoth, and it be∣gan at, 1 King. 7.51. So was ended all the words which King Salomon made, &c. And that day Salomon stood up and blessed all the people: So Iesus Christ the true Sa∣lomon blessed the people in the great and last day of the feast. The second Haphtorah which was read this day, was Haphtorah Shimhhath Hatorah, festum laetitaei legis, and it began at Iosh. 1. They kept this feast because the Law was ended, At this feast was the de∣dication of the Temple, and the Arke brought into it.  Chro. 3.2.3.7. The remnant of the Iewes that returnd from the cativity was to keepe this feast, Zach. 14.16. and Ioshua began the Prophets. The third Haphtaroh which they read, was Sabboth Hagadol, which began at, Mal. 3.4. And it ended with these words, Behold I will send you Elijah the Prophet. Mal. 4.5. And so they joyned the last Section of the law, and the last Section of the Prophets both together, and it was on this day that Iesus Christ stood up and
spake to them, who was the true Salomon, the true Ioshua, the end of the law and the Prophets: and where∣as the Iewes delighted much in eating and drinking that day, Iesus Christ called all those to him who thirst. If any man thirst let him come to me and drinke. Ioh. 7.37. Last, see how upon the first day of this feast they offe∣red thirteene young Bullockes, two Rames, and four∣teene Lambes of the first yeere, the second day twelve, the third day, eleven; the fourth day, ten; the fift day, nine; the sixt day, eight; and upon the seventh day of the feast were offered but seven Bullockes, the sea∣venth day of the feast was the great day of the feast, and yet it had but the meanest offering, which gave them to understand, that the Lord was to abolish these sacra∣fices, and to bring in a perfect sacrifice in place of them, who is Iesus Christ once to be offered for all. At this feast they held up branches, and so they held them up to Christ before the Passeover, and they sang Hosanna which was a solemne sort of prayer, Sal∣va quaeso nunc, and they wish not onely peace to him on earth but also in Heaven. Then the shoute of a King was amongst them, Num. 23.21.
EXERCITAT. XXII. Of the New Moones. A ceremoniall appendix of Command. 4. Psal. 81.3. Blow up the Trumpet in the New Moone, in the time appointed on our solemne feast day. Novilunium a  texit, quod∣tunc Luna Sole tegitur: vel  Feria sta∣tiva, tempas statum; quod in numeratum an∣ni diem semper recurrit, a  numeravit, sup∣putavit.THe New Moone hath two names in the Scripture, First, it is called Ceseh or Cese. Secondly, it is called Hhodesh from [Hhiddesh] renovare. They kept the New Moones holy as they did their Sabbaths, Wherefore wilt thou goe unto him to day, it is neither New Moone nor Sabbath. 2 King. 4.28. So the Apostle joyneth them both together. Coloss. 2.16. Let no man therefore judge you, in respect of an Holy day, or of the New Moone, or of the Sabbath. Their new Moones and other feasts were Holy dayes, they might doe no servile worke in those dayes, as to reape, sow or plough, buy or sell, but they might kin∣dle fire, dresse meat, and such upon them, which they might not doe upon the Sabbath. Noviluniū, men∣sis a  Innovavit.In all their other Holy dayes, the Passeover, pentecost, feast of Tabernacles, and first day of the new yeare, their sacrifice had a feast joyned with it; but the first day of the new Moone had no feast added to it. 1 Sam. 20.11.12.13. It is said that it was the day of the new Moone, and David desired to goe to Bethlehem to keepe the feast. The feast was not kept here for the new Moone, but because it was the day of the feast of Trumpets, or the first day of the New yeere; for the first day of the
Moneth, and the first day of the New yere fell together; therefore the Iewes when they set downe their Haphto∣rah in the Margent upon, 1 Sam. 20. They set downe Haphtorah berosh Harsh, as ye would say, a division to be read in the first of the first, that is, on that which was both the first day of the Moneth, and the first day of the New yeere; and it was for the first day of the New yeere that the feast was kept, and not for the first day of the New Moone. The New Moone was celebrated ever upon the first day of the Moneth,The new Moone kept ever upon the first day of the moneth. and therefore the Moone and the Moneth began both in one day, although not at the same houre; for the Moone had twentynine dayes and twelve houres, but the Moneth had twentynine or thir∣ty dayes successively; therefore the twelve houres of the first New Moone, excressing over the twentynine dayes of the first moneth, were reserved untill the se∣cond New Moone, which had other twelve houres, and those two being joyned together, made up the thir∣ty day of the second Month. The Lord would have them to keepe these New Moones Holy to him, to teach them,Why they kept the new Moones. that it was he who ruled and governed the world, and all the changes and vicissitudes of it; for as the Moone is predominant over all inferior creatures, so doth Gods providence rule all things below here; the heathen groaped after this, when they set a god or a goddesse to every Moneth, as Iuno to Ianuary; Neptune to February;The heathen set a god over every moneth. Minerva to March; Venus to Aprill; Apollo to May; Mercury to Iune; Iupiter to Iuly; Ceres to August; Vulcan to Septem∣ber; Mars to October; Diana to November; and Vesta to December. But the Lord hath made summer and winter, Psal. 74.17. And it is he that crowneth the yeere with his goodnesse. Psal. 65.21. The keeping of these New Moones taught them the
estate of the Church in this world;A comparison betwixt the moone and the Church. the Church is com∣pared to the Moone, the Moone is lightned by the Sunne, and beautified by it, the Church is said to be faire as the Moone, Cant. 6.10. She is faire as the Moone, when she is cloathed with Christs righteousnesse: and as the moone hath her light from the Sunne, so hath the Church her light from Iesus Christ. The Sunne gi∣veth light and receiveth none; the Moone giveth light, and receiveth; the aire onely transmitteth light, but it giveth no light; so the Lord onely giveth light, but receiveth none; the Church receiveth light and com∣municateth light to others; but the worldlings neither receive light nor doe communicate light to others. The diverse changes of the Moone.Againe the Church is like the Moone for her altera∣tions, and change, for the moone hath many changes; she is somtimes [Cese] in ab scondito, or in , or , in the conjunction; Secondly, she is , or in , when shee is in the prime; Thirdly, she is , Corniculata; Fourthly, she is , halfe Moone; then she is , Gibbosa; and then , full Moone: so in declination, First, she is , then ; Thirdly, , and fourthly, in , many are the alterations which are in the Moone; so there are in the Church. Psal. 89.2. Salomons Kingdome is compared to the Moone;Solomons Kingdome compared to the Moone. the Moone in twenty eight dayes finisheth her course, fourteene dayes to the full, and fourteene dayes to the wane: so from Abraham were fourteene generations to Salomon, then the Moone was at the full; then from the end of Salomons dayes, untill Zedokiah are fourteene generations; and then the Kingdome decay∣ed and waned. Lastly, observe here that they are commanded to keepe the New Moone, and not the full Moone, to teach the Church that her greatest perfection here is to bee growing to perfection.
The Moone keepeth three courses,Three motions of the Moone. the first is called mensis peragrationis, The second is mensis illuminationis, and the third is mensis conjunctionis. Mensis peragrationis is this,Mensis peragrationis what, when the Moone goeth from the point of the Zodiacke to the same point a∣gaine; and this shee doth in twentyseaven dayes and eight houres; the Iewes observed not this moneth, be∣cause it hath no reference to the Sunne, but respecteth onely the owne proper course of it. The second is mensis illuminationis, that is,Mensis illuminationis what. when the Moone is entring in under the Sunne, and when she is wearing out under the sunne againe; this moneth comprehendeth twentyeight dayes, the Greekes call it , the old and new, and this moneth the Iewes keepe not. The third is mensis conjunctionis,Mensis conjunctionis, what. the moneth of the Moones conjunction with the Sunne, consisting of twenty nine dayes and twelve houres, she remained un∣der the beames of the Sunne twelve houres before the point of the change: when she is comming out under the Sunne, in those twelve houres she is said to bee in , or , but because she could not be seene immediately after these twelve houres were past for the brightnesse of the Sunne beames, they stayed untill the Sunne went downe,What time of the new Moone they blew the Trumpets. then they went up to the Tur∣rets of their Synagogues and then they blew their Trumpets and killed their sacrifices in the space of those eighteene houres; her twelve houres after she came out under the Sunne, and the sixe houres to the prime the Iewes marked them with those two letters [Iod He] which make eighteene.. 18. Againe,Motus Velo cissi∣mus, tardissi∣mus, medius. observe that the Moone hath Motum velo cissimum, tardissimum, et medium; her swiftest course is when she is farthest from the earth, and then she is in , in this course she runneth 17 degrees in one day,
and she remaineth not under the shadow of the Sun; the Iewes observed not this motion. The slowest motion of the Moone is in , nearest the earth, then she runneth but ten degrees in one day, and shee remaineth under the Sunne more than two dayes: This course of the Moone the Iewes observed not. The Iewes observed the first apparition f the Moone in her middle motion.The third motion of the Moone is a middle motion, and in one day she runneth thirteene degrees, and then remaineth under the shadow of the Sunne two dayes, and the Iewes observed her first apparition in this course for their New Moones; the Moone keepeth alwayes a constant course, but yet when she is farthest from the earth the seemeth to us to runne more swiftly, therefore they could not make their observation, of the change of the Moone from that course; neither when she is neerest to us: for then she seemeth to make too slow a course, therefore they observed this course, when she was in her middle motion, neither too slow nor too swift. Of their feast of Trum∣pets.In the first day of the seventh moneth they had the feast of blowing of Trumpets, the Iewes commonly hold, that this feast was kept in remembrance of Isaacs deliverie, when the Lambe was killed for him, but Psal. 81. vers. 5. David biddeth them blow up the Trumpet, because it was a statute in Israel, and a law of the God of Ia∣cob, this he ordained in Ioseph for a Testimony, when he went out through the Land of Egypt.
A figure to shew at what time the Iewes began their New Moones.
EXERCITAT. XXIII. Of the day of Expiation. A ceremoniall appendix of Command. 4. Levit. 23.24. On the tenth day of the seventh moneth there shall be a day of Atonement, &c. THis day of Atonement is called Dies cippurim, the day of expiation. Picavit, pice obduxit.  Aliquem in∣iustum pronuntiare. Caphar properly is to cover a thing with pitch or plaster, Gen. 6.14. Christ must cover our sinnes so that they appeare no more, contra∣ry to this is Hirshiangh, to condemne a man or to make him wicked, that is, to pronounce him to bee wic∣ked. Foure things comman∣ded to be done in the day of expiation.There were foure memorable things commanded on this day of expiation, first, that they should fast; Se∣condly, that they should abstaine from al sorts of work; and all sorts of delights; Thirdly, that they should af∣flict their soules; Fourthly, that they should proclaime the Iubile this day. The day of expiation called a fast by way of appropriation.First, they were commanded to fast this day; they had many fasts, as the fast of the fourth moneth, and the fast of the fift, and the fast of the seventh Moneth, and the the fast of the tenth moneth, Zach. 8.19. But this was cal∣led the great fast, as Act. 8.9. Sailing was dangerous be∣cause the fast was now past, this fast was the day of ex∣piation. No workes to be done upon the day of expia∣tion.Secondly, they were commanded to abstaine from all workes this day. In other feast dayes they were com∣manded to abstaine frō servile works, as plowing, sow∣ing, reaping, but this day was to be kept as Holy as the
Sabbath it selfe, they might kindle no fire this day nor dresse meat, they were to abstaine from all delights and pleasures this day, as first, from washing of themselves, secondly from anointing of themselves, thirdly, from putting on of their shooes and fine apparell. First, from anointing,They abstained from pleasures that day. in the day of affliction they did not anoynt themselves. Dan. 20.3.12. So they laid aside their ornaments. Exod. 33.4▪ 6. So they went bare∣footed. 1 Sam. 15.30. So wearing Sackloth. Psal. 35.13. Not washing themselves. 2 Sam. 12.20.21.They afflicted their soules on the day of ex∣piation. Not to lye with their wives. 2. Sam. 11.11. Thirdly, This day they afflicted their soules or humbled their soules, for the outward humiliation had beene nothing with out the inward. Esay. 58 5. Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soule. Outward ab∣stinence without humiliation of the soule is nothing ac∣ceptable to God. Fourthly, this day they proclamed the Iubile,Why the Iubile was proclaimed on the day of expiation. they were humbled in their soules this day in afflicting them∣selves, and then he biddeth them proclaime the Iubile; to teach us, that the Lord giveth grace to the humble; and secondly, that the Lord mixeth griefe and joy toge∣ther to his children in this life, they are sweet-sowre joyes, and all the promises have Annexionem Crucis, a condition of some crosse adjoyned to them. Marc. 10.30. He shall receive an hundreth fold in this life, &c. With persecutions. This day was instituted for to purge all the defects and wants which had beene in their Sacrifices all the yeere long, and when this day was not able to purge them from their sinnes, this taught them that they must ex∣pect another Sacrifice to purge sinne, for Non datur pro∣cessus in infinitum, but there must be one perfect Sacri∣fice to purge all our sinnes, wherein we should rest. They had many reasons to shew them the weake∣nesse
of this Leviticall Law,The weakenesse of the Ceremonies shewed by the Priests and sacrifi∣ces. both in the Sacrifices, and in the Priest; in the Sacrifices, Num. 19.8.9. When the Heifer was burnt, they put the ashes in water to purge these who were put out of the Campe for uncleannesse; therefore it was called the water of separation: those ashes purged them that were separated, yet they defi∣led them that burnt them, and gathered them, Vers. 10. Therefore this Sacrifice could not purge him. So the weakenesse of these ceremonies was also shew∣ed in the Priests themselves, that the Priest being a sin∣ner, could not make atonement for himselfe; when the Priest eat the meate offering of the people, he made atonement for them; but he might not eate his owne meat offering. Levit. 10.17. This sheweth the Imper∣fection of the ceremonies, in eating the sinne offering of the people, but not his owne sinne offering. This was also shewed to them by this; If the high Priest had beene defiled by any thing, there was a second high Priest appointed to supply his wants, 1 King. 2. which shewed the Imperfection of his Priesthood. Lastly, this Highpriest entered but once in the yeere, into the Holi∣est of all, and he alone, therefore this Priesthood could bring nothing to perfection. Heb. 10.5. Sacrifices and Mincha, thou wouldst not have, but a body thou hast prepared for me; in the oblation of Christs Body, the legall services were abolished, and the meatoffering ceased when CHRIST came. Dan. 9.2. Three sorts of purifica∣tion.The Iewes had diverse sorts of purifications. First they had  which was a purifying by water Ioh. 11.55. , they went up to Ierusalem, to purifie themselves, and this the Latines called Lustra∣tio. The Greeke called the same , which was a purifying by fire, for  is the heat of the sunne, this they borrowed from that Idolatrous custome which the
Priests of Moloch used, transitus per ignem. when as they had Magnabhir Baish Transitum per ignem, when they did initiate their young children by making them passe through two fires. Their second purification was ,Purifying with water for what? a washing with water, whereas the former was but a sprinkling with water; Ioh. 3.25. There was a question betwixt some of Iohns Disciples and the Iewes , about puri∣fying, and it was for this purification that those water pots of stone were set. Ioh. 2.6. for when they came home from their markets, or had touched a gentile or any uncleane thing, they washed their cloathes, their hands and their feete, in those pots of water. Their third sort of purification was  Piaculum,The manner of the hea∣then expiating sinne. or victima piacularis, when as they offered a sacrifice of any beast after they were thus purified, and this was called , which the Gentiles abused, as the Carthagi∣nians, when they tooke a man, and laid all the sinnes of the people upon him, they offered him in a sacrifice, and burnt him in the fire to be , or an expiation for the whole people of that Country or City. When Iohn the Baptist,Iohn changed all these washinge. the forerunner of CHRIST came to abolish the ceremonies of the Iewes, and to make way for the Gospell both to the Iewes and Gen∣tiles, he changed  this sprinkling of wa¦ter into repentance, and he changed  the wa∣shing with water  in baptizing with the holy Ghost and with fire; & he changed  that sacri∣fice for sinne, into that Vniversall , the sacrifice of Iesus Christ, when he said, Behold the Lamb of God, , that taketh away the sinnes of the World.
EXERCITAT. XXIII. Of the seventh yeares rest, and the Jubile. A ceremoniall appendix of Command. 4. Levit. 25.4. But in the seventh yeere shall be a Sabbath of rest unto the Land, &c. vers. 8. and thou shalt number seven Sabbaths of yeeres, &c. GOD commanded his people to rest the seventh day from their labours; then he commanded them to keepe many feasts in the seventh moneth; upon the first day of the seventh moneth they were to keepe the feast of Trumpets called Rosh Hashanah, primus dies anni. the first day of the new yeere; upon the tenth day of this moneth they were to keepe the feast of expiation; upon the fifteenth day of this moneth, the feast of Tabernacles, which continued for seven dayes, and in the seventh day of the feast of Tabernacles, they kept festum salicis, and caried branches, as they used in the Pascha to carry palmes, which was a signe of victory; then they carried branches before CHRIST and cryed Hosanna filio Da∣vid.The feast of collections added to the feast of Tabernacles and Passe∣over. In the last day of the feast of Tabernacles, was the feast of collection added both to the Pascha, and to the feast of the Tabernacles, and Ioh. 2.37. it is called the last and the great day of the feast. Besides these legall feasts in this moneth, they had likewise on the fourth day, the fast of Godaliah, and up∣on the twenty third day was festum latitiae legis, et bene∣dictio. They had but one feast in the Moneth Nisan, and one in Iair, the Pentecost.
So the Lord commanded that the Land should rest in the seventh yeere, and every seventh seventh in the Iu∣bile, The lan was laboured six yeeres, and these yeeres were called Anni georgici. The land was to rest the seventh yeere, this was cal∣led annus shemittah from Shamat, liberum demittere, and not to seeke any due of it; for those who laboured the ground to seek fruit of it every yeere was too much, and gave no time of rest to the ground. The Lord taught the Iewes sundry things by the re∣sting of the Land;What things the Iewes were taught by the rest of the seventh yeere. for as the Sabbath day taught them that as they were the Lords they behoved to cease from their owne workes, to doe his worke: So the Sab∣bath of the seventh yeere taught them, that both they and their land was the Lords, and therefore it was to rest. Secondly, this yeere taught them to depend upon the Lords providence, for the Lord promised his blessing upon the sixt yeere, that the Land should bring out for three yeeres, Levi. 25.20. Thirdly, this yeere was a signe to them of their eter∣nall rest. Lastly, he instituted this yeere, to teach them to be pitifull to the poore; for those things which grew of their owne accord that yeere, were alloted to the poore and to the strangers. How could they live, seeing the land rested the se∣venth yeare? The Lord answered, Levit. 25.21.How God blessed the sixt yeere, that it served for three yeeres. Thar he should so blesse the sixt yeere, that it should serve for three yeares, and here we may see how the promises were fulfilled, which were made, Levit. 26, 10. Ye shall bring out the old, because of the new, that is, there shall be such plen∣ty of new, that yee must bring forth the old to make roome for it, and that is that which Amos speaketh,
cap. 9.13.Haebraice  a specie in speciem et chaldaice  ab anno in annum, Arator apprehendet messorem, the plowman shall ever take the reaper, that is, the old and the new shall meete together. So Psal. 144.13. That our garners may be full affording all manner of store, but the Chaldee Pa∣raphrast paraphraseth it, Affording corne from one yeere to another. The fertility of the se∣venth yeare, was not meerely naturall.Here we may observe that this fertility of the seventh yeare was not merely naturall, but proceeded from the blessing of God. Secondly▪ all those who rested the se∣venth yere from their labours, yet they wanted nothing but it was supplied by the blessing of God. Mal. 3.10 Effundam vobis vsque ad non sufficientiam, that is, that yee shall not have vessells to containe the oyle, and the wine, nor garners to containe the corne, which I shall bestow upon you. Never man suffered any losse in Gods service.So those who abstaine from their labours upon the Sabbath, it shall never impoverish them; for the bles∣sing of God upon the weeke dayes shall supply all their wants; so the Lord promised, when they shall goe up to Ierusalem to serve him at their feasts, that he would keepe their land from the incursion of the enemies, Exo. 34.24. and we see, Iosh. 5.2. When they were circum∣cised, the Lord strooke such a feare and terror in the hearts of the Canaanites, that they durst not touch them, as Simeon, & Levi killed the Sichemites when they were newly circumcised; never man yet got hurt in the ser∣vice of God: He shall still find the Lords protecting Hand and blessing in his service. When hee sent out the seventy Disciples without purse, scrip, and shooes, he said, Lacked ye any thing? and they said, Nothing. Luc. 22.35. Nebuchadnezzer shall not want a reward for his service which he did to the Lord, albeit he was an heathen, for hee got the Land of Egypt for his wages. Ezek. 29.20.
The next priviledge of the Sabbaticke yeare was this, Deut. 14.1.Debts were payed in the seventh yeare. that mens debts were pardoned to them, if they became poore and had nothing to satisfie, but not if they had sufficient to pay, then they were bound to satisfie; and if they were poore, the Lord commanded to lend unto them, Deut. 15.19. although the seventh yeare was at hand; but that which was bor∣rowed for necessitie onely, was not to be restored; and the naturall Iewes had onely this priviledge, but not the Proselytes. The third priviledge of this yeare was this,Servants were set a li∣berty this yeare. Exod. 21.2. He shall goe out free in the seventh yeere, paying no∣thing, to wit, if he was an Hebrew servant; but if hee was not an Hebrew servant, but a stranger, then he was to serve untill the yeare of the Iubile, Levit. 25.4. The fourth thing which was done in the seventh yeare,The Law was publike∣ly read this yeare. the Law was publikely read, Deut. 31.10. Whether or not, kept they alwayes these sabbaticall yeares? Not, Ier. 34.14, therefore the Lord plagued them with divers plagues, and especially with barrennesse of the sixt yeare, 2 Mach. 6.43.49. When began this yeare of the rest? Some hold that it began after the land was divided by Lot;At what yeare the first Rest began. but seeing the Land was twise divided by Lot, first in Gilgal, Ioh. 14. Secondly, in Siloh a few yeares after, because the first division was not perfe∣cted, this account of the seventh yeare seemeth to be∣gin at the latter division of the Land, Ios. 18 2. What time of the yeare began this rest of the seventh yeare? From Tishri, and not from Nisan; At what time of the were this Rest began. for if it had begun in Nisan, then they should have lost two Harvests, first, they might not cut downe the Corne which was grow∣ing upon the ground in Nisan; and then secondly, they
might not sow in Tishri, and so they should have lost both the Harvests, Exod. 23.16. and 34.22. but the Lord saith, Levit. 25.27. Yee shall sow the eighth yeare, therefore they wanted but one sowing, and one Harvest. Of the Jubile. Produxit, eduxit.Their great Sabbaticall yeare was the yeare of the Iubile: It was called the Iubile from Iobhel or hobhel, deduxit or produxit; because it brought men backe a∣gaine to their first estate; the Seventy translate it , because they were brought backe to their first estate, and Philo Iudaeus calleth it, , restitutio, and Iosephus , libertatem, and from the word Iubile, the Latines made their word Iubilo, to take up a merry song. So it might be called buccina reductionis. They blew with Rammes hornes at this feast, dekeran dikraia, as the Chaldee paraphrast paraphraseth it. And they blew with these Rammes hornes in remembrance of their deliverance out of Egypt. Masius holdeth, that they were Neat hornes; they blew with Rammes hornes in the forty ninth yeare, and in the fiftieth yeare, the yeare of the Iubile, with Oxens hornes; but when they gathered the people to the Congregation,Elevare cornu prophe∣tiae quid. they blew with silver Trumpets; this blowing of Trumpets signified, that Ministers should lift up their voyce like a Trumpet, Esay 58.1. and proclaime salvation to the people. The Prophets were said to lift up the horne, 1 Chro. 25.5. because the Prophets were to lift up their voyce, and to blow, as if it were with a horne.The Priests proclaimed the Iubile with Rammes hornes. None might blow with those hornes but onely the Priests, for the hornes were ap∣pointed for a holy use, and no man might blow those
hornes, but he who was consecrated for a holy use, as the Priest was, for the Priest went out to battell and blew the Trumpet, it was he that blew, the trumpet to convocate the people; it was he that blew, when the wals of Iericho fell downe; it was he that proclaimed the yeare of Remission; and it was he that proclaimed the yeare of the Iubile. When they proclaimed this Iubile upon the forty ninth yeare, they proclaimed it upon the day of expiati∣on; the day of expiation was dies luctus to them, a day of mourning; and yet the intimation of great joy of the yeare of the Iubile was proclaimed that day, to teach thē in the midst of their griefe to remember joy. Although the Iubile was proclaimed the fortie ninth yere, yet the forty ninth yeare of the rest and Iubile,The forty ninth yere of the Rest, and the ubile could not ever fall toge∣ther. fell not alwayes together; for if the Iubile, and the yeere of the rest had fallen alwayes in one yeare (as some would reckon, beginning the Iubile in Nisan, and the yeare of the rest in Tishri) then there should be wanting either a halfe yeare, or a whole yeare to the yeare of the rest; the Iubile hath fifty, and the seven rests forty nine, it wanting halfe a yeare in the first Iubile, in the second Iubile there should be a whole yeare of the rest wanting. And so the whole order of their reckoning should be perverted; the Text saith expresly, that the fiftieth yeare shall be the Iubile, and not the forty ninth yeare; neither is it enough to say that the Iubile is the fiftieth yeare, because the former Iubile is reckoned for one of the fifty, because this wayes, one Iubile should be twise numbred, being the last of the one Iubile, and the beginning of the next Iubile; and as no man will say, that the Iewes were to rest from their labours after the seventh day, but upon the seventh day; so no man can say, that the land was to rest after the seventh yeare, but upon the seventh; and as the seventh day of
the weeke is to be reckoned, excluding the former Sab∣bath (for when the former Sabbath is included, then it is called eight dayes) so the seventh yeare is to be rec∣koned excluding the former seventh; and the fiftieth yeare, secluding the former Iubile. The yeare of the Rest and the Iubile fall toge∣ther every seventh Iu∣bile.Then to make up the right reckoning, is to give to the yeare of the rest fortynine yeares, and to the Iubile fifty, and so they shall fall together at every seventh Iubile, in threehundreth and fifty yeares. Seven times forty nine, maketh but three hundreth and forty three yeares. Three sorts of recko∣ning amongst the Iewes. The three yeeres are not three full yeares.When the land is said to rest for three yeares, it is not meant here of three compleat yeares; the Hebrewes have three sorts of reckonings, the first reckoning is, ex∣cluso utroque termino; their second reckoning was inclu∣so utroque termino; their third sort of reckoning was, excluso uno termino & incluso altero. Example of the first, when they are both excluded, Matthew saith, cap. 17.1. sixe dayes after, the other Evangelists say, eight dayes af∣ter, Marc. 9.2. Luc. 9.4. including both the termes. And thus the Evangelists are reconciled. The 3 sort of reckning is, including one of the termes, and excluding the other; as they were to Circumcise their children the eight day, if the child had lived seven dayes, and a part of the eight, he was to be circumcised, as if he had lived compleat eight dayes; therefore the Iewes say, that dies legis non est à tempore ad tempus, that is, it is not to be understood, de completo tempore, of the full time; so the three yeares wherein the Lord promised to blesse their land, are not to be reckoned for three whole yeares, but excluso utroque termino, two halfe yeares and a whole yeare, Deut. 5.1. At the end of every seventh yeare thou shalt make a release, mikketz should not bee translated, a fine, מ pro ב A fine, but in fine, Deut. 31.30. putting beth for mem.
The land rested three yeares,How the land rested three yeares together. but not three com∣pleat yeares, but one whole yeare and two halfe yeares, excluso utroque termino; they did sow their Corne in Shebhat, answering to our Ianuary; and they reaped their Barley in Nisan, answering to our March; and they reaped their Wheat at the Pentecost, the yeare before the Iubile; when the rest and the Iubile fell to∣gether, they reaped their Corne in Nisan, which ser∣ved them till Tishri;Annus cempletus. currens. and this halfe yeare was called the first yeare of the three yeares rest; then the yeare of the Iubile began in Tishri, which was a compleat or a full yeare, and this was the second yeare of the Rest; and af∣ter the Iubile, the Cornes were sowen in Shebhat againe, and reaped in Nisan, and this halfe yeare was counted the third yeare; and this was annus currens, but not completus. In the fiftieth Iubile from the Creation of the world, the seventh Sabbath of the Land and the first Iubile began both in one yeare. After Ioshua had fought against the Canaanites for sixe yeares, the Lord commanded the land to rest the seventh yeare, reckoning the seventh yeare and Iubile from Tishri. How the Iubile and the seventh yeare of the rest, fell both together, see this Figure following.
A figure to shew when the seventh yeare of the Rest and the Jubile fell both in one yeare. Also there were no Iubilees reckoned untill Ioshua had conquered the land, yet if ye will reckon from the Creation of the world, till the dayes of Ioshua, 3500 yeares, which will make up just fifty Iubilies, we may
reckon this way, per tempus prolepticum, which is nei∣ther postulatitium nor historicum; tempus postulatitium they call this, when the Kings of Egypt deduced their genealogies thirteene thousand yeares, before the Crea∣tion this is a false reckoning; but tempus prolepticum, is this, when they reckoned seven hundred yeeres before the Creation, to make the Sunne, the Moone, and the yeare of the Indiction to fall in one yeare; and so doth Scaliger reckon; and thus wee may reckon the Iubilees ascending up to the Creation,Tempus postulatitium prolepticum historicum. not per tempus historicum, nor tempus postulatitium, but per tempus pro∣lepticum; but when we reckon from Ioshua's dayes des∣cending to the time of Christs death, this is per tempus historicum, the Scripture sheweth us just twenty nine Iubilees from Ioshua to Christ, then was the acceptable time, and the day of great deliverance, Luc. 4.18. and then all the Iubilees ceased. The difference betwixt the seventh yeere of release,The difference betwixt the priviledges of the se∣venth yeare and the Iu∣bile. and the yeare of the Iubile was this, in the seventh yeere the Hebrew servant was released, and if he had maried a stranger, his wife and his children were not released; but in the yeare of the Iubile they were released. Se∣condly, the morgaged lands in the seventh yeare were restored, to the last Morgager; but in the yeare of the Iubile the Land was restored to the proper inheri∣tor. The Lord appointed these Iubiles, First,Why the Iubile was ap∣pointed. that the poore might not be excluded from their inheritance; Secondly, he instituted them that they might keepe a right chronology and reckoning of times; for as the Greekes did reckon by their Olympiades, and the La∣tines by their Lustra; So did the Hebrewes by their Iubiles. Thirdly, he instituted these Iubiles, that they might be a type to them of their full deliverance by Christ. Esay. 61.2. Luc. 4.10.
The extent of the remis∣sion under the Gospell, above the remission under the Gospell, above the remission un∣der the Law.The Remission of the Iubile exceeded the remission of the seventh yeare seven times, and Christ extended the remission under the Gospell as farre above the Iu∣bile, as the Iubile is above the seventh yeare to seventy times seaven times: Peter would have restrained this remission to seven onely, Mat. 18.21. but Christ ex∣tendeth it farre above seven times or seventy times, but he saith that wee should forgive our brother seventy times seven. The conclusion of this is; the seventh day they rested from their labours, in the seventh moneth the most of their feasts fell; and in the seventh yeare their Land rested, and in the seventh seventh their Iubile fell, then all their debts were payed, then they were resto∣red to their inheritance, but when our eternall Sabbath shall come, Esay. 66.22. then we shall rest from our labours and our sinnes, and the punishment of them; then the earth shall rest from the burdens under which it groneth now, Rom. 8.22. and the sunne, qui jam anhe∣lat ad locum suum, anhelavit. Eccles. 1.5. Who now is weary in run∣ning of his course, shall rest, and there shall be no more need of his light, Revel. 22.5. Then all our debts shall be fully pardoned, and we shall be fully restored to our inheritance which we have morgaged: when the Priests went about the fortyninth yeare, and proclai∣med that the fiftieth yeare was at hand, were not these glad newes to the poore, and to those who were in debt; so when the Ministers of the Gospell, Lift up their voyce like a Trumpet, Esay. 58.2. and proclaime to us, that the yeare of the Iubile is at hand; should not poore and miserable sinners rejoyce, and lift up their heads because their redemption draweth neere, Luc. 21.28.
Commandement V. EXERCITAT. XXIIII. Of the maintenance of the Priests under the Law. A ceremoniall appendix of Command. 5. Num. 18.21. And behold I have given the children of Levi, all the tenth in Israel, &c. LEt us consider here, first, who payes tithes. Secondly, to whom they were payed. Thirdly, for what end they were payed. Fourthly, what things the Priests and the Le∣vites had beside: the tithes, and last∣ly, the blessing upon those who payed their tithes. First, the people payed their tithes to the Levites, because the Levites Adhaerebant Sacerdotibus, they were joyned to the Priests, Num. 18.2. And thy brethren also of the Tribe of Levi, of the tribe of thy father, bring them with the [Vaijlavu] ut adherescant tibi, that they may bee joyned unto thee; the children of Levi called Levites, filius adhaesienis sic dictus a matre quia putabat maritum sibi adhaesurum a  ad∣hesit & hic, aliudit do∣minus, cum dicit  ut adorestant. were adjuncts to the Priests, and therefore the people payed the tithe to them. The second thing to be considered here, is to whom they payed tithe, the people payed their tithe to the Levites. How did the Pharises pay tithe, seeing they were
Church-men, decimas do vel decimas accipio. Answ. the Pharisie said I tithe, that is, I pay tithe. Luc. 18.12. docentes.  separati.All the Pharises were not teaching Pharisees, they were not all [Porashim] Docentes, but some were [Pa∣rushim] vel , separati; and of these some ma∣nured the ground, and were Laike Pharises, as wee may call them; and those payed tithe as well as o∣thers. Then the Levites payed their tithes to the Priests. Sometimes the Priests are called Levites in the Scrip∣ture,Priest, sometimes called Levites. as Ezek. 44.15. The Priests, the Levites, the sonnes of Zadok; therefore although when the people are commanded to pay their tithes, the Levites are onely mentioned, yet the Priests are comprehended under the name of Levites, because the tithes belonged to the Priesthood onely; when the Priests and the Levites are taken Composite, then the tithes belong to them both iointly; but when they are taken opposite, then the people must pay their tithe to the Levites, and the Le∣vites must pay their tithe to the Priest, Heb. 7.5. The sonnes of Levi who receives the office of Priesthood, have Commandement to take tithes of the people. Why the Lord would have the Levites pay tithes.The Levites payed to the Priest the tithe of the tithes, although they had no inheritance in the land, yet the Lord would have them to honor him with a heave of∣fering, and it was reckoned to them as if they had posses∣sions and Lands; and besides this, they payed tithes of the ground of the suburbe, and fields which were given them; therefore, Num. 18.28.29, Thus you also shall offer an heave offering unto the Lord of all your tythes which yee receive of the children of Israel, and ye shall give thereof the Lords heave offring to Aaron the Priest out of all your gifts yee shall offer, &c. Thirdly, to what end they were payed; the tithes were given as a signe of homage, and thankfullnesse to
God, Prov. 3.9. Honour the Lord with th y substan,Why the tithes were payed. and with the first fruits of all thine increase; and as Kings have their tributes payed unto them for the mainte∣nance of their attendance, Rom. 13.6.7. So the Lord will have his tribute payed to him, for the mainte∣nance of his servants the Priests; therefore the tithe is called his heave offering, Levit. 27.30. and before the Law was given, Iacob payed them to the Lord, Gen. 28.22.Araham and Iacob pay∣ed tithes before the law. and Abraham the tenth generation from Sem payed them to Melchizedecke the Priest, and the Lord ap∣pointed them for the Priests, Num. 18.28. Now that we may understand what great plenty and a boundance, the Levites had, who had the Lord for their portion. Num. 18.20. Deut. 18.2. Ezek. 44.28.The great plenty which the Levite, had for their service. Let us consider what they had in particular. First, they had a part of the meatoffering called Mincha. Secondly, they had a part of the peace offe∣ring, the breast, and the shoulder and skin of the burnt offering, Num. 18.18. Levit. 7.13. Thirdly, they had the first fruits of the Corne, of the wine, and of the oyle, [Reshith] prestantissimum, primitie primitium  primitiae. the best of them and the fat of the oyle, Num. 18.12. Deut. 18.4. and they had [Biccurim] the first fruits. The difference Betwixt [Biccurim] and [Reshith] was this; Reshith were the first fruits which the Levites tooke from the people; but Biccurim were the first fruits which the people presen∣ted to the Lord, and the Lord gave them to the Priests, Num. 18.13. What so ever is first ripe in the Land shall bee thine; Reshith was the first of the first fruits, and Biccurim were the first fruits themselves. It was not determined by the Law how much they should offer here,What every one was to offer of their first ruits. but the Doctors of the Iewes deter∣mined afterwards, that none should offer lesse than one of sixty, and none should offer more than one of forty, and the middle sort one of fifty, and they called
him who offered one of sixty; Oculus malus.  Oculus bonus.  Oculus inter utrumque. the man with the evill eye, or the covetous eye, or the covetous man, Prov. 23.6. eat not the bread of him who hath an evill eye, that is, of a covetous man; and he who payed one of forty, they called him the man with the good eye, Ecclus. 35.8. Give the Lord his honor with a good eye, and diminish not the first fruits of thine hand, and he who payed one of fifty, they called him, the man with the middle eye. Oblto magna.This was called [Tereumah Gedolah] the great heave offering by way of excellency, and they payed this, not onely of things commanded in the Law, but also of their oates, Lentiles, and fitches: although these served not for the sustentation of man; but onely in time of fa∣mine mine to satisfie their hunger; yet they payed them, and they payed also tithe of Anise and Mint, which did grow in their gardens, which our Lord doth not blame, Matth. 23. for he addeth, these things yee should have done: all these, because they were not determinated by the law, they gave at least to the Priests the sixty part, so they gave the sixty part of their wool in their Tereu∣mah Gedolah to the Priest. The Priests and Levites had the feeill offe∣rings and the estimation of male and female and according to their abi∣litie and sexe.Besides these first fruits which they were bound to pay, they payed likewise free will offerings, Levit. 7.16. So when they made a singular vow, they were valued according to their age, and according to their sexe, Levit. 27.3.4. The estimation of the male from twenty yeare old, even unto sixty, was fifty Shekels of Silver, after the Shekell of the sanctuary; and the esti∣mation of the female was thirty. Againe, from five yeare old to twenty, the estimation of the male was twenty Shekels, and of the female ten. Thirdly, from a moneth old to five yeares old, the estimation of the male was five; and the female was three Shekels of sil∣ver. Fourthly, if they were past sixty yeares and
above, the estimation of the male was fifteene shekels: and of the female, ten shekels. Fiftly, the poorer were valued after the valuation of the Priests, ac∣cording to their ability, and all these came for the maintenance of the Priests. So they had a part of things consecrated, Levit. 7.35. Num. 18.13. The Levites had the tenth part of all the fruits which did grow in Israel; then the Priests got Decimas Deci∣maum the tithe of the tithes from the Levites: the husband man payed to the Levites the tenth of his whole encrease, Decima prima.  Decima ex Decima. and this was called [Magnasar rishon] the first tithe; and the Levites payed out of this, the tenth to the Priests, which was the hundreth part of the husband mans increase [Magnasar min Hamagnasar] decima ex decima. The third tithe was given to the poore, and it was the ninth part of the whole increase. Tobit. 1.7.8. It was called [Magnasar shani] the second tithe, Decima secunda, vel secundi anni.  Decima tertia, vel ter∣tij anni. and in the first and second yeare, this tithe was reserved by the hus∣band man, and either taken up to Ierusalem, or else sold and put in mony, that the Levite, the widdow and the poore might eat of it there at the three great feasts, and it differed nothing from the tithe of the third yeare, but onely in the use, as Maimony sheweth, and every third yeare it was given to the poore, but every first and se∣cond yeare it was given to the Priest, and to the Levite, and to the widdow, and they did eate it before the Lord in Ierusalem, by this we may perceive how the husband-man payed the ninth part of his whole increase every yeare: Let us put this case,The husbandman paid the most part of his in∣crease. a husband-man hath an hundreth and two logs of oyle, of this he was to pay two to the Lord, which was his Tereumah Gedolah, and this was one of fifty; and then ten to the Levites, and nine of the hundreth, to the poore for the second tithe, so that of an hundreth and two logs, he payed twenty
and one, which was the fift part of the hundreth, and some more. They had the first borne of man and beast.Moreover, they had the first borne of all sorts of cat∣tell, as of sheepe, beeves, and goats; and the price of the rest which were to be redeemed according to the Priests estimation. Likewise the first borne of man re∣deemed at five shekels the man, Ezek. 44.30. Neh. 10.36. And when all the males appeared before the Lord three times in the yeare; none of them must come empty handed; all these the Priests got. And besides all this, the Levites had forty eight cities, and two thousand cubites of ground round about them on every side,They had 48 cities and so much ground about them. with their Cattell and flockes; the num∣ber of the Levites were but twenty three thousand, Num. 26. The tribe of Asher was fifty three thousand, and two hundreth; and the tribe of Nephthali was forty five thousand and foure hundreth; and the tribe of Issa∣char, was sixty foure thousand and three hundreth, and the tribe of Dan, was sixty foure thousand and foure hundreth, and yet the greatest of them all, had but nin∣teene Cities; but the Levites being but few in number, got moe Cities than any of them all; and the reason was,The Levites were not the tenth part of the people yet they had the tenth part of the in¦rease. because the Lord would provide liberally for them; the Levites who were not the tenth part of the people, yet they got the tenth part of the increase of the Land, and Priests who were but a small number in re∣spect of the Levites, yet they got the hundreth part of the increase of the Land, and because the Priests had such a plentifull portion, therefore the Lord alludeth to this,  Iere. 13.14. I will satiate the soule of the Priest with fatnesse. The Lord was their portion, Num. 18.20. Deut, 18.1. Ezek. 44.28. and the godly allude to this,  Psal. 73.26. God is my part for ever,  So Psal. 142.6. Thou art my part in the Land of the Living, Lam. 3.24. The Lord is my part,
saith my soule, therfore I will hope in him. Psal. 16,The Hebrewes repeate words to signifie that nothing should be omit∣ted.  Et praecipuum omnium primitiarum ex omnibus, et omnis oblationis om∣nium ex omnibus oblati∣onibus vestris Sacerdo∣esto. Ʋox  hic quin∣quies repetitur. The blessing of God up∣on those who payed their tithes. the Lord is the portion of mine inheritance. And see what a care the Lord had that they should want none of these. Ezek. 44.30. And the first of all the first fruits of all things, and every oblation of all of every sort, shall be the Priests; the Hebrewes when they would have a thing precisely kept, they double this word [Col] as Psal. 119.128. Therefore I esteeme all thy pre∣cepts, concerning all things to be right, So here the first of all the first fruits of all things, &c. The last thing to be considered here, is the blessing of God upon those who payed their tithes, they were to pay to the Priests the first fruits, and tithes of all their increase of every sort. And the first of their dough That he might cause the blessing rest in their house, Ezek. 44. So Mal. 3.10. Bring ye all the tithes into the store∣house, that there may be meate in mine house, and prove me now here with, saith the Lord of hosts, if I will not open you the windowes of heaven, and powre you out a blessing, that there shalt not be roome enough to receive it, Deut, 16.74. Thou shall rejoyce in the feast before the Lord, thou & thy son, and thy daughter, and thy maid servant, and the Levite, and the stranger, and the fatherlesse, and the widdow,The Lord had foure, and the Priest had foure at the eating of the Tithe of the third yeare as the Hebrewes say. that are within thy gates; And the Hebrewes say, the Levite, the fatherlesse, the stranger, and the widow, foure that belong to me, answerable to foure that belong to thee, thy sonne, thy daughter, thy man and thy maide; if thou comfort those that are mine, I will blesse and com∣fort these that are thine, and they say, when a man pay∣eth his tithes, he is the husbandman, and God Almighty is the Priest; but when he payeth them not, then God is the husbandman, and he is the Priest, and then, Ten Akers of Vine shall yeeld but one Bath. Esay, 5.8. The Conclusion of this is, they who have the Lord for their portion can lacke nothing, Psal. 23.1. here was
none of the Priests that did shut the doores of Gods san∣ctuary or kindle fire upon his Altar for nought, Malac. 1.10. EXERCITAT. XXV. The Jewes might not kill the damme sitting upon the young ones. A ceremoniall appendix of Command. 5. Levit. 22.6. If the damme be sitting upon the young, or upon the egges, thou shall not take the damme with the young, &c. That it may be well with thee and that thou maist prolong thy dayes. God made choise of Canaan after a speciall manner.The earth is the Lords, and the fulnesse thereof. Psal. 23.1. Yet the Lord made choise of Canaan in a special man∣ner, and therefore he saith, the Land is mine, Levit. 25.23. Thence it is called Emmanuels Land, Esay. 8 8. and other Lands the Lord calleth polluted Lands, Amos. 7.17. Thou shall dye in a polluted Land. So the people who dwelt in Canaan were the Lords, after a speciall man∣ner, and all that which belonged unto them, therefore he forbiddeth to take usury of his people. The damme fitting on the yong ones was not a type.When the Lord forbiddeth them to kill the damme with the young ones; the damme sitting upon the young ones, was not a type to the Iewes here, no more then the oxe when hee trode out their corne; but there was a tropologicall sense here, to teach them manners; but Canaan it selfe was a type to them. By this Law the Lord taught them mercy to all men, and reverence to their parents.God will have them to shew mercy upon the beasts, and the birds, and he will not have the damme,
and the yong killed together; and Targum Ionathan paraphraseth it thus, as your heavenly Father is mercifull in heaven, so be ye mercifull in earth. The farthest extent and meaning of this Law is, that they should abstaine from cruelty, Hos. 10.14. Gen. 32.11. To kill the Mother, and the Children, for as God hath not regard of Oxen, 1 Cor. 8.9. his chiefe regard was not to the Oxe, when he forbiddeth to muzzle his mouth, but that the Minister should have maintenance: so the Lords chiefe regard, is not here that the Damme be spared, but that Parents be reverenced. God taught the Iewes in their infancy sundry wayes. First, he taught them by their apparell,God taught the Iewes many wayes. that they should not weare Linsey wolsey; so that the Priests should weare linnen in the Sanctuary, and wooll out of the Sanctuary, Ezek. 44.17. and so by their meates, putting a distinction betwixt clean and uncleane; and so by their houses, when he commanded the Law to be written upon the posts of their doores, and by the Battlements to be put about their new houses, and so by their husbandry, when he commanded them not to plow with an Oxe and an Asse, and not to sow their fields 'with divers sorts of seede? So by their flocks to offer their first borne of them to him; and here when they were walking in the fields, if a birds nest were before them in the way, either in a tree, or upon the ground, they were commanded to spare the damme; to teach them reverence to their Parents; wheresoever they lookt, they had some in∣struction before them. He forbiddeth them to kill the Damme and the yong ones together;Why God would not have the Iewes to kill the Damme with the yong ones. he commanded them to eate flesh after the flood, but here he would restraine their appetite, that they should not kill both the Damme and the yong ones; and which is more, the Lord for∣biddeth
when they are about to sacrifice, that they kill not the Cow or the Ewe, and their young ones both in one day, Levit. 22.27. So the Iewes say that they might not kill the damme upon the young ones although it were for cleansed of the Leprosie, Lev. 14.4. And if he will not have this done for his owne wor∣ship, farre lesse will he have men do it for their own pri∣vate use, God will have mercy and not sacrifice, Matth. 9.13. he forbiddeth them to kil the Dam, but they might take the young ones; he will not have them like the Pythago∣reans who thought it unlawfull to kill any beast or fowle, neither will he have them like Barbarians who kill all without respect, but he will have them kill the young ones and spare the old, to teach them reve∣rence towards their parents;No creature but man may make use of it. there is no creature, but man may make some use of it, either to make it the ob∣ject of his pity, or else to imitate it, as the Storke, the Crane, and Swallowes, Who know their times, Iere. 8.7. yea the Lord sendeth the sluggard to the pismire to learne, Prov, 6.6. Honour thy father and thy mother, is the greatest Com∣mandement in the second table, and it hath this pro∣mise annexed unto it, that they who honour their pa∣rents shall live a long life; and here the Lord joyneth it to the meanest of all the Commandements which the Iewes call Praeceptum leve, the Lord set the ceremonies [Sejag Latorah] as a hedge about the Law; and as the hedge is a fence to keepe out beasts; so were these cere∣monies set as a hedge to keepe the Iewes, that they should not breake in to violate the morall. This law to spare the Damme upon the yong ones, binds us not now.If a man should find a bird fitting in this land upon her yong ones, he is not bound by this Law to spare her, more then he is bound, when he reapeth his field to leave the gleanings ungathered; yet he is bound by the Morall Law to shew pity to his beast, and so upon
the foule, neither could he promise to himselfe longer life, if he should doe so: but onely he must looke to the morall precept, which obligeth man still, when these ceremonies are abolished. It may be said, where the reason, or the promise an∣nexed to the Law is perpetuall, there the law is perpe∣tuall, but this promise is perpetuall, long life to the o∣bedient child; therefore it might seeme that this law is perpetuall.How the promise is an∣nexed to this ceremoni∣all precept, and to the morall precept. Simile. The promise is properly annexed to the morall Law, and but accidentally to the ceremoniall Law: a father hath a child whom he mindeth to make his heire, he biddeth his child doe such and such things, which are but trifles, and then he promiseth unto him, the inhe∣ritance, there are more weighty conditions included in this promise; but for the childs nonage, and because as yet he is not capable of the greater conditions, there∣fore his father setteth downe those meaner conditions unto him; the inheritance is promised unto him especi∣ally if he observe the maine conditions; but the meaner are set downe for the present to him: so dealleth the Lord with the Iewes here. The keeping of the whole Commandements hath this promise of long life annexed unto it, Prov. 3.1.2. my sonne forget not my law, but let thine heart keepe my Com∣mandements, for length of dayes, and long life and peace, shall they adde unto thee, so Deut. 8.1. and 30.16. But it is more particulary annexed to this Commandement, and it is called the first Commandement with promise, Ephes. 6.2.
Commandement. VI. EXERCITAT. XXVI. That the Jewes might eat no blood. A ceremoniall appendix of Command. 6. Deut. 12.24. Thou shalt not eate it, thou shalt powre it up∣on the earth as water. The blood is not the forme to the body.THe Lord forbiddeth the Iewes his people to eate blood, because the life is in the blood, the blood is not the forme to the living body, because one body cannot be the forme to another; neither is it a part of the bo∣dy, for it nourisheth the rest of the body, and one part nourisheth not another; and it is more excellent than milke, melancholly, or marrow; for they have their re∣sidence in some particular parts of the body, but the blood is dispersed through the whole body, and none of those are profitable to the body, unlesse they be mix∣ed with blood. Why the life is said to be in the blood.The life is said to be in the blood, because the naturall heat is preserved in the body by blood; the blood it selfe is a thing naturally cold, and it is the heat of the spirits which commeth from the heart that heateth the body, and the blood but keepeth in the heat, as a mans cloathes doe quae non calefaciunt sed recalefaciunt, it but keepeth in the spirits which are in the heart; but when the blood is let out, then the spirits faile, and the blood is congealed.
Although the soule be said to be in the blood,The blood is not the seat of the soule. yet we must not thinke that the blood is the seat of the soule; because the seat of the soule is some principall mem∣ber of the bodie, but the blood is not a member of the body; the seat of the soule is a firme, and a perma∣ment thing, and it hath sense, especially the Touch, but the blood in it selfe hath no sense, wherefore it is not the seat of the soule, but the common instrument, and Vehiculum which carieth the spirits. The life is in the blood,The passions shew themselves in the blood. all the passions of man shew themselves in the blood, as the blood is hote with anger, it flyeth for feare, it groweth slow for griefe, and spreadeth it selfe abroad for joy, and in shame, it mak∣eth the face to blush. The life is in the blood, therefore David saith, Psal. 30.10. What profit is in my blood, that is, in my life, and Virgil calleth it the purpure soule. God taught his people to abstaine from blood for two reasons; First,Why God would have his people abstaine from blood. in reverence of the blood of Christ which was to expiate their sinnes, wherefore the blood was called the atonement of the soule, Levit. chap. 17.11. that is, the soule or the life of the beast, is made the ransome for the soule or life of man, and therefore it should not be eaten; and for this cause they were commanded to cover it in the earth with dust: contra∣ry to this, is that, Iob 16.18.They were to cover the blood. Let not the earth cover my blood, and Ezek. 24.7, 8. Their blood is in the midst of her, she set it upon the top of a Rocke, she powered it not upon the ground to cover it with dust: that it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance, I have set her blood upon the top of a Rocke that it should not be covered But in this respect it is not an appendix of the sixt Commande∣ment, but in another respect; the Lord commanded them to abstaine from blood, and not to eate it, to teach them to abstaine from cruelty, and then it is a
ceremoniall appendix of the sixt Commandement. How the Romans by degrees became cruell.The corruption of man is such, when he beholdeth cruell things then he beginneth to be more cruell; the Romanes used at the first to set wild beasts upon the stage to kill one another; and after this they came to be delighted to see Gladiators, and Fensers kill one a∣nother; and thirdly they delighted to see men cast un∣to the wild beasts, so that from the sight of killing of beasts, they delighted to see men killed; and so from eating of blood, they might have beene drawne to cruelty, and shedding of the blood of men; for those who are but acquainted with the shedding of the blood of Beasts, doe care little for the shedding of the blood of men; Nimrod was a mighty hunter, Gen. 10.9. and then he became a cruell murtherer of men; Pythagoras, that he might teach men to abstaine from blood, taught men alwayes to abstaine from the shed∣ding of the blood of Beasts. It may be said where the reason of the law is perpe∣tuall, the law is perpetuall; ye shall eat no blood, because the life is in the blood: this reason is perpetuall, there∣fore this law may seeme to be perpetuall. What part of this Law is morall.Thus much of the law is perpetuall, that they should not eat membrum de vivo, or while it is palpitans sanguis, that is the morall precept, Ezek. 33.25. Yee eat with the blood, which must be understood, ye eate while the life is in the blood; this is a breach of the morall precept, and it is joyned here by the Prophet with other morall transgressions, Yee lift up your eyes to your Idols, yee shed blood, and yee eate blood. But this is the Ceremoniall part simply to eat blood, the Lord commandeth to give that which dyed of it selfe to the stranger, Deut. 14.21. But if this were a morall precept simply, to abstaine from Blood, then no stranger might eat Blood, or eate that which dyed of it selfe;To eat blood simply was not a morall Law. and the Apostles, Act. 15.20.
renued this precept of abstinence from blood,Why the Apostles renu∣ed this precept. and they give this to be the reason, vers. 21. For Moses of old time had in every citie those that preach him, being read in their Synagogues every Sabbath day, that is, seeing Moses ceremoniall law is yet professed by the Iewes, ye must beare with the weake Iewes untill ye and they be fully united, and this occasion being taken away, the law ceaseth. He commanded the Iewes to abstaine from blood,Why he commanded the Iewes to abstaine from blood. because the Church was in her infancy yet; therefore to command the Iewes still to abstaine from blood, it is even all one, as if one should command that a man should be continually nursed with milke, because he suckt milke when he was a child. Why did not the Apostles forbid them to abstaine from fat, as well as from blood? Seeing to eate the fat was forbidden in Moses Law as well as to eate the blood. This precept of abstinence from blood was given to Noah, and it was one of the seven precepts;Why the Apostle com∣manded abstinence from blood. but absti∣nence from fat, was not commanded untill the ceremo∣niall law was given, Levit. 3.16.17. and because the Iewes esteemed more of this interdiction of eating of blood, therefore the Apostles commanded them absti∣nence from it. Tertulian in his Apology for the Christians showeth that they would not eate blood or strangled,Tertullian in Apolog. c. 9. and that the heathen used to come to them with bottles of blood, and to force them to drinke of it: by this it ap∣peared, that the Christians in his time abstained from blood; but Beatus Renanus commenting upon that place of Tertullian, noteth well, that the Christians were too superstitious in that, Nam citrascandalum Iudaeorum fuit inscitia servare, they were bound onely to abstaine from blood, that they might not offend the Iewes.
But Blandina the Martyer abstained from blood. The reason of this was the danger of future scandall which might follow; for the Christians were charged by the Pagans, that they spilt the blood of Infants, & did drinke it; now if she had not abstained from blood, how could she have contested with the Pagans?How the Pagans char∣ged the Christians with drinking of blood. It is not like∣ly that we drinke the blood of Infants, who abstaine from the blood of beasts; the Councell of Orleance is justly censured for renuing this abstinence from blood, as Iudaizing in this point. The conclusion of this is; the Lord by degrees trai∣ned up his people to be mercifull; as he forbad them to kill the damme sitting upon the young ones; so he would not have the flesh of the beast eaten that killed a man, and hee forbiddeth, to eate that which is torne of beasts, Exod. 22.21. And here he forbiddeth them to eate blood. EXERCITAT. XXVII. That the Jewes might not seethe a Kid in the mothers milke, to teach them not to be cruell. A ceremoniall appendix of Command. 6. Exod. 23.19. Thou shalt not seeth a Kid in the mothers milke. A Philosopher in Egypt asked a Iew upon a time, why the Iewes abstained from Swines flesh, and would eate none of that which was holden to be most wholsome? the Iew answered him by another questi∣on; What was the reason why the Egyptians had so
many Hieroglyphickes, and the Pythagoreans, their e∣nigmaticall speeches? were not those Symbolicall, and taught them some other thing? as ignem gladio ne fodias, Pythagoras meaning was, that they should not provoke an angry man; so the precepts of Moses com∣manding them to abstaine from such and such beasts as uncleane, were Symbolicall, and implied some o∣ther thing. This Commandement forbiddeth not mixtures in Religion,How this precept is an appendix of the sixt Commandement. as an appendix of the second Commande∣ment, but as an appendix of the sixt Commandement, to abstaine from cruelty, as not to take the damme sit∣ting upon the young ones, and not to muzzle the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the Corne. Yee shall not seeth a kid in the mothes milke;The divers interpreta∣tion of this precept. this is not the meaning of the command, content your selves to eate the kid,The true meaning of this precept. but take head that yee eate not the damme also; neither is this the meaning of it, ye shall not eate flesh with milke, as the Chaldee Paraphrast Paraphraseth it; neither is this the meaning of it, take heed that ye seeth not the kid in the mothers milke, as the superstitious Iewes expound it at this day; they will not seeth flesh, and milke in one pot, neither will they cut both flesh and cheese with one knife; and a∣mongst the precepts which they have written of things lawfull to be eaten, they forbid the eating of flesh, and milke together; but the meaning of the place seemeth to be this; ye shall not eate of a kid or of a Lambe, (for so the Seventy translate it) so long as it sucketh the damme, for all this time it is as it were but milke; they might sacrifice it when it was but eight dayes old, but not to eate of it so long as it was sucking. 1 Sam 7.9. Samuel tooke a sucking Lambe and offered. The Lord forbiddeth also, Exod. 22.31. To eate that which was torne by beasts; the former Commandement
that they should not seeth a kid in the mothers milke was a ceremoniall law belonging to the sixt Comman∣dement,Not to eate that which was torne, is a ceremo∣niall appendix both of the sixt and eight Com∣mandement. but this Commandement that they should not eat of that which was torne by beasts was an appendix both of the eight, and sixt Commandement, where∣by he taught them, both to abstaine from blood, and from theft. Whether should those words, Levit. 15.17. Be read copulativè? the soule which eateth that which dyeth of it selfe, and is torne by beasts; or disiunctivè? that which dyeth of it selfe, or is torne of beasts. Some of the Iewes read the words copulativè, thus, if it dye of it selfe, and be torne of beasts, they might not eate of it; but the true reading is disiunctive? if it dye of it selfe, or bee torne, (as Iunius readeth it) for the law saith expressely, that that which is torne is uncleane, although it dye not first; and then be torne; and some of the Iewes make that more uncleane which is torne, then that which dyeth of it selfe; one demanded the question of R, Ioseph Gersaeus,Whether the beast that dyed of it selfe, or that which was torne, was the more uncleane. why hee writ the Law rather upon the skinne of a beast that dyed of it selfe, than upon the skinne of a beast that was torne? he an∣swered them by this comparison, I tell you whereun∣to I liken the beast that dyeth of it selfe, and that which is torne; to two malefactors who are adjudged to dye, the one malefactor the judge himselfe killeth, and the other the hangman killeth; so they hold, that that which dyed of it selfe was not so uncleane, as that which was torne by wild beasts. The conclusion of this is, here we may see the infan∣cy of the Iewish Church, when the Lord forbiddeth them to taste, touch, or handle, and restraineth their baser senses, tasting, touching, and handling, Coloss. 2.21. Even as parents forbid their little children to touch this, or handle that, whereas they forbid them
when they come to understanding, to looke upon evill,God dealeth with the Iewes as fathers doe with little children. or to heare evill. So under the Gospell, the prohibiti∣on is given chiefely to the nobler senses, hearing and seeing, and not so much to the base senses, touching, and tasting.
Commandement VII. EXERCITAT. XXVIII. When a Bastard might enter into the Congregation under the Law. A ceremoniall appendix of Command. 7. Deut. 23.2. A Bastard shall not enter into the Congrega∣tion unto the tenth generation. THe Lord forbiddeth here that a Bastard should enter into the congregation of the Lord, unto the tenth generation, there are foure things to be consi∣dered here? First, who is called [Mamzer] a Bastard here; Secondly, What is meant by entering into the congregation; Thirdly, That this is but a ceremoniall Law;What is meant by Ba∣stard here. and Lastly, That it is not meant of every sort of Bastard. First, he is not called Mamzer here, if his father were an Hebrew, and his mother a Gentile, as the Chal∣dee Paraphrast taketh it, for then Obed the sonne of Ruth the Moabitesse, should have beene a Bastard. Secondly, He is not called Mamzer or Spurius, who is borne of a Widdow (as the Hebrewes hold) as if an Hebrew had maried a captive woman, and had lyen with her and she fel with child, and it was in doubt whether hee was the child of the first husband or of the last. And so they hold that David begot Chili∣ab
upon Abigail, and that his mother called him Daniel, and his father Chiliab, 2 Sam. 2.2. and 1 Chro. 3.1. Be∣cause hee was incerto patre; but this is one of their dreames: neither is he called a Bastard, qui ex secundis nuptijs natus est, as when a man marieth a Widdow, and begeteth a child upon her her. The Iewes are most mistaken in this, Ben Syra in his Proverbes, saith, Oculos tuos absconde a muliere vidua, et ne concupiscas pulchritudi∣nem ejus in corde tuo; nam filij ejus, fiij scortationū sunt, hide thine eyes from a Widdow Woman, and be not taken with her beauty; for her children are the children of for∣nicatiō. And the same Ben Sira at the letter Samech, saith,Ben syra inter proverbia alphabeto. 2. Scriba ducat virginem, et ne ducat eam quae maritū habuit, nam aquae virginis tibi soli erunt, aquā vero eius qua maritū habuit ante te, alius praeter te hausit, that is, let a scribe mary a Virgin, and let him not mary her who hath had an husband before; and content himselfe, with the waters of his owne cisterne, and not to drinke of that water, where another hath drawne before him: where he alludeth to the phrase of the Scripture, which cal∣leth adultery stollen waters, Prov. 9.17,Water put for seed. And they put water for seed, Num. 24.7. So Moab, is his fathers wa∣ter. But the Iewes were much mistaken in this, for the A∣postle saith. 1 Cor. 7.37. If her husband be dead, she is at liberty, to marry whom she will, onely in the Lord, Rom. 1 Tim. 5.14. Let the younger Widdows mary. Therefore Mamzer here, signifieth him, qui ex incerto patre, et certa matre, natus est, whose mother is knowne but not his father. The second thing to bee considered, is this, what is meant, by, entring into the Congregation. To enter into the Congregation,What is meant by en∣tring into the Congre∣gation. is to beare charge a∣mongst the people of God, and this is expressed by go∣ing out and in before the people, Deut. 31.1. I am too old to
goe out and in before this people, so, Act. 1.21. All the time that Iesus went out and in amongst us: this is, to have a charge over the people, and in this sense the Bastard might not enter into the Congregation, that is, hee might have no charge, nor beare rule amongst the peo∣ple of God. To beare charge expres∣sed by dwelling.Sometimes to beare charge amongst the people of God is expressed by dwelling amongst them, as 1 King. 3.8.To dwell among the people, what. Thy servant is in the middest of thy people whom thou hast chosen, that is, he raigneth amongst them, and ruleth them, and so Psal. 101.2. So to dwell amongst the people is to bee esteemed and to bee in account a∣mongst them, Gen. 23.10. Ephron dwelt amongst the chil∣dren of Heth, that is, he was a Ruler and a Prince amongst them, and in this sense the bastard might not dwell a∣mongst the people of God. Sometimes to dwell among the people is to dwell safely among them, so the Shunamitish Woman said to the Prophet when he offered to speake to the King and to the captaines for her I dwell among my people, 1 King. 4.13. that is, I dwell safely among them, and no man doth me harme, and in this sense a bastard might enter into the congregation. To enter into the Con∣gregation, is to enioy all the priviledges of the people of God.Againe, to enter into the Congregation is, to enjoy all the priviledges that the people of God enjoyed, and in this sense, a Bastard might not enter in the Congrega∣gation. Nehemiah findeth fault with the children of Israel, because they married with the Moabites, and he giveth the reason, because the Ammonite and the Moa∣bite, should not come into the Congregation for ever, Nehe. 13.1. So by the like reason, the Bastard might not enter into the Congregation unto the tenth generation, therfore they might not marry with them, Iosh. 23.7. Ye shall not come among the Nations, that is, ye shall not mar∣ry with them: there were many other priviledges
which the Israelites enjoyed, whereof the Bastard was not capable; the Israelite had this priviledge to be set at liberty the seventh yeare. So they might not take Vsury of an Israelite, these priviledges the Bastard had not. When he is secluded from the Congregation,The Bastard was not secluded from the wor∣ship of God. here it is not meant, that he is secluded from the worship of God, but by Congregation here, is meant their civill society and meeting, Act. 19, 39. It shall be determined , in a lawfull congregation, that is, in a civill meeting, they were admitted to the Temple, and to the worship of God. Zach 9.6. A Bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, therefore it may seeme that they might not come to the Temple of God. By Bastard here is meant any vile or wicked man,A Bastard put for any vile person. that is not regenerate by the seed of grace. Vnto the tenth generation, that is, he should never en∣ter, Nehem. 13.1. This Law was ceremoniall, and when the ceremo∣nies were in force, it was not meant of all sorts of Ba∣stards. There are three sorts of impurity set downe in the Scriptures which defile the children;Three sorts of impuri∣ties. the first is pecca∣tum innatum, that is, originall sinne, and all the chil∣dren of men are equally defiled with this, both those who are begotten in marriage, and those who are be∣gotten in adultery: the second sort of impurity which the children doe contract, is legall impurity, and this is peccatum agnatum:Impuritas innata. agnata. imputata. if the woman had vowed her childe to be a perpetuall Nazarite to the Lord, if she had drun∣ken any strong drinke after the child was quicke in her belly, she defiled the child, and he might not be a Naza∣rite: this was but a ceremoniall uncleannesse which hindered him, that he might not enter into the Con∣gregation.
So if there were defects in the Priests birth,Defectus natalium. persona. conjugij. person, and marriage, which hindred him that he might not enter into the Congregation. First, if he had been basely borne, he might not enter into the Congre∣gation. So if there were any defect in his person, or ble∣mish in his body, and the Canon law imitateth that yet, and calleth it Impedimentū Canonicū,Impedimentum canoni∣cum. or irregularity, espe∣cially if he wanted his left eye, that, they call oculum Ca∣nonis. The third was defectus conjugij, Levit. 21.7. he might not marry [Hhalelah] a profane woman, such a one as was repudiat from her husband, or one borne of a whore, or a widdow, Ezekiel, chapt. 44. verses 21, 22. All these were called [Hhalelah] profane. And a Priest that married such a one, might not enter into the Con∣gregation to serve before the Lord;No defects in a mans per∣son, or birth doe hinder him from entring into the Congregation under the Gospel. this was impuri∣tas agnata that hindered the Priest. Vnder the Gospel if a man should lacke an arme, or a leg, he might, notwith∣standing of this, enter into the Congregation; as an Eunuch is admitted to stand before the Lord, Esay 56. And if the defects of a mans person, and of his marri∣age, doe not hinder him, to stand before the Lord, so neither doe the defects of a mans birth; although he be basely born, yet he may enter into the congregation. Imputed uncleannesse of two sorts.The third sort of impurity which defileth a man, is imputed uncleannesse; and it is of two sorts, either be∣fore God, or before the Magistrate. Before God, the Lord may visite the sinnes of the fathers upon the chil∣dren, who are begotten in holy marriage; much more may he visit the sins of the fathers upō the childrē who are begotten in whoredom,The Lord sometimes punisheth the whore∣domes of the parents upon the children. I will not have pitty upon her children, because they are the children of fornications, Hos. 2.4. And so he visited the whoredomes of Iezabel up∣on Ioram, 2 Kings 9.22. But if the children follow not the footsteps of their fathers, then the Lord imputeth not the sinnes of the fathers unto the children; if the
adulterer repent him of his adultery, then God pardo∣neth him for his adultery: So he will not lay the fa∣thers adultery to the childs charge, if he follow not his fathers footsteps. The second sort of imputation is by the Magistrate,How the Magistrate may impute the parents whoredomes to the children. for the restraining of whoredome, Thou shalt not inhe∣rite with us, because thou art the sonne of a strange woman. Iud. 10.2. The equity of this Law is, because they are not knowne to be their fathers children; and if the children of the concubines succeeded not to their fa∣thers inheritance, much lesse should the children of the harlots; So they exclude them from bearing any civill charge. But this defect is taken away, first, by their good education, which washeth away this blot; and then they are reabled by the Law, and made capa∣ble of honors. And this should be no more a blot un∣to them, than if they wanted a hand or a legge; and as we blame not the stollen seede when it is sowen, and groweth up, but these who stole the seede;  so wee should not blame the child begotten out of marriage (if he follow not his fathers footsteps) but onely his father who begot him. The Iewes say in the Talmud,Talmud torah. cap. 1. fol. 10. that the Priest excelleth the Levite; and the Levite ex∣celleth the Israelite; and the Israelite excelleth the Mam∣zer; and the Mamzer excelleth the Nethinim, and the Nethinim the Proselyte; but they say if the Priest be unskilfull in the law, and an Idiot, and the Mamzer be the son or a scholler of the wise; then he excelleth the Priest:Notable men in the Church who have been Bastards. There have been profitable men in the Church who were basely borne, as Lumbard, Gratian, and Come∣ster, who were three bastards borne of one whore, and Darius Nothus among the Persian Kings, and Hercules. When the Lord debarred them to the tenth generati∣on, this is a ceremoniall Law, and not a Morall;This Law is ceremoni∣all, and not morall. David the tent fromh Pharez incestuously begotten, was King
in Israel, and if this were a morall precept, then Gods Iustice should exceede his mercy in the Church, hee showeth mercy to the thousand generation, but his Iustice should extend it selfe for ever. What sort of Bastard is meant here.Lastly, it is not meant here of every bastard, but of him who is borne of a common harlot, Iephthe was basely borne, and yet he had, the charge of the people of God. Foure sorts of sinnesThe Lawyers marke that there are foure sorts of sonnes, first, some naturall, and Legitimate, secondly, some Legitimate, but not naturall; thirdly, some natu∣rall and not legitimate; and fourthly, some neither na∣turall, nor legitimate. Naturall and legitimate are those who are borne in holy wedlocke. Secondly, legitimate and not naturall are those who are adopted children; collecti ab  collegit congre∣gavit, and such the Iewes called [Asuphim] collecti, Psal. 27.10. Thirdly, na∣turall but not legitimate, as those who are borne of har∣lots, but not of common harlots, and such are called Nothi; Lastly, neither naturall nor legitimate, as those who are borne of common harlots; such a one the He∣brewes called Mamzer, and the Latines call him Spu∣rium; and the Lawiers call such children incertos, quia incerto patre, sed certa matre, such as those might not en∣ter into the congregation. The Conclusion of this is, children beare not the re∣proach of their parents, under the Gospell; therfore it is a vile thing, and an opprobry, to object to a man, that he is a whores sonne, although his mother were a whore; farre more then, when his mother is an honest and chast woman; as Saul did to Ionathan, 1 Sam. 20.30. Thou hast chosen the son of Iesse to thine own confusion, & to the confu∣sion of thy mothers nakednesse, that is, all men hearing, that thou lovest a man whom I hate, they will say; that thou art not my son, but the son of a whore and a Bastard; and so this shall be a reproach both to thee and to thy mother.
EXERCITAT. XXIX. The Priests Daughter that defiled her selfe with fornication was to be burnt. A ceremoniall appendix of Command. 7. Levit. 21.19. And if any Priests Daughter defiled her∣selfe by playing the whore, she profaneth her father, she shall be burnt with fire. THe Priests Daughter if she committed whoredome was to be burnt quicke, this the Latines call Vivi∣comburium. So the King of Babel. Iere. 29.23. Caused rost two adulterous Priests in the fire, because they lay with their neighbors wives. She was to be burnt quick,Why the Priests daugh∣ter was to be burnt quicke. because she had profaned her father the Priest. As Si∣meon, and Levi made their father stinke before the Siche∣mites, because of their vile murther, Gen. 34.30. So the Priests Daughter committing whoredome profa∣neth him and maketh him vile in the eyes of the peo∣ple. Secondly, she made the sacrifice of the Lord to be abhorred. As the sonnes of Eli, lyeing with the wo∣men that came to the Tabernacle, made the sacrifice of the Lord to be abhorred (for the people judged of the sacrifice by the Priest; such Priest, such sacrifice) so when the Priests Daughter committed whoredome, she made the sacrifice of the Priest to be abhorred. This sinne deserved a fearefull punishment,Chri∣stus typicus. mysticus. Sacramentalis. proprie dictus. because it was committed against the Lord Iesus in type. Christ is set downe to us, in the Scriptures, foure manner of wayes. First; Christus typicus. Secondly,
Christus Mysticus? Thirdly, Christus Sacramentalis; and fourthly, Christus propriè dictus. When a profane man or woman defile themselves with whoredome, and then doe come to the holy Sacrament, thus they defile Christ Sacramentally. So when they commit this sinne; they offend the Church, the Mysticall Body of Christ, and they take one of his members, and make it the member of an Harlot. So when the Priests Daughter committed whoredome, she sinned against Christ in type. Whether was the man that lay with the Priests Daughter burnt also, or not? Whether the man that lay with the Priests daughter, was urnt or not.Not, and the Iewes say, that they killed not two up∣on one day, unlesse they were guilty of one and the selfe same crime, as the adulterer and the adultresse were both put to dead upon one day; but they say, if one had lyen with the Priests Daughter, he was strangled, and she was burnt, and therefore not put to death in one day. The Iewes afterwards changed this sort of burning, and they burnt them, powring in hote Leade at their mouth,Combastio anima quid apud hebraeos. and this is called Combustio animae, and so Iona∣than the Paraphrast paraphraseth it this wayes, she shall be burnt powring in hote Leade at her mouth;Combusti per munus cali qd, and this sort of burning they called also Combustio per manus coeli, that is, as if they were stricken from the Heavens by Gods hand immediately; the ground of this punish∣ment they made to be this, because it is said of Nadab, and Abihu, combusti sunt in animabus suis, they were burnt in their soules; there was no burning seene in their bo∣dies, but they looked like those who were stricken with thunder from the heavens, their cloathes were not burnt, Levit. 10.5. And their bodies were caried forth whole and buried; they looked as if they had dyed a naturall death, without any marke in their bodies: not
unlike unto this punishment was that kind of death, which Sir Roger Mortimer put King Edward the second to, causing an hote broach to be put in his fundament, that he might seeme to be killed, per manus coeli, as the Hebrewes speake. The Priests Daughter was burnt, and not the man,Why the Priests daugh∣ter was burnt, and not the man that lay with her. because she defiled her fathers house. Sometimes the sinne is more exaggerated upon the Womans part, then upon the mans; so Tamers fault was greater, then Iu∣dahs, because she knew him to be her father in Law; but Iudah tooke her onely to be a whore, and not his Daughter in law.How sinne is exaggera∣ted both upon the wo∣mans and mans part. Sometime againe the sinne is exagge∣rated more upon the mans part than upon the womans, Levit. 19.20. if an Israelite had lyen with a stranger that was betrothed, he was both to be beaten, and to offer a sacrifice, the woman was onely whipt, and offered not a sacrifice, because she was not an Israelitesse, and somtimes the sinne is equall one both their parts, as if a Priests sonne had lyen with a Priests Daughter, then they were both to be burnt. What if a Ministers Daughter, now under the Gos∣pell should commit whoredome, should she bee burnt as the Priests Daughter under the Law? Not,A Ministers daughter now is not to be burnt if she commit whore∣dome. because a Minister now under the Gospell is not a type of Christ to come, as the Priest was under the Law: I grant she should be more severely punished then another woman, in respect of Scandall; but not in this respect, as if her father were a type of Christ. so the breach of the Sabbath under the law was punished by death, because it was a pledge to them of all the be∣nefits which they were to receive in Christ to come; but the breach of the Sabbath now, is not so to be puni∣shed, because our Sabbath now is not a type of that which we are to receive in Christ to come. The conclusion of this is,  that those who should bee
most holy, if they become profane, they shall endure the greatest punishments in Hell fire. EXERCITAT. XXX. How the woman suspected of adultery, was tryed by her jealous Husband. A ceremoniall appendix of Command. 7. Num. 5.12. If any mans wife goe aside, and commit a trespasse against him, and a man lie with her carnal∣ly, and it be clept close, &c. The manner how the woman suspected of adultery was tryed.THe Lord bearing with the infirmity of the jealous Iewes, setteth downe this tryall, that the woman who was suspected of adultery, should be tryed after this manner. The husband brought her before the Priest, and the Priest brought her before the Lord, and he charged her with an oath, that she should confesse, if she were guilty; then he tooke holy water, and mixed it with the dust of the Sanctuary, and set it before her, and said; The Lord make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when he maketh thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell: and after that she had drunke the bitter water, if she was guilty, then this curse ligh∣ted upon her; but if she was not guilty, then she was free and conceived seed. The Veile upon the wo∣mans head, a token of subjection.First, when her husband suspected her, he brought her before the Priest, and her head was uncovered: her Veile was a token of subjection to her husband, and therefore she stood bareheaded, as not being under her husband, for so is the Scripture phrase, Rom. 7.2.
The Priest wrote these curses in a booke,The Priest wrote the curses in a booke. and then blotted them out with the bitter water, Thou writest bitter things against me, Iob. 13.26. This was a bitter writing that was written against the woman, and shee was to drink it in water, even as the Israelites dranke the golden Calfe, being beaten to powder, which was their bitter sinne. She dranke the bitter waters here,Why the woman was made to drinke the bit∣ter waters. Because stollen wa∣ters were sweet to her, Prov. 9.17. Sinne is sweet in the beginning, but sowre in the end, and chiefely this sinne of adultery, The lippes of the whore drop as an honey combe, and her mouth is smoother than oyle, but her end is bitter as wormewood, Prov. 5.4. Againe, she dranke these waters out of an earthen vessel,Why she dranke in an earthen vessell. because she dranke wine before in a golden Cup of whoredomes. Lastly, she dranke the waters that were mixed with the dust,Why mixed with the dust of the Sanctuary. in the floore of the Tabernacle, because she despised the Ta∣bernacle of the Lord, therefore now she hath no part of it, but onely the Serpents portion, to drinke the dust of it. Her thigh did rot if she was guilty;That part of the body wherewithall a man sinneth, is commonly punished. the part of the body whereby a man sinneth, that is punished com∣monly. As Absolom was punished by his haire. Zim∣ri and Cosbi stricken through the belly, and here the adultrous womans thigh rotteth, and her belly swel∣leth; and David alludeth to this curse, Psal. 109.18. Let cursing come into his bowels like water. It is strange to see how God beareth so much with the man here; First, when he is married,God beareth with man in many things. if he did sus∣pect that he had not married a Virgin, then the tokens of her virginity were to be brought before him. Se∣cōdly, if he agreed not with his wife, he was to give her the bil of divorcement, but she might not give it to him. Thirdly, if he suspected her of adultery, she was to drinke the bitter waters, but not he, if she suspected him.
The woman that was innocent became fruit∣full, although before barren.If the woman was innocent, then she incurred no danger by drinking the bitter water, but if she had been barren before, then seminabat semen, she did give seed, it is not rightly translated, she shall conceive seed. Whether was this her conception (being barren be∣fore) a miracle, or not? Whether was this con∣ception of the woman, a miracle.When God, who is the Author of Nature contracteth Nature, or inlargeth it; it is not a miracle, although it be a great worke of God; when God blessed the se∣venth yeare, so that it brought forth for three yeares, it was a great worke, but it was not a miracle; it was onely an inlarging of Nature. Secundum naturam. Prater naturam. Supra naturam. Contra. naturam. God worketh not con∣trary to nature. God worketh , but he worketh never, , God worketh , according to Nature, when he maketh a man see ordinarily; so he worketh , besides Nature, when he made Stevens eye to see to the third Heaven, Act. 7. But when he made the blind to see, this was . When a yong woman conceiveth and beareth a child, this is according to Nature; but when Sarah bare a sonne, After that it ceased to be with her after the manner of women, Gen. 18.11. This was , besides nature; but when the Virgin Mary bare a sonne, this was , above Nature. The Lord reserveth foure keyes to himselfe.She shall bring forth children, the Lord is he that giveth children to the barren, Ier 31.27. I will sowe the house of Iuda, and the house of Israel with the seed of men. The paraphrast of Ierusalem, in Gen. 30.4. setteth downe foure keyes, the first is, clavis foecunditatis ad ape∣riendum, the key of fertility to open the wombe, and sterilitatis ad oceludendum, of barrennesse to shut the wombe, Gen. 30.22. God remembred Rahel, and opened her wombe. Secondly, clavis pluviae, Deu. 28.12. The Lord shall open unto thee his good treasures, the heavens to give raine unto the Land in due season. The third is, clavis ci∣bationis, the key of feeding, Psal. 145. Thou openest thine
hand, and satisfiest the desire of every living thing. And the fourth is, clavis sepulchre the key of the grave, Ezek. 37.12. And I shall open your graves. She shall give seed,The woman giveth seed in generation. the woman giveth seed in the generation as well as the man; it should not be trans∣lated, Si semen conceperit aut susceperit, for that is con∣trary to the nature of the Active conjugation hiphil, and it is oftentimes spoken in the Scriptures of trees and herbes, sementare semen, which cannot be translated suscipere semen. So Heb. 11.11. Sarah received strength, quid. , is not susceptio sed jactus, or the casting out of the seed; as when the Husbandman casteth the seed into the ground that is, , the casting out of the seed. The Syriacke paraphrase doth not paraphrase it rightly, ut susceperit aut concepe∣rit semen, that she might conceive seed. The Anabaptiste deny that Iesus Christ tooke flesh of the Virgin Mary but that he passed through her,The errour of the Ana∣baptists. as water doth the row a golden Pipe; and their chiefe reason is, because as they say, Women give no seed in generation, but this Text sheweth the contrary. So Le∣vit. 1.2. And if Christ had not taken flesh of the Vir∣gin Mary, he had never been our Goel, but as our neere kinseman, he has redeemed us from eternall damna∣tion. Lastly observe,The Word of God like the bitter water. as this bitter water made the guilty womans thigh to rot, so it maketh her that is innocent to conceive. So the Word of God, which is the savour of death unto death to the wicked, is the savour of life unto life to the godly. The conclusion of this is,  God findeth out & punisheth all sinne, but especially adultery, He will uagerwomen that breake wedlocke, Ezek. 6.28. And he shall be a swift witnesse against adulterers, Mal. 3.5.
Commandement. VIII. EXERCITAT. XXXI. Of devouring of holy things. A ceremoniall appendix of Command. 8. Prov. 20.25. It is a snare for a man to devour that which is holy, and after Vowes to make inquiry, Sacriledge compared to a snare.IT is a snare for a man to devour holy things; a snare is set as a trape to catch, Ier. 5.26. When the fowler lay∣eth his snare, he scattereth some Corne about it to draw the Birds to it; then the snare catcheth the Birds, and lastly the fowler destroyeth them, when Sacrilegious men meddle with holy things to devour them, they see some hope of gaine there which allureth them, but there is a snare laid secretly to catch them, and then the Lord who taketh them, justly destroyeth them for meddling with holy things. The judgements of God upon those who have devoured holy things.There was never one that medled with those holy things, to devour them, or turne them to their owne private use and commodity, but it was a snare to him: Iehoiakim tooke the Cedar out of the house of God, and seiled his owne Windowes with it, and painted it with Vermilion that it should not be knowne to be the seiling of the house of God, but see what judgements befell to him, quia commiscuit se cum ista cedr, because he meddled with that Cedar, & turned it to his owne use, the Lord saith, They shall not lament for him, he shall be buried with the buriall of an Asse, drawne
and cast forth beyond the gates of Ierusalem, Iere. 22.19. And see what judgements befell to Nebuchadnezzer because he robbed the Temple? and to Belshazzer be∣caused hee dranke in the Vessels of the House of the Lord? And what befell Sbishak King of Egypt, and to Crassus for robbing of the Temple of the Lord? All these doe let us see what a snare it is to devour holy things. Abimelech when he burnt the house of Baal Be∣rith the Idol, his snare catched him quickely, because he medled with the house of Baal which he tooke to be a god, hee was killed by a Woman with a piece of a Milstone, Iudg 9.53. How dangerous a thing is it then to rob the house of the living God? Dionysius, the Ty∣rant, after he had robbed the Temple of Apollo, and fin∣ding a good goale of wind, as he returned home, he jestingly said, O how doth sacrilege please the Gods! But here the Lord saith, It is a snare to devour that which is holy. When the Heathen were sacrificing,  there came an Eagle to the Altar and caught a peece of the sacrifice from it, but a coale did cleave to the flesh, which she carrying into her nest, burnt her nest, her yong ones, and she hardly escaped her selfe; it is easie for any to apply this, who is not a mocker as Dionysius was. So it was a snare to the sonnes of Eli, to take that part of the Sacrifice which belonged not to them; so it was a snare to those in the dayes of Malachy, Who with-held the tithes from the house of God, and so to the Priests who changed and alienated their Portions, Ezek. 48.14. And so to those who delayed to pay their vowes. So the Hebrewes say,What it is to transgresse in holy things. that to transgresse in the holy things, is sacriledge, as if they did eate the tithe of their Corne and Wine within their owne gates, Deu. 12, 17. So if they did worke with their first borne bullocke, or sheare their first borne sheepe, Deut. 15.29. All these
were devourers of holy things, and the Prophet allu∣deth to this,   ditescere, cum puncto in dextro, et  decimare, cum puncto in sinistro cornu. Iere. 2.3. Israel was holinesse to the Lord, and the first fruits of his increase, all that devour him shal offend, evill shall come upon them, saith the Lord. The Hebrewes say that tithes are the hedge of a mans riches, and they say gnashar with the point in cornu dextro signifieth dite∣scere, to grow rich and in sinistro, decimas pendere, to pay the tithes, haec duo vno puncto dirimuntur. To devour holy things, avaritious and greedy men, are like the horse leech, who hath two Daughters which cry continually, give, give, but most of all they are desirous to devour holy things, and to eat of the for∣bidden tree, the Iewes say that every Child in Israel knew his owne portion, there were somethings where∣of both the Priest, his sonnes and daughters might eate, as the wave breast, and heave shoulder. Levit. 10.14. There were other things which the Priest and his sons might eate of, but not his daughters, As the sinne offe∣ring, whereof none of the blood came within the Tabernacle of the Congregation to reconcile with all, Levit. 6.28. and there were other things which the Priest might eate, but neither his sonne nor his daughter might eate of them, as the meat offering that remained of the offering of the Lord, made by fire, Levit. 10.12. for it was eaten be∣side the Altar. When men become vnsatiable, and lust as the Israelites did at the graves of concupiscence, then nothing will content them untill they have Gods por∣tion also; when the father and the mother came before the Iudges in Israel,   vrbis. and complained that their son was [Zolel] a vile person, a drunkard, and a glutton, Dut. 21.20. Then the Iudges ordained that he should be stoned to death; but when God the Father and the Church their Mother, doe complaine of those devourers of holy things, what fearefull Iudgements must they un∣dergoe?
And after Vowes to make inquiry, that is, after that thou hast vowed a Vow to seeke how thou mayest illude or disanull it: the Iewes said of old, that vowes were the hedge of the first fruites, and tithes the hedge of their riches; they said that vowes were the hedge of the first fruites, because when a man had vowed, his vow would bind him to performe it, but these thought not that their vow was such a hedge, when they sought to disannull it. When they vowed of old, they said after this maner,The forme of the Iewes vow of old. my estimation be upon me fifty Shekels, or the esti∣mation of this man, be upon ine fifty shekels, this was the forme of their vow: according to this David saith, My Vowes are upon me, Psal. 56.12. then they were bound to pay their vowes, and if they refused to pay, then they might take a pawne or pledge of them, and force them to pay them as just debt,They might force them to pay their vowes. and this was called the money of the soules estimation. 2 King. 12.4. When they said, the estimation of this man be upon me, they meant, I am willing to pay that, which such a man may be valued at; therefore when they made such a vow, they might not enquire after it. Thus God would not suffer his name to be abused.Better not to vow, than to vow and not per∣forme. Eccles. 5.2, 4, 5, Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God; for God is in Heaven, and thou upon Earth, therefore let thy words be few. When thou vowest a vow unto God, deserre not to pay it, for hee hath no pleasure in fooles; pay that which thou owest; better it is that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow, and not pay. And if so bee, that the Lord will have a man that hath but given his word for his neighbour, not to give sleepe to his eyes, nor slumber to his eye Lids, untill he have delivered him∣selfe, As the Roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler, Prov. 6, 1, 2, 3.4. Much more
when he hath bound his soule with a bond, Num. 30.4.5. will he have him to performe his vowes, and not to enquire after them. EXERCITAT. XXXII. Of the Jewes Phylacteries. A ceremoniall appendix for keeping of all the Com∣mandements. Num. 15.38. Speake unto the Children of Israel, and bid them that they make fringes upon the borders of their garments, &c. THe Lord sitting himselfe to the nonage and infan∣cy of the Iewes Church, he gave them helpes; first for their judgement, secondly, for their affections, and thirdly, for their memory. God gave the Iewes helpes for their Iudge∣ments, memories and affections.First, he gave them helpes for their judgement, for as we, when we have a dull Scholler, borrow com∣parisons from sensible things to teach him; so the Lord set sensible figures and types before the Iewes to teach them. Secondly, he helped their affections by Musicke, and thirdly he helped their memories by those Phylacte∣ries or fringes, which he commanded them to put upon the borders of their garments, Deut. 22.12. Exod. 13.9. And it shall be for a signe unto thee, upon thine hand, and for a memoriall, betweene thine eyes, that is, the Phylacte∣ry shall be a signe unto thee upon thy hand, and a me∣moriall betweene thine eyes, and a signet upon thine heart; those things which we account of we carry them
as they were written in our hands, Esay. 49.16. Behold I have graven thee vpon the palmes of myne hands, Prov. 7.3. Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the Ta∣ble of thine heart, say unto wisdome thou art my sister, and call understanding thykinswoman. As they carried, of old, the names of those whom they loved, in rings, and bracelets; so he willeth him to cary the Law of God graven, as it were his dearest Sister, or like a Phylactery upon his hand. The garment which the Iewes wore, was a side coate like the garments which the eastern people do weare at this day, and it was called Cesuth, Deut. 22.21. Tegumentum  Pallium. Besides this, they had another garment which they called Me∣gnil, a long Cloake without sleeves: Thirdly, vestis villosa, Pallium Iudaeis peculi∣are. they had a Garment called Talith which was vestis superior, an upper Garment used by the most of them when they travelled. Their first Garment called Cesuth was parted below, which made the foure wings of it, two before and two behind, so their upper Garment called Talith was made like the coate of a Lacky or footboy, divided in two parts. Those fringes which they were commanded to put upon the borders of their Garments, institae. and the wings of them, are called Gedilim threeds woven together, that is, threeds which remaine hanging downe like small haires, after the coate was won, Num. 13.38. And then they had their Tephilim, their Phylacteries, and the Phylacteries were put upon their heads, peniculatus fi∣lorum textus. Why the Iewes wore Phylacterius. and upon their armes, and those which were called TZitzith were put upon their cloathes, and the posts of their doores; he commanded them to weare those fringes, and Phy∣lacteries, to put them in remembrance to keepe the law of the Lord, and to distinguish the Iew from the hea∣then; and they say, three things distinguished the Iew
from the heathen, their Sabbath, their circumcision, and their Phylacteries. The Iewes abused their Phylacteries.They abused those fringes and Phylacteries, first in∣larging them and making them , Christ bla∣med them not for wearing Phylacteries, but for making them too broad. Againe, they abused them, making them helpes onely for their prayers, and they derived Tephilim a Phylacterie a [Palal] orare, derivatur a  apponere, et non a  orare, ut quidam volunt. whereas it should be derived from, [Taphal] apponere; Taphal signifieth adhaesionem vel conjunctionem, and the seventy translate it , Immobilia, they were not then , helpes to prayer, as the Iewes superstitiously imagined, but helpes to put them in remembrance to keepe the Law, and from this superstition it came, that Elisha de∣lighted still to were Talijoth his upper Garmēt with the wings, therefore they called him Elisha with the wings, and his superstitious prayers they called them his gol∣den wings, and R Eleazer the son of Ioseph said, whosoe∣ver had Phylacteries upon his head, and upon his arme and fringes upon his Garment, and a marke upon his doore, all these would keepe him from sinning, as it is written, a threefold cord is not quickly broken. Eccles. 4.12. After this they became more impious in abusing them, making them remedies against Witchcraft,  contra fascinationes, those Phylacteries Varro called Prebia or Brebia, hence commeth the word briefe which is Satan signe to save men from danger.
EXERCITAT. XXXIII. A ceremoniall appendix for the breach of all the Commandements. Deut. 21.23. Cursed be he that hangeth upon a tree. THere are two parts in this punishment, a judiciall part, and a ceremoniall. The judiciall is this,A judiciall and ceremo∣niall part in the Law. to put the malefactor to death; the ceremoniall part is this, to hang him upon a tree, but not to suffer him to hang all night, for then he defileth the Land. When the adulterer is commanded to be put to death, the judiciall part of the Law, had but respect to the breach of one Commandement, to wit, the se∣venth;The malefactor that was anged under the Law, was accu sed for breach of all the Com∣mandements. but when the Law commanded to hang up the malefactor upon a tree, then the malefactor is accoun∣ted accursed, because he hath broken the whole Com∣mandements: Therefore the Apostle addeth, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which are writ∣ten, and Deut. 27.26. Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to doe them, that is, who hath not continued in them to doe them, Heb. 8.9. Iere. 31, 33. This transgression of the law is called the quarrell of his covenant, that bringeth on the vengeance of God, Levit. 26.25. And I bring a sword upon you that shall avenge the quarrell of my covenant, so Iere. 50.28. We are naturally accursed for breaking of all the Cō∣mandmēts, & Christ by imputatiō was really accursed for the breach of all the Commandements, so was the malefactor typically accursed, being a type of Christ. No malefactor was a type of Christ but he that was hanged. Secondly, none hanged out of Iudea,The malefactor typical∣ly accursed. the forme of their death made them accursed, but onely the sinne it selfe;No Malefactor was a type of Christ, but he who was hanged in Canaan. as when Haman's sonnes were hanged upon a gallowes; thirdly, whatsoever forme of hanging upon a tree they used in Iudea, it made
them accursed, whether they were hanged upon one tree, as Sauls sonnes were; or upon a crosse tree, which forme the Romanes brought in amongst them,No death made a man accursed, but hanging on a tree.  Crux, pati∣hulam a  erigere crucifigere Why the theefe was not to hang all night. the Iewes called Zekephah, and the Greekes called  lignum geminum. Fourthly; they might not suffer them to hang all night upon the tree because it defiled the land; the Chaldee Paraphrast giveth this to be the reason, why they should not be suffred to hang all night upon the tree, because man was made to the Image of God, and as it is a dishonor for a Prince to see his Image misregarded; so the Lord would not have man to hang, all night upon a tree, because he was made to his Image; but the text giveth this reason that he should not hang all night, lest he defile the Land, Deut. 21.22. And Iosh. 10.26. it was not for the honor of the party hanged, that hee was cut downe before night, but that the Land might not be defiled, and in detestation of this death,The tree buried with the Malefactor. they tooke the tree upon which the malefactor was hanged, and buried it with him; and the Iewes adde that they did not hang him upon a growing tree, lest they should have spared the growing tree, and not cut it downe, and buried it with the malefactor. It may be asked how David caused the young men to kill Rechab, and Benah who killed Ishboseth, and to hang up their armes and legges over the poole in Hebron, 2 Sam. 4.12. seeing the malefactor was to be cut downe before the sunne set? Why David set up the legs and armes of Benah and Rechab.The bodies of the malefactors might not hang all night, but they were to be taken downe and buried before the Sunne set; but the legges and hands of those malefactors were set up there, to teach others to ab∣staine from cruell murther. Fiftly, they were accursed who hung upon a tree ra∣ther than upon any other thing, because Adam sinned eating the fruit of the forbidden tree.
Lastly, observe that no forme of mans death,All sorts of deaths now are alike. now maketh him accursed, for all sorts of death now are a∣like, providing that he die penitently; it is the dying in sinne onely that maketh a man accursed now, it is not the forme of the death that maketh a man accur∣sed. There were three things which did accompany him, who was hanged upon a tree, first shame, secondly paine, and thirdly a curse. First,The death of the Crosse an ignominious death. it was a most ignominious and a shamefull death, Num. 25.4. Take the Princes and hang them up before the Sun, that is, publickly; the Seventy translate it, paradigmatize them, and make open spectacles of shame, and Suidas saith, when any dyed an infortu∣nate death, they put a crosse upon his grave, and Pli∣nie reporteth, that the Romans set up certaine Crosses where upon they did hang those dogges which gave no warning when the Gaules did scale the capitoll; they counted this sort of death, a dogges death, therefore Seneca called it stipem infamem, and others called it lignum infoelix, and because it was such an infamous kind of death, therefore the Christian Emperous chan¦ged, Crucem in furcam, in honor of Christ; because he was hanged upon the Crosse they would have it no more used; and Cicero said, it was an hainous thing to bind a Citizen of Rome, a villanie to scourge him; and in a manner parricide to kill him; what shall it be then to hang him upon a crosse? This death of the crosse was a most painefull death, Psal. 22.14. All my bones are out of joint, disparant s omnia ossa mea  separavit disiunxit. in the Hebrew it is Hithpardu are sundred, this was but the outside of the paine; but if we shall consider what was the paine and griefe upon his soule, then we may say, was there ever griefe like unto his griefe, Lament. 1.12. Lastly, the death of the Crosse was a most cursed
death; When the Iewes object to us, as the greatest opprobry, that we worship Christ crucified who dyed such a cursed death; we should rejoyce in this, and count it our greatest happinesse, that he was made a curse for us hanging upon a tree, for his lifting up upon the Crosse draweth many to him. Ioh. 3.14. And Bernard said well, Non pigeat videre serpentem penden∣tem in lign, si vis videre regem in solio residentem; let us observe how the theefe beleived in Christ when hee was hanging upon the Crosse, if Esay beleived he saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, Esay. 6.1. If Moses be∣leived he saw the Lord in a flame, Exod. 3.2. If the three Disciples beleived they saw him betwixt Moses and Elias, and his face shined, Matth. 17. but the theefe saw him hanging upon a tree, and betwixt two theeves, and not betwixt two Prophets, he saw him not sitting upon his throne, but hanging upon the Crosse, and yet he beleived in him. The conclusion of this is, blessed is he that heareth the Word of God, and doth it. Luc. 11, 20. EXERCITAT. XXXIIII. Of the Jewes Logicall helpes for the understanding of the ceremo∣niall Law. FRom the excellency of the cause, they gathered the excellency of the effect; Bezaleel and Aholiab were extraordinarily gifted to worke all manner of worke in the Tabernacle, Exod. 31.2. and the women who spunne the Curtaines of the Tabernacle were wise hearted women, Exod. 35.25. Therefore the Tabernacle was a
most excellent worke. causa prima.  causa causarum. The materiall cause of the Temple. So the curious Artificers of Tyrus wrought in the Temple, therefore it was an ex∣cellent worke, God himselfe was, Hael hisibba harisho∣na, or Sibboth hasibboth, causa causarum. The materiall cause of the holiest of all was gold, the Holy place, the Vessels of it Gold and Silver; and in the outer Court, the instruments serving for it were of Brasse, there were none of the instruments which served in the Tabernacle made of iron; the materiall cause of the most of the Temple was of the Cedar of Libanus, and therefore the Temple is called Lebanon, causa materiali. Zach. 11.1. And this they called Sibbah Homerith. The formall cause of the Tabernacle was that which the Lord shewed to Moses in the mount, Causa formalis,  Causa finalis.  ab effectis. so that of the Temple which was shewne to David, and this they cal∣led Sibbah Tzurith. The finall cause was, that the Lord might be wor∣shiped there, and this they called Sibbah Tachlith. From the effects, this they called Mesubbabh; no∣thing that fermented might be in a sacrifice, therefore honey is forbidden in a sacrifice, because it fermenteth, Exam. 2. that which was uncleane defiled, so that which came of an uncleane thing defiled; therefore they gathered, that there could bee no silke in the Tabernacle, because it came of an uncleane worme, Byssus was that fine linnen of Egypt, and not that which wee call silke, and Xylinum was the wooll of the tree which we call Cotten, and not silke! So they say the Elephants tooth or Ivory, none of it was in the Taber∣nacle, because the Elephant was an uncleane beast; yet Solomons throne was made of it. Subjectum [Nosheh] they say that Canaan was more holy than other lands; Subjectum therefore they who dyed out of Canaan, dyed in a polluted land, Amos 7.17. Againe, in Canaan townes were more holy than the rest of the
land; for they put the Lepers out of their Cities, and they buried not their dead in them. Then Ierusalem was more holy than the walled townes, for they eate the light holy things there, and the second tithe within the wals of it; then the chel or rampire was holier than that, for no Heathen, or he that was defiled by the dead, might enter within that. Then the womens Court holier than that, for none that was washed from their uncleannesse, might come there before the Sunne set, Levit. 15.6. The Court of men holier than that, for none that brought his offering for attonement, though otherwise he was not cleane, might come there, Levit. 12.6, 7. and 14.9, 10. The Priests Court was holier than that, for no Israelite might come there save in the time of their necessities, for imposing of hands or for attonement: betwixt the Porch and the Altar was holi∣er than that, for none that were blemished, or bare∣headed, might come there. The Temple holier than betwixt the Porch and the Altar, none came there but he that had his hands and his feet washen. And the Holiest of all was more holy than that, for none might enter in there, except the High Priest once in the yeare. Adiunctum.Adjunctum, [Nashu] Example, Levit. 13. verse 55. the leprosie amongst the Iewes was knowne by the colour of the scab, if it was blacke, then it was dry, and he was whole; if it was alba-subrufa, white, reddish, he was to be shut up for seven dayes. If it was [adam∣dam] subrufa, more tending to red, than he was shut up other seven dayes; and when it was rufa, very red, then he was shut out of the Campe; and the Doctors of the Iewes expresse these divers colours of the lepro∣sie after this manner; If we shall take a cup of milke, and put foure drops of blood in it, then it shall be album subrufum, subrufum. somewhat reddish, that is, inclining more to white than red; if we shall put eight drops of blood in
it, it shall bee subrufum, inclining more to red than white, but if we shall put sixteene into it, than it shall be rufum, altogether red. Example 2. Ab adjunctis, Concha, the Laver in the Tabernacle, was vnctum, sed non sanctum, it was annoynted, but it was not cal∣led holy. The Tabernacle was vnctum & sanctum, sed non sanctificans, it was both annoynted and holy, but it sanctified not other things. But the Altar was vnctum, sanctum, & sanctificans, it was both annoynted, holy, and sanctified other things that came upon it. Decisio à pari, Argumentum vel Deci∣a pari. [Gezarah shavah] the Altar was a place of refuge in the Temple; therefore it was the place of refuge in the Wildernesse. Exod. 21.14. Example 2. no Mamzer might enter into the Congregation of the Lord; therefore Hybris, that which was begotten of a Goat and an Ewe might not be offered to God in a sacrifice. Example 3, Take off thy shooes, for the place where thou standest is holy, Exod. 3.5. Therefore the Priests behoved to stand barefooted before the Lord. A simili, [Cajotza] as he who washeth his hands, a simili. and keepeth an uncleane thing still in his hand, is still un∣cleane; so he who confesseth his sinnes and keepeth one, is still uncleane. Example 2, as the body without the soule, is dead, so is the sacrifice that is offered with∣out devotion. Decisio à gravi ad leve, [Gezarah hhomer vemikkal, decisio a gravi ad leve.] from the more to the lesse. Example, if the hornes of the Altar did not shelter the Highpriest who had killed a man willingly, farre lesse did it protect any o∣ther man. Example 2. Levit. 4.12. if the ashes of the red Cow that was burnt, was to be carried forth into a cleane place, much more should the Cow be burnt and carried into a cleane place.
Decisio a levi ad defi∣cile.Decisio a levi ad difficile, [Gezarah mikkal vehhomer] from the lesse to the more. Example, if no blemish might be in the sacrifice, farre lesse in the Priest. Ex∣ample, if the Badger skinne, which was the outward covering of the Tabernacle, behoved to be of a cleane beast, much more the inner Curtaines. Exam. 3. If the Priests daughter was to be burnt for whooredome, much more the Priests sonne: if an inferior Priests sonne for fornication, much more the sonnes of Eli, for adultery; if she for lying with a man at home, much more they for lying with women in the Temple. diversum contrarium.  Egrediens foras Scortum Meretrix vaga.A contrarijs [Hephech] stolne waters are sweete, Pro. 9.17. therefore they gave her who was supected of adultery, bitter waters to drinke, Exam. 2. Habitatio domus dividit spolia, that is, the good Woman who kee∣peth herselfe at home; therefore, Niphkath bara, egre∣dien iforas, the Chaldee calleth a whore. A signo ad signatum, vel dictio relativaA signo ad signatum [Millah Mitzarepheth] Exam. No sort of fowles were offered by them to the Lord, but Turtle Doves, and young pigeons; the Turtle Dove had but one mate, and the yong pigeon had none, there∣fore God will have of his Church her first love, and onely love, Exam. 2. Leprosie was a filthy disease a∣mongst them, and the Lepers were secluded out of the Campe, signifying that vile sinners should be secluded out of the Church, and they say, that some of Ioabs posterity for the shedding of blood were strucken with Leprosie, so Vzzia for his sacriledge strucken with Leprosie. Gehezi for Simony strucken with Leprosie, Miriam for railing strucken with Leprosie. Exam. 3. Levit. 11.2.3.26. Whatsoever divideth the hoofe, and is cloven footed, & cheweth the Cud that ye may eat; there are three properties set downe here to know a cleane beast, First, to divide the hoofe. Secondly, to divide the hoofe in moe, this is called findere fissuram vngularum, the dog
divideth the hoofe, but divideth it not in two. est dividere in duas partes.  est dividere in plures partes. Deut. 14.6. he divideth not prefectly, because he divideth not in two, Levit. 11.26. Sheshang should be translated in two parts, and Parash is simply to divide. EXERCITAT. XXXV. How to understand the signification of the ceremonies of Moses Law. THe signification of the ceremonies in generall was to distinguish the cleane from the uncleane, the Iewes from the Gentiles; this application God himselfe maketh, when hee let downe the sheete to Peter, Act. 10. In applying of the ceremonies, we may make an ap∣plication of thē in generall, but we cannot make a par∣ticular application of every one of them. Example, the round footed beasts represent the estate of the perfect in glory. They that part the hoofe in two, signifie the middle estate of the Church, which is a midst betwixt the Triumphant Church, and the world; and those who part the hoofe in many partitions, doe signifie the world;The fault of the Iewes in applying the cere∣monies. but here we must not make a particular appli∣cation of every one of these; this was the fault of the Iewes, they say, the Camell signified the Babylonian Empire; the Coney signified the Grecian Empire, the Hare the Medes, and the Hogge the Edomites, or the Romanes, as they call them; this was also the fault of some of the ancient, who studied to make a particular application of every one of these ceremonies. Example, ye shall eate fish with sinnes, but not Eeles; ye shall eate fish with sinnes, their sinnes signified faith and hope, the
Eele having no sinnes signified worldlings, who are al∣wayes grubbling in the earth; but in those we rest must in the generall signification. Ceremonies of the Old Testament, are applyed by the Apostles in the New Testament diversly,Ceremonies in the old Testament are applied in the New three wayes either al∣legorically, tropologically, or anagogically; they are applyed allegorically, when the thing spoken of in the old Testament, signifieth somthing in the new Testamēt; they are applyed tropologically; when they are appli∣ed to signifie our manners, and when they inferre some morall duty; and they are applied anagogically, when the thing below here, signifieth the estate and conditi∣on of the life to come. No allegoricall appli∣cation to be made from the Old Testament to the new, but where the Spirit of God hath made it.We are not to make an allgoricall application of any thing in the old Testament to the Church in the new, but where the holy Ghost hath made it, Example, Galat. 4.25. Hagar, and Sara in the old Testament are applied allegorically to the new coveant, and they are said, , or as the Syriacke hath it, to be at peace together, or agree together: Hagar, her sonne Ismael, and the Law, and Ierusalem below here, and her chil∣dren are all . Sara againe, the freewoman, her sonne Isaac, the new covenant, Ierusalem which is from above and her children are , but they are , to Hagar and her children. Psal. 40.6. Mine eare hast thou boared, but Heb. 10.5. A bodie hast thou prepared for me; it is commonly hol∣den, that this is an allegoricall application applied to Christ, taken from the boaring of the servants eare un∣der the Law; but if it had beene an allusion to that forme under the Law, why would the Apostle then who was most skilfull in application of the ceremo∣nies set it downe thus; thou hast prepared a body for me. And David saith, Psal. 40.6. Thou hast boared mine eares, Whereas the right eare of the servant was onely boared.
EXERCITAT. XXXVI. Of the abrogation of the Ceremoniall Law. THE Leviticall ceremonies are considered three wayes; first, with CHRIST; Secondly,The ceremonies consi∣dered three wayes. without Christ; and thirdly, against Christ; In the first estate they were weake Elements and could bring nothing to perfection, Heb. 10, 1. And therefore they were to be abolished, and the Gospel was to come in the place of them. Heb. 7.19. The Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did, by the which we draw neare to God. First, Lex rogatur, the Law is given. Secondly, Subrogatur, when somethings are added to the first Law.Lex rogatur. subrogatur. obrogatur. derogatur. abrogatur. Thirdly, Obrogatur, when something is changed in the first Law. Fourthly, derogatur when something is taken from it. Fifty, Abrogatur, when it is altogether aboli∣shed and taken away. When the ceremoniall Law was given,The ceremonial law was was not changed in part, but altogether abo∣lished. there was nothing subrogate or put to it, neither was it obroga∣ted, changed in part, neither was it derogated, any thing taken from it, but fully abrogated, and therfore the Apostle saith, , Superin∣ducta est spes melior, the new covenant was not brought in upon the old, that they might be both joyned in one, but the old was first abrogated, and the new brought in, in the place of it. Againe, the Apostle saith,Gods chiefe delight was not in sacrifices under the Law. A body hast thou prepared for me, as if he would say thou hast made choice of no sa∣crifices, thou wouldst not have them, for thou tookest no delight in them, thy delight was in the most excellent
thing and not in the basest, 1 Sam. 15.22. Hath the Lord as great delight in burnt offerings and in sacrifices as in obeying? behold to obey is better then sacrifice. A threefold use of the ceremonies under the Law.These ceremonies had three speciall uses when they were in force, first to helpe the Iewes infancy, but the Church under Christ comming to mans age, these ceremonies have no use now, many things become a child which are unseemely in a man. Secondly, these ceremonies served for significati∣on: when we have the fruit, there is no use of the blos¦some; so when Christ is come, there is no use of the ceremonies. Thirdly, these ceremonies served to make a parti∣tion wall betwixt the Iewes and the Gentiles, but this partition wall is now broken downe, and there is one sheepheard and one sheepfold, Ioh. 10.16. and therefore this use ceaseth now. Three errours concer∣cerning Christ.Secondly, the ceremonies are considered without Christ, when the Apostles did beare with the weake Iewes for a while. And in this estate they were beg∣gerly elements. Coloss. 2.20. Scotus observeth the peri∣ode of circumcision, the first period was from the in∣stitution of it untill the time that Christ was baptized; then it was Necessaria et utilis: the second period was from the Baptisme of Christ, untill the promulgation of the Gospell, Goe teach all Nations, Baptizing them; Matth. 28.19. In this period it was Vtilis sed non neces∣saria, Profitable but not necessary: the third period from the promulgation of the Gospell untill the de∣struction of the Temple; it was Licita in this period, Sed non vtilis: The fourth period was from the destru∣ction of the Temple, or rather from the Councell of the Apostles, even unto this time, then it was altoge∣ther Illicita. In this estate when the ceremonies were Licita sed
non vtilis, they did beare with the weake Iewes at Ieru∣salem, but not at Antioch, who would have added the ceremonies to the Gospell. Paul circumcised Timothy, Act. 16.3. bearing with the weake Iewes, but hee would no wayes beare with the malicious Iewes; therefore hee would not Circumcise Titus, lest hee should strengthen them in their obstinacy, Galath. 2.3. The ceremonies being dead, and Christ come;  how could Cornelius Prayers and almes bee acceptable to God, seeing he waited for Christ to come? There are three sorts of error concerning Christ,Error temporis. condetionis. persona. the first was error temporis, the second was error conditi∣onis, and the third was error personae. Error temporis, was twofold, either of simple igno∣rance, or of affected ignorance; simple ignorance as that of Cornelius, and for this cause Peter was sent to teach him that Christ was come, and therefore his error was pardonable: affected ignorance is that igno∣rance of the Iewes who will not know nor beleeve that Christ is come, although the truth bee evidently de∣monstrated unto them. Error conditionis, was that in the Apostles, who tooke Christs Kingdome to be a Worldly Kingdome at the first, Act. 1.6. When wilt thou restore the Kingdome to Is∣rael? This error was a dangerous error, but yet was pardoned because as yet the holy Ghost was not come downe upon them: the third was error personae, and this was when they tooke false christs for the true Christ, Matth. 24.24. And this error was alwayes damnable. Whether may these lawes which are mixtly ceremo∣niall, be kept now under the Gospel or not? Where the ground of the law is ceremoniall, and the Iudiciall but an appendix of it, it no wayes may be kept. Example, this is a ceremoniall law, cursed is he
that hangeth upon a tree,Whether Lawes mixtly ceremoniall doe bind. the ceremoniall part is, that he is accursed that hangeth upon a tree, wee must not thinke that hee is accursed now who hangeth upon a tree, therefore that law is quite abolished; the Iudi∣ciall part is this, that he shall not hang all night upon the tree, and this law bindes not Christians now, because it is an appendix of this ceremoniall Law; but where the ground of the Law is Iudiciall, and the ceremony but an appendix of it, then the Iudiciall law may be observed, at least the equitie of it. Example, Cities of refuge were appointed as a Iudiciall Law, to save the mankiller from the revenger of the blood; there was a ceremony annexed to this Law, that they should stay within the City of refuge untill the death of the High∣priest, this was but an appendix of the judiciall Law, therefore the Law may stand, that Cities of refuge bee kept, or at least the equity of it, that those who casu∣ally kill, be not slaine. What, if a Christian now should keepe any of the ceremonies commanded in the Law? There is a three fold use of the ceremonies, Materia∣lis, formalis, & mixtus vsus, a materiall, a formall, and a mixed use. A threefold use of the ceremoniall Law.Materialis, as if a man should abstaine from eating of swines flesh onely, because it were unwholsome, he Iudaizeth not in this case; but if hee should abstaine from swines flesh as a meat uncleane, and forbidden in the Law, then he should formally keepe the cere∣mony, and truely Iudaize; the mixt use is this, when a Christian borroweth Iewish ceremonies to any use in the Christian Church. Marke how the Apostles in their practise renounced the ceremonies of the Law; first the Apostles kept the Christian Sabbath after Christs Resurrection, and not the Iewish Sabbath, therefore they renounced the
ceremonies; and the Apostle willeth the Corinthians to keepe the Passeover all the dayes of their life, in ho∣linesse, and restrained it not to some few dayes, as the Iewes Passeover was. But when the dayes of the Pentecost were fulfilled, Act. 2.1.2 Cor. 16. Here Paul reckoneth according to the Iewish Pentecost. When he speaketh of their Pentecost here, and when he sayes the dayes of their fast were expired, Act. 27.9. (the Iewes at the day of expiation had a great fast) Paul doth not Iudaize here, but onely marketh these for a ci∣vill use, to know the time of the yeare which was most knowne to the Iewes, when Paul, Act. 17.19. calleth Areopagus Mars street, none will thinke that Paul wor∣shipped Mars here, but he useth onely this name as a name of distinctiō to know this street frō other streets; so when he sayes that he sayled in a ship that had the badge of Castor and Pollux, Act. 28.11. we must not thinke he worshipped Castor and Pollux, but hee useth them onely as names of distinction, to put a difference betwixt this ship and other ships;Paul used the names of the Iewes feasts for di∣stinction. so when Paul useth the name of the Pentecost, and the name of the fast, Act. 2. and 27.9. he used them onely as names for di∣stinctions sake, and not for any Iewish observation, and when Paul practised any of these ceremonies, he practi∣sed them not for the ceremonies themselves, but for the weake Iewes sake. Example, When he did shave his head in Cenchrea the Port towne in Corinth. Act. 18.18. this was not according to the Law altogether,Paul did not shave his head according to the law. for if he had done it according to the Law, he should have gone to Ierusalem and there have cast the haire of his Nazarits vow under the Altar and burnt it; after the death of Christ, none of the Apostles ever went to the brasen Altar againe to sacrifice, but onely they practised some of the meaner ceremonies bearing with the weake Iewes.
How could these ceremonies be hinderances from Christ, seeing, they were types of him to come? Christ saith, Ioh. 16.7. If I goe not away, the Comforter shall not come, Christs bodily presence amongst the A∣postles hindered his spirituall presence amongst them; if the bodily presence of Christ hindered the comming of the Spirit unto them, how much more did these ce∣remonies under the Law hinder the sight of his Incar∣nation, and obscure his glory amongst them. The ceremonies in the third estate are against Christ.In the third estate these ceremonies were against Christ, in this estate the Apostle calleth it, concision, and not circumcision, Phil. 3.2. In the third estate the Iewes preferred the shadow to the body,The errour of the Iewes in preferring the Cere∣monies to Christ. the bones to the marrow, and the letter to the spirit; they preferre the shadow to the body, the ceremonies to Christ, the bones to the marrow, because they content themselves onely with the outward figures, and types, and seeke not for the thing signified, and so they have the killing letter, but not the quickning spirit: and therefore Saint Hierome compareth them well now to dogges who get onely the bones to gnaw, but they get none of the mar∣row, or that hidden Manna, Iesus Christ to their saluati∣on. The conclusion of this is, it was a great benefit to learning, when the obscure Hieroglyphicks, in Egypt were changed into letters, and the darke and mysticall writings of Plato were changed by Aristotle, into a cleare and plaine forme of writing: It is a farre greater bene∣fit, when the Lord hath changed these darke figures and shadowes, into the cleare light of the Gospel.
Hovv to make use of the Ce∣remonies of the Law in opening of a Text, and redu∣cing them to practise. Of the Notes whereby Aaron and his posterity were discerned to be called to the Priesthood. Num. 17.2. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, speake unto the Children of Israel, and take every one of them a rod, &c. WHen Corah and his complices murmured against Aaron, and contended with him for the Priesthood, (as we may see in the Chapter preceding,) the Lord commanded every one of the first borne of the tribes to bring a rod to him, that by this new miracle (causing Aarons rod to blossome) he might end this controversie, and con∣firme Aaron the more in the Priesthood.
The Prince of the tribe represented the whole tribe.Secondly, hee commanded that the names of the Princes of the tribes should be written upon the rods, and the reason, was because the Prince represented the whole tribe; so the Prince being repelled from the Priesthood, the whole tribe was repelled. Write thou every mans name upon his rod. Aaron had not written upon his rod the Tribe of Levi, but the name of Aaron, and so the rest of the Princes. Another reason wherfore the names were written upon the rods of the Princes, was because the Princes of the tribes were their first borne, and therefore they might seeme to claime right to the Priesthood: every mans name was written upon his rod, and Aarons name was writ∣ten upon his rod, because he was the first borne of Le∣vi, for the first borne of Levi was Cohath, and he begot Amram, and Amram begot Aaron, who was elder than his brother Moses. How were the Tribes reckoned in the Scriptures. How the tribes are rec∣koned in the Scripture. Whē a matter is in hand which cōcerneth the whole people, then Levi is reckoned amongst the rest, as in the matter of blessing and cursing, Deut. 27. So in setting up the twelve stones at Iordan; and upon Aarons breastplate, so here when the question is to which of the Tribes the Priesthood belonged; but when the matter is concerning civill things, then Levi is excluded as in the division of the land, and then the tribe of Ioseph is divided into two Ephraim, and Manasses, and so there are twelve Tribes. Every Tribe must lay their rod before the Lord, and have their name written upon it, Tribus. and from hence it came afterwards that the Tribes were called Shebhte because they carried rods before them, and their names written in them, and therefore Baculus is put for Tribus, Num. 1.4.16.26. Iosh. 20.10. Aaron tooke not his brother Moses rod which was
the rod of God,Why Aaron tooke not his brothers rod. by which he wrought so many mira∣cles, for the rest of the Tribes would have excepted against that rod, because it was the rod of God; but it was a common rod like the rest of the rods, that they might take no exception against it. The rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded. God thinkes not every man fit for this holy calling, he maketh choise here of Aarons rod amongst all the rest, and maketh it to bud;God thinketh not every man fit for the Calling of the Ministery. No man taketh this honour unto himselfe, but he that is called, as was Aaron. Heb. 5.4. First, no man taketh this honor, that is, ought to take it;What it is to take this calling. Secondly, take it, that is, usurpeth it at his owne hand, as he that taketh the sword shall dye with the sword, Matth. 26.55. That is, he that takes it having no calling. So thou shall not take the name of the Lord thy God in vaine, Exod. 20.7. that is, usurpe it, having no calling to take it up. Thirdly, this honor, the Priesthood was an ho∣norable calling, and therefore every base fellow should not usurpe it; any was fit enough, yea the basest of the people, if he could but conserate a ram, to bee a Priest sufficient for Ieroboam, 1 King. 12.31. but the Lord would have none to take upon him this honorable cal∣ling, but those whom he separated for it, and were called as was Aaron; if any man might challenge this preroga∣tive, might not the King? but see what Vzzia got for attempting this, 2 Chro. 26.19. & Saul for sacrificing be∣fore Samuel came, thou that canst not shew that the Lord hath made thy rod to bud, meddle not with this calling, for then some marke of Gods wrath may light upon thee. The rod of Aaron was budded. This miracle was not so much to confirme Aa∣ron, as to convince his gainstanders; the Lord sayes,The chiefe end of this miracle was to con∣vince the enemies of Aaron. Bring Aarons Rod backe againe to bee kept for a to∣ken against the Rebels; As the Rodde was kept
for a testimony against the rebels, so it budded for a testimony against them the Apostle, 1 Cor. 14.22. saith of tongues, that they are for signes, not to them that beleeve, but to them that beleeve not; so are miracles for the most part ordained for those that are unbeleevers,Miracles doe not beget faith, but confirme it. or for those who had a small measure of faith in the beginning of the Gospell see what sort have beene most desirous of miracles, those who had no faith; first, the Devill, he cryed for a miracle, that stones might be turned into bread, Matth. 4.3. Se∣condly, the rich glutton in hell, he would have one sent from the dead to tell his brethren, Luc. 16.30. Moses and the Prophets would not serve the turne; so the misbeleeving Nazarits would have had a signe from Christ,What sort of people de∣sired miracles. and the Iewes would have seene miracles, Mat. 12.39. And Herod hoped to have seene some miracle of Christ, Luc. 23.8. All these, because they had not faith, cryed for miracles; When Paul healed the father of Publius the Consull of a fever, he healed him by a miracle, and made him presently to arise, Act. 28.8, but he healed not Timothy that way, but seemed rather to play the Physitian to him, bidding him drinke no longer water, but wine; 1 Tim. 5.23. What was the reason of this? Timothy beleeved, therefore he needed not a miracle, but the father of Publius beleeved not, he was an infidell as yet, therefore a miracle was more necessary for him; many men cry for miracles, but that argues infidelity in them; but if thou didst be∣leeve, thou neededst none of these, they serve but for infidels, but they serve nothing to beget faith; the theefe said, if thou wilt come downe from the Crosse, and save thy selfe and us, then I wil beleeve in thee, Luc. 23.39. But if the death of Christ will not worke faith in the, if thou shouldst see miracles both in heaven and earth, they will never convert thee.
What is the reason that God confirmes not now mens callings by miracles? Because now religion hath taken roote;Why God confirmeth not mens calling by miracles. Simile. at the first when the Law, and the Gospell were planted, they were confirmed by miracles, but when they once tooke roote, he withdrew these miracles. A gardner when he transplāteth a tree out of one ground to another, before the tree take roote, he setteth stayes to it, he poureth water at the roote of it dayly; but when it once taketh roote, he ceaseth to water it, and pulleth away the stayes that he set to uphold it, and suffereth it to grow with the ordinary influence of the heavens; so a Chirurgian when a legge is broken, he bindeth it up; but after the bones be fastened, he taketh away these helps from it; so the Lord in planting of Religon, he put to these helpes of miracles as stayes to uphold it, but when it is once confirmed and fastened, he taketh away these helpes. What sort of miracle was this, when Aarons rod did bud. The Schoolemen marke that there are three sorts of miracles. First, miracles in the highest degree.Thom. contra gentiles. Second∣ly, miracles in the second degree; and thirdly, mira∣cles in the lowest degree. Miracles in the highest degree they make to be these,Three sorts of miracles. wherein nature never had a hand, as for the sunne to goe backe and stand stil: Miracles in the second degree, they make to be these, when nature had once an hand in them, but when they are once decayed nature can never restore them againe; nature bringeth forth a man seeing, but when he is once blind, nature can never make him to see againe; but when he is restored to his sight againe, this is a miracle in the second degree: A miracle in the third degree, they make to bee this; when nature in time could doe such a thing, but nature
upon a sodain cannot doe this, and when it is done up∣on a sodaine, it is a miracle in the third degree; they give the example of this in Peters mother in law, when Christ upon a sodaine cured her of a Feaver, nature in time might have cured her of this Feaver, but because she was cured of this Feaver upon a sodaine, it was a miracle in the third degree. Now what sort of mira∣cle was this, when this Almond rod budded, and brought forth upon a sodaine, it was a miracle in the second degree, for an Almond tree will bring foorth Almonds by nature, but being once cut up, it cannot bring forth Almonds againe, then it was a miracle in the second degree, for nature could never have made this rod to bring forth Almonds. Why Corah and Dathan contended for the Priesthood.Dathan and Abiram contended for the Priesthood, be∣cause they were of the posterity of Ruben the eldest brother, and Corah thought that it belonged to him, be∣cause he was the eldest sonne of Levi, as Adonijah con∣tended with Salomon for the kingdome, because he was the eldest sonne of David, Dathan and Abiram conten∣ded for the Priesthood, because they came of Reuben. Lineall succession not alwayes the Lawfull successinn.Learne then that lineall succession is not alwayes the lawfull succession; these were lineally descended of Ru∣ben, yet this lineall succession failed, for Ruben lost his dignity by incest, the Church of Rome now hath a line∣all succession from the ancient Roman Church, but by their spirituall whoredomes and adulteries,  they have lost their succession; Scarabeus, or the dunghill flye, bragg'd upō a time that he was more excellent than the Bee, because he was descended of the horse; but how was he descended of the horse? he was onely bred of the dung of the horse: so the Church of Rome that now is, is but come of the excrements of the old Roman Church & optimi vint pessimum acetum; when the con∣tention was betwixt Salomon and Adonijah about the
kingdome of Israel; Adonijah had standing for him A∣biathar the Priest; and Salomon had standing for him, Zadok the Priest, both of them were Priests, and both of them had the holy oyle, but who had the right, whe∣ther he that was anointed by Zadok, or he that was an∣oynted by Abiathar? he that was anoynted by Zadok had the right, because he had Nathan the Prophet upon his side. No succession is the right succession, although they have both Priest and the holy oyle, if they have not Nathan upon their side; Salomon had the right suc∣cession, because he had it by Nathan. And so Aaron here had the Lord upon his side, and therefore the Priesthood belonged to him. He chused the Almond rod, because it flourished first;Ministers should be trai∣ned up frnm their youth. The Lord liketh these to be his Ministers, who begin to blossome from their youth, this was excellently typed in Ieremiah, cap. 1. What seest thou Ieremiah? I see an Almond rod; This figured Ieremiahs calling, as the Al∣mond rod blossomed first, so Ieremiah was called from his infancy; and as the Almond tree flourished first, so the Lord was to bring his judgements quickely up∣on that people which he pronounced by Ieremiah. So he chose Samuel from his infancy, and Iohn the Baptist from a childe, and so Timothy and Athanasius: he likes not these autumnales arbores, as Iude calleth them, vers. 12. which begunne not to blossome till the latter end of Harvest, and then to enter to the Ministery; happy are they who can say with the Church, omnes fructus servavi tibi, Cant. 7.13. I have reserved all my fruits to thee, of my infancy and middle age, and old age, and have dedicated my selfe still for this calling, it is a pitty to see those that have bin deboshed and disso∣lute men, to be thrust into this holy calling, a casheerd souldier, a bankrupt Merchant, or a fallen Cour∣tier.
When the Lord caused the uncleane spirit to passe out of the land, Zach. 13. then those who had no calling to be Prophets, were ashamed of their vision, and of their rough gowne which they wore to deceive the people (because the Prophets of God wore a hairy Gowne) they confesse then that they were not Pro∣phets,The false Prophets were ashamed of their vision. but they were husbandmen, and taught to keepe Cattell from their youth; it were to be wished, that those who have not a calling to this holy function, would renounce it, and say, I was not taught from my youth, and trained up to this holy calling, but to be a souldier, a Merchant, &c. and therefore I will re∣nounce it. The Almond rod brought forth buds, blossomes, and ripe Almonds The blossoming of Aarons rod was to confirme Aaron, as the Vine branches which budded and brought forth blossomes, was to confirme the Butler in his office, Gen. 40.10. and this was declared to Ieremiah, a Priests sonne, Ier. 1.11, 12. and the continu∣ance of the Priesthood, with those who should sprout and grow out of him, Ezeck. 17.44 children are called buds, Iob 30.12. The Church is in a happy estate when she hath quali∣fied labourers in the Lords Vineyard,The estate of the Church is happy when they have good men to succeed in the Ministry. and expectants to succeed them, when she hath her ripe fruits, her blos∣somes, and her buds; the buds are the yong ones, who give themselves to those holy studies; the blossomes are the yong men who have made good progresse in Divinity; & the ripe Almonds are those who are actu∣ally serving in the Church: The Iewes alluding to Aa∣rons rod, call the children of the Priests flores sacerdoto∣les: it was a comfortable thing to Eli when he had yong Samuel to succeed him, and to Elijah when he had Elisha to succeed him, Reliquium revertetu, Esay. 7.3. and to Esay that had his sonne Shear-ja∣shub to succeed, as a pledge to confirme his prophesie,
that the remnant of the people of God should be sa∣ved and brought backe from the captivity againe. It was a great comfort to Paul when he had yong Timothy to succeed him, and to Augustine, when he had Alippius; a father dieth the more willingly, when he hath a good sonne to succeed him; the blossomes may rejoyce when they have the buds to succeed them, and the Almonds may rejoyce when they have the blossomes to succeed them. Iohn saith, 1 Iohn. 2.14. I write vnto you babes, I write unto you young men, and I write unto you old men; Babes are the buds, the young men are the blos∣somes, and the old men are the Almonds. Let us pray to God for the Schooles and Vniversities, when the old men are wearing away that good young men may succeed them, and babes in their places: the Church is much to be pittied now, although there bee many youthes to succeed, who have knowledge, yet there is little sanctification amongst them, and there∣fore lesse hope that their ministery shall bee profita∣ble. And yeilded Almonds. In the originall it is, a  abla∣ctavit [Vaijgmol] et ablactavit, it weaned them; for even as the mo∣ther weaneth her child when he is of such an age, so did the Almond tree weane the Almonds, when they were ripe. The Lord likes none to enter into this holy calling untill they be ripe,God will not have Mi∣nisters to enter on their calling untill they be ripe. they should have the full grouth before they enter, these , or young plants are not fit for it, young men are not fit for the ministery, Eccles. 12.1. Remember thy Creator in the dayes of thy youth; why bids hee the young man remember his Creator in the dayes of his youth? because he is most forgetfull of this duty to remember his God; if he be not fit to remember him∣selfe, and to recommend him∣selfe to God twise or thrise in the day, how can he be
the Lords remembrancer, to remember his people be∣fore him?Ambros. lib. 1. de offic. cap. 1. tom. 1 It was a case of necessity, when Ambrose was made Bishop of Millan, qui simul et discebat, & doce∣bat. Why youthes are not fit for the Ministry.Secondly, youthes are not fit for this calling, because this age is much subject to lust, 2. Timot. 2.22. Flye the Lusts of youth, if ever Lust breake forth in a mans life time, usually it breaketh forth in his youth, he that can∣not command his owne Lusts, how can he teach other men to subdue theirs? 1 Tim. 3.5. if a man know not how to rule his owne house, how shall he take care of the Church of God? Paul will not have a young wid∣dow admitted to wash the Saints feete, 1 Tim. 5.10. because they give themselves oftentimes to wanton∣nesse and fleshly lusts, farre lesse will he have a young man to be admitted to this holy calling, who should wash the soules of the Saints, and not their feete; this age likewise is much subject to contempt, 1 Tim. 4.11. Let no man despise thy youth, and therefore not fit to en∣ter in this calling. The naturall history marketh, that the whelpes of the Lyons who have the sharpest pawes, do so pricke the matrix of their damme, that they are borne the sooner, and they never get the full strength; so it fa∣reth with young men who hasten out of the Vniversity before they get giftes, and strength, wherefore young students are to be exhorted to stay at the Vniversity, untill they get strength; and as the Lord bad his Disci∣ples stay at Ierusalem untill the holy Ghost came downe upon them, Luc. 24.49. So should they stay at the Vni∣versities untill the Lord enable them with gifts: It is an unseemely thing to see yong ones, ante lanuginem docere senes, et hodie Catechumenus, cras Episcopus, and how unsavory a thing is it out of the mouth of a greene youth to exhort people to flye from these lusts, where∣unto they are most subject themselves; may not the
people justly say to them, Physitian heale thy selfe, and take out the beame, first, out of thine owne eye. What time should a man enter into the Ministe∣ry? We cannot prescribe a certaine time, for some are sooner gifted then others. But Christ who disputed with the Doctors of the Law, when he was but twelve yeares of age, yet he entred not into his Ministerie, untill he was thirty yeares of age, therefore it may seeme that none should be admitted before that time. Christ entred not into his Ministery until he was thir∣ty yeares of age, according to the Leviticall Law, for it behoved him to fulfill all righteousnesse; this was not a morall precept, but a ceremoniall, for it was chan∣ged. Numb 4 3. they entred to their full ministery at thirty; but Num. 8.24. he appointed them to enter at twenty and five, for the beginning of their ministery; but they entred not to their full ministery, untill they were full thirty, and they served untill they were fifty, but in Davias time they began at twenty, 1 Chro. 23.24. The sonnes of Levi did the worke of the service of the house of the Lord, from the age of twenty yeares and upward; and 2 Chron. 31.17. in Hezekiahs dayes, and so in the dayes of Ezra, from twenty yeares old and upward, Ezra chap. 3. vers.. 8. Some may be ripe Almonds now when they are sixe and twenty, or eight and twenty, and some scarce when they are thirty; therefore, there cannnot be a certaine time determined when they shall enter, but this is left to the tryall, and discretion of the Church; the determination of the Canon Law, who con∣cludeth absolutely that they should be thirty before they enter, seemeth to Iudaize in this. The Levites when
they entred on their ministery, they were thirty yeares before they entred, because their ministery was a laborious and a painefull service, and therefore required full bodily strength, and so they gave up their ministery, when they were fifty; but the ministery now is not such a bodily service, and therefore re∣quireth not such bodily strength now; the souldiers when they went to warre were admitted, when they were but twenty yeares of age, but the Levites not untill they were thirty, there is both strength and wisedome required in the warres, as Solomon saith, Prov. 24.6. strength in the souldiers; and wisedome in the gover∣nors; but in the Levites and Priests there was both wisedome and strength required, strength without wisedome before they be thirty, and wisedome with∣out strength after they are fifty. So knowledge and sanctification are requisite in those who are to enter on this Holy calling; knowledge without sanctification is like wine that runnes in a mans head, and makes him giddy, sanctification without knowledge turnes into blind zeale, and therefore they are to be joyned toge∣ther in those who are Preachers, as strength, and wise∣dome was in the Priests. The Almonds rod brought forth buds and blossomes. The Lord taught Aaron by this, although hee was weake, and old himselfe, yet his posterite should not faile; he was fourescore and sixe yeares of age now, yet to let him understand of a succession, he makes his rod to bud, and it continued in his posterity for sixty, and three Highpriests. The Priesthood was entailed to Levi, when they were chosen in the place of the first borne; and againe, when they killed their brethren for the worshipping of the golden Calfe, it was promised them anew againe, and when Phinehas killed Zimri and Cozbi, the promise was renued to him.
What needed a new promise to be made to Phinehas of the Priesthood, seeing it was due to him by the Law,  and by succession. This new promise secured him in the Priesthood,  that hee should out-live his father, and serve in the Priest-hood himselfe. Nadab and Abihu were killed before their father dyed, againe this promise assured him that it should continue in his famile. But the Priesthood was soone translated from the family of Phinehas to Ithamars posterity,  for Eli was of the posterity of Ithamar, and not of Phinehas, and from Eli it came to his sonne Phimehas, and then to Achitub, and then to Achiaz the brother of Ahimelech, and then it was restored to Zadoc, see 1 Chron. 24.3. for foure generations, the posteritie of Phinehas wan∣ted the Priesthood. Elies posterity had it, de facto et non de jure,  therefore it is to be marked what bad successe most of them had in the Priesthood, Eli brake his necke, his sonne Phinehas was killed in the battell, Abiathar was put from the Priesthood, and his soone Ahimelech was slaine by Doeg, and all this time when they wanted the Priesthood, the posterity of Elcazer farre surpassed the posterity of Ithamar, 1 Chron. 24.4. Againe it was promised to Phinehas posterity conditionally, if they should walke in their fathers wayes. This promise of the Priesthood was not made so absolutely to Phine∣has, but that Phinehas posterity for their sinnes might be deprived of it for a time, (even as the promise made to David that the Kingdome should continue with his posterity for ever, did not exclude the captivity of Baby∣lon, and the overthrow of the kingdome for a time) yet by vertue of this promise made to Phinehas his poste∣rity could not want it for ever And thirdly, it is so pro∣mised to his posterity that it should not be taken for e∣ver
from him as it was from the posterity of Eli. This rod brought forth Almonds without a roote: the fathers reason out of this place against the Iewes who will not beleeve that the Virgin could beare a sonne; why will ye beleeve this (say they) that Aarons rod brought forth Almonds without a roote, and can∣not beleeve that a Virgin can beare a sonne? ye beleeve that Eva was created out of the side of Adam, and that Adam was created out of the dust, why may yee not beleeve this likewise, that God can create a child in the Wombe of the Virgin? Yee beleeve that Sara an old withered stocke, conceived by the power of God, and why ye will not beleeve this, that God by his power created the Child in the Wombe of the Vir∣gin? The tree blossomed, although it was withered. Hence we may gather that the withered tree, the Church of the Iewes, shall flourish againe: a man loo∣king with a naturall eye upon that heape of dry bones, Ezek. 37. would never thinke that they should rise a∣gaine, but the Lord by the mighty wind of his Spirit, gathered these bones together, and made them to live; so the Lord by his mighty power, shall make the wi∣thered tree of the Iewes to flourish againe. But ye will say that Christ cursed the figtree, which represented the Church of the Iewes, and said, Never fruit grow upon thee henceforth, Mat. 21.19. Then it may seeme, that this tree shall never flourish againe. That figtree that was accursed by Christ, never to beare fruit againe, represented the Iewes who lived then, and those who shall live till the conversion of the Iewes; but when the wrath of God is come upon them to the full, as the Apostle speakes, then the Lord shall call them, and their rod shall flourish againe. Whether kept this rod still the buds, blossomes and
Almonds, when it was laid up before the Lord, or not? No question it did,  for the Lord commandeth to lay it up as a testimony against the rebels, now when it kept the buds blossomes, and Almonds, it testified the more vively against them, and as the Manna lasted so many hundreth yeares in the golden pot, so did this rod keepe the blossomes and Almonds. When Aarons rod budded, it was a token to him that he was called of the Lord; he that runneth, and is not sent by the Lord, shall never doe good in that holy Calling: these Agrippa who were borne with their feet formost, it was a bad token of their evill govern∣ment to follow, as it fell out in Herod Agrippa, who was a very bad Governour: so when a Preacher is not sent by God to his people, and the Lord doth not make his rod to bud, he shall never be a profitable Minister in his Calling.
Of the priviledges of the first borne under the Law, and what he was bound to doe to his brethren and kinsmen. Matth. 22.24. If a man die, having no children, his bro∣ther shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto him. AFter that the Pharisees had tempted Christ, the same day the Sadduces came to tempt him, who denyed the Resurrection, and they reason with Christ ab absurdo, if there were a Resurrection, then this absurdity would follow, that seven men should have one wife at the Resurrection, but this is absurd; therefore, &c. and thus they goe about to ground upon Moses Law; For Moses commanded in the Law, that if a man dye without seed, then his brother should raise up his seed unto him, Deut. 35.5. Now there fell out a case among us, that a man married a wife and dyed without chil∣dren, his brother married his wife, and he dyed with∣out children also; and seven brethren had her to wife, Whose wife then shall she be in the Resurrection? Our Lord answereth, that they erre, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God, for in the Resurrection men neither mar∣ry, nor give in marriage, but are like the Angels of God. The Sadduces who denyed the Resurrection, put this question to Christ. He that denyeth the immortality of the soule, cannot hold one sound point in Religion, the Sadduces denyed the immortality of the soule, they held the soule to be like Quickesilver which made the body to stirre, or like Salt that kept the body from
corruption, as Epicurus held, and the best that they made of it, they said it was an exact temperature of the humours of the body; and then for the Angels, they said they were but good thoughts, but not subsisting spirits. Now if the soule be not an immortall sub∣stance, the body cannot be joyned to it againe, for the weale of the body dependeth upon the soules immorta∣lity, they held the soule to be mortall, and therefore of necessity they behoved to deny the resurrection. Ter∣tullian called the Marcionites and Valentinians, qui crede∣bant reditum animae non corporis, partiarios Saducaeos. We who professe our selves to be Christians, say the Creed, and repeate this Article often, I beleeve the resurruction of the body, but yet if we will looke to the lives of most part of men, we shall heare than say no other thing, but that which the Sadduces and Epicures said, 1 Cor. 15.32. Let us eate, let us drinke, for to morrow we shall dye, that is, be quite extinguished in soule and body, as if there were no more of us after our death, thā beasts when they are knockt on the head; when the Pha∣rises reasoned with the Sadduces, they said unto thē, Why study ye to keep the Law, seeing ye beleeve not the im∣mortality of the soule? they answered, That it might be well with them in this life: we professe the immor∣tality of the soule, why study we not then to keepe the Law, that it may goe well with us in the time to come? Augustine said, if he were perswaded that the soule were mortall, then of all religions he would chuse to be the Epicure or Sadduce; but seeing the soule is an immortall substance; Let us detest these bruit beasts who imagine that death is the end both of soule and body; the soule liveth for ever, then the body must live for ever either in weale or woe; Let us study therefore to feed the soule with that immortall food of the Word of God, and not say with the rich man in the Gospell,
Luc. 12.19. Soule, thou hast enough, if we would have that happy conjunction betwixt the soule, and the bo∣dy againe. Moses said, if a man dye having no children. The question may be asked here how Moses could command such a thing; for incest is condemned in the morall law, and forbidden in the seventh Com∣mandement. We must distinguish betwixt these lawes which are morall positive lawes, and those which are divine posi∣tive lawes.Morale positivum, divi∣nu positivum. Morall positive lawes are such as the very light of nature commandeth. Divine positive are those which are accessory commandements added to the first. Example, this is a morall positive law, that a man should not lye with his mother, nor with his mother in law, for this is a fornication, that is not named amongst the Gentiles. 1 Cor. 5.1. And it was for this sort of incest that the Canaanites were cast out of Canaan. So this is primarium jus naturae, or morale positivum, that a man should not lye with his daughter, nor his daughters daughter, descendendo descending downeward: but this againe is divinum positivum, or secundarium jus naturae, in the collaterall line, that a man should not lye with his sister or his brothers wife; No marriage in the col∣laterall line was forbidden at the first, by the law of nature, or morall positive law; but it was forbidden afterwards by the divine positive law, Levit. 18.16. When Lot lay with his daughters, this was incest in the highest degree, because it was contrary to Ius naturale, the morall positive law; but when Amram married Iochabed [Dodatho] his fathers sister, Exod. 6, 20, Amita. It should not be transla∣ted Patrueis, cozin-ger∣man, but his fathers si∣ster, see Num. 26.59. This was not against the morall positive, or natu∣rall part of the law, because it was not in the right line, but in the collaterall, although in the neerest degree it was against the divine positive law; and that the
Church might be replenished with people, God over-saw this sort of marriage at the first, but God doth more here, hee commanded the brother to raise up seede to his brother. First,This Commandement was not against the mo∣rall positive Law. this is not contra prima∣rium jus naturae, because it was not in the right line. Secondly, it is an exception from secundarium ius natu∣rae, for when God commanded to doe this, hee willed them not to doe this to satisfie lust (for that were against primarium jus naturae, the morall positive law) but onely that the elder brother might be a tipe of Iesus CHRIST, who should never want a seede in the Church. If he dye having no children. In the originall it is, ha∣ving no seede.  should not be translated sonnes here, for daughters succeeded likewise to the inheritance when the fathers had no sonnes, therefore it should be translated, haeving no children,The women raised up seed to their parents. which comprehends both the males and femals, the women raised up seede to their parents as well as the males, marrying within their owne tribe, therefore that saying in the Talmud was not true, qui masculam prolem non habuit, etsi filias habuerit plurimas, in eo genus est consummatum. His brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seede to him. What brother had this priviledge?The eldest brother was bound to raise up seed. onely he that was the eldest brother, and therefore, Deut. 25.5. If bre∣thren dwell together, and one of them dye, one of them,Numerus Cardinali pro ordinali. that is, the eldest of them, Gen. 1.5. and the evening, and the morning were one day, that is, the first day, this is, cardi∣nalis numeru pro ordinali, if the third brother had rai∣sed up seede to the second brother, then it had beene incest. He that was the first borne in Israel,What things the first borne did to the rest. he was bound to do three things to his brethren & kinsmen, first he was bound to revenge his blood, their was vindex sanguinis.
Secondly, he was Goel, and redeemed the morgaged lands of his neere kinsman, and thirdly, it was he that delivered him out of prison; all these three he was bound to doe to him, jure propinquitatis, because hee was his neerest kinsman. What things due to the eldest brother.There were three things againe which were due to him; First, hee had a double portion of his fathers goods: Secondly, he had the whole inheritance; and thirdly, if he dyed without children, his brother was to raise up seed unto him. Christ our Goel reven∣geth our blood upon his enemies.Now let us apply these to Christ; First, Christ is our Goel or vindex sanguinis, the revenger of our blood upon that red Dragon who thristeth for the blood of man, and upon all the enemies who thirst for the blood of his children; the revenger of blood or Goel. Deut. 19.6. when he pursued the killer, his heart waxed hote in the pursuite; Iesus Christ our Goel, when hee doth see the blood of the Saints shed, his heart waxeth hote, and he furbisheth the sword, to make it drunke with the blood of his enemies, Iere. 51.35. The violence done to me, to my flesh, be upon thee Babylon, shall Sion say, and my blood be upon the Chaldeans, shall Ierusalem say; now marke what is said in the chapter preceding, Iere. 30.50.How teares are said to offend. Thy Goel or redeemer is strong, and I will pleade thy cause. See how the revenger of the blood makes Baby∣lon, and Chaldea answer for all: Iob saith, Cap. 17. My teares ascend before the Lord, Teares naturally descend, but as the Sunne drawes up the exhalations, and they fall downe againe; so the wrongs that are done to the Saints, they come up before their Goel, and then fall downe againe upon the enemies heads, they shall an∣swer for all the blood shed from Abel to Zachary, and all this innocent blood which is shed now, the Lord will require it at their hand. Secondly, he redeemed the morgaged land. Ruth.
4.4. and Ier. 32.7. when Hanameel the sonne of Shal∣lum, had morgaged his field that was in Anathoth, the right of redemption belonged to Ieremiah, as being co∣zen german to Hanameel. We have morgaged the In∣heritance of heaven, but Iesus Christ who is flesh of our flesh, and bone of our bones, hath redeemed it to us againe. The third thing which the Goel did to his kinsman,The Goel redeemed his kinsman out of prison. he redeemed him out of prison; so we being condemned to everlasting prison, Zach. 9.11. our Goel hath redee∣med us. It may be asked why our Goel should give any price for our redemption,  seeing we were sold freely without any money, Esay 50.1. for according to the Law of Redemption, the Redeemer should pay no more than was paid. The divell, death,  How we are said to bee redeemed freely. and sinne our enemies to whom we were slaves, gave nothing for us, they held us as ty∣rants and unjust possessors, wherefore when we were redeemed without money, we were redeemed freely, both in respect of our selves who paid nothing, and al∣so in respect of the Divell, Sinne, and Death, we are re∣deemed freely, for nothing was paid to them, because they gave nothing for us; but because we are sold from the Lord, who was our right owner, the price behoved to be paid to him, and so 1 Pet. 1.18. We are not redee∣med with corruptible gold or silver, but with his precious blood. He that is our Redeemer then, first, he is our neere kinsman, and hath priviledge to redeeme us; next, hee hath taken the prey from the unjust possessor; thirdly, he payed no ransome to him. Lastly, the ransome that our Goel paid for our Redemption was his owne blood, Sanguis est redemptionis jus & redemptionis pretium, It is both the right of redemption, and the price of re∣demption,
Ephes. 1.7. In whom wee have redemption through his blood. Thou that art redeemed, rejoyce in thy liberty; se∣condly, take not that yoake of servitude againe upon thee; thirdly, shew thy selfe a servant of obedience to righteousnesse. The priviledges which the first borne had done to him, were three; first, he had the double potion of his fathers goods; and secondly, all the inheritance; and thirdly, his brother was bound to raise up seed to him. So Iesus Christ our eldest brother hath gifts above his brethren, and anoynted above his fellowes; there∣fore the whole inheritance belongeth unto him; but this is the difference betwixt our eldest brother, and other elder brethren;The difference betwixt Christ and other elder brothers. here the eldest brother getteth all the inheritance, and the rest are excluded; but our eldest brother Iesus Christ secludes not us from the in∣heritance, but makes us coheires with himselfe, Rom. 8. We use to say of our friends, that we can see them need but wee will not see them bleed, but Iesus Christ our neerest kinsman, he will neither see us need, nor bleed, but revenges our blood, and prepareth a kingdome for us. The second thing which was done to the eldest bro∣ther, was this, if he dyed without children, then his brother was bound to raise up seed to him, and the children which his brother begot, were not called his children, but his eldest brothers, Ruth 4. and if he re∣fused to doe this duty to his eldest brother, then they spat in his face, and pulled off his shooe, and he was cal∣led discalceatus in Israele, that is, lost his possession in Israel. Now let us come to the application of this ceremo∣ny, who is the eldest brother here? Christ, who are the
second brothers that are bound to raise up seede unto him? the Preachers. Christ shall never want a seede in his Church till the Worlds end, Psal. 72.5.Christ shall never want a seed in the Church. They shall feare thee as long as the sunne, and the moone endureth, throughout all genera∣tions. Secondly, CHRIST promiseth to be with his Church to the end of the world, then this seede shall endure to the end of the world. Thirdly, the cove∣nant made with this seede shall endure for ever, Hos 2.19. Therefore this seede must endure for ever. Fourth∣ly, the seales of the covenant and the people within the covenant must endure for ever, 1 Cor. 11.26. Yee shew the Lords death till he come againe. Fiftly, see what an expresse promise our eldest brother hath, that hee shall never want a seede, Psal. 72.17. filiabitur no∣men eius vel sobole scet nomen eius. [ijnnon] filiabitur nomen ejus, the Seventy transleth it , permanebit, he shall not want a posterity to continue his name for e∣ver; when Rezin King of Syria, and Pekah King of Isra∣el came against Ierusalem to besiege it, Esay. 7, Achaz trembled and feared exceedingly, that the two Kings should sacke the City and waste all; but what doeth the Lord to confirme Achaz? he causeth Esay the Pro∣phet to bring forth his young sonne in his hand, Shear∣jashub, which signified, the rest shall returne, and that there shall bee a remnant seede left still in Iuda, Esay. 1.9. Who shall be saved in the midst of all their desola∣tions, 2 Chro. 28. so when we see the Church like to be made havocke of let us looke up to God the Father, bringing out his Sonne Iesus Christ, Shear-jashub, reliquum revertetur. to confirme us against the strength and power of the great Kings of the world, Pekah and Rezin; that there shall alwayes be a seed, and a remnant left, for the Lord, and that the gates of hell shall not prevaile against his Church: when Er was dead, Onan was bound to raise up seed unto him, and when Onan refused, then Shelah
was bound to performe this duty, so there shall bee some still to performe this duty to their elder Brother Christ. The second brother raised up seed to the eldest bro∣ther, but the children were called the eldest brothers children.A Minister should not seeke his owne praise. Hence wee learne; that a faithfull pastor should not seeke his owne praise but the honor of his eldest Brother Christ; if he seeke his owne praise, then he begetteth but children to himselfe; when Ioab be∣sieged Rabba, and was ready to take it, hee sent unto David, saying, come thou and take it, lest the victory be attributed to me; so should all faithfull Preachers be exceeding carefull, that whatsoever they doe, the praise may belong to their elder brother; Preachers are but the Bridegroomes friends, they should not sue for themselves but for the Bridegroome: when Sampson sent one to be spokesman for a wife to him, Iudg. 14.0. this spokesman tooke the woman to himselfe; he is not a faithfull spokesman that sues for himselfe, the Preachers are but the children of the wedding, or the Bridgroomes freinds, , or , that should be our highest credit. 2 Cor. 4.5. I doe not preach my selfe, but the Lord Iesus, and my selfe your servant for his sake; and let us be content with Iohn the Bap∣tist to decrease, that Christ may encrease, and labour to exalt wisedome, and she will exalt thee, Prov. 4.8. the onely way for a Minister to get credit, is to seeke the credit of his Master; but there are too many like the Pharises, who did all that they might be seene of men, and in effect they say as Iehu said, come and see how zealous I am for the Lord of hoasts, 2 King. 10.16. where a man might see as it were through a hole of his coate, pride peeping out, and he seeking his owne praise, and not the Lords honor. Let us not be like Onan who knowing that the seede should not bee his,
refused to raise it up to his eldest brother. If the second brother raised not up seed to his eldest brother, then they spit in his face. The greatest credit to a Preacher is to beget child∣ren to his eldest brother, the Lord Iesus Christ, this was Pauls glory, this shall be their Crowne and glory in the day of the Lord; the Lord likes not these barren Eunuches in the Church who beget not children unto him. It was a great credit for Abdon, Iud. 12.14. To have fourty sonnes, and thirty Nephewes, that rode on threescore and ten Asse-Coltes, but what credit shall it be for a Preacher to have so many sonnes, and daugh∣ters begotten to the Lord riding in Chariotes of tri∣umph to Glory? when they can say, behold me, And the Children which the Lord hath given me, Esay. 8.18. When a Preacher hath begotten many sonnes to him∣selfe, and built up his owne house, this shall never be reckoned upon his score; but what children hast thou begotten unto me, will the Lord say; as Arrowes are in the hand of a mighty man, so are the children to the fathers, Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them, they shall not be ashamed, but pleade with the enemies in the gate. Psal. 127.5. The Lord objected to the Iewes by Haggai. Cap. 1.4. Is it time for you, to dwell in your seiled houses, and this house lye waste? So the Lord may just∣ly object to many of us that we build our owne houses, but suffer the house of the Lord to lye waste, it was an opprobry in Israel, when a man or a woman wanted children, scribe hunc sine liberis, Iere. 22.30. and there∣fore they said when they had children, deus abstulit op∣probium meum. Luc. 1.25. The Lord hath taken away my opprobry; the Lord take away that opprobry and shame from the ministry, that they stand not up as bar∣ren and unfruitfull Eunuches in the day of the Lord. How shall we judge, who is a profitable Preacher?
Not by the event, but by his diligence: Esay was a good Preacher, and yet his ministry for the most part was to make fat the hearts of the people; and he said, I have spent my strength in vaine, Esay 49, 4. so Iere. 6.25.Cura officij. eventu. was an excellent Preacher; yet he said, The bellowes are burnt, the Lead is cōsumed & the Founder mel∣eth in vaine, & Christ himselfe converted not so many as Peter did; There is cura officij, and cura eventus, we must measure a faithfull Pastor,How the faithfulnesse of a Preacher is to be measured. per curam of ficij, and not eventus: his cura officij, is this, nosce statum gregis tui. Prov. 27.23. To know his sheepe by their names, Ioh. 10. Secondly, to feed them diligen ly, to goe out and in before them, to leade them to the wholsome pastures, & to sow his seed faithfully and then he may lye down and sleepe, and then it growes up day and night, and he cannot tell; this cura eventus belongs not to him. Lastly, he should be grieved when he sees the people hard hearted, and will not be converted. Three sorts of Prea∣chers.There are three sorts of Preachers; First, those who give a good account of good sheepe, who can say with Esay. 8.18. Here am I, and the children that thou hast given me. Secondly, those who give a good ac∣count of bad sheepe, he is free of their blood, curavi∣mus Babylonem, & noluit sanari, Iere. 51.9. this faithfull Preacher shall not want his reward with God, although he hath not converted many, and Augustine shewes the matter by this comparison; two men come into a Bar∣bers shop to be washed, a Blackamore and another man, the Barber washes the other man and makes him whiter, he washes the Blackamore and makes him blacker, yet the Barber will be payed for both, be∣cause he hath taken equall paines upon both; so shall the good Preacher get his reward, although hee make not the Blackamore looke the whiter. A Minister shall not bee like Iacob in the day of his reckoning, for Iacob
made good to Laban, that which was torne by the wilde beasts, Gen. 31.39. but a Minister shall not make good that which is lost, if it be not lost thorow his negligence, it shall suffice if he can shew the skinne and the marke to the Lord, and if he have sustained the heat of the day, and the cold of the night, as Iacob did, that is all that the Lord requires from him. The third sort is he that gives a bad account of bad sheepe, when the sheepe perisheth, through his negli∣gence; then the Lord shall require their blood at his hands. Whether should a Minister be grieved,  when he seeth his Ministery unprofitable amongst a people, and that his Ministery is like to be the favour of death unto them. No question he should be grieved;  Ieremie wished that his head might be a fountaine of teares, Ier 9.1. That he might weepe for that people, and Christ himselfe wept over Ierusalem, Mat. 23.37. But Christ himselfe (ye will say) gave thankes to God his Father,  That he had hid these things from the wise of the world, and revealed them unto babes, Matth. 11.23. and the Angell sang praise, when Esay made fat the hearts of the people, Esay 6. Christ is considered two wayes; first,  as he was the Minister of Circumcision; secondly, as Mediator; Christ, as he was the Minister of Circumcision,Christ considered as the Minist r o circumcisi∣on and as Mediator. and sent to teach the Iewes; no doubt it was a great griefe to him when he saw them hard-hearted, that they would not beleeve; but againe, if ye will consider him as Mediator, looking up to Gods wisedome and d¦cree, he giveth God praise for passing by some, and chusing others; Paul looking to his charge, he wished the Iewes to be saved, but when he looketh up to Gods will, in a second consideration, then his preaching was
to make fat the hearts of that people, as was the preach∣ing of Esay, he resteth in this; and he rejoyceth that God is glorified.Simile. Although the spheares have their owne motions in particular, yet they all follow the motion of the first mover: So although Christ and Paul be sorry at the first for the hardnesse of the Iewes hearts, yet they must follow the motion of the first mover, God himselfe, and rejoyce when he is glori∣fied. T Angels are not or∣dain to be ministring pirts to the wicked.The Angels sing praise to God for the hardning of the hearts of the wicked, and they are not sad for that; the reason of this is, because they are not ordained to be ministring spirits to such, and therefore it was no griefe to them, to see them condemned, they rejoyce to see the godly converted, because they are committed to their charge; but Ministers have both the good and the bad in their charge, and therefore at the first cannot be but grieved that they should miscarry, as Samuel mourned for Saul, 1 Sam. 15.35. The travell of the Mini∣ster is not alwayes lost.But we are to marke, if a Preacher be faithfull, and painfull in his calling, although his Ministery be not effectuall to the conversion of all, yet it shall alwayes serve to the conversion of some. Esaias ministery was to make the hearts of that people fat, yet there was a remnant seed left unto him, Esay 1.9. If he refused to raise up seed to his brother, then the woman spit in his face. Great shame to unprofi∣table Ministers.Great shall be the shame and confusion that shall be∣fall unprofitable and wicked Ministers in the day of the Lord, who refused to raise up seed to their eldest bro∣ther; Marke but the circumstances of spitting in the face, and ye shall see how great a disgrace it was. First, we use to spit upon a dogge, and not upon a man; Se∣condly, Num. 12.4. the Lord saith, If her father had spit upon her face, would she not have beene ashamed for seven
dayes? Where the Lord compareth Miriams leprosie to a father spitting upon his child; so the Lord spit, as it were,Spitting in the face a great disgrace. upon Miriam when he strucke her with lepro∣sie; and Onkelos paraphraseth it, Si increpando increpas∣set eam pater ejus: The woman the weaker Sexe did spit here in the mans face, but what a shame is it for a childe to have his father to spit upon him? Thirdly, the place aggravates the shame, it was in the publike meeting, in the gates of the City, it was a great matter to be praised in the gates of the City, Prov. 30.23. The husband when he was well apparelled, sitting among the Elders in the gates of the City, then his wife is praised, this was her greatest credit; so it was the greatest credit of the Father, when he had store of children, then he was not ashamed to plead with his enemies in the gates of the City, Psal. 137. therefore to be put to publike shame and disgrace in that place, what shame and confu∣sion would that breed. Lastly, that she should spit in his face, the face is the most excellent place in the body, & the most honourable, and not a part of dishonour. The Apostle Paul saith, If a man smite you in the face, 2 Cor. 11.20. If it was a greater shame to be smitten in the face, than any other part of the body, then it is a greater shame to be spit upon the face, than any other part of the body;Great shame to have the father spit in their faces. and if it was such a shame in Israel for a woman to spit in a mans face in their solemne and pub∣like meetings, what shame shall it be for Preachers, if the Lord spit in their faces in the sight of Christ and his Angels; and if it was a shame to the daughter when the father did spit in her face, what shame shall it be, if the Lord, who is the father of all, and of whom all fa∣therhood is called, Eph. 3.5. if he spit in the face of those who are negligent in their Callings; if she was separa∣ted out of her fathers sight, for seven dayes, what is it to be separated out of his sight for ever? There is no
argument more forcible to move an unregenerate man to abstaine from sinne,Shame a bridle to an un¦regenerate man. than shame: what saith Tamar to Amnon? 1 Sam. 13.13. And I, whither shall I cause my shame to goe? and as for thee, thou shall be counted as one of the fooles in Israel. Saul had rather kill himselfe than fall into the hands of the Philistines, and abide that shame. 1 Sam. 31. When such doe heare the faithfull Pastors praised in the gates of the City, what griefe will this breed to them? and when they see those who have converted others shine like starres in the firmament, Dan. 22.3. And themselves like darke, and blacke clouds, Iude. 12. What shame shall this be to them? The naturall brother who refused to raise up seed to his eldest brother, then the woman who complained did spit in his face, but if he was a Cousin German or another kinsman, they did not spit in his face, because he had not such a neere interest, as the naturall brother had to raise up seede; yet the holy Ghost, Ruth 4.1. doth not expresse his name, but calleth him, Pelone al moni, which implieth some disgrace, the Lord would not name him here by his name as he did Boaz. Onan was killed because he refused to raise up seede to his brother Er; this Er was a wicked man, yet be∣cause Onan refused to raise up seede to him, the Lord killed him. What will he doe then to those who re∣fuse to raise up seed to their elder Brother Iesus Christ; who is holy, blamelesse, and worthy of all honor? The putting on of the shooe a signe of posses∣sion.They pulled off his shooe, this was a signe that he lost his inheritance, for when they tooke possession of the land, they put a shooe upon their foot, and when they lost their inheritance, the shooe was pulled off their foote. The principall and chiefe regard that a man should have, is that hee lose not his inheritance; a man in Is∣rael for necessity sometimes morgaged his inheritance,
and sometimes by violence put from his inheritance, and sometimes through negligence, and slothfulnesse did suffer bryers and thornes to grow up in his inheri∣tance, but unlesse he had beene a runnagate like Esau, he never sold his inheritance: looke what regard Ieremiah had to that little peece of ground in Anathoth which he redeemed from Hanameel his Vncles sonne,What care Ieremiah had of his inheritance. to secure himselfe in that inheritance, Iere. 32. First he bought the field, then he weighed the silver, and gave seven∣teene shekles for it, then he subscribed the evidence and sealed it, and he tooke witnesses, and tooke the dou∣ble of the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the Law and custome, and that which was open; than he gave the evidence of the purchase unto Baruch, the sonne of Nerijah in the sight of Hanameel his uncles sonne, and last hee bids take these evidences, and put then in an earthen vessell, that they might continue there for many dayes; had Iere∣miah such a care for so small an inheritance? a little plat of ground in Anathoth, that cost but seventeene shekles, that he would have the evidence subscribed and sealed before faithfull witnesses, and to have them safe∣ly laid up till the peoples returne out of the captivity? shall not we then be carefull of that great inheritance which is not purchased with gold nor silver, 1 Pet. 1. to have the evidence of it sealed, subscribed, and laid up safely in our hearts? Esau was a profane man and a for∣nicator, Heb. 12.16. He sold his birth right for a messe of pottage, if Preachers be profane and vile men like Esau, they will set their inheritance at a light reckoning, but if they be the children of grace, they will esteeme much of it, as Naboth did of his Vineyard: it is the inheri∣tance that our father hath prepared, and his sonne dearely purchast for us, and therfore we should esteeme highly of it, and beware to lose this inheritance that
was bought with such a price, left if we lose it, the shooe be pulled off our feete, and we be called discal∣ceati in Israele. Now come to Christs answer to the Sadduces obje∣ction. Yee erre not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God, for in the Resurrection men neither marry, nor give in mar∣riage, but are like the Angels of God. They erre not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God, that is, the power of God manifested, and set forth in the Scriptures, the Scriptures teach us that God by his power shall raise these mortall bodies to immortality, and that then we shall be like to the An∣gels in glory; and all these naturall bonds and societies amongst men and women shall cease, as to mary, and give in marriage, &c. Yee erre not knowing the Scriptures. All error proceedeth from ignorance of the Scrip∣tures, therefore Christ biddeth the Iewes, search the Scriptures, Ioh. 5.39. and the holy Scriptures are able to make us wise unto salvation, 2 Tim. 3.15. We shall never under stand the truth but out of the Scriptures; the Church of Rome are most injurious to the Laickes forbidding them to read the Scriptures, what mervaill is it that they be led into all errors, when they want this light of the Scriptures to direct them;The Church of Rome like a Pyrat. she may be justly compared to a Pirate; a Pirate when he takes a poore Barke what doeth he? First, he taketh the com∣passe from her. Secondly, the sayles, and thirdly, the Anchor, what becomes of the poore Barke then? she is cast away upon the Rockes; so the Church of Rome first taketh from the people the compasse that is the Word of God; Secondly, shee taketh from them , (a speech borrowed from a full sayle) for∣bidding the people assurance of faith, they teach them
that they should have a morall perswasion of the re∣mission of their sinnes, to hope well that they shall be saved, but they say it is presumption to be certainely perswaded of the remission of their sinnes; and thus they take away , or the full sayle from the people: now when assurance of faith,The miserable estate of those who live in Po∣pery. the full saile is gone, then hope the Anchor (as the Apostle calleth it, Heb. 6.19.) must be lost also; yee see then the neces∣sity of searching the Scriptures; and if we would bee free of error we must study to know them, and lamen∣table is their estate, who live in popery, exposed to all danger, because they have not the use of the holy Scrip∣tures. Nor the power of God,Twofold power in God. There is a twofold power in God, first his absolute power. Secondly, his limited power; his absolute power is this, when he can doe any that implyeth not a contradiction, for that were impotency in God; his limitate power is this, when his will limitateth his po∣wer, and his other attributes: God by his absolute pow∣er could have destroyed Sodom before Lot came out of it, but by his limited power, he could not, Gen. 19.22.God may doe many things by his absolute power which he cannot doe by his limitted power. because it made more for the glory of God, that Lot should be saved, then destroyed with the Sodomites; so God by his absolute power might cast away Peter, but by his limited power, he cannot, because it makes more for his mercy to save Peter, then to destroy him. Christ by his absolute power could have wrought mi∣racles in Nazareth, but by his limited power he could not, because it made more for his glory, not to worke any amongst that unbeleeving people, Marke 6, 5. So Christ by his absolute power could have prayed for so many millions of Angels to have delivered him; but by his limited power he could not, because it made more for the glory of his Father, that he should die for
the redeeming of his Church, then that he should es∣cape the cursed death of the Crosse; here Christ speaks of that limited power of God, and not of his absolute power. Yee erre not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. We should know Gods power out of the Scrip∣tures.We must learne to know the power of God, onely out of the Scriptures, that power which is attributed to God, and not found in the Scriptures, is not to be counted Gods power: there is a question betwixt us and the Church of Rome, whether the body of Christ can be both in Heaven, and in the Sacrament at once, they alledge the power of God for them, because God by his power can make this body to be really in the Sacra∣ment; but we reply unto them, that they erre not know∣ing the Scriptures and the power of God; if they could demonstrate to us out of the Scriptures this power, then we would beleeve them; but the Scripture saith, that Iesus Christs body is in the heavens, and must bee contained there till he come to judgement, Acts 3.21. Whom the heavens must receive untill the times of the re∣stitution of all things. And therefore this power is but an imaginary power, contrary to the Scriptures of God. We shall be like the Angels of God, who neither marry nor give in marriage. There is a good axiome in the Schooles, that relata extra usum non sunt relata, relations out of their use, are no relations; a Land-marke, so long as it stands in the field, distinguishing one mans land from another, it is in the relation but taken out of that place, that relation ceaseth; the bread in the Sacrament is holy bread, so long as it is in the use, but out of this holy use it becom∣meth common bread againe; those things that were eaten in , or Idols chappell, were idolatrous in
state there, and might not be eaten; but when they were sold in the Shambles, they were extra usum, and Paul allowed then to eate of them: so here the woman is the wife to the husband in this life, but in the life to come, this relation ceaseth, And we shall be like the An∣gels of God, who neither marry nor give in marriage. We shall be like the Angels of God.Our condition in the life to come, shall be per∣fect. Marke the perfection of our condition and estate in the life to come, above our estate and condition here; our estate and condition here is twofold; either our estate after our fall, or our estate in innocency, we stand in need of many things after our fall, that we needed not before our fall; after our fall we have need of cloathes to cover us, of Physicke to cure us, of sleepe and rest to refresh our wearied bodies, and a thousand such; before the fall we had need of meat, and we had need of marriage, for man was not to live in Innocency here for ever, and therefore had need of children to succeed him to continue his generation; but in the life to come we shall stand in need of none of these things, whereof we stood in need, either in our first estate in innocency, or after the fall. This Doctrine serveth to reproove Turkes, Iewes, Chiliasts, Epicures, and such as imagine the life to come, to be after the condition and estate of this life, that men shall be there in pleasant Gardens, have great Feasts, weare gorgeous apparrell, by ima∣gining no higher of heavenly things and estate in the life to come, than of earthly things below here, like unto little children, the highest things that they can imagine of, are sweetnesses, or those things which de∣light the taste, but we must have transcendent thoughts, whē we think of heaven, those things which the eye never saw, the eare never heard, nor entred into the heart of man, are laid up for his children in the life to come, 1 Cor. 2.9. there our meat and our drinke shall be, to doe the
will of our God; we shall not stand in need of marri∣age there, because we shall continue for ever. In this life marriage is necessary to continue our kind, because we are mortall here, wee live in our mers bl∣ly,We have three mansions. this is our first mansion; we live in the world, this is our second mansion; and we live in heaven, that is our third mansion. If it were possible that a child could imagine or thinke any thing in his mothers belly, and should conceive the estate of the perfectest man upon earth, when he is lying in his mothers belly, wallowing in his blood, breathing by the Navell, were not this a false and a base imagination? a thousand times greater difference is there betwixt our estate here, and our con∣dition in the life to come; therefore to measure the life to come by our condition here, is great folly. We shall be like the Angels of God. Great difference be∣twixt our condition in this life, and our estate in the life to come.Here the Iesuites fall into the commendation of sin∣gle life, that it is Angelicall; but they distinguish not our condition in this life, and our estate in the life to come; this single life shall make us like the Angels, but in this life it makes us not to resemble the Angels, for men here marry and give in marriage, they marry here for the continuance of their kind, which they need not in the life to come; they marry here for the avoyding of Lust, and fornication; but in the life to come, they shall not be subject to this; and therefore neede no marriage. We shall be like the Angels of God. How the Angels are describe, cap. 1.The creatures which are most perfect, are the An∣gels, and the perfection of man is to imitate them; the Angels are described by the Prophet, Ezek. c. 1 with the face of a man, with the Crest of a Lyon, with the wings of the Eagle, and the foote of the Oxe. First, with the face of a man, to signifie their understanding, for of all visible creatures man is the most understanding.
Secondly, they are described with the Crest of a Lyon for their strength. Thirdly, with the wings of the Ea∣gle for their swiftnesse; and lastly with the foote of the Oxe, for their obedience; would ye then describe an Angell? He is a creature most wise, most strong,An Angell, what? most swift and nimble, and most obedient, and yee have the proofe of this, first of their wisedome; the woman of Tekoah said to David, And my Lord is wise, according to the wisdome of an Angel of God, 2 Sam. 14.26. And for their strength, ye see how one Angell killed an hundreth fourescore, and five thousand in one night in Senacheribs host, 2 King. 19.35. and for their swiftnesse ye have example in the Angell, who in one night killed all the first borne in Egypt. Exod. 12.29. and for their obedience, they are so ready to obey the Lord, that they are made a paterne and example to us, Matth. 6.10. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven, We should doe his will upon earth as they doe if in the heavens, that is, most willingly. And now to make use of this for the Ministery, the Ministers are called the Angels of the Lord, Reve. 3. because they should resemble most the Angels. First, The Angels behold the Face of God continually, Matth. 18, 10. and they desire with stretched out neckes to behold the mystery of the incarnation, 1 Pet. 1.12, If they desire to see the face of God in his Word as the Angels doe see his face in glory, and have an earnest desire to understand the mysteries of salvation, then they are like the Angels, and may bee called An∣gels. Secondly, they are the Angels of God, because they cary the message of the Lord, and therefore they should speake nothing, but the Lords message unto the people, Hag. 1.13. Then spake Haggai the Lords messenger in the Lords message unto the people.
Thirdly, The good Angels keepe the Saints in all their wayes, Psal. 91.12. For hee shall give his Angels charge over thee, to keepe thee in all thy wayes, lest thou dash thy foote against a stone. So should Ministers keepe the people committed to their charge; they should be∣ware to cast in offences, either by erronious Doctrine, or scandalons living to offend the weake, that they dash not their foote against them. Fourthly, The Angels doe separate the good fish from the bad, And sever the wicked from amongst the just, Matth. 13.49. So should Ministers strive to sepa∣rate notorious vile sinners from amongst the righteous and then they shall resemble the Angels, yea they shall become the Lords mouth in so doing. Iere. 15.19. If thou take forth the pretious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth.
Of Satans accusation of Joshua the High-Priest. Zach. 3.1. And he shewed me Ioshua the Highpriest stan∣ding before the Angell of the Lord, and Satan stan∣ding at his right hand to resist him, &c. IN this Chapter are set downe the benefits whch God bestowed upon his Church, after she returned from the captivity; and first what he did for Ioshua the Highpriest, as a type, to Vers. 8. Secondly, what he did for the Church, in the three last verses. In the type againe these things are to be considered; First, how Christ our Advocate taketh the defence of Ioshua against Satan, Vers. 2, and then how he pardo∣neth him of his sinnes, and sanctifieth him, vers. 3.4.5. and lastly, the promise which Christ, the Angell of the covenant, maketh unto him, if he walke in his wayes, Vers. 6.7.8. The accuser is Satan, the accused is Ioshua, and the de∣fender is Christ. Satan, the accuser is described by his name, Satan, Adversa∣rius saluti hominum a  adversari, odio bere. hee is called Satan, that is, qui intestino odio prosequitur, who hath a deadly hatred against the sonnes of men; the place where he stood when he accused, was at Ioshua's right hand, for it was the manner of the accusers a∣mongst the Iewes, to stand at the right hand of the par∣ty accused, when they did accuse, Psal. 109.6.The accuser stood at the right hand of the party accused. Let Sa∣tan stand at his right hand and when he shall be iudged, let him be condemned. The thing which he accused him of
was because hee stood in filthy apparell before the Lord. The opinion of Hierome concerning Ioshua.Hierome is of this mind, that Ioshua the Highpriest married a strange woman contrary to the Commande∣ment of the Lord, as the rest of the Iewes did, Ezr. 10.18. And he holdeth that Satan did accuse him justly here, because he had married a stranger as well as the rest, but we are rather to incline to Ionathan the Para∣phrast in this, who Paraphraseth it thus, Filios habebat qui duxerant uxores non convenientes sacerdotio, hoc est, a∣lienigenas, ipse vero non corripiebat eos, that is, hee had sonnes who married wives who were not lawfull for the Priests to marry, and yet he reproved not them, this may seeme rather to be the cause for which he was blamed, as we may see, Ezr. 10.18. And amongst the sonnes of the Priests, there were some that had taken strange wives, namely of the sonnes of Ioshua the sonne of Iozedek, and it was for this that his priestly Garments were stai∣ned. And he shewed me Ioshua. Foure things are to be considered in this name Ioshua. First, that Ioshua was called Hoshea, and Moses changed this name, and called him Iehoshua, and the Greekes cal∣led him Iesus. Act. 7.45. The opinion of the Iewes concerning the change of Ioshua's name.The Iewes say that the letter [jod] י was taken from the name Iehova, and was put to Hoshea, and then he was called Ioshua, as the letter [he] ה was taken from Iehoua, and put to Abram, and then he was called Abraham, but if this their observation were true, then it should fol∣low, that when the Lord tooke the letter [jod] י from a name, that it should be for the disgrace of the person, as Sarai, the Lord changed her name, and called her Sarah; this change was for the credit of Sarah, and yet [jod] י was taken from it, before she was, my prin∣cesse, but now she is a princesse simply; when Davids
incestuous sonne Amnon was called Amminon. 2 Sam. 13.2. Was the letter [jod] added for his credit? No, but the reason why this name was changed was this, to signifie the authority which the Lord had over him; for the imposition of new names signifieth authority in him that imposeth, as Ioseph's name was changed by the King of Egypt, and he was called Zaphnath-paaneah,To impose or change a name, a signe of autho∣rity. Gen. 41.45. So Eliacim's name was changed by Pharao Neco, & he was called Iehojakim, so Ananias, Misael, and Hazarias their names were changed in Babel, so Si∣mon's name was changed into Peter; Iacobs name was changed into Israel; So this name Hoshea was changed into Ioshua, Num. 13.16. and Revel. 2.17. To him that over commeth I will give a new name. Secondly, Moses gave him this name by the Spirit of God, either foreseeing that he should be his succes∣sor, and save the people from their enemies the Cana∣anites, or praying for him that the Lord would save him from the wicked spyes as Salo. Iarchi saith. Thirdly, the Seventy translate this name Ioshua al∣wayes Iesus. Whether may this name Iesus be given to any in the Church now, as Colos. 4.11.  Salute Iesus which is called Iustus. This name Ioshua contracted into Iesus by the Greeks,  was an usuall name amongst the Iewes; but now when it is appropriated to Iesus, none may bee called Iesus but Christ himselfe; for he both preserveth alive and giveth life: the Hebrewes take vivificare, vel in vita conservare, vel vitae restituere, Num. 22.33. so Num. 31.15. Num vivificastis omnem foeminam have ye kept the women alive; so Luc. 13.34. Ioshua might have done this; but vivificare is vitae restituare, to restore to life againe, and this Ioshua could not doe, but Iesus who quicke∣neth the dead, and restoreth them to life againe. 1 Cor. 15.22.
And Satan standing at his right hand. The right hand was the chiefe place; for the un∣derstanding of this situation amongst the Iewes, marke first,How to understand the situation at the right hand. when three are going together or sitting toge∣ther, he that is in the middle place is in the chiefe place, he that standeth upon his right hand, is in the se∣cond place; and he that standeth on his left hand is in the third place; and in this sense we are to understand these places, Hee shall set the sheepe at his right hand, and the goates at his left hand, Matth. 25.33. Christ is in the highest place, the sheepe in the second place, and the goates in the third; so the mother of Zebedees children; Matth. 20.21. desired that one of her sonnes might stand at Christs right hand, and another at his left hand; Christ is in the highest place, hee that stands at his right hand in the second place; and he that stands at the left hand, is in the third place. Secondly, when the most eminent person sitteth, he that sitteth at his right hand, is in the second place, Example, Salomon sate upon a throne, and his mother at his right hand, 1 King. 2.19. Salomon was in the first place, and his mother in the second. So Christ sitteth at the right hand of the father, that is, in the second place next to the father, for we cannot imagine that Christ as mediator sits above his father. The right hand is the more excellent, being compared with the left.Thirdly, when the two hands are compared toge∣ther, then the right hand is the more excellent, and so Paul saith, They gave unto us the right hand of fellow∣ship, Galat. 2.9. So Benjamin is called the sonne of the right hand, and Salomon, Eccles. 10.2. saith; that the wise mans heart is in his right side, and the fooles in his left side;How the wise mans heart is said to be in his right side. the reason why the fooles heart is said to be in his left side, is because the blood for the most part falleth to the left side, and so the heart that is dull is said to be in the left side; but the spirits againe ascend
from the left side to the right, and so the wise mans heart is said to be in his right side, because he hath more understanding. So in pleading before the judges the accused stood at the left hand of the accuser, as Satan stood at the right hand of Ioshua, but if the accused prevailed in judgement, and the accuser succumbed then he was shifted from the right hand to the left hand, then he was said to lose his cause. But when the Scripture speakes of protection,The left hand put first for protection. it put∣teth the left hand first, Psal. 16.8. Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved. Then David stood at his left hand. So Psal 129.5. The Lord is thy defence at thy right hand. So when Iob prayeth, Iob 17.3. Pone me juxta te, set me by thee, that is, at thy left hand, that thou mayest defend me with thy right hand. Lastly, when the heart and the hand are compared together, then the left hand is the chiefe hand, therefore the Iewes wore their Phylacteries upon their left arme, because it was nearest their heart; and so the Latines say of him that went at the left hand,Ambulare introrsum vel extrorsum quid. ambulare intror∣sum, because that hand was nearest the heart, and of him that goeth at the right hand, they say of him, am∣bulare extrorsum, and we use to say when we give a man the left hand, we give him the hand that is nearest the heart. Standing at his right hand. To stand, in the Scriptures, is either to pray,Stand, taken diversly. Stare, pro orare. as Abra∣ham is said to stand before the Lord, that is, to pray, and the Publican stood a farre off, that is, prayed. So Iere. 18.20. Remember that I stood before thee to speake for them, and to turne away thy wrath from them; and the He∣brewes say, Sine stationibus non subsisteret mundus, that is, without prayers the world could not endure, because they stood when they prayed. Secondly, to stand, signifies to serve, Pr. 22.29. Seest thou
a servant diligent in his businesse,Stare pro servire. this man shall stand be∣fore Kings, that is, serve, Psal. 135.2. Yee who stand in the Courts of the Lord, that is, who serve. Thirdly, to stand in the Scripture, is to stand to be judged before a Iudge;Stare pro judicare. as Exod. 17.14. Why doth the people stand all the day long, So amongst the Latines, Stare in judicio, & cadere causa, Psal. 1.5. Impij non sta∣bunt in judicio, that is, they shall lose their cause, now Ioshua stood here praying, Ioshua stood here ready to serve, and Ioshua stood as accused. He shewed me Satan standing at the right hand of Io∣shua. Foure chiefe combats betwixt God and the Divell.We may marke foure singular strifes betwixt God and the Divell, about foure singular of the Lords vali∣ant ones. The first was betweene God and Satan about Iob, cap. 1, The second was betwixt Michael the Archangell and the Divell, about the body of Moses, Iude 9. The third, was betwixt Christ and the Divell about the High∣priest Ioshua here. The fourth, was betwixt Christ and the Divell, about the faith of Peter, Luc. 22.31. In the first strife betwixt God and the Divell, about Iob; it might seeme strange that God gave such a way to Satan in this conflict; but if we will consider Gods end in it,Why God suffered Sa∣tan to afflict Iob. we shall see both his wisedome and goodnesse in it; for God did not expose Iob to these trials, that the Divell might swallow him up; but both that he might get the greater glory by this his Champion Iob, and that the Church might learne patience by this exam∣ple; yee have heard the patience of Iob, Iam. 5.11. The Lord delighted here to see his champion Iob wrestle, and to returne victorious,God taketh delight to see his children fight with Satan. and to put Satan to the foyle; the Romane Emperours used to keepe Lyons in cages, and they used to cast in condemned persons to them to fight to the death with them; wee read in
Tertullian how conclamatum est, Christiani ad Leones; so the Lord keepeth the Divels in Cages, and brings not out slaves and condemned wretches to fight with them, but his most notable champions whom he knowes will report the Victory, and therefore hee delights to be∣hold this conflict. The second reason, why the Lord put Iob to these hard tryals was for the good of his Church; for even as the Physitians keepe the bodies of the condemned to make anatomies of them for the good of others, so the Lord kept Iob for this tryall, for the good of the Church, that they might remember the patience of Iob. The second great strife was betwixt Michael the Archangell and the Divell, about the body of Moses,A second strife betwixt Christ and Satan about the body of Moses. Iude 9. It is strange to see how Satan dealeth with Moses; when Moses was living, nothing but stone him to death; but now when he is dead, he would make an Idoll of his body, and set it up to be worshipped; and that which hee could not effectuate by him when hee was living, he goes about to effectuate it now by his dead body. It was a great sinne, first to kill the Prophets, and then to erect Sepulchres to them, Matth. 23.29. Woe unto you Scribes and Pharises, hypocrites, because, &c. but this is a greater sinne first to kill Moses, and then afer his death to labour to make an Idoll of him; but the Lord had a great respect to Moses who was faithfull in all his house, Heb. 3.5. when hee was living, so now when he was dead hee preserved this his body, and buried it honorably with his owne hands, where the devill knoweth not. The third strife betwixt CHRIST and the Devill was about Ioshua the Highpriest; Satan accuses Ioshua for standing before the LORD in soiled apparrell, but the Lord takes his defence, putteth Satan to rebuke,
putteth new apparell upon Ioshua, and setteth a crowne upon his head. The fourth strife was about Peters faith, Satan sought to winnow Peter as wheat, but Christ prayed for Peters faith, that it should not faile, Luc. 22.31. The devill gave his faith a shrewd blow, and sifted him strangely, when he made him deny his master thrice. But Christ saved him by his intercession. We are to make use of these conflicts, 2 Cor. 10.13. that God will not suffer us to be tempted above that wee are able,God will not suffer us to be tempted above our power. but with the temptation will make a way alwayes to es∣cape, that we may be able to beare it. Observe in Satans tempations first the order, and then the manner; the Apostle hath an heavenly order, 1 Cor. 11.3.The order of Satans temptations. God is Christs head, Christ is the mās head, and the man is the womans head, the Devill first hee tempted the Woman, the weaker Vessell: Secondly, he tempted the man, the womans head; Thirdly, hee tempted Christ here in his type Ioshua, and then Christ in proper person, who is the mans head; but hee durst never goe higher to tempt God Christs head. There is nothing contrary to God by his omnipotencie, hee sub∣dueth all things to him, as there is nothing summe ma∣lum, as God is summe bonum, for then there should be duo principia, as the Manicheans held, so the Divel is not absolutely contrary to God, but must be subject unto him, and over-ruled by him. And if we shall marke the manner of his temptati∣ons, we shall see them strange. First, he intices and setteth forward men to mischiefe, and then he would be their first accuser, like unto Ioab. 2 Sam. 18.12, when Absolom was hanging in an oake tree, one came and told Ioab that he was hanging there, Ioab offered the man ten shekles of silver to kill him, but what saith the man? he refused, and said, No, & thou wouldst give me a
thousand shekles of silver,The manner of Satans temptations. for the King commanded to spare the young man, and if I should doe so, thou wouldst be the first man that wouldst set thy selfe against me; for Ioab first to perswade the man to kill Absolom, and then to bee the first to accuse the man, was not this a shamelesse ac∣cuser? So for the Devill first to set men on worke, and then to accuse them, is not this a vile accuser? Satan is a cruel and a crafty adversary, he is called Satan, quia intestino odio prosequitur, because hee pur∣sueth with deadly hatred, and that red Dragon who thirsts for the blood of the children of men, therefore miserable are those who seeke to him for reliefe in their sicknesse or distresse, Exod. 4.14. I am the Lord that healeth thee: many thinke that there are some gentle sorts of Divels that can doe men no harme, and that are , but if they understood Satan's grounded and rooted malice and craft, they would never seeke to him. Observe the nature of this false accuser,How Satā dealeth with his owne children, and how with the children of God. when he ac∣cuseth the child of God, he makes his sinnes appeare more than they are; if Ioshua's cloathes be soyled, he makes them appeare like the cloathes of the menstru∣ous women; but when he hath to doe with the wicked, he makes their sinnes appeare lesse than they are; but God keepeth a contrary course; when he lookes upon the sinnes of his Saints, they seeme lesse to him than they are, Iere. 51.20. Iacobs iniquity shall be sought for, and shall not be found, and Rom. 8.1. No condemnation to them which are in Christ; but when he lookes upon the sinnes of the wicked, he sees them just as they are;Simile. when a man lookes in a round glasse, his face seemeth to him lesse than it is; when a man lookes in a hollow glasse, his face seemeth to him more than it is; when a man lookes in a plaine glasse, his face seemeth just to him as it is. They will never be well decked to whom the
Divell holdeth up the glasse, of all men the Divell ta∣keth most notice of the sinnes of the Ministers, and is readiest to lay their sinnes to their owne charge, and to blaze them abroad to others; if there be a hole in their coat, he will say they are ragged; and if their cloathes be soyled, he will say they are naked; he ob∣serveth all our infirmities, and watcheth our haltings; therefore let us looke well to our wayes. To resist him. Satan layes to Ioshua's charge the faults of the people, here Ioshua represented the whole people, for the Priest under the law bare the sinnes of all the people; but to be partakers of the sinnes of the people, as here Ioshua was when hee did beare with the people that had married strange wives,How a Minister may be guilty of the sinnes of the people. that is a great sinne. A Minister may be guilty of the sinnes of the people sundry wayes; First, of the ignorance of the people, when hee instructs them not; the lipes of the Priest should preserve knowledge. Secondly, he is guilty of the sinnes of the people when he reproveth them not for their sinne, as, Mal. 2.9. Accepistis facies in lege, what is that, Ye have accepted persons in the Law? that is, when the great men sinned, the Priest durst not reprove them, but was partiall in his reproofes. Third∣ly, they are guilty of the sinnes of the people when they scandalize them by their bad life, when they cary not the tender, and weake Lambes in their bosomes, or cause them to abort, For whom Christ hath died, Rom: 14.15. Lev. 4.3. in reatum populi, , to cause the people to trespasse, 1 Chro. 21.3 Why wilt thou be a trespasse to Israel? How the Minister may be partaker of the sinnes of the people.And as the Preacher may be an occasion and a stum∣bling to make the people sinne, so he may be partaker of the sinnes of the people, if hee follow them in their sinnes; we have a notable example of this, Amos 2.11.
The Lord forbad expressely the Nazarits to drinke wine, and yet the wicked Iewes came and tempted them to drinke wine, and they to be counted boone com∣panions, did drinke wine with them; and thus they were guilty of the sinnes of the people. But they should have remembred that of Iere. 15.19. Turne thou not to them, but let them turne to thee, they bid you drinke wine, will yee drinke it? then yee goe to them; but refuse to drinke it, stand in your place and let them rather come to you; run not in that same excesse of ry∣ot with them. When Ioshua's sonnes maried strange wives, this was a staine to his holy garments; so when the sonnes of Eli lay with the women that came to the Tabernacle; it made the sacrifice of the Lord to be abhorred, and when the Priests daughter committed whoredome, it was a great disgrace and shame unto him, therefore Paul will have a Minister, To rule well his owne house, having his children in subjection with all gravity, 1 Tim. 3.4. and he giveth the reason why they should have obedient children and his house well ordered, vers. 5, For if a man know not how to rule his owne house, how shall he take care of the Church of God. How shall a Minister know that he is free from the pollutions of the people? First,  if he be deepely touched with a sense of his owne sinnes and then of the pollutions of the people, Esay. 6.5. Woe is me, for I am undone,Notes for a Minister to know when he is free from the sinnes of his people. because I am a man of polluted lipes, and I dwell in the midst of a peo∣ple of polluted lips; he that is not touched with a sense of his owne pollutions will never be touched with a sense of the peoples. Secondly, he shall know if he be free from the pol∣lutions of the people, if he be grieved for their sinnes, as the soule of just Lot was vexed for the uncleane con∣versation
of the Sodomites, 2 Pet. 2.7. and if he say with David, woe is me that I sojourne in Mesech, that I dwell in the Tents of Kedar. Psal. 120.5. Thirdly, when he dwelleth amongst a corrupt peo∣ple, let him converse little with them, and separate him∣selfe from them in conversation, or live like a Pelican in the Wildernesse, Psal. 102.6. and when he comes abroad amongst them, doe as those doe who dwell amongst a people, where the sicknesse is, that is, have his Antidot or Amulet with him, that he be not infe∣cted with corruption. The sacrifice for the Priests since was as great as the sacrifice of the whole people.The Priest was guilty of the peoples sins, and there∣fore as great a sacrifice was offered for him, as for the whole people; we have personall sinnes enough to be charged for, but when we are charged likewise for the sinnes of the people, and be guilty of them, then it will be a fearefull reckoning, happy are we if we can say I am free from the blood of this people, Act. 20.26. The Hebrewes speake of themselves in the plurall number.And the Lord said to Satan, the Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, which may be thus construed, I will rebuke thee Satan, for it is the manner of the Hebrewes to speake of them∣selves in the third person, as if they were speaking of another, as Gen. 4.23. Heare my voyce yee wives of La∣mech, that is, my wives, so Gen. 19.24. The Lord rai∣ned from the Lord, that is, from himselfe, so Esth. 8.8. Write unto the Iewes in the Kings name, that is, in my name. So here, The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, that is, I will rebuke thee. Or it may be the speech of the sonne to the father,Actiones ad extra fiunt a atre authoritative, a fi vero subauthori∣tative, th father rebukes from himselfe, and the sonne from the father. desiring the father to rebuke him; here he desireth his father to rebuke, and Marc. 1.26. he him∣selfe rebuketh, for the actions ad extra (as they speake in the Schooles) are common to all the three persons; when the father doth rebuke, he rebuketh by the sonne, and by the holy Ghost, and when the sonne doth re∣buke, he rebukes from the father, and by the holy Ghost;
and when the holy Ghost doth rebuke, hee rebuketh from the Father and from the Sonne. The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan. What is meant by rebuke here?What is meant by re∣buke here. the Seventy trans∣lates it , it is not a simple rebuke then, but con∣joyned with opprobry and shame; the Greeke Fathers afterward called the censures of the Church, as excom∣munication, &c. . Satan is accursed of God with a last and most feare∣full sort of excommunication Maran-atha or Shan-atha, Dominus venit, Iude 14. the lesser sort of excommuni∣cation is used in the Church for the destruction of the flesh, and saving of the spirit, 1 Cor. 6.5. and I gave them to Satan, that they may learne not to blaspheme, 1 Tim. 1.20. but this last and fearefull sort of excommunication, is a finall and totall rejection of the party; when one was excommunicate by this first sort of excommunication, he was to be reputed as a Publican, none might eat with him, salute him, or converse with him; what a fearefull thing is it then in these times that Witches should be so familiar with the Divell, salute him as their Master, banquet with him, dance with him,The manner how they excommunicated the Samaritans. and more than that, to lye with him, these that are without, 1 Cor. 5.13. what have we to doe with them? the Iewes would not meddle with the Samaritans, because they were Apostates from their Religion, and fearefully excommunicated, they brought 300 Priests, and 300 Trumpets, and 300 Bookes of the Law, and 300 Boyes & they blew with the Trumpets, & the Levites reading,Drusius ex Tilmideni qui sepher tanhuma etiam dicitur. accursed the Cuttaeans in the name of Tetragrammaton, or Iehova, and with the curses both of the Superior and Inferior house of judgement, And they said, Cursed is hee that eateth the bread of the Cuttaean, hee that eateth the bread of the Cuttaean or Samaritan, is as hee that eateth Swines flesh, and let no Cuttaean
be a Proselyte in Israel, neither have any part in the Resurrection, these curses they wrote upon tables, and sealed them, and sent them through all Israel, who mul∣tiplied also their great Anathema or curse upon them: If the Samaritans were so execrable to the Iewes, that they would not eate with them, nor salute them that were thus excommunicated, what a fearefull sinne is it then to salute the Divell, to eate with him, who is given over to that last and fearefull curse. They said, thou art a Samaritan, and hee's a Divell, Ioh. 8.48. they hated them as if they had beene Divels, should not then men and women much more hate the divell him∣selfe, and count his bread execrable. And the Lord said to Satan, the Lord rebuke thee, O Sa∣tan. Observe that all the defence of the Church against Satan, is onely in Christ, I have prayed for thee Peter that thy faith might not faile, Luc. 22.32. Now that ye may understand this the better, how Christ protecteth his Church, it shall not be amisse to marke the Epi∣thites that are given to Satan in the Scripture; and then to observe the Epithites given to Christ contrary to these, for defence of his Church. First the Divell is called Abaddon, Apollyon, Revel. 9.11.The Epethites of Christ, and the Epi∣thites of Satan are op∣posite. and Ashmoderus, Tobit. 3.8. A destroyer; but Christ is called Iesus a Saviour, Mat. 1.21. Thou shalt call his name Iesus, for he shall save his people from their sinnes. Secondly, the Divell is called , That evill one Mat. 37. But Christ is called Iesus the Iust, Act. 3.14. He denyed the holy One and the Iust. So 1 Ioh. 2.1. We have an Advocate with the Father, Iesus Christ the Righte∣ous. Thirdly, the Divell is , an adversary, 1 Pet. 5.8. Your adversary the Devill like a roaring Lyon, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour, he ever setteth him∣selfe
against us; but Christ is called Emmanuel, God with us, Matt. 1.25. Fourthly, the Divell is called the accuser of the bre∣thren, Revelat. 12.10. but Christ is our Advocate, 1 Ioh. 2.1. Fiftly, he is called the Tempter, Mat. 2.3. but Iesus Christ is called the Comforter, and the consolation of Israel, Luc. 21.25. primogenitus mortis, Iob. 18.13. The first borne of death, (as many of the Fathers expound it) but Christ is principium & primogenitus ex mortuis, the beginning and the first borne from the dead, Coloss. 1.18. Revel. 1.5. by whom we shall live and rise againe. Seventhly, the Diuell is that roaring Lyon that see∣keth to devour us, 1. Pet. 5.8. but Christ is that Lyon of the Tribe of Iuda, the roote of David who hath prevailed migh∣tily, Revel. 5.5. Lastly, the Divell is that Old Serpent who stingeth us to death, but Christ is that Serpent lift up in the Wil∣dernesse, that whosoever looketh upon him and be∣leeves in him, should not perish, but have everlasting life, Iohn 3.15. The Prophet Zachariah, saw in a vision foure hornes rising up to molest and trouble the Church, but he saw foure Carpenters come to beat downe these hornes, Zach. 1.18. This is the comfort of the Church, that there is no tentation that ariseth from Satan to trouble her, but the Lord hath a hammer to beat it downe, & si ve∣nenum in Diabolo, antidotum in Christo, and if there bee poyson in the Divell, there is a remedy for it in Christ. The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan. The Apostle Iude, verse 8.A great sinne to curse the Magistrate. gathereth out of this place and out of the fight betwixt Michael the Archan∣gell and the Divell about the body of Moses, that men should not revile those who are in authority. Michael is God blessed for e, Satan is a condemned spirit,
yet Michael will not raile against him. The Devill is a condemned spirit, and we are bound to pray against him; but we are bound to pray for Magistrates of whose salvation we hope well, therefore we are not to curse them; the Lord commanded his people to pray for Nebuchadnezzer, and for Babylon, Iere. 20 7. and the Apostle willeth them to pray for all that are in Autho∣rity, 1 Tim. 2.2. yea although they be infidels; Davids heart smot him for cutting off the lap of Sauls garment, 1 Sam. 24.5. and should not their hearts smite them, who raile against Princes, much more for killing of them, the Lord will make the fowles of the heaven to discover this wickednesse, although it be secretly spo∣ken in their chambers, Eccles. 10.20. The Lord rebuke thee, O Satan. What if a man should be tempted by Satan appea∣ring in a visible forme, what should he doe? whether should he use arguments out of the Scripture to repell him or not? He should doe nothing but turne his face to God, and weepe upon him, and desire that the Lord would re∣buke Satan. Christ the Mediator could hold argumnt with him, because he was God blessed for ever; but never one else could hold stitch with him, Eva by rea∣soning and keeping purpose with him, got the foile. But ye will say that in spirituall temptations we may reply to him out of the Word; why then may we not reply to him out of the Word, if he should visibly ap∣peare to us. The case is not alike, for when the devill tempteth us by inward tentations and suggestions, they are but the messengers of Satan, and they are not so subtile tentations, for they are mixed with our thoughts, and therefore may be the ore easily answered; but when he comes in proper perso, then his wickednesse
is more spirituall, Galath, 6.12. therefore wee should turne to God, and desire the Lord to rebuke him. What are we to thinke of those Exorcists who take upon them to cast out the devill? That gift was an extraordinary gift bestowed onely upon the Church in her infancy,  and it served not sim∣ply for edifying of the body of the Church;Gifts simply necessary for the Church. the gifts which served simply for the Church were, Ephes. 4.10.11. Apostles, Evangelists, Pastors and Teachers. The Apostle, 1 Cor. 12.Gifts necessary for the Church in her infancy. reckoneth up other gifts which were not simply necessary for the Church, but onely for her infancy; as the gift of healing, the gift of tongues, and this gift of casting out devills; if the Highpriest after the captivity should have put in two counterfeit stones in the breastplate, and called them Vrim, and Thummim, would not this have beene a false∣hood in him, when the gift ceased, to use the signe? so now when there is no such gift in the Church, to use the name, this is but a deceit. Gifts necessary for the building of the Church were of two sorts.Gifts necessary for the Church of two sorts. First, extraordinary, as Apostles and Evangelists. Secondly, ordinary, as Pastors and teachers; other gifts were onely for the infancy of the Church, the matter may bee cleared by this example; A Prince when he is a child he hath need of a regent,Simile. of counsel∣lers, and boyes to play with him; but when the Prince commeth to maturity of age, the Regent ceaseth, and his Play fellowes, but not his Counsellors; so the Church in her minority had Apostles and Evange∣lists, as her regents; and shee had these gifts of ngues, healing, and casting out of Divels, as her play-fellowes, these cease now; but Pastors and Teachers as her counsellers remaine still with her; when Satan is cast out, now by Exorcists this is not , by
force to cast him out, but onely by collusion, he goeth out, but he returneth againe. Even the Lord that hath chosen Ierusalem rebuke thee, as if he should say, I have decreed that Ierusalem shall be built, although thou hast set thy selfe against this, yet thou canst not hinder it;Ierusalem taken for the City, and for the peo∣ple in the City. Ierusalem is taken here, first, for the City Ierusalem, and then for the people gathe∣red to that City out of the captivity. No counsell can stand against the counsell of the Lord; see what Gamaleel said, Act. 5.38. if this Counsell be of God, we cannot hinder it; yee may see what strange impediments, were cast in to hinder the buil∣ding of the Temple, although it was Gods purpose to have it built againe, there was an hundreth and thirteene yeeres before it was finished, after the foun∣dation was laid; First, it was hindered by craft, We will build with you, Ezr. 3. then by bribes, They hired counsellers to weaken the hands of the people, and troubled them in building, Ezr. 4.5. Thirdly, by false accusati∣ones by letters, Ezr. 4.6. Fourthly by force, Ezr. 4.23. Fiftly, by the Kings edict. Ezr. 4.21. Lastly, when they could doe no more they hindred them by taunts, and mocking, if a foxe goe up with his taile, he will destroy this worke. Nehem. 4.3. yet because the Lord had determined to build it, it must be builded, the Counsell of the Lord stands sure for ever, therefore in Zachary it is compared to Mountaines of Brasse, and the gates of hell shall not prevaile against it. The Lord hath chosen Ierusalem, although the Lord made choise of Ierusalem, yet this notable vine which he planted degenerated, Iere. 2.21. and then he rejected it, and brought great desolations upon it, Esay. 29.1. I will make Ierusalem like Ariel; when Ierusalem killed the Prophets then he sprinkled it with blood like Ariel, the Altar which was sprinkled with blood.
Is not this a brand pluckt out of the fire? As if the Lord would say, he is new brought out of the captivity, and therefore no mervell though his cloathes be yet soiled. There are three sorts of wants in the Church, First,Three sorts of wants in the Church. wants of necessity; Secondly, occasionall wants; Thirdly, contracted wants; wants of necessity are these, when God with-draweth the meanes,Wants of necessity what. that the Church cannot have them; when the people were in the Wildernesse, and sacrificed there, they had nei∣ther wine nor oyle to joyne to their sacrifice, yet their sacrifice was accepted, because it was a want of neces∣sity;The anointed of the Lord. so the Highpriest in the second Temple he wan∣ted Vrim, and Thummim, and he wanted the holy oyle, therefore he was not called in the second Temple, Vnc∣tus Iehovae, but vir multarum vestium, the man with the many cloathes, because he had five ornaments belong∣ing to him, which none of the rest of the Priests had, al∣though he wanted this holy oyle yet he was accepted, and his sacrifice, because this was a want of necessity. Secondly, occasionall wants are these, when men for the time cannot so conveniently have their defects supplyed; as Num. 10. Eleazar and Ithamar, when they should have eaten the sinne offering in the holy place; they forgot to eate it, and suffered it to burne, because they were in such griefe for Nadab, and Abihu; Aaron taketh the defence of them in this case, and sayeth such things have befallen me this day, and no mervaile, that both I and my sonnes should have forgotten to eate the sinne offering in the holy place, Num. 10.Occasionall wants what. if wee being in our sinne, should have taken upon us to purge the sinnes of the people, should it have beene accepted in the sight of the Lord? Moses accepteth of this occasion∣all want, because they were in great griefe, it was no mervaile that they forgot to eate it; So they now late∣ly
comming out of the captivity, no mervaile that Ioshua was not so handsomely dressed, as hee should have beene, for in their captivities they contracted much corruption, as in Egypt they forgot their Circumcisi∣on, and that was called opprobrium Egpti, Iosh. 5. Vn∣der Antiochus attrahebant praeputium, for feare they drew the skin of their prepuce that they might not bee knowne to be Iewes,The Israelits learne cor∣ruption in the captivity. and the Apostle alludes to this, Circumcisus es? noli attrahere praputium, 1 Cor. 7.18. And when they were in Babylon they married strange wo∣men; and no mervaile that his cloathes were now soiled and foule when he was lately come out of the captivi∣ty; a man that is newly risen out of the ague, no mervaile that his colour be not good, and if hee be weake and fall, we excuse him. Contracted wants what.Thirdly, there are contracted wants; and these are not excusable; if a man should drinke untill he were drunke, and then stagger and fall, no man will excuse him, as they doe him who falleth through sicknesse; the Lord that excuseth Ioshua here for his occasionall want, he will not excuse Vrijah the Highpriest when he brings the paterne of the Altar of Damascus to Ieru∣salem, 2 King. 18.11. This is a contracted guilt, and not occasionall; when our forefathers came out of popery first, no mervaile that there were great wants amongst them, and that they savoured of the dregges of Rome; but now when we have lived so long out of popery, and yet desire to be backe againe to Egypt, what a shame is that, the Lord will not be beholden to idolatrous Egypt to borrow any thing from her: Christ stands here for the occasionall wants of the Highpriest, but not for the contracted wants; our fathers lived in constituenda ecclesia, and we live in constituta ecclesia, and that which was tolerable in them, may be abhomi∣nation in us: God accepted of their little knowledge
but he craves a greater measure of knowledge of us, because we live in the sunne shine of the day. And he answered and spake to them that stood before him, saying, take away these filthy Garments. And he answered, that is,To answer is to begin to speake. he began to speake accor∣ding to the manner of the Hebrewes, for no speach passed betwixt him and the Angels before. Thomas marketh well that Christ speaketh after one manner to the Angels, and the Angels speake another way to Christ; for when Christ speakes to them, he is sicut agens illuminans & revelans: but when the Angel speakes to Christ, he is Velut passum, admirans, consu∣lens, & accipiens revelationem ab eo. And he spake to those that stood before him. That is, ministred unto him.The Angels serve Christs but attend us. The Angels are ministe∣ring spirits to serve Christ, but they are ministering spirits to attend vs, as a Nurse doth her young infant, they attend not Christ to defend and protect him in danger, for he is their head; they onely Minister to him: therefore when the devill cited the Psalme to Christ, Cast thy selfe downe, for he hath given his Angels charge to keepe thee, this place was falsely cited two wayes by Satan, First, he leaveth out in all thy wayes, Secondly, he applyed it falsely to Christ, they shall keepe thee, this part onely belonged to Christus mysti∣cus, to Christs members, they keepe Christs mem∣bers in all their wayes, but they keepe not Christ him∣selfe; Christ hath procured this their ministery to us, and he is that Ladder, up which they goe up and downe to serve us, Gen 28.12. Take away the filthy garments from him. It may be asked here,  how the Angels could take a∣way Ioshua's filthy garments; seeing they have no hand in our justification or sanctification: Christ the media∣tor justifieth us, and the holy spirit sanctifieth us.
God speakes oftentimes after the manner of men.This is but spoken humanitus, after the manner of men, for as men cause their servants to take away the foule cloathes off the person, which is to be brought before them, and put new apparell upon him, as Ioseph was brought before Pharao; so doth the Lord speake heare after the manner of men. Some parts of Prophe∣sies and visions are not to be expounded literal∣ly.Those parts of visions and Prophecies which seeme contrary to other parts of Scripture, we are not to ex∣pound them literally; but we are to hold that they were onely done in vision. Example, Ieremiah is com∣manded to carry his girdle to Babel, and there to hide it beside Euphrates, Iere. 13.4. these words we cannot expound them literally, but in vision for Ieremiah was never yet in Babel. So we are not to expound the Pro∣phecy literally, when it is contrary to piety, but one∣ly in vision as when Hosea is bidden marry a whore, Hos. 1.2. This was onely in vision; Thirdly, when they are contrary either to decency or good manners, as when Ezekiel is bidden goe naked, and to eate his bread baken with mans doung, Ezek. 4.12, so we are not to take this vision literally, that the Angell did any thing in our sanctification or justification. In the parable of the rich glutton hee desired that Abraham would send Lazarus, that he might dip his finger, & put it upon his tongue; in heaven the glorified soules have no fingers as yet, nor in hel the damned have no tongues yet; but because we cannot conceive spirituall things but by bodily things, therefore it is expressed after this manner; So every knee in heaven and earth shall how, Phil. 2.10. there are no knees in heaven as yet to bow to Christ, but this is spoken to our capacity, for when we would doe homage here below, we bow the knee; so heavenly worship is here figured by earthly gesture. And to him he said, behold I have caused thine inquity to passe from thee, and I will cloath thee with change of ray∣ment:
Pardoning of sinne here is expressed by putting off foule cloathes, and putting on a new garment. The Lord delightes to see his Priests cloathed in ho∣linesse, Psal. 122.16. and to put on righteousnesse as a gar∣ment, Iob. 29.14. Sacerdos.  sponsus. and the Hebrewes observe that Co∣hen a Priest, and Cahan a Bridgroome come both from one roote, because the Priest when he commeth be∣fore the Lord, should be adorned like the bridgroome; the Apostle saith, That as many as were baptized into Christ, have put on Christ; Galat. 3.27. which is a speech borrowed from the custome used in the primitive Church; for those who were Adulti or come to age,The custome in the Pri∣mitive Church, when they baptized those that were come to age. when they were to be baptized, came to the Church the Sunday before the Pascha, and put upon them white cloathes, therefore the day was called Dominica in albis, and they were called candidati; if white cloathes and holinesse becommeth every Christian, when he ente∣reth into Christianity, how much more should Prea∣chers study to put on righteousnesse when they enter to this holy calling; but many now dare be bold to come in before the Lord with their soiled, and filthy cloathes, as if they had lyen amongst the pots of E∣gypt.Foure sorts of Gar∣ments unbeseeming a Minister. Secondly, some come in, and they have not these mutatorius vestes, changed apparell, but they had rather superindui, to put one some shew of holinesse above, but not to lay aside their old sinnes. They make the outside of the platter cleane, but within it is full of un∣cleannesse, Matth. 23, 25. Thirdly, others come in with their garment of Lin∣sey-Woolsey before the Lord, ye shall not know of what profession they are, like Sceptikes doubting of all things, now standing for popery, now for the truth, now broching this heresie, now that. Fourthly, some come in before the Lord with their
wollen cloathes, the Lord by Ezekiel, cap. 44. com∣mandeth expressely that the Priests should weare no wooll in the sanctuary but linnen, and out of the san∣ctuary when they were about their secular affaires no linnen but wooll, and therefore the Iewes proverb was when they saw a worldly minded Priest, they said, there goeth the man with the wollen cloathes; Ministers, of all men, should study to have their cloathes cleane, and see that their garments be not spotted with the flesh, Iud. 23.Great purity required in Ministers. It was a great change in Israel, when the Nazarits who were purer then snow, whiter then milke, more rud∣dy in body then rubies; when they became blacker then a coale, Lamen. 4.7. So now it is a great change, when Ministers whose Garments should be pure and holy, shining as the wings of a dove covered with silver, and like her feathers covered with yeallow gold, come in as though they had lien among the pots, Psal. 68.13. Many now that should come in Candidati before the Lord, are fettered and intangled with the affaires of the world, yea they come in Loadened with thicke clay, Habak. cha. 2.6. having greater care to heape up gold then to gather grace to uphold them in the day of their tri∣all; when Satan shall accuse them, for being cloathed with filthy garments, as hee did Ioshua the Highpriest here. And I will cloathe thee with change of raiment. Ioshua's sinnes being pardoned already, how is his sinne pardoned anew againe? There is our totall justification, and our partiall justi∣fication; Ioshua had his totall justification before; but this was his partiall justification;Iustificate totalis partialis. God pardoned him those sinnes which hindered him in his Priestly office: an ex∣ample, not unlike unto this we have, Esay 6.7. When the Seraphim came with a coale and touched the lippes of Esay, this was his partiall justification when he par∣doned
him those sinnes which hindred him in his cal∣ling, Esay 6. But ye will say;  get we not the remission of all our sinnes, simul & semel. Although all sinnes both by past and to come are re∣mitted to the child of God in Gods eternall counsaile,  Whether we get remis∣sion of all our sinnes si∣mul et semel. yet the sinnes not yet committed, when they are com∣mitted; and repented of in our sense and feeling, then they are pardoned when we feele them to be pardoned, Peccata praeterita remittuntur per formalem applicationem (as they speake in the Schooles) futura vero virtualiter tantum; praeterita insese, futura in subjecto vel persona pec∣cante. And I said, let them set a faire crowne upon his head. God never beginneth a worke but he perfecteth it;God never beginneth a worke but that which he perfecteth. this we see in the worke of creation. God rested not untill he had finished all his workes, so in the worke of his providence, Psal. 65.11. Thou crownest the yeere with thy goodnesse. Thirdly, in the worke of redemption, Christ left not off this worke till he said consummatum est. Fourthly, in the worke of sanctification, Phil. 3.6. He that hath begun a good worke in you will performe it un∣till the day of Iesus Christ. The Lord bringeth to per∣fecton every good worke begun in us, he is not like the man in the Gospel; who began to build a house, but was not able to finish it. This is a great comfort to the children of God, who find many impediments in the worke of their sanctifica∣tion; the child of God saith sometimes with Rebecka, Gen. 25.22. It had been better for me,The comforts of the children of God. never to have conceived; he feeleth the flesh striving against the spi∣rit, as Iacob and Esau in their mothers belly, and some∣time he feeleth the messenger of Satan buffetting him, and hanging so fast on, and fettering him by the way, that in his owne sense and feeling, he thinkes this worke
will never be finished, but yet he may take heart to him in this, as God brought home Ioshua out of the capti∣vity, cloathed him with change of apparell, and lastly, put the crowne upon his head; so shall the Lord finish that good worke which he hath begun in us, Philip. 1.6. The difference betwixt the Kings Crowne and the Priests.  corona regis.They put a Crowne upon his head. The Kings Crowne differed from the Priests crowne; First in name, the Kings Crowne was called, Gnaterah, the Priests was called Mitznephath; Secondly, in the matter, the Kings Crowne was of pure gold; the Priests was fascia, cidaris vel corona sacerdotis, Exod. 28.4. of silke mixed with gold, and it was called tiara. Thirdly, they differed in the forme; and lastly, in the use, the Kings Crowne was typicall, and civill also for government in things civill; the Priests was onely typicall. Secondly, the things that were joy∣ned with the Priests Crowne were more vive types of Christ, then the Kings Crowne was; for his Bells typed Christs propheticall office, his white garments his Priestly office, and the Crowne his Kingly office; he was a more vive representation of Christ, than the King was. And they put a Crowne upon his head. There are three sorts of crownes; first, the crowne of profession,Three sorts of crownes. common to all Christians, Revelat. 3.11. Hold fast that thou hast, let no man take thy Crowne. Se∣condly, a ministeriall crowne which belongeth to faith∣full Pastors, Phil. 4.1. Therefore my brethren, my joy and crowne. So 1 Thess. 2.19. And thirdly, the Crowne of glory, 1 Pet. 5.4. The crowne of the Pastor, is his peo∣ple converted by him, Prov 17.6. Childrens children are the crowne of old men, [Gnatereth] corona, commeth from [Gnatur] cingere, 1 Sam. 24.23. When Saul and his men invironed David, then they are said [Gnatar] cingere; when the Grandfather hath his childrens chil∣dren
compassing him about, what a crowne is that for him? so a Ministers crowne shall be this,Simile. when his people converted by him, stands about him like a crowne; The Priest under the Law in the time of his dayes, laid aside his crowne, Ezek. 24.17. and in time of joy and gladnesse, put it on againe. Many now a griefe may lay aside their crowne, and trample it upon the ground, for griefe that they have been so negligent in their Calling. What joy can a man have when hee remembreth his great negligence in his ministery, and sloth in the Lords businesse? he should not be so neg∣ligent if he would alwayes remember that last crowne of glory which the chiefe Shepheard shall give, 1 Pet. 5.4. A crowne that fadeth not away, The crownes be∣low here, wherewith men were crowned, were made of grasse, of Lawrell trees, of linnen, of wooll, and the best of them but of gold, which all are fading crownes, but this crowne is ,, immarces∣sibilis, nunquam marces∣cens; item flos quidam sic dictus quod non mar∣cescat, sed decerptus asservetur, & cum cuncti flores defecere, madefactus aqua, revi∣viscat, Plinius lib. 2. cap. 11. an incorruptible and durable crowne that cannot fade nor vanish away. So they set a Mitre upon his head, or a crowne upon his head. After that Ioshua, by the assistance of the An∣gel, had resisted Satan, given him the foyle, and had got∣ten the victory, the Lord in signe of this victory, and to confirme Ioshua in the Priesthood, after hee retur∣ned from the captivity, setteth a crowne upon his head. This is a great comfort to all Christians, but chiefly to faithfull Ministers, that although they suffer persecu∣tion, be carried, as it were, into captivity, accused by Satan and the wicked in the world, yet if they constant∣ly stand out and resist Satan, and stop the mouthes of those wicked instruments of his, by their good life and holy conversation, they may be assured the Lord will
give them a crowne, even the Crowne of life, Revel. 2.10. Feare none of those things which thou shalt suffer; be∣hold the Divell shall cast some of you into prison, that yee may be tryed, and ye shall have tribulation ten dayes: be thou faithfull unto the death, and I will give thee a Crowne of life.
Of the eating of holy things. Levit. 22.10. There shall no stranger eate of the holy thing: a soourner of the Priest, or an hired servant, shall not eate of the holy thing: But if the Priest buy any soule with his money, he shall eat of it, &c. THe LORD made a twofold distinction of meates under the Law. First, of cleane and uncleane meates, and that is taken away now; for to the cleane all things are cleane, Titus. 1.15. The Hebrewes call that which is uncleane [Piggul] a polluted thing, that is, Abhominatio res abhominanda, pro∣prie dicitur de carne faetoris & coloris tetri. a thing that is ea∣ten after the time; and Aquila translateth it , that is, a thing to be rejected or refused; And the Apostle useth the same word when he is speaking of meates, that nothing is , to be refused, if it be recei∣ved with thankesgiving, 1 Tim. 4.4. The second distinction of meates was this, some were cleane by the Law, but yet if they were eaten by persons who had no right to eat them, then they were uncleane to them; Thirdly, if they eate them not in the appointed place; and fourthly, if they eat them not in due time. First, somethings the Priests might eate and their sonnes, but not their daughters, Num. 18.9. Here we must marke a difference betwixt the legall promises, and the spirituall promises; the legall pro∣mise is, the Priests and his sonnes shall eate of it, but not their daughters; but the spirituall promises are made to them and to their children, and to all that are a farre off,
even as many as the Lord our God shall call, Acts chapter 2. verse 39. The difference betwixt the legall promises, and Evangelicall promises.Secondly, the legall promise was made to the Priests and their sonnes, but not to their daughters; but in the spirituall promises there is no difference betwixt male and female Galat. 3.18. There were other things that their daughters might eate of, as well as their sonnes, and the servant that was bought with money, or borne in the house, and the Priests daughter who was a Widdow, or divorced, and returned to her father againe, having no chil∣dren, all these might eate of the lesse holy things, Lev. 22.11, 12 A difference betwixt the morall and cere∣moniall Law.Observe first a difference betwixt the morall Law and the ceremoniall; the morall Law putteth no dif∣ference in the worship of God betwixt the sonne, the daughter, the man-servant, nor the maid-servant, nor the stranger, Exod. 22.10. but the ceremoniall Law al∣loweth the Priest to eate, his sonne to eate, his daugh∣ter to eate, his servant bought with his money to eate, and his servant borne in the house to eate, but not the stranger, Levit. 22.10, 11, 12. Why the servant borne within the house and bought with the money, might eat the holy things.Againe, the servant that was bought with his mony, and he that was borne in the house might eate, to signifie unto us, that they who are borne within the covenant, & they who are bought with the price of Christs blood, although strangers before, are parta∣kers of Christs sacrifice; but these who are strangers still, are not partakers of his holy body. The Priests daughter when she returned home to her father againe, might eate of these lesse holy things; so we being mar∣ried to the law, and it having dominion over us, Rom. 7, 1. we were out of our fathers house, and might not eate of this holy bread; but being dead to the law, Rom. 7.4. and divorced from our sinnes, as Widdowes,
we may come home to our fathers house, and be par∣takers of the holy things. Secondly,What things the Priest and his sons might eat. what things the Priest and his sonnes might eate; that which was ignitum Iehovae, the sacri∣fice which was burnt to the Lord by fire, as the sinne of∣fering and the Trespasse offering, the Priest and his sonnes might eate of them, but not his daughters; so the Shewbread, Levit. 24.9. and it (the Shewbread) shall be Aarons and his sonnes, and they shall eate it in the holy place; for it is most holy unto him, of the offerings of the Lord made by fire. The Priest and his sonnes might onely eate of the Shewbread, but not his daughters, but in neces∣sity others might eate of it as well as the Priest and his sonnes, as David and his men in necessity eate of it, 1 Sam. 21.6. if they might eate of it in necessity, much more might the Priests wife and his daughter in their necessity eate of it. When the Priest asked David whether his men were cleane or not, that they might eate of the Shewbread;  whether might he have given them that bread in the time of their uncleannesse to eate of it in their necessity or not? If it had beene in extreame necessity,  he might have given them of this bread to eate, to save their lives, although they had beene in their uncleannesse; but he could not have given them it in their lesse necessity, when they were uncleane. The Iewes have a rule,A rule of the Iewes. where thou findest a com∣mand to doe a thing, and a prohibition to forbid a thing, and they both cannot be kept, then thou must leave the negative and fellow the affirmative. Exam∣ple, a Nazarite is forbidden to shave his haire, and the Leper is commanded to shave his haire. Now when a Nazarite becomes a Leper, which of these two shall
he follow; hee shall leave the negative precept which commanded him, not to shave his haire, and he shall follow the affirmative, and shall shave his haire. So the Priest is forbidden to give his daughter any of the Shewbread, againe he is commanded to provide for his family, now his daughter is like to sterve for hun∣ger, which of those two shall he follow; he is to fol∣low the affirmative here, and to leave the negative. So in the Sabbath, &c. The Place where they eate the holy things.Thirdly, the place where they were to eate the ho∣ly things: some things they were to eate by the Altar, that is, in the Chambers of the Priests hard by the Al∣tar, some they were to eate in Ierusalem, and some they were to eate in any part of Canaan. Some things they were to eate in the Chambers nere the Altar, Ezek. 42.14, those things in Levit. 10.12. they are said to eate at the Altar. When Ezekiel describeth the Temple here, he mea∣neth the Temple under Christ, and the maintenance of the ministery under the Gospel, as the Priests who served at the Altar under the law, eate of the rest of the sacrifice in their Chambers: so the ministers under the Gospell should be maintained now. 1 Cor. 9.13. Secondly, the lesse holy things they eate them in Ie∣rusalem, the Paschall Lambe was eaten within Ierusa∣lem, and not in the Temple, therefore it was of those lesse holy things. The Paschall Lambe being the chiefe thing that re∣presented Christ, how is it reckoned amongst the lesse holy things? Why the Passeover was reckoned a lesse holy thing.It was reckoned amongst the lesse holy things, be∣cause there was little of it burnt, but it was eaten by the people. Secondly, it could not be eaten as a Sacrament in the Temple, for the distinction of the families, that must eate it severally, they all could not eat it in the
Temple. So the first Tithe was but a common holy thing, or lesse holy, and it might be eaten any where, but the second tithe was the more holy tithe, and there∣fore behoved to be eaten in the Temple before the Lord. Lastly, when they might eat it. Somethings they were bound to eate the selfe same day that the things were offred,When they were to eat the holy things. as the flesh of the sacri∣fice of the peaceoffering, Levit. 7.15. some things might be eaten that same day that they were offered, or upon the morrow, as the sacrifice of the vow, or a free∣will offering, Levit. 7.16. But they might eate none of the flesh of the Sacrifice upon the third day after it was offe∣red, but it was to be burnt with fire, Levit. 7.17, 18. Now time, place, distinction of persons,No meat of it selfe un∣cleane. and distincti∣ons of meats are all taken away, and it entereth not in at the mouth which defileth a man, but that which com∣meth out of the mouth defileth him, Matth. 15.11. there is no meat now, that is uncleane in it selfe, but it be∣commeth uncleane to them that receive it not with pure hearts, Tit. 1.15. Vnto the pure, all things are pure, but unto them that are defiled and unbelieving, is no∣thing pure; but even their mind, and conscience is defiled, and every creature of God is good, if it be received with thanksgiving. 1 Tim. 4 4.
Of pollution by the dead. Num. 29.11. He that toucheth the dead body of any man, shall be uncleane seven dayes. THe pollution of man above other crea∣tures,Man more uncleane than any other creature. sheweth the effects of sinne which causeth death, Rom. 6.23. Hee that tou∣ched a dead beast was but uncleane untill the even, Levit. 11.24. but he that touched a dead man, was uncleane for seven dayes. So he that tou∣the grave or the bones of a dead man was uncleane, and therfore they were cōmanded to bury the bones of the dead, when they found them in the way. Ezek. 39.15. And the passengers that passe through the land, when any seeth a mans bone, then shall he set up a signe by it, till the bu∣riers come and bury it. This signified such as were dead in trespasses and sinnes, Eph. 2.1. and such as have their con∣sciences defiled by dead workes, Heb. 9.13.14. those are un∣cleane. What the legall pollu∣tions taught the Iewes.And those legall pollutions taught the people of God how carefull they should be that they defile not themselves with sinne, or communion with dead and sinnefull workes as the Apostle saith, touch no uncleane thing, 2 Cor. 6.17. and be not partakers of other mens sins, keepe thy selfe pure, 1 Tim. 5.22. The Iewes adde to ma∣ny of the Lawes of God.Whosoever toucheth one that is slaine with a sword in the open fields, shall be uncleane seven dayes, Num. 19.16. And the Iewes adde, he that toucheth the sword which killed the man, shall be uncleane; but this is an addi∣tion of their owne. So the Lord commanded that the Nazarit should drinke no wine, & they adde, nor come
nere unto a Vineyard. So the Lord commanded that they should not cary burdens upon the Sabbath, Iere. 17. but they added, that it was not lawfull for a sick man to take up his bed upon the Sabbath. Ioh. 5. So the Lord commanded that they should goe no further but a Sabbath dayes journey upon the Sabbath, but they added that it was not lawfull to stirre out of the place upon the Sabbath. So the Lord commanded them that they should abstaine from the drinke offerings of the heathen; but they added that they should abstaine from the wine of the Gentils. So here the Lord saith that Whosoever toucheth one that is slaine with a sword, shall be uncleane untill the even. But they adde, whosoever shall touch the sword which killed the man, shall bee uncleane untill the even. The touching of the bodies of the dead shewes us what unregenerate men are in the sight of God, they are dead while they are alive. 1 Tim. 5.6. they are like rotten graves, their throte is an open sepulchre, Rom. 3.13. and they are like whited Sepulchres which indeed appeare beutifull outwardly, but within are full of dead mens bones, and all uncleannesse, Matth. 23.27. What are we to thinke of the bodies of the Saints,  when they are lying in the grave, whether are their bodies, corpora pura, or impura? They are neither corpora pura, nor impura,Whether the dead bo∣dies of the Saints in the grave be pure or not. sed non pu∣ra; they are not impura, because their sinnes are par∣doned; they are not pura, because they are as yet under the corruption and punishment of sinne, but the wic∣ked, who lye downe with their sinnes in the dust, their bodies are impura, filthy and uncleane. The bodies of the Saints being not impura, there∣fore the soules of the glorified might come to such bo∣dies againe, as Moses in the transfiguration was there in soule and body, his glorified soule came to his body
againe, because it was not a sinnefull body now, but a body lyeing under corruption as yet, but when Laza∣rus soule returned to his body, we must not thinke that Lazarus soule was a glorified soule (for a glorified soule returneth not to a sinful body to dwel in it againe) but the vinon betwixt the soule and the body was loo∣sed at this time,A difference betwixt the glorified soules, and sinfull soules, enioning into their bodies againe, Sumus de purgatorie. and the soule was still in the sinfull body, tanquam in sede, non tanquam in organo, that is, it was still in the body, although it did not animate the body. Whether did he Iewes commit sinne when they tou∣ched a dead body or not? There was irregularitas here, sed non peccatum, for for there is not a sinne where there is not a law forbid∣ding it,In what case the Iewes sinned when they tou∣ched a dead body. for sinne is the transgressing of the Law. The Lord saith not, yee shall not touch the dead, but he saith, he that toucheth the dead shall be uncleane untill the even, Then there is a Commandement added, that a cleane person shall sprinkle him with water upon the third day, and upon the seventh, Num. 19.19. So that al∣though he be not commanded, not to touch the dead, yet if he have touched the dead, he is commanded to wash himselfe. So there is not a Commandement for∣bidding a man to touch a Leper, but if he had touched a Leper there was a Commandement given that he should not enter into the congregation untill he was purifieth, and if he did enter before he was puri∣fieth, he transgressed the Comman∣dement and sinned.
The comforts in Death. Eccles. 7.1 Better is the day of death than the day of ones birth. IN the former part of this verse, the Preacher sheweth,The cosion of the words. that a good name is better than pre∣tious oyntment, and then he subjoyneth, bet∣ter is the day of death, than the day of ones birth, as if he should say, a mans good name and his report is better knowne after his death, than when he is alive, and then his good name smelleth like the Wine of Le∣banon, which in his life time may be many wayes blot∣ted. He preferreth the day of our death to the day of our birth, and hee saith, that the day of our death is bet∣ter. A thing is said to be [better] sundry wayes,One thing is said to be better then an other sundry wayes. first it may be better in it selfe; but not to the person; so it is said, that it had beene better that Iudas had never beene borne, it made more for the glory of God that Iudas was borne, but it was not better for himselfe. Secondly, things are said to be better, when they seeme to be better to a carnall and corrupt man, as hee saith, that a living dog is better than a dead Lyon, Eccles. 9.4. that is, he had rather live in a base estate here, than to be in best account amongst the dead. Thirdly, some things are better for this present estate and condition of life than others, as better is a dinner of hearbes where love is, than a stalled Oxe and hatred there∣with, Prov. 15.17. Fourthly, some things are better for a man in the state of grace, and for his soule, as it is better to be a doore
keeper in the house of God, than to dwell in the tents of wic∣ked men,One thing is said to bee better then another comparatively. Psal. 84.1. So it is better to goe to the house of mourning, than to the house of feasting; and, sorrow is bet∣ter than laughter, Eccles. 7.2, 3. So, the day of a mans death, is better than the day of his birth. Next, let us consider, why the day of death is better than the day of ones birth; because, man is borne unto trouble, as the sparkes flye upward, Iob 5.7. but the day of his death, is the end of all his miseries, and therefore is properly called, mans day, Iob 18.20. The day of a mans death is better then the day of his birth, Luc. 2.29. Now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, 1 Sam. 28.15. Why hast thou troubled me? Iob 3.13. For now should I have lien still and beene quiet, I should have slept; then should I have beene at rest. The Councell of Toledo marketh that Christ wept not at Lazarus death, but at his resurrecti∣on; and this should teach us to moderate our griefe when our friends dye, and those whom we love best, If ye love me, saith Christ, yee will rejoyce, because I goe to my father, Ioh. 14.28. So we should rejoyce when wee see our friends goe to our Father, and count the day of their death better then the day of their birth. The day of death is worse to the wicked.The day of a mans death, is better than the day of his birth, to the children of God it is better, but to the wic∣ked, it is much worse; the child of God saith in his death, as Christ said, consummatum est, then all teares are wipt from their eyes; but to the wicked, it is their worst day, as the child of God saith, consummatum est, so they say, inchoatum est, Luc. 16.25. Remember that thou in thy life time receivedst thy good things, and Laza∣rus his evill things, but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented. Death is worse to the wicked man, there∣fore his death is called, the death of the uncircumcised, Ezek. 28.12. and he dyeth as a foole, 2 Sam. 3.33. but the children of God die in the Lord, and their death is their rest.
It may seeme, that to be borne is better than death,  Ioh, 16.20. A woman when she is in travell, hath sorrow, because her houre is come, but assoone as she is delivered of the child, she remembreth no more the anguish, for joy that a man is borne into the world. She rejoyceth that she hath brought forth a Sonne, but we rejoyce not when one dyeth, therefore it may seeme that the day of ones birth is better then the day of his death. It is better for the woman that she hath a child borne for the continuation of her posterity,  and therfore she re∣joyceth; but the day of the childs death is better for himselfe than the day of his birth, because then there is an end put to all his miseries. In what case may a man choose death rather then life? We may chiefely choose death rather then life one∣ly to be rid of sinne, as Paul desired,  to depart and to be with Christ. Phil. 1.23. but this was onely to be deli∣vered from the body of sinne; to prevent sinne, it is better not to be, than to be, Eccles. 4.3. for he hath not seene the evill worke which is done under the Sunne: Againe, it is better for reprobates that they had never beene because of their damnation, as it is said of Iudas, It had beene better for him that he had never beene borne. Matth. 26.21. and it is better to be dead then living, that a man may be freed of sinne. There is esse Physicum & esse morale; it is better for a wicked man to be, than not to be, ratione Physica; because he commeth nearer to God who hath his being of himselfe; but it is worse to him, quoad esse morale, & magis optandum non esse, cum carentia poena, quam esse cum poena, that is, it is bet∣ter for him not to be, & without punishment, than to be, and be punished eternally. There is in man instinct, reason, and faith; instinct teacheth him onely to seeke the preservation of his body; reason goeth somewhat higher, and hath some respect to vertue and honor,
but yet it is not a right guide to man here, when hee wisheth to be dead for feare of shame and such world∣ly inconvenients;Stoici ne foedetur vir∣tus, & Romani ob ina∣nem gloriam mortem optarunt. but faith seeth farther, and wisheth this dissolution, because it knoweth that the body and the soule shall be joyned together againe after they are separated and purified from sinne. A man must not wish death, or the grave although, he be bitter in soule, Iob. 3.20. and afflictions be upon him, but onely for sinne. If it be said, death destroyeth the substance of man, but sinne destroyeth onely an accident in man?  there∣fore death should not be desired for the eschewing of sinne. Death is not a totall destruction of a man, neither is a man turned into nothing when he dyeth, neither wisheth he death that he may not be, but that this Ta∣bernacle may be dissolved, that he may have, A buil∣ding of God, an house not made with hands, eternall in the heavens. 2 Cor. 5.1. Observe that men looke diversly upon death. First, as it is an enemy to nature, and so all men abhorre it. And the naturall man in this respect calleth it a bitter death, 1 Sam. 15.3. Hagag said, Surely the bitternesse of death is past. Secondly, some looke upon it as the wages of sinne, Rom. 6.32. then it is a more bitter death, and thirdly, some looke upon it as a passage to life, and then it is to be wished, but not for it selfe, but for ano∣ther end, as when a sicke man desireth a bitter potion for his healths sake; for no evill of punishment is to be desired for it selfe. There are two periods set downe here, our birth, and our death, and not our life. It is the manner of the spirit of God in the Scriptures to set downe the two extremes, and to leave out the midst, as Psal. 21.8. the Lord shall keepe thy going in, and going out, that is all
thy wayes, so Exod. 8.11.5. And all the first borne of the land of Egypt shall dye from the first borne of Pharaoh that fitteth upon the throne, unto the first borne of the Maidser∣vant, that sitteth behind the Mill, here the rest of the people are left out for shortnesse, and the two extremes are expressed, so Num. 6.4. from the kernell to the huske, here the wine which is the midst is left out, so Iob. 24.20. The wombe shall forget him, and the wormes shall feede sweetly upon him, here the birth and the grave in∣clude the whole life. So here are set downe our birth and our death our two graves, the grave out of which we come and the grave unto which we goe; Iob joy∣neth these two together, Naked came I out of my Mo∣thers wombe, and naked shall I returne thither, Iob. 1.21. he was not to returne backe to his Mothers wombe a∣gaine, but he was to returne backe to the grave againe the second wombe, and Christ joyneth the belly and the grave, Matth. 1.4. For as Ionas was three dayes and three night, in the Whales belly. So shall the some of man be three dayes and three nights in the heart of the earth, hence it is that the inferior parts of the earth are both called the Mothers wombe, and the grave, Psal. 139.15. My substance was curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth, that is in my Mothers wombe, and as no man hateth the belly that conceived and bred him; so no man should hate the grave which is his second mother. He marketh the two extremes here the birth and the death, and passeth by our life, to teach us the short∣nesse of our life, the Scripture describeth the shortnesse of mans life sundry wayes? First, he calleth our dayes anni numeri, that is, which may bee easily numbered, Iob. 16.22. when a few yeeres are come (yeeres of num∣ber) than I shall go the way, whence I shal not returne, so dies numeri signifie a few dayes, Num. 19.20, so
homines numeri, a few men, Deut. 4.27. So Ezek. 12.16. and Esay. 10.19. The rest of the trees of his forrest shall be number, that a child may write them, that is, they shall be few, and here Iob saith, When yeeres of number are come, that is, a few yeeres that may be easily numbered, to note the shortnesse of his dayes. Secondly, our life is called saeculum, Psal. 17.14. Thirdly, our yeeres are re∣duced to three score and tenne, and if by reason of strength, they be fourescore, yet is their strength labour and sorrow, for it is soone cut off, and we flye away; if a man out live threescore and ten, he payeth interest for those yeeres, much sorrow and griefe. Then our yeeres are compared to the dayes of an hire∣ling, Iob. 7.1. which was a short time, the yeres of an hir∣ling were but three yeeres, and the Lord to shew the suddaine destruction that should come upon Moah, he saith, Esay. 16.14. Within three yeeres, as the yeeres of an hirling, and the glory of Moab shall be contemned, that is, it shall shortly be contemned, so Iob saith, his dayes are like the dayes of an hireling, that is, they are very short. They are compared to monthes, Iob. 14.5. the number of his monthes are with thee. Then they are compa∣red to dayes, and to an artificiall day from the sunneri∣sing, to the setting of the Sunne, they are like grasse which groweth up, in the evening it is cut down and whitereth, Ps. 90.6. and to a watch in the night, which was but three or foure houres, vers. 4. then they are compared to an houre, then to a moment, and last to nothing, Psal. 39.5. So our yeeres for the shortnesse of them are compa∣red to a post, Iob. 25. Now my dayes are swifter than a post, they flyaway & see no good, they are passed away as the swift ships, as the Eagle that hasteneth to her pray, Marke the gradation here. First, Iob compareth his dayes, to a post, a post goeth on in his journey very swiftly, when
one horse wearieth he will take another, and so goeth on; but yet he must rest sometimes: Therefore hee goeth further and compareth them to the swiftest ships, that are called ships of desire, the ship will not weary day nor night, yet there may come a contrary winde and make her stay; therefore he goeth higher, and he compareth his dayes to the Eagle, which of all fowles is the swiftest to catch pray, and nothing can stay her untill she have obtained it. So mans dayes wearies not, nothing can stay them in their course, but they flye a∣way, and hasten to their end. So mans life is compared to the weavers shitle, Iob. 7.6. this comparison would be marked, for the shuttle carieth the threed within it, and the weaver tosseth the shuttle too and fro untill the threed be spent, and then he cuteth it off. So time is the weaver that tosseth the shuttle, and our dayes are as the threed within the shut∣tle, which peece and peece are spent, and then death cutteth them off. So they are compared to a smoke and to a dreame, or to a vapour, Psal. 49. or to the breath of ones mouth, and to this the Apostle hath reference, when he saith, what is your life? it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away, Iam. 4.4, Now that our death may be comfortable unto us; first, we must remember that we are mortall, Gen. 2.17. In that day that thou eatest thereof, thou shalt dye the death, Symachus translateth it, Mortalis eris, the consideration of mortalitie in Abraham, made him to say that he was but dust and ashes, Gen. 78.27. It is appointed unto men once to dye, but after this the judgement, Heb. 9.17. If men dyed not, they could not obtaine life eternall, for flesh and blood cannot inherit the Kingdome of God, neither doth corruption inherit incorruption, therefore we must either die, or be changed; And this corruptible must put on in∣corruption,
and this mortall must put on immortality, and then we need not to be afraid of death, for it shall be swallowed up in victory, 1 Cor. 15.50. as the Wise man saith, Ecclus 14.12. Remember that death is not long in comming, and that the covenant of the Grave is not shewed unto thee; The Lord sheweth unto us that we are all mortall, and that we must dye, but he sheweth not in particular the time when we shall dye, and therefore we should be ready at all times. Secondly, remember the advertisements of death, when thou art faint and weary, those are Gentlemen Vshers to death, when yee feele those messengers, re∣member that the sound of their Masters feet is behind them, cincinni, sic dicti quod facile mu∣tantur a  mutabit. 2 King. 6.32. We are called in the Scriptures, [bene hhaloph] Prov, 31.8. Children of change; and the lockes of our haire are called [mahhaliphoth] mutatio∣nes Iudg 16.13. because they are soone changed, when our haire beginneth to change once, that is an advertise∣ment to death, as the wise man saith; but many men take no notice of those advertisements, when a Sergeant commeth to arrest a man, the man absenteth himselfe, and will not seeme to be at home; yet notwithstan∣ding the arrestment is valide, and holdeth good in the Law: so those advertisements of death, although thou neglect them, and seemest not to be at home, yet the arrestment shall hold good, and thou shalt be en∣forced to answer at the day appointed. Thirdly, looke upō the death of others, for that he loo∣keth seriously upon the death of others, he cannot chuse but that he must remember his mortality, 2 Sam. 20.12. When Amasa was wallowing in his blood, all the peo∣ple stood still and lookt upon him; when people be∣hold the death of others, then it should put them in minde of their owne death. Fourthly, acquaint thy selfe often with death, that it
seeme not a stranger to thee when it commeth, Hierome set the skull of a dead man before him daily, and the Anchorites of old scraped with their nailes some part of their owne grave every day; Put not the evill day farre from thee, Esay 22.12. When the Lord called the Iewes to mourning, yet they put the evill day farre from them, and they said, Let us eate, let us drinke, for tomor∣row wee shall die, 1 Cor. 15.32. Many men live now as though they should never dye, they make a covenant with death, as the Prophet saith Esay 28.16. We have made a covenant with death, and with hell are we at agree∣ment. But they are deceived, death is unmercifull, it will mak a league with no man, this league is made only in the imagination of their owne hearts. Fiftly, consider the comforts which we have against the grave, it is very terrible in it selfe, it is called a pit, Esa 38.18. darknesse and the Land of oblivion, Psal. 88.13. The shadow of death, Iob, 10.21. corruption and de∣struction, and for the power of it, it is said to have gates and doores, Iob 38.13. and a soule, Esay 5.14. dilatat sepul∣chrum animam suam. [Hirhhibbah sheol naphshah] the grave hath enlarged her soule; so to have hands Psal. 49.16 and 89.49. so to have a mouth, Ps. 141.7, so a sting 1 Cor. 15.55. all those Epithites are to shew how terrible and fearefull it is to a wicked impenitent sinner who lyeth down in it with his sins upon him, but to the godly it is , a sleeping place; it is a place that all men, yea even the best must come into, Iacob made account to go thither Gen. 37.35. and Iob desired to be there; O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, Iob 14.13. Because he knew that it was his house, Iob. 17.13. Yea Christ himselfe was there, and sanctified it, first he bought the grave, the price of him that was valued, after that Iudas had cast it backe againe, was gi∣ven for a potters field, for the buriall of strangers, this is the first right which gentiles have to the grave,
because Christ purchased it unto them. Againe Christ was buried in Golgotha where his blood ranne downe upon the graves of the dead that were buried there. Thirdly, he hath lyen downe in it, and whereas it was loathsome before, now he hath persumed it, so that we may safely lye downe in that bed in which his blessed body lay; and lastly he hath the key of the grave, to open it when hee pleaseth so that it hath no power to keepe us. Revela. 1.18. I have the keyes of hell and of death, this is a singular comfort to us then who are the Children of God, so that we may say better is the day of our death than the day of our birth. Sixtly; wee should remember that our dead bodies are within the covenant, and the Lord forgetteth them not: When Iacob went downe to Egypt the Lord pro∣mised to bring him backe againe, Gen. 46.4. but how did the Lord bring him backe againe, seeing he dyed in Egypt? The Lord was with him when his bones were brought out of Egypt: so the Lord preserveth all the bodies of his Saints, and he keepeth all their bones, Psal. 34.20. yea even when they are in the grave, because they are within the Covenant, therefore it is called, domus viventium, the house of the living. Lastly, that our death may be comfortable unto us, let us remember that it doth not onely put an end to our miseries in this life, but it is the entrance to glory and everlasting happinesse, where we shall see the Lord and his Angels, and abide with them eternally; Moses is renowned unto the worlds end, because hee saw the Lords backe parts onely; but we shall not onely see his backeparts, but we shall see him as he is, even face to face, 1 Iohn 3.2. 1 Cor. 13.12. The Queene of Sheba heard many things of Salomon, and yet the halfe was not told her, but when shee saw him face to face, then shee said, Happy are thy men, happy are thy servants that stand conti∣nually
before thee, 1 King. 10.8. So in this life wee heare many things of Christ the true Salomon and his king∣dome, but yet the halfe are not told us, for the eye hath not seene, nor eare heard, neither have entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him, 1 Cor. 2.9. But at the day of our death when our soule shall be separated from our bodies, then wee shall see these things, and shall say with the Queene of Sheba, happy are thy men, happy are thy servants that stand continually before thee; and blessed are the dead that die in the Lord, Revel. 14.13. If wee con∣sider these things seriously, wee shal be inforced to conclude with Salo∣mon here, better is the day of death, thā the day that one is borne. Errata. Pag. 32. line 6 for Ezek. r.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE COLENE, EARLE OF SEAFORT, Lord Mackenzee and Kintaill, one of his MAIESTIES most Honorable Privie Councell in the Kingdome of Scotland. Honorable and my very good Lord, GOD who is the God of order and not of con∣fusion, from whom all good things descend, hath placed here below sundry sorts of people;Prov. 30.25.26.27.28 the Ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the Sum∣mer;
the Conies are but a feeble folke, yet make they their houses in the Rocks; the Locusts haue no King, yet goe they forth all of them by bands; the Spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in Kings palaces; this sort of people dif∣fer very much, for some of them are , which provide onely for the present day, but lay up nothing against the morrow; the Gras∣hopper provideth not against the winter as the Ant doth; there are others of them who liue by rapine, as the Caterpillers who devour all and then flie away;Nahum 3.16. and Nahum compareth the Mer∣chants of Ninive to these, that carry all the wealth away with them; and there are some of those people which are insatiable, as the Horsleach, that hath two daughters who cry continually,Prov. 30.15. Giue, giue; This sort of people are governed by instinct onely; the Locusts haue no King, yet they goe out in bands; the Ant hath no guide,Prov. 6.7. overseer, or ruler, yet shee provi∣deth her meat in the Summer, and gathereth her foode in the harvest, although they haue no King or ru∣ler to command them, and oversee them, nei∣ther a guide to direct them, yet they are ruled by instinct. There are a second sort of people that God hath placed here below, and they are men; and there is a greater difference amongst this
people, than amongst the former, for looke upon some of them, and yee shall hardly dis∣cerne whether they be men or not, and as the Philosophers say, there are some sorts of creatures that we cannot tell whether they liue the sen∣sitiue or the vegetatiue life onely, there is so little life in them, as in the Shel-fish; so it is hard to discerne whether those liue the reaso∣nable life, or the brutish onely, they haue no lawes, they lodge in the caues of the earth, goe naked, eat raw flesh, and although they haue the shape of men, yet they haue but the heart of beasts in them, as Nebuchadnezzar had. There are other men who are ruled by reason, and politicke government, for their God hath taught them, he may be called their God in this respect,Esay 28.26. as the Prophet Esay calleth him the husband-mans God, because he teacheth him how to manure the ground, and so God commeth neerer to them; they are a people here, but yet they are not Gods people, and it is better to be a dorekeeper in the house of God,Psal. 84.10. than in high∣est advancement amongst such. There is a third sort who liue in his Church, and this is the highest societie in this life, and here we shall see policie, justice, frugalitie, and all vertues, because Gods worship is here, and as the inferior faculties of the soule are
eminenter by way of excellencie contained in the superior, so are all those comprehended in Religion; and as the shadow followeth the bodie, so doth policie and order follow Reli∣gion; if a man would learne frugalitie, let him looke to Ioseph,Psal. 104.22. who taught the Senatours of Egypt; if he would learne policie, let him looke to the government of Salomons Court and his house;2 King. 4. if he would learne to be a good war∣riour, let him see what order the Lord hath placed in the Campe of the Iewes;Numb. 80.10. and if he would learne justice, he shall see it exactly de∣scribed in the Law of God. My Honourable Lord, I haue made choise of your LP: to recōmend this Treatise to your Patrocinie, because yee know what it is to be amongst Gods people; many great men if they get their portion in this life amongst the people of this world,Psal. 17. they care not to be De∣nisons in the societie of Gods people, and they content themselues with the portion of this world, and say, Benum est hic esse; but this is a freedome which is bought at a higher rate, it cost the chiefe Captaine a great summe of money to be made a freeman in Rome;Act. 22 28. but to be made a freeman in the Church of GOD, it cost the price of Christs bloud. Great men desire to be out of this first societie, they de∣sire
not to liue like beasts; but if they come to the second societie, to liue like civill men, that doth content them; they giue GOD thankes (perhaps) for this, that they are men and not beasts, and that they haue beene bred civilly, but few giue God thankes for this, that they liue under the Gospell, where they may learne Christ, not many Noble are called.1 Cor. 2. Sometimes they may tremble and feare,Act. 24.25. as Fe∣lix did,Act 26.28. and put off their conversion to another time, and some of them are like Agrippa, who almost are perswaded to be Christians; but few like Sergius Paulus,Act. 13.7. who was converted at Pauls preaching. My Lord, you haue had still the practise of Religion in your house, and one of the best helpes to further you, your worthy and reli∣gious Lady, whose name smelleth now like the wine of Lebanon, when shee is gone,Hosea 14.7. and now she enjoyeth the fruit of that, when nei∣ther her Nobilitie, birth, or worldly honour profited nothing; and this I write unto your LP: beseeching you to goe on in that Chri∣stian course, that both by your place and ex∣ample, you may draw others unto the truth. The Lord promised that he would giue the uttermost parts of the earth for a possession to his Sonne;Psal. 2.8. this is the Motto of this Iland, and the farther
North, it is the nearer to the ends of the earth, studie therefore my good Lord, that Iesus Christ may haue his possession enlarged in the North, and this shall be your crowne in the latter day, when all your possessions shall faile you. Your Honours in all dutifull submission, IOHN VVEEMSE:

AN EXPLICATION OF THE IVDICIALL LAWES OF MOSES; As they are annexed to the Morall and Ceremo∣niall Lawes. Of the Iudiciall Lawes in generall. SALOMON the Preacher, Ec∣cles 4.12. saith, that a threefold Cord is not quickly broken. The LORD gaue his people three sorts of Lawes, as three Cords to binde them, and to keepe them in obedience.God gaue his Morall, Iudiciall, and Ceremo∣niall Law to his people as a threefold Cord. The first was his morall Law, which was properly called his Law, Deut. 6.1. Secondly, he gaue them his Ceremoniall Lawes, which are called his Statutes and Decrees, Exod. 12.24. And thirdly, his Iudgements, which were the Iudiciall Lawes, Mal. 4.4. Deut. 24.17. These Iudiciall Lawes were Determinations of the Morall Law.The Iudiciall Law what. A Determination is either Iuris divini or Humani;
these Determinations in Moses judiciall Lawes are divi∣ni juris;Determi∣natio Iuris divini. Iuris humani. therefore they had greater force to binde the Iewes, than any municipall Law hath to binde the Sub∣jects now, in respect they were given by God himselfe, and these Lawes of men which draw nearest to them in equitie, are most perfect; although particularly they cannot be fitted to every Nation, no more than a shooe of one measure can serue for every foote. The second sort of Determination is Iuris humani, when men determinate, where there is no expresse com∣mandement of God, as concerning circumstances, time, places, persons, and such. God commandeth in his law, that they should pay their first fruits, but he determi∣neth not how much they should pay of their first fruits; then the Priests come in with their humane determina∣tion, that the most shall giue no more than one of fiftie, and the least shall giue no lesse than one of sixtie.Simile. When the Israelites were travelling in the Wildernesse, they had the Cloud to direct them by day, and the pillar of fire to direct them by night; yet they desired Iethro to be eyes to them, Num. 10.31. What neede had they of Iethro to be eyes to them, seeing they had the Cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night? Iethro was a guide to them, to shew them the particular places and wayes in the Wildernesse, as the Cloud and the pillar were their guide to direct them to Canaan. So humane De∣terminations and Lawes, are but guides in particular circumstances. A comparison betwixt Humane Lawes and Moses Iudiciall Lawes.Humane Lawes they command, they forbid, and sometimes they permit, and lastly they punish: so yee shall see all these foure in Moses Iudiciall Law. First, his Iudiciall Lawes doe command, but they command the outward man onely, Iguca lex. and here Moses speaketh to them but as a Iudge, and they differ from that fierie Law, the morall Law, that searcheth and peirceth into the heart, Deut. 33.2.
Secondly, Humane Lawes doe prohibite and forbid; so doe these Iudiciall Lawes, and there are moe of them which are Negatiues than Affirmatiues, to shew us the perverse nature of man. Thirdly,Why Moses Iudiciall Lawes permit many things. Humane Lawes giue way and permit some∣thing for the eschewing of greater evill; so doth Moses Iudiciall Law, Levit. 27.10. When a man offered a Beast vnto the Lord which he had vowed, he might not change a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; this was commanded onely for eschewing of greater evill; for if it had beene lawfull to change once, a good in place of a bad one, then they would haue come quickly to this, to haue changed a bad for a good: So this Law permitted divorcement for the hardnesse of the peoples hearts, and for the eschewing of greater inconvenience, least hard-hearted men should haue killed their wiues. Fourthly,The punishments of the Iudiciall Law al∣terable. the punishments inflicted by humane lawes are alterable: so were the punishments in Moses Iudici∣all Law; therefore the Iewes say of them, ascendunt & descendunt, which they vnderstand, not of the greatest and highest transgressions, but of the middle sort of transgressions, which praecepta media, their middle Pre∣cepts did forbid. Example, Ex. 22. If a man kept a push∣ing Oxe, knowing that he were wont to push, if he kill a man, then the Law ordaineth that the man shall die, or else to redeeme himselfe with a summe of money; here the Law ascended or descended: but if a man had wilfully killed a man, that was praeceptum grave, the pu∣nishment neither ascended nor descended, but he was to die the death. The Scripture compareth the morall Law to a prison, Gal. 3.22. the Ceremoniall Law to a second Ward, and these Iudiciall Lawes to a Iailor, to keepe the transgres∣sors in close prison that none of them breake out.
CHAPTER I. That Kingly Government is the best Government. IVDG. 17.6. In those dayes there was no King in Israel, but every man did that which was good in his owne eyes. IN government there are fiue things to be conside∣red; first, potestas; secondly, ordo; thirdly, modus; fourthly, titulus; and fiftly, vsus. Fiue things in Go∣vernment.First, there must be a power to exercise government; secondly, order, that some command and some obey, some to be superiors and some to be inferiors; thirdly, the manner, whether the governement be Monarchicall by one, or Aristocraticall by moe; fourthly, the title whether it be by Succession, or Election; and last the vse, how they exercise this Authoritie. What things essentiall and what accidentall in Government.That there should be a power and order in Govern∣ment, these two are essentiall in all Governments, no Government can stand without these two; but the man∣ner, whether it be by one or by moe; and the title, whe∣ther it be by Succession or Election; and the vse, whe∣ther they governe well or not; these three are but acci∣dentall in Government. Monarchicall the best Government.Of these two sorts of Government Monarchicall is the best. Their reasons who hold Aristocraticall Government to be the best.Levi ben Gerson vpon the 1 Sam. 8. holdeth that Ari∣stocraticall Government is best, and to be preferred to Kingly Government; learne, saith he, what hath be∣fallen us under the hand of Kings; David caused the
plague to come upon the people. 2 Sam. 24.15. Ahab restrained the raine for three yeeres. 1 King. 17. and Ze∣dekiah caused the Sanctuary to be burnt, 2 Chro. 36.14. and the Iewes apply that saying of Hosea, I gaue them a King in mine anger, and tooke him away in my wrath. Hos. 13.11. That is, I gaue them their first King Saul in mine anger, and I tooke away their last King Zedekiah in my indignation.Wee must distinguish betwixt the parts of a Kings person, and the faults of the Office. But the Iewes distinguish not well here be∣twixt the faults of a Kings person, & the calling it selfe; good Kings did many excellent things amongst them; for David a man according to Gods owne heart, fought the battels of the Lord, 1 Sam. 25.28.Kings haue beene the Instruments of much good. appointed the or∣der of the Priests, and Levites, and Singers, 1 Chro. 24. and 25. He made many Psalmes to the prayse of God. And Salomon who succeeded him, built the Temple, wrote many excellent Proverbs and Parables, 1 King. 4.32. And kept peace in Israel, that every man might dwell safely vnder his owne Vine-tree, and vnder his Figge-tree, 1 King. 4.25. Now that Monarchicall Government is the best go∣vernment, it is proved thus.Reasons prooving Mo∣narchicall government to be the best. Kingly or Monarchicall Government resembleth Gods government most, which is Monarchicall; so it resembleth Christs government most in the Church. Kingly government is the fittest government to re∣presse sinne; for when there was no King in Israel, eve∣ry man did that which he pleased; Micah set up an Idol.Kingly government fit∣test to represse sinne. Iudg. 18. and they defiled the Levites Concubine, be∣cause there was no King in Israel. By King, here is not meant any other sort of government, but Kingly go∣vernment, as is evident, Iudg. 18.17. haeres in∣terdicti a  heredi∣tare, vel possidens reg∣num,  possidere  regnum. There was no Ma∣gistrate then, but in the originall it is, there was no heire of restraint then to put them to shame, Ioresh gnetzer, which may be interpreted either haeres interdicti, or possidens regnum, there was none to possesse the Kingdome, or
there was not an heire of restraint. Here two things are to be observed; first, that that is the best governement which restraineth sinne most; secondly, that that go∣vernment which is by an heire of restraint, is fittest to represse sinne; but the governement Monarchicall is such, and not Aristocraticall, for it commeth not per haeredem, but onely by Election. Obserue what GOD himselfe saith to his people, Deut. 17.20. that he may prolong his dayes in his Kingdome, he and his children in the midst of Israel. Here the Kingdome goeth by succes∣sion, and not by election; here was an heire of restraint to represse sinne. It is objected, if Government be hereditary, then wicked Cambyses will succeed to good Cyrus. So in Kingly government, good Hezekiah succeeded to Idolatrous Ahaz, and if we receiue good at the hands of God, why should we not receiue evill also, Iob 2.10? Thirdly, they alledge Iosephus testimony, of the Iewes dealing with Pompey to change their Government,Lib. 4. Antiq. 5. and that they would be no longer under Kings; and so they bring Lactantius citing Seneca,Lactantius lib. 17. c. 15. speaking of the Com∣mon-wealth of Rome; Pueritiam sub caeteris regibus egisse, ait, a quibus auctam & disciplinis plurimis institutis{que} for∣matam; at verò Tarquinio regnante, cum jam quasi adulta esse caepisset, servitium non tulisse; & superbo jugo domina∣tionis rejecto, maluisse legibus obtemperare quàm regibus. When the Iewes wished that Pompey might change the government,The Romanes finde fault with the person of their King, and not with his Office. they wished onely, that they might be more gently vsed; they blamed the persons, and not the government simply; and so the Romanes were wea∣ry of Tarquinius government, but they were not weary of Kingly government, as long as their Kings ruled them well. Their Deduction then seemeth not to haue a good ground, who simply doe preferre Aristocracie to Mo∣narchie;
first, they say Moses was extraordinarily cal∣led, and Ioshua succeeded him; and after that, the go∣vernment of the Synedrion or Seventie was setled a∣mongst them, whose government was Aristocraticall, Nomb. 11. The Iudges were set up but for a time over them, and they were raysed up extraordinarily; and then the government was still the Lords, as wee see in the example of Gideon, Iudg. 8. and of Iephthe, Iudg. 9. And after, that the Iudges had ruled & governed them, then came Saul, whose government arose from the dis∣contentment of the people, but they say it continued in the house of David especially, because he was a type of Christ; but simply they say, that God liked Aristo∣cracie best. But seeing the Lord was minded to giue the people of the Iewes a King,God was minded to giue the Iewes a King. and telleth them what King he would choose, Deut. 17. How liked he Aristocracie best? and he liketh that government here. Iudg. 18.17. which is by the heire of restraint or the heire of the Kingdome. The Conclusion of this is,  let us be thankfull to God for our gracious Kings Government, and that there is now an heire of restraint, to put wicked men to shame, and to curbe the sonnes of Belial. CHAPTER II. An Explication of Iothams Apologue. IVDG. 9.8. The trees went out on a time to anoint a King over them, &c. THe Holy Ghost teacheth us in the Scriptures by Si∣militudes, Parables, and Apologues;God teaches us by Si∣militudes, Parables, and Apologues. and as a cun∣ning Painter, the more vive that his Colours are drawn
in the purtraiture to expresse the image,Simile. wee commend him the more; but when wee see an Image made by some Archimedes, that is , to mooue it selfe, nod with the head, and roll the eyes, we commend that much more; So all the comparisons and similitudes in the Scripture, are laid out as it were in vive Collours to us.Two Apologues onely found in the Scriptures. But there are two Apologues brought in in the Scriptures, this of the trees Iudg. 9. and that 2 King. 14.9. how the Thistle of Lebanon propounded mariage to the Cedar in Lebanon, where the trees are brought in walking and speaking, which affect the mind more than plaine Similitudes; and in these we must not so much looke to the Letter, as to that which they call , or the thing signified by the Apologue. All the trees refuse the Government.Iotham bringeth in here the trees anointing a King, and they make choise of three most excellent trees; the Oliue, the Figge, and the Vine-tree, and they all refu∣sed,The trees described by their properties. and then they make choise of the Bramble. The three excellent trees which refuse the government, the Oliue, the Figge, and the Vine-tree, are described by three properties; the Oliue for his fatnesse, the Figge-tree for its sweetnesse, and the Vine-tree because it cheared God and man: The Oliue Iudg. 9.9. saith, should I leaue my fatnesse, wherewith by me they honour God & man; ex hiphil & hophal compositum, sensus est, vestrisne ver∣bis persuasa ita missam facere pinguedinem me∣am, juxta hiphil, & ea ipsa que{que} priver & de∣ficiar juxta hophal, ni∣hil{que} amplius habtam in me commendabile. The trees serue for a naturall, civill, and religious use. in the Hebrew it is Hehhadalti, as if it should say, will yee perswade me with your faire words to leaue my fatnesse, that I should be altogether deprived of it, so that I haue nothing left in me worthy of commen∣dation. And if we will compare these three trees together, we must consider them first as they serue for naturall uses; secondly, as they serue for civill uses; and thirdly, for religious uses; and then we shall see the excellency of these trees. First, in their naturall use; consider the wood of the
Oliue how farre it excelleth the wood of the Fig-tree,The wood of the Oliue tree excelleth the rest. or the Vine-tree; The Cherubims were made of the O∣liue tree, 1 King. 6.23. which was a wood both of in∣durance fit to be carved or cut, better than the Algum or Almug trees which Hiram sent to Salomon, 1 King. 10.11. and it was better than the Cedar of Lebanon; the wood of the Fig-tree was but a base sort of wood, but the Vine-tree is the basest of of all, Ezek. 15.2.3. will a man take a pinne of it to hinge any vessell, it serveth for no vse if it be not fruitfull; it is like the salt, if it loose the savour, it is good for nothing, Mat. 5.13. Secondly, consider the fruit of these trees;Their use in naturall things. the Vine is uvifera, the Oliue is baceifera, and the Figge-tree is po∣mifera, and they serue for most excellent uses in nature; the Wine serveth to cheare the heart of man, Psal. 104.15. and Pro. 31.16. giue Wine to him that is of a sad heart, so the Oyle maketh the face to shine, Psal. 104.15. and it is good for the anointing of the body. A Romane being asked how it came to passe that he lived so long? he said intus melle, & foris oleo: qui ungebat,  qui un∣ctus fuit, ab  ungo. it is fit for the anointing of the body: therefore those who wrestled of old were called Aliptae. Secondly, they haue good use in curing of wounds, the Samaritane powred Wine and Oyle in the mans wounds, Luk. 10.34. and the Figge is good to mature a boyle; the Lord commanded to lay a lump of Figges to Hezekias boyle, Esay. 36. For civill uses, the Oyle excelleth the Wine and the Figge, for by me they honour man, Iudg. 9.9.unguentum militare. convivale. funebre. There is Vnguentum militare, wherewith their Kings were anoin∣ted to goe out as their Captaines before them to the Battell; so David was anointed amongst the mīdst of his brethren to be their Captaine and King, 1 Sam. 16.13. Secondly, there was Vnguentum convivale, Eccles. 9.8. Let not Oyle be wanting to thy head, and let thy clothes
be white. And thirdly, was Vnguentum funebre, as that box of Oyntment which was powred vpon Christs head, Math. 26.12. The spirituall use of these trees.Now let us consider them in their spirituall uses, as they served for the worship of God; vnder the old Te∣staments the Wine and the Oyle were used in their Sa∣crifices, the Oyle in their Meat-offering and the Wine in their Drinke-offering; so in anoynting their High Priests; but the Figge had no use in their Ceremoniall worship; but in his worship under the Gospel the Wine goeth before the Figge or the Oliue, for it is the signe of our Lords bloud in the Sacrament. These trees fitly repre∣sent a good King.The Oliue, the Vine, and the Figge tree, fitly repre∣sent a good King; the Oliue for his fatnesse to cure and heale their wounds, Esa. 3.7. Non ero Hhobhes, I will not be a healer. Ligator vulnerum. The Seventie translateth it,  ligator vul∣nerum; it is the part of a good Prince to powre Oyle in the wounds of his wounded Subjects. Secondly, the Figge tree for his sweetnesse representeth a good King. 1 King. 12.7. If thou wilt be a servant unto this people, and serue them this day, then they will serue thee for ever. So David spake mildly and sweetly to the people, 1 Chron. 28.2. Heare me my brethren and my people. Thirdly, the Vine-tree representeth a good King; the Wine gladdeth the heart, so the light of the Kings countenance is life, and his favour is a cloud of the latter raine, Prov. 16.15. Three refused the Go∣vernment, Debora, Gide∣on, and Iephihe.When these trees which were excellent for their fruit had refused the Government, then they made choise of the Bramble for their King; the Bramble represented a bad King. First, the Bramble bringeth forth no fruit; Secondly,The many evils which the Bramble brought with it. the Bramble hath no shadow to shadow the rest; thirdly, Rhamnus the Bramble is full of prickles, whatsoever it toucheth it holdeth fast, and it maketh bloud to follow; it was with this sort of thorne where∣with Christ was crowned; the Italians call it Spina san∣cta:
Fourthly, the fire came from the Bramble and did not onely burne the shrubs of the field, but also the Cedars which were tall, which might haue seemed to be exempted from this tyrannie. The Persians said of Cyrus their King, that he was their Father, and Darius their King was ,. a Vintner who sold them, but Cambyses their King was  their Lord who hardly ruled over them. The conclusion of this is,  a good King is much to be honoured for the great good he doth to his Subjects: First, he is the head of the people, and as all the mem∣bers of the body will hazard themselues for the safetie of the head, so should he subjects for the safety of their Prince. Secondly, he is the Shepheard, and the Sub∣jects are his flocke, but who feedeth a flocke and eateth not of the milke. 1 Cor. 9.7. Thirdly, he is the husband and his Subjects are his wife, and therefore she is called a widow when she wanteth her King, Lament. 1.1. What great lamentation doth a widow make when she wants her loving husband Iosias, then she poured her liver out vp∣on the ground, her eyes failed with teares, and her bowels were troubled, Lament. 2.11. Last, the Prince is the soule and the Subjects are the bodie, and the body should doe all things for the good of the soule; he is the breath of our nostrils, Lament. 4.12. We see how many obligations the Subjects owe to their King.
CHAPTER III. Why was God angry with them for choosing of a King. 1 SAM. 8.7. And the Lord said unto Samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee, for they haue not reiected thee, but they haue reiected me that I should not reigne over them. God was not angry simply with the Iewes for choosing of a King, but because they pre∣vented the time.KIngly Government being the best Government, why was the LORD then angry with the Iewes for choosing of a King? He was not angry with them simply for desiring and choosing a King, but for the manner of their choise; for God was minded to haue given them a King, but they would not stay the Lords leasure, but anticipated the time; therefore the Iewes say of them, comederunt immaturam uvam, the grape was not ripe enough as yet; wee may see that God was minded to haue given them a King, Deut. 17. because he telleth them what sort of King they should choose, and what he should doe; and they say,Three things given in commandement to the Iewes when they ente∣red into Canaan. that he gaue them three things in com∣mandement when they entered into Canaan; first, to choose a King; secondly, to roote out the Canaanites; and thirdly, to build a Temple for his worship: God was angry with them that they sought a King so long as good Samuel ruled over them; he was angry with them because they would haue a King to reigne over them after the manner of the Nations, Deut. 17.14. I will set a King over me like all the Nations round about me, but thou shalt set them over thee whom the Lord thy God will choose: If they had said to Samuel, giue one to reigne o∣ver
us after thy death, because thy children are corrupt, 1 Sam. 8.3. or giue us one who may governe us in e∣quitie; this had beene no offence to God: but simply to desire a King like the Kings of the Nations, this was their sinne, and herein they rejected not Samuel, but God himselfe, 1 Sam. 8.7. How was God rejected when they chose a King,  seeing Kings reigne by him, Prov. 8. and the Kings throne is Gods throne, 1 Chro. 29.23. & 1 King. 2.15. The Lord did reigne over them in both these sorts of Government,  but when the Iudges commanded and ruled them,The Iudges had not such absolute govern∣ment over the people as the Kings had. they had not such an absolute Government as when the Kings reigned over them; the Iudges might make no Lawes, nor take tribute of the people as the Kings might doe; therefore the Lords immediate Go∣vernment did more appeare when the Iudges ruled them, Iudg. 8.23. I will not rule over you, neither shall my sonne rule over you, the Lord shall rule over you. And when they rejected Samuel here they said in effect, as the Iewes said when they disclaimed Christ, We will haue no King to reigne over us but Caesar, Ioh. 19.15.Gods power did more appeare when the Iud∣ges ruled, but his good∣nesse and mercie appea∣red more when the Kings ruled. When the Iudges ruled over them then Gods power did more appeare helping them by weake meanes; but when the Kings reigned over them, then Gods wisedome and his good∣nesse did more appeare in setling a government amongst them, and making their Kings types of Christ. And as in Gods miracles his power did more appeare, but in his ordinary course working by nature his wisedome and goodnesse appeared more; so in these two formes of Government, his power did appeare more when the Iudges ruled over them; but in setling the Kingly go∣vernment amongst them, his goodnesse and his wise∣dome did more appeare. The conclusion of this is,  happie is that Kingdome when the King reigneth a me, per me, & propter me: a me
when he is sent by the Lord; per me, when he is sustained and upholden by the Lord; and propter me, when he serues to glorifie God in his Kingdome. CHAPTER IIII. What Samuel meaneth by Mishpat Hammelech. 1 SAM. 8.11. And he said this will be the manner of the King that shall raigne over you, &c. KIMCHI saith whatsoever is set downe in this Text, Lex Regis. it is lawfull for the King to doe it, and therefore he interpreteth Mishpat Melech 1 Sam. 8.8. This shall be the Law of the King, or this is the thing which the King may doe by the Law; the Chaldie Para∣phrast paraphraseth it Nimusa, a Law. Lex, chalda∣icè.Maymone expoundeth the words in this wise, he shall take your Beasts at the Kings price, and your Oliues and your Vines for to maintaine his servants in the Warres;Rambamfilius Maymone. and he saith in necessitate omnia pertinent ad jus regis, sed extra necessitatem non pertinent: But this is not the meaning of the place. Samuel describeth a ty∣rant, and not what a King may lawfully doe.The Lord is describing here to them, that King which he is to giue to them in his wrath, and not what a law∣full King may doe; and Mishpat here signifieth not a Law, but the manner and custome of him who should doe such things, as 1 Sam. 2.13. And the Priests [Mishpat] custome was with the people to take the flesh of the sacrifice that did not belong to him. Here it cannot be translated, it was the Priests Law, for it had beene sacrilegious theft in the Priest to haue taken any part of the sacrifice, but that which was due to him. So this should be the
[Mishpat] or custome of this King whom God sent in his wrath, that he should take any thing which he pleased from them, although it had not beene for necessary u∣ses; but 1 Sam. 10.25. Lex Regni. the word Mishpat is taken in a∣nother sense, then Samuel told the people [Mishpat Ham∣melocha] the law of the Kingdome, and laid it up before the Arke. Here Mishpat is taken in another sense, how the King should rule the Countrey, and this Booke Samuel laid up before the Arke; but this Mishpat was not laid up before the Arke, but was set downe as a punishment for that people. Now that this King which Samuel describeth unto them (whom God sent in his wrath) might not doe these things to his Subjects by lawfull authoritie,Reasons prooving that he was not a lawfull King, who is described here. the reasons are these. First, God gaue them this King in his anger, and tooke him away in his wrath, Hos. 13.11. Which cannot be said of any King in whom there is but the least sparkle of goodnesse. Secondly, He will take your [Cerem] not onely your Vines, but also your Vineyards, as Ahab tooke Naboths Vineyard; whereas David bought from Aranna the Ie∣busite the ground to build the Temple on. Thirdly, He will take their tithes; either he will take these tithes from the Priests, and that had beene sacri∣ledge; or else he will tithe the people over againe, and that had beene too hard a burden for them. Fourthly, He will make your young men slaues, and your young women drudges;The Kings of Israel made no free men slaues. but the good Kings of Israel never did so, they set not the Israelites to any ser∣vile worke, 2 Chron. 2 17. And Salomon set the Israe∣lites to be overseers over the worke of the Temple, but he set Strangers to doe the servile workes. When the Holy Ghost describeth a good King, he calleth him Nadibh: and  in the New Testament,. Bountifull ord, Luk. 22.
In what Kings were these punishments accomplished? The Iewes hold that they were not all accomplished in one King, some of them were accomplished in Reho∣boam, 1 King. 12.16. some of them in Ahab, 1 King. 21. and some in Omri, Micah 6.16. The Conclusion of this is, a good King seeketh not theirs but them, therefore good subjects should answer as an Echo, We and ours are thine; and the good King or Nadibb will answere, Princeps, à mu∣nificentia et liberalitate fic dictus. I and mine shall be ever for you my people. When the Master sendeth his servant away with his reward, and the servant doth his dutie faithfully, then it is called , Mat. 20.2. CHAPTER V. A Difference betwixt the Election of Saul, and the Election of David. 1 SAM. 13.14. The Lord hath sought him a man after his owne heart. FIrst Saul was chosen but out of the tribe of Benja∣min, but David out of the tribe of Iuda; and the Kingdome was intailed to him and his posteritie, but not to the posteritie of Saul. In Christs genealogie none is called a King but David onely. Saul was chosen by lot, David immediately.Secondly, Saul was chosen by lot, but David more immediately by God; and even as Matthias when he was chosen by lot, his calling was not so solemne as Pauls was: so neither was the calling of Saul so solemne as was the calling of David, Non tam misit Deus Saulum quàm permisit populo. Thirdly, when he speaketh of David, he saith 1 Sam.
13.14. Quaesivi, Bikkesh est diligenter inquirere, Cant. 3. diligenter inqui∣rere. Exod. 4.19. 2 Sam. 22.33. And he was as glad in fin∣ding of him, as the Widow was when shee found her groat, who called in her neighbours to rejoyce with her when she had found it, Luk. 16.9. Fourthly, Quaesivi mihi, est dativus Commodi. Zach. 9.9.Mihi est dativus commo∣di. id est, in commodum meum. Behold thy King commeth unto thee; that is, for thy profit and benefit. So David was the King that would serue for the Lords glory. Fiftly, he chose David according to his owne heart, this was verbum amoris; and there was great similitude betwixt Davids heart, and Gods owne heart. The Iewes obserue concerning David, that when he had sinned in numbring of the people, God said to the Prophet, Goe tell David, 2 Sam. 24.12. 1 Chron. 21.10.How the Lord calleth David his servant. Giving him no other title but David; as Kimchi marketh upon that place; but when he had a purpose to build a house for the Lord, then he said Goe tell my servant David, 2 Sam. 7.5. 1 Chron. 17.4. Shewing what account he maketh of such, and how acceptable men are to him, when they seeke his glory, and the good of his Church. So when the people had committed Idolatry, the Lord calleth them Moses people, Goe get thee downe,Why God called the Israelites Moses people. for thy people which thou broughtst out of Aegypt, haue corrupted them∣selues, Exod. 32.7. He calleth them not my people, be∣cause they were blotted with such a blot as was not to be found in his children, Deut. 32.5. Now because Da∣vid was a King fit for Gods worship, see how friendly he speakes of him, I haue sought to me a man; that is, an excellent man. Sixtly, according to my heart;God chose not David for his stature. I made not choise of him for his comely stature, as the people made choise of Saul, but I chose him because he was a man according to mine owne heart. The Conclusion of this is, 1 Sam. 16.7.  a man judgeth
according to his eyes, but the Lord looketh to the heart; the Lord hath not eyes of flesh,Carneos habire oculos quid. Iob 10.4. That is, he looketh not to outward qualities as men doe; but his eyes peirce into the heart; and he made choise of David, because he saw his heart was upright. The heart of the Prince is the object of the eye of God. CHAPTER VI. Of the anoynting of their Kings, and whe∣ther the Kings and Priests were anoynted with the same Oyle or not. PSAL. 89.27. I haue found David my servant, with my holy Oyle haue I anointed him. How the anointing of the Kings and Priests pertaineth to the Iudi∣ciall Law.ALthough the anointing of the Kings and Priests was a thing ceremoniall under the Law, yet thus farre it falleth under the Iudiciall Law: first, what Kings and their sonnes succeeding them were a∣nointed; secondly, whether the Priests and the Kings were anointed with the same Oyle or not. There were three sorts of persons anointed under the Law, Kings, Priests, and Prophets. All the Priests at the first were anointed.All the Priests were anointed at the first, both the high Priests and the inferior Priests, Levit. 8. but af∣terwards onely the high Priest was anointed and his sonnes after him, Levit. 6.21. & 21.10. & 16.32. there∣fore he was called the anointed of the Lord. How the Priest was anointed.The Priest when he was anointed, first, he was anoin∣ted with Oyle, secondly, sprinkled with bloud, and thirdly, with bloud and oyle, Levit. 8. The first was up∣on his head, the second upon his flesh, and the third up∣on his garments.
So the King was anointed,What Kings were a∣nointed. but the Kings sonne was not anointed, if his father was anointed before him; one anointing served for both, because the Kingdome is the Kings inheritance for ever, Deut. 17.20. But if there had beene a sedition, they did anoint him, to pacifie the people, and settle the sedition, and to make knowne who was the right King; as Salomon was anointed,Maymont in his Trea∣tise of the Implements of the Sanctuary, cap. 1. sect. 4. because of the sedition of Adonijah, 1 King. 1. and Ioash because of Athalia, 2 King. 11. and Ioahaz because of his bro∣ther Iehojakim, 2 King. 23.30. Whether were the Kings and Priests anointed with the same Oyle or not? There were foure Kings anointed at the first with common Oyle, called the Oyle of Balsom;  but not with holy Oyle. First,Foure Kings anointed both with cōmon oyle, and with the holy oyle. Saul was anointed with this common Oyle when Samuel first anointed him, this was done in Rama, where neither the Sanctuary nor holy Oyle were; secondly, he who was anointed with this common oyle was David by Samuel at Bethlehem; thirdly, Hasael and Iehu by one of the children of the Prophets, 2 King. 9.1. And the Iewes say, that those who were anointed by the Prophets, were anointed with common Oyle; but those who were anointed by the high Priest were anointed with holy Oyle. But Saul when he was made King over Israel at Miz∣peh, was anointed with the holy oyle by the high Priest, and David was anointed with the holy Oyle at Hebron and at Ierusalem; when they were anointed before by the Prophets, it was but a preparation to this holy Oyle. The Church of Rome holdeth that the King and the Priest were not anointed with the same Oyle,Becanus de jure regio. that they may advance the Pope aboue Princes: their reason is this; None that had the holy Oyle upon his head might
lament for the dead. Levit. 21.10. But the King might lament for the dead; therefore he was not anointed with the same Oyle wherewith the high Priest was anointed: they proue that the King might lament for the dead, as David did for Absolom, 2 Sam. 18.33. so for Abner, 2 Sam. 3.21. Although the King and the Priest were both anoin∣ted with the same oyle, yet the Priest is forbidden espe∣cially to lament for the dead, because he was a more vive type of Christ than the King was; and concerning Davids mourning after the Beere;Why the high Priest might not mourne for the dead. R: Iudah answereth, that David did this to purge himselfe, that he was not guiltie of the bloud of Abner: and the Text saith, that the people and all Israel understood that day,Why David mourned for Absolon and Abner. that it was not of the King to slay Abner the sonne of Ner, 2 Sam. 3.27. The ceremony gaue place here to the necessitie, he mourned that he might take the suspition out of the hearts of the people: and for his mourning for Abso∣lom, his passion miscarried him. Now the reasons proving that they were both a∣nointed with the same sort of Oyle are these. First, the Oyle wherewith the Kings were anointed, is called the holy Oyle: with mine holy Oyle haue I a∣nointed him, Psal. 89.27. Secondly, these are the two Oliue branches that stood before the Lord, Zach. 4.11. The Chaldie Paraphrast paraphraseth it thus; those are Zerubbabel and Ioshua, the Prince of the people, and the high Priest; because they were both anointed with the same sort of Oyle. But there was none of this sort of Oyle in the second Temple, therefore the high Priest in the second Temple was not called Vnctus Iehovae, but vir multarum vestium; he was distinguished then from the rest of the Priests by the severall Ornaments which he wore, but not by his anointing.
Although there was no materiall oyle in the second Temple, wherewith they anointed the King and Priest,  yet the spirituall anointing was figured here, by the comparison taken from the anointing in the Temple. So Nehem. 7.65. there was neither Vrim nor Thummim in the second Temple, yet by the forme in the first Tem∣ple he expresseth what Priests shall be in the second Temple. Thirdly, the King was in dignitie aboue the high  Priest, but onely when the Priest asked counsell at the Lord for him, the high Priest stood when the King sate in the house of the Lord, 2 Sam. 7.18. Is it probable then that he was anointed with an inferiour sort of oyle to that wherewith the Priest was anointed? A comparison betwixt Davids anointing and Christ,David thrice anointed, so was Christ. David was thrice anointed; first, in Bethlehem secretly by Samuel; secondly, at Hebron; and thirdly, at Ierusa∣lem: so Iesus Christ was anointed in the wombe of the Virgin; secondly, this anointing manifested it selfe more when he taught at Nazaret, Luk. 4.13.14. see Act. 7.37.38. And this anointing was fully manifested in his resurrection, Psal. 4.5. David was anointed a King, but he was not an anoin∣ted Prophet to attend upon that calling onely, as Esay and Ieremiah; but Christ was anointed both King and Prophet: Melchizedeck was a King and a Priest,None anointed King, Priest, and Prophet, but Iesus Christ. but he was not a King, Priest, and Prophet, as Christ was. Samuel was a Priest and a Prophet; but he was not a King, Priest, and Prophet, as Christ was. There was never any anointed King, Priest, & Prophet, but Christ onely, and we are made in him regale sacerdotium, 1 Pet. 1.9. a royall Priesthood. It may be asked seeing all the children of God are called Mesichim, or Christs,  whether is this Christs proper name, or is it an appellatiue name?
It is but his appellatiue name, and Iesus is his proper name, but yet by way of excellencie, it is appropriate to Christ; all Christians are Mesichim, but Christ is Hame∣shiah, that anointed of the Lord, Luk. 2.26. He is not so much called the anointed in concreto, as the oyle in abstracto,Christ called the oyle. Esay 10. I will take away the yoke for the Oyles sake, that is, for the anointeds sake Iesus Christ. The Pope claimeth to be aboue Kings in his anoin∣ting, in state, and worldly dignitie; therefore this shew∣eth him to be that man of sinne, who exalteth himselfe a∣boue all that are called gods, 2 Thess. 2.4. that is, aboue all Princes and Kings. CHAPTER VII. How the Kings of Iudah and Israel, brake this Commandement in multiplying riches. DEVT. 17.17. Neither shall he greatly multiply to himselfe silver and gold, &c. IT is lawfull for Kings to multiple riches by lawfull meanes;How the Kings of Iu∣da and Israel might multiplie riches. first, of their owne proper inheritance, 1 Chron. 29.3. this the Hebrewes call Segulla, I haue of my owne proper good. Secondly, the King may mul∣tiply his riches by husbandry, as Vzzia did, 2 Chron. 26 10. So by tributes and gifts given unto him by other Nations, 2 Chron. 17.5. in token of their homage and subjection. So with things purchased by lawfull warre from captiues, 2 Sam. 8.10. and 1 Chro. 18.22. 2 Chro. 15.7. So for the safetie of his Country, and for the good of his Subjects, he may require tributes and taxations from the people, and more than ordinary Subsidies,
which all turnes to their good: for as the vapours which are drawne up to the Clouds, are not reserved there, but are sent downe to the earth againe to water it, and to make it fruitfull; so the Subsidies which the King exacteth from the people this wayes, come backe againe to their use, to keepe and to defend them. David had great riches,How David came by his riches. and he got his riches three wayes: first by his tributes; secondly, by the spoyle of his enemies; for he fought twentie battels, and got all the spoyle from the enemies; and thirdly, he had ar∣gentum capitationis, the pole-money of all the people; and all this he laid up for the building of the Temple of the Lord; therefore he saith 1 Chro. 22.14. in afflictione mea. Now behold [Begnaneij] in my povertie or affliction, I haue prepared for the house of the Lord an hundreth thousand talents of gold, &c. Why calleth he it, his povertie? because he had nothing but that which he had from the Lord, 1 Chron. 29.16. And therefore he would returne it backe againe for the building of a house to him: here David multi∣plied silver, but not contrary to the law.Salomon how he came by his riches. So Salomon exceeded all the Princes of the earth in riches, his Do∣minion was from the river of Egypt to Euphrates; and from Libanus Northward, to the Mediterran Sea, all those were tributaries to him; the Queene of Sheba brought out of Arabia Faelix much spices to him, 1 King. 10. And he had three Navies that came home e∣very third yeere with gold and pretious stones; and the whole twelue tribes payd tribute to him: he did not here contrary to the law, that the King should not mul∣tiplie riches, but that blessing was then fulfilled in him which was made to Abraham, that his seede should pos∣sesse, from the river of Egypt to Euphrates. The Law saith, Deut. 17.17. Non multiplicabit sibi valde [lo jarbe lo meod,] in 2 Chron. 32.27. it is said of He∣zekias that he had exceeding much riches: [Harbe meod,]
the very same words which are in the interdiction, did Hezekias gather his riches contrary to the law here? Not; the meaning of the law then is this, that a King should not multiplie gold and silver, to put his confi∣dence in them, or for unnecessary uses; and it seemeth that Salomon brake not this law untill the Temple was built, the Citie enlarged, and the warres ended; then for him in his old age to lay such heavie tributes and taxa∣tions upon the people, was to multiplie riches unto a wrong end: when Salomon gaue gold and silver at Ieru∣salem as plenteous as stones, 2 Chro. 1.15. This was law∣full to giue to his Subjects, but Eccles. 2.8. he sayes, I gathered me also silver and gold, when he gathered it onely to satisfie his covetous desire, and not for neces∣sary uses, that was the transgression of the Law. The next part of the interdiction was this, that he should not multiplie horses to himselfe. The end of this interdiction was first, to take away all commerce and dealing with the Egyptians; for having commerce with the Egyptians, & bringing horses from thence, they were in danger to be infected with Idola∣try.Why God forbad them to multiplie. Secondly, he forbad them to multiply horses, least they should trust in them, Psal. 20.7. Some trust in Cha∣riots, and some in Horses, but we will remember the name of the Lord our God. He forbad to multiply horses to trust in them, therefore the Lord commandeth Ioshua 11.6. Thou shalt hough their horses, Subnervabis equo. [Tegnakker Suschen] subner∣vabis equos, thou shalt not kill them, but cut the master∣sinew, and make them unfit for any service and warre hereafter,Ioshua why comman∣ded to hough the hor∣ses. that they might doe no service against the people of God afterwards: they might take Camels and Asses in the Battell, Numb. 31.11. and such beasts as were not fit for the warres, and if at any time they reserved any of the Horses, it was but a small number: so we see 2 Sam. 8.4. that David of a thousand Chari∣ots
and seaven hundreth horsemen which he tooke in the warres, reserved onely horses for an hundreth Chariots; but he houghed all the rest of the Chariot horses, he left them so, that they might serue for other uses, but not for the warres, and he reserved here but the tenth part of them; Salomon at the first was commended for the multitude of his horses,When horses and silver may be multiplied. because he kept them for the defence of the Countrey; but the Law forbiddeth to keepe them for unnecessary uses, for ostentation, or for trusting in them, and so Salomon fell afterwards to multiplie horses and gold exceedingly, but not for ne∣cessary uses; and see how Esay is a Commentary to this law, cap. 2.7.8. and sheweth us the end of this inter∣diction, when he saith, the land is full of silver and gold,Multiplying of horses and gold, draw them to Idolatrie. neither is there any end of their treasures; their land is also full of their horses, neither is there any end of their Chari∣ots; their land is also full of Idols. Here we see why the Lord forbiddeth them to multiplie horses, because these drew them to make a league with Idolaters, and made them worship Idols. Thirdly, the King is forbidden to multiplie Wiues,The heathens multiply Wiues. Pro. 31.3. Giue not thy strength to women, nor thy wayes to that which destroyeth Kings; the Heathen Kings gaue themselues much to haue many wiues: Asshuerus com∣manded, that through all his Provinces which were an hundreth twentie and seaven, that the most beauti∣full Virgins should be brought to him, Esth. 2.3.Iustini. lib. 12. And Darius had as many wiues as there are dayes in the yeere; but Salomon exceeded them all in the number of his wiues. The number of Salomons Wiues and Concubines are reckoned diversly, 1 King. 11.3.The reconciliation of these two places King 11 3 and Cant 6.8 concerning aomons Wiues. it is said that he had sevē hundreth wiues Princesses, and three hundreth Concubines: but Cant. 6.8. there are sixtie Queenes and eightie Concu∣bines, and Virgines without number: where he alludeth
to the number of Salomons wiues: Genebrard goeth a∣bout to reconcile the places this wayes, that Salomon at the first had but sixtie Queenes, and eightie Concu∣bines; but afterward their number came to seven hun∣dreth wiues, and three hundreth Concubines; but this reconciliation cannot stand; for then it should follow that Salomon wrote the Canticles before he repented; but the true reconciliation is this, although he had seven hundreth Queenes,Sixtie Queenes which were in favour with him. yet he had sixtie of them who were most in favour with him, and honoured by the people, and these are set downe, Cant. 6.8. and they were brought forth that day that Salomon maried Pharaohs daughter, and when they saw her, they praised her beautie and dignitie, and they said, who is shee that looketh out at the windows as the morning; the whole number of his Wiues and Concubines seemeth to haue beene a thou∣sand, Eccles. 2.28. Of men I haue found one of a thousand, but I haue not found a woman amongst these thousands. The Iewes restraint of multiplying vviues.This Law that the King should not multiplie wiues, the Iewes restrained it to eighteene wiues; they say that David the King had sixteene wiues, 2 Sam. 15.16. the King left ten women which were Concubines to keepe the house; these Concubines were his wiues, and besides it is said, 1 Chro. 3.6. that he had six wiues moe, in all he had sixteene. So Rehoboam had eighteene wiues, 2 Chro. 11.21. And they adde farther, that David had six wiues before Nathan came to him, 2 Sam. 3.13. then the Lord said unto him, 2 Sam. 12.8. if that had beene too little for thee, I would haue overmore given thee such & such things; the word is twice repeated here [Cahenna ve cahenna] quot illae quot illae, twelue moe make in all these eight∣teene wiues which David might haue had; and the Tar∣gum paraphraseth that place, Deut. 17.17. Ne multipli∣cet uxores ultra octodecem, ne depravent cor ejus; and Salo∣mon Iarchi upon Deut. 17. he shall not multiplie wiues
aboue eighteene, because we finde that David the King had but eighteene wiues. Yee see upon what a sandie ground they build this: they say that David and Reho∣boam brake not this commandement, because they con∣tained themselues within the number of eighteene; but Salomon who exceeded the number, he brake the com∣mandement. To multiplie wiues was altogether against the law;Multiplying of wiues was against the Law. for they two shall be one flesh, bindeth him as well that sit∣teth upon the throne, as him that draweth the water and heweth the wood: but this to multiply horses and gold, is but secundum quid against the Law; that is,Multiplying of horses not altogether against the Law. it is not simply forbidden, but onely for unnecessary uses, and to put their trust in them; but to enable them for the defence of their Countrey, and benefit of the Estate; that is not forbidden. CHAPTER VIII. A comparison betwixt Salomons Kingdome and Christs. PSAL. 89.2. His throne shall be established as the Moone, and shall endure as the Sunne before me. DAVID prayed for his sonne Salomon, that the Lord would giue his Iudgements to the King, and he compareth his Kingdome to the Moone;Salomons Kingdome compared to the Moone. Simile. for as the Moone borroweth her light from the Sunne, so he beggeth of the Lord, that he would giue light to his sonne Salomon to direct him: and as Astrologians obserue, that when the Moone is joyned with a bad
Planet, then her influence is bad; but when she is joy∣ned with a good Planet, then her influence is good; so Salomon in his Government when he was joyned to Idolatry, and strange women, then there was a bad in∣fluence upon his Government; but when he tooke the direction from the Lord, then his Kingdome flourished. There is a stone in Arabia called Selenites,Plinius de Gemmis. Simile. which grow∣eth with the Moone, and decreaseth with it; when the Moone is in the wane, yee cannot see the stone in the perfect colour; but when the Moone is at the full, then the stone groweth againe to the full: so Salomons King∣dome, as long as he got light from the Lord it waxed; but when he turned once from the Lord, it decayed daily. Last, it was like the Moone, the Moone in twen∣tie eight dayes finisheth her course, fourteene dayes to the full,Salomons kingdome like the Moone in waxing and waning. and fourteene to the wane; so from Abraham to Salomon fourteene generations, then the Moone was at the full; then from the end of Salomons dayes untill Zedekiah were fourteene generations; and then his King∣dome decayed and waned. Salomon the King when he judged Israel he sat in a throne, 1 King. 10.18. and the King made a great throne of Ivorie, and overlaid it with the best gold; the throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round be∣hinde, and it stood in the porch of Iudgement where he judged the people, 1 King. 7.7. and there were stayes in each side in the place of the seat, and two Lyons stood behinde the stayes,The difference betwixt Salomons throne of Ivo∣rie and the brazen scaf∣fold. and twelue Lyons stood there, sixe on the one side and sixe upon the other upon the sixe steppes, and there was not the like made in any Kingdome, 2 Chron. 9.17. This throne of Salomon was called Soli∣um Domini, because he judged the Lords judgement there; and it differed from that pillar which stood in the Temple, for that was a pulpit in which they read the Law, Suggestus. 2 Chro. 6.13. and it was called [Cijor] but this
throne was called Cisse, and it stood in Domo Libani, thronus. next adjacent to the Queenes Palace; it was made of I∣vory, which was in great request amongst the Iewes; and Salomon alludeth to it, Cant. 4.6.Allusion. thy necke is like a Tower of Ivorie. There were sixe Lyons upon the one side as he went up to his throne, and sixe upon the other,What the Lions signi∣fied on every side of the Throne. a Lyon at e∣very steppe; these Lyons on every side signified that all the twelue tribes were subject to Salomon, and acknow∣ledged him as their King; and the two Lyons which stood before the stayes signified, that the two tribes Iu∣da and Benjamin should not depart from Salomon, but continue with him, and his posteritie, to be stayes to uphold his Kingdome; which was signified by the gar∣ment of Ahija the Shilonite, rent in twelue peices, ten were given to Ieroboam, and two onely left to Rehoboam Salomons sonne, 1 King. 11. And the Iewes write,The admonitiōs which they gaue the King when he ascended to his Throne. In Znorenna P. Shophat. 1  2  3  4  5  6  that as he ascended upon every steppe or degree to his throne, a cryer cryed to him thus; upon the first steppe he cryed, [lo titeh Mishpat] judicium ne inclinato, wrest not judgement; secondly, when he ascended upon the second steppe he cryed un∣to him, [lo tikir panim] personam ne respicit, accept no persons in judgement; when he ascended upon the third steppe, he cryed unto him, [lo tikahh shohher] munus ne recipito, take no bribes; when he ascended upon the fourth steppe, he cryed [lo tittang lech asherah] non plan∣tabis lucum, thou shalt not plant a grove; when he as∣cended upon the fift steppe he cryed unto him [lo takim lech matzebah] noli erigere statuam, set not up a pillar; when he ascended upon the sixt steppe, he cryed unto him [lo tizbahh shor] ne macato bovem, kill not an Oxe, that is, sacrifice not to Idols: as he ascended by degrees, so the admonitions did grow by degrees, from justice to haue a care of religion; and as the Iewes had Psalmos
gradnum, Psalmes of degrees which they sang when they ascended to the Temple; so these were admonitio∣nes graduum, that he should not pervert justice, that he should absteine from Idolatrie, that he should not plant a groue, nor erect a pillar for Idolatrous worship, and that he should not sacrifice to Idols. The twelue Prin∣ces of Israel sat round about this throne; and Christ al∣ludeth to this forme,Allusion. yee shall sit upon twelue thrones, jud∣ging the twelue tribes, Luk. 22.30. A comparison betwixt Salomon and Christ.Now let us compare Salomon with Christ; First, in their name, Salomon was jejidia, beloved of God, but Christ was the onely beloved sonne of his Father. Secondly, in his anointing, Salomon was onely a∣nointed, and all the rest of his brethren secluded from the Kingdome; but we are anointed by Christ, and re∣ceiue grace for grace from him, Ioh. 1.16. and are made coheires with him, Rom. 8.17. in his Kingdome; here is a greater than Salomon. Thirdly, Salomon was crowned his Father being aliue, here was Leo & catulus Leonis, the Lyon and the Lyons whelp; so Christ thought it not robbery to be equall with the Father, and to reigne with him, Phil. 2.6. here is a greater than Salomon. Fourthly, Salomon was obedient to his Parents, so Christ, Ioh. 8.49. I honour my Father, that is, my hea∣venly Father, and he went home and was obedient to his Pa∣rents, Luk. 2.51. Here is a greater than Salomon. Fiftly, by Salomons mariage, friendship was made up betwixt Egypt and Israel; but Christ marrying his Church, friendship is made up betwixt God and man; here is a greater than Salomon. Sixtly, in the extent of his Kingdome, Salomons King∣dome reached but from the Mediterran Sea to Euphra∣tes; but Christs Kingdome reacheth to the ends of the
earth, Psal. 2.8. I will giue thee the ends of the earth for a possession; here is a greater than Salomon. Salomon exceeded all the Princes of the world in ri∣ches;  but in Christ are hid all the treasures of wisedome and knowledge, Col. 2.3. here is a greater than Salomon. Let us compare Salomons pietie and Christs,Christ and Salomon com∣pared in pietie. Salomon  built the Temple; but Christ was both the Temple, Priest, Sacrifice, and Altar; Salomon offered an hun∣dreth thousand Bullockes; but Christ offered a greater Sacrifice, even himselfe upon the Crosse; here is a grea∣ter than Salomon. The Kings of the earth were subject unto him, but  Christ Revel. 17.14. had written upon the hemme of his garment, Rex regum, & Dominus dominantium, the lowest thing which is in Christ, is aboue all the Princes of the earth; here is a greater than Salomon. When Salomon went to the Temple, he had foure and  twentie thousand to guard him with their Targets out of Li∣banus, 1 Chro. 27.1. and 2 Chro. 11.12. and when he went to bed, he had threescore valiant men about him of the va∣liant of Israel, Cant. 3.7. But Christ hath ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands of Angels at∣tending him, Revel. 5.11. here is a greater than Salo∣mon. Let us compare them in their wisedome, Salomon  for his wisedome had a large heart, like the sand of the sea,Christ and Salomon com∣pared in wisedome. 1 King. 4.29. Obserue his wisedome in deciding the matter betwixt the two women, 1 King. 3. the thing was done in the night, there were no witnesses, no probable conjectures favouring the one more than the other, the allegations of the Mothers both alike, no difference be∣tweene the childrens age; Salomon gathered that shee was the mother who had the bowels of compassion to∣wards the infant; Counsell in the heart of man is like deepe waters, but a man of understanding will draw it out. Pro. 20.
5. Salomon by his understanding drew out here who was the mother of the living childe, but he must haue some meanes whereby to know this; but Christ to whom darkenesse is as light, he seeth the secrets of the heart, and all things are naked before him, Heb. 4.13. here is a greater than Salomon. His Iustice in punishing Ioab and putting Abiathar from the Priesthood; but Christ shall put downe all his enemies, and purge his Church of hirelings, Mat. 21.12. here is a greater than Salomon. Lastly, all the earth shall be blessed in Salomon. When the Iewes blesse any man, they pray for him after this manner, Beneficus sit tibi Deus ac liberalis, ut praestitit se erga servum suum Salomonem, this was but fulfilled in type in Salomon; but the truth was fulfilled in Christ, Esa. 65.16. He who blesseth himselfe on the earth, shall blesse himselfe in the God of truth: & he concludeth this Psalme for Salomon, Amen, Amen, Psal. 72.19. Salomon was not he that could effectuate the prayers of the Church; but Christ is that true and faithfull witnesse, who is yea and Amen, Revel. 3.14. Arguments prooving Salomons repentance.Salomon being such a vive type of Christ, whether might he haue beene thought to haue beene a reprobate or not? He cannot be thought to be a reprobate; for first, He was the Penman of the Holy Ghost, & they were holy men, Luk. 1.70. As he spake by his holy Prophets. The Lord heard Salomons prayer, and accepted of his sacrifices, 1 King. 3.6. which he never did in any obla∣tion of the wicked, Esay 1.11.12.13. so Ioh. 9.31. We know that God heareth not sinners,See Pro. 15.8. that is, Impenitent sin∣ners. Thirdly, He is set downe as an example of Imitation, 2 Chro. 11.17. Rehoboam in the first three yeares of his Raigne followed the footsteps of David and Salomon; hence
it followeth,Salomon set downe as an example of good. that Salomon being set downe as an exam∣ple of Imitation for good, that he died a penitent and reconciled to God; and as the evill beginnings of Ma∣nassch, discommended the evill end of Ammon; so the good beginnings of Rehoboam, commended the good end of Salomon. When the Kings of Iuda and Israel are set downe for examples, these Rules are to be observed.Rules to be observed concerning examples. First, when the wicked father liueth in his sinnes, and  dieth in his sinnes, and his sonne is said to walke in his wayes, and follow his example, then the bad sonne died miserably as his father died. 2 King. 15.9. Zachariah is said to haue done that which was evill in the sight of the Lord, as his fathers had done; he departed not from the sinnes of Ieroboam, the sonne of Nebat, who made Israel to sinne. Secondly, when the wicked King repenteth him of  his sinnes, and his bad sonne is said to follow his exam∣ple, then it is to be understood, that he followed his ex∣ample in his first yeares, and sinfull dayes. Example. 2 King. 21.20. it is said of Ammon, that he walked in all the wayes that his father Manasseh walked in, and served Idols which his father Manasseh served; This is to be understood onely of Manassehs first dayes, and not of his last dayes, when he repented him of his wicked∣nesse. Thirdly, when a bad King repented him of his wic∣kednesse,  and his sonne is commended for following of his wayes; then it is to be understood, that he followed him in the end of his life, and not in the beginning; as 2 Chron. 11.17. Rehoboam in the first three yeares of his Reigne followed the footsteps of David and Salomon. Fourthly, If the beginning of a King be good, and his  end bad, then his sonne is never said to walke in his wayes, although he be a good man. Example, Asa be∣gan
well, yet because he fell away, 2 Chron. 10.10. therefore good Iehosaphat is never said to walke in his wayes. And the Lord giueth the reason of this, Ezek. 16.24. When a righteous man turneth away from his righ∣teousnesse, and committeth iniquitie, his former righteous∣nesse shall be no more remembred. And againe, when the wicked turneth away from his wickednesse, and doth that which is lawfull and right, he shall liue. Salomon is censured by the Holy Ghost, not that he had utterly forsaken God, but that he went not fully after the Lord; or that his heart was not perfect as was the heart of David his father. The Conclusion of this is; Salomons Kingdome flou∣rished so long as he followed the Lord; therefore Reli∣gion is a strong pillar like Iakin or Bognaz to uphold a Kingdome; otherwise it will stand but upon brickle feete of yron and clay, as Nebuchadnezzars Image did, Dan. 2.33. CHAPTER IX. Whether Rahab was a betrayer of the Citie of Iericho or not? IOSH. 21. And the Spyes came into an Harlots house, named Rahab, and lodged there, &c. Things objected a∣gainst Rahab for re∣ceiving the Spyes.IT may be said against Rahab, first that shee was an Harlot, and therefore no marvell that she was so rea∣die to betray the Citie in which she was borne, re∣ceiving the Spyes into her house. Secondly, when the King sent unto her, she answered him not as a dutifull Subject ought to haue done, but
hid the Spyes in her house, and let them downe by a Cord through the window, and taught them how to escape, and when the Searchers came to seeke them, she said, she knew not what men they were, or whither they were gone; whereas in the meane time, she had brought them up to the roofe of the house, and hid them with the stalkes of Flaxe, which she had laid upon the roofe in order, Iosh. 2.6. But it may be said in defence of Rahab,  that the know∣ledge which she had from the Lord exempted her from treason, as not being bound any more by the common Law, she becomming now a member of the Church, and so had no more to doe with that Societie wherein she lived before. Grace taketh not away the bonds of nature,  neither doth the Law of God take away the Law of nature,Grace takes not away the bonds of nature. but rather establisheth it, 1 Pet. 2.5. Feare God and obey the King: a King and his Subjects are Infidels, some of his Subjects are converted to the faith, as it fell out in the Apostles dayes, that the Emperors remaining Infidels, yet sundry of their Subjects were converted to the Christian faith. Did their Christianitie loose the bond of obedience which they ought to their Emperour? God forbid; but confirmed it rather, therefore the A∣postle willeth to make all sort of supplication for them, 1 Tim. 2.1. But Rahab was free from the crime of treason,Rahab was free of trea∣son. for first God revealed unto her, that the Israelites were to take this Citie, and destroy it. Secondly, she knew that whether she had discovered the Spyes, or hid them, yet the Citie should be destroyed: wherefore it was best for her in the destruction of the Kingdome which she could not saue, to saue her selfe, and her own houshold; and here she conformed her will to the will of GOD; and as he is no traytor, who yeeldeth an Hold to the
Prince of the Land, although it be contrary to the will of him, who hath commandement over the Hold: so when Rahab yeelded the Citie to the Lord, contrary to the will of the Inhabitants of Iericho, she is not to be re∣puted a betrayer of the Citie for that.Heber made a covenant with the Canaanites and with the Israelites. Heber the Kenite and his wife made a covenant with the Canaanites, and a covenant with the Israelites the people of God; now there was warres betwixt the Israelites and the Canaa∣nites; Sisera the Canaanite flieth into the tent of Iael the wife of Heber the Kenite; What shall she doe in such a case? If she kill Sisera, then she breaketh her covenant with the Canaanites; and if she let Sisera goe f ee, then she will fight against the people of God, and destroy them;Iael had a civill league with the Canaanites, but a civill and spirituall league with the Israe∣lites. here her wisedome teacheth her what to doe, to kill the Canaanite with whom she had onely a civill league, and to saue the Israelites, with whom she had both a spirituall and a civill league. Three sorts of stran∣gers with whom the Israelites had to doe.There were three sorts of the Nations, with some they might haue faedera commerciorum, as David and Sa∣lomon made with the King of Tyrus, 2 Sam. 5.11. 1 King. 5.12. of whom it is said, he made this covenant with them, according to the wisedome which God had given him. So Christ sought water of the woman of Samaria, and David fled to the King of Gath for a refuge. Secondly, there were the Ammonites and the Moabites, Deut. 23.6. Ye shall not seeke their prosperitie all your dayes; that is, ye shall not enter into covenant of friendship with them, but yet Deut. 2.19. they are forbidden to make warre against them. And so the seven Nations they were not to seeke their good, but yet upon submission they were to accept of them. Thirdly, there were the Amalekites, and these they were utterly to destroy. How the law of the de∣stroying of the seven Nations is to be un∣derstood.Rahab was saued, although she was a Canaanitish and one of the seven Nations who were to be destroyed; for that law, that the seven Nations should be destroy∣ed,
should be interpreted by another law, to wit, they were to be destroyed, unlesse they had submitted them∣selues, and became tributaries unto the people of God, Deut. 20.10. When thou commest nigh a Citie to fight a∣gainst it, then proclaime peace unto it; and it shall be, if it make the answere of peace, and open unto thee, then it shall be that all the people that are found therein, shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serue thee. So 1 King. 9.26. And all the people that were left of the Amorites, Hittites, Peri∣zites, Hivites, and Iebusites, which were not of the children of Israel, their children which were left after them in the land,The Canaanites were bond-slaues to Sa∣lomon. whom the children of Israel also were not able utterly to destroy, upon those did Salomon levie a tribute of bond ser∣vice unto this day. And it was the people of the seven Nations, who hardned their hearts, with whom Ioshua tooke not peace, Iosh. 11.19.20. When the Gibeonites came to Ioshua, if they had told him the truth, that they were a people that dwelt a∣mongst them, and that they came not from a farre Countrey, but were Canaanites indeede, and came to seeke their peace, (which they did not for feare) then Ioshua was bound to haue spared their liues upon their submission: and whereas the men of Israel said then, Peradventure yee dwell among us, and how shall wee make a league with you? Iosh. 9.7. The meaning is, we cannot make sociale faedus vobiscum, but onely deditionis, that is,Faedus Sociale. Deditionis. we cannot make a covenant or league of mutual friend∣ship with you, but wee may take you as servants and slaues, if ye submit your selues;Ioshua might make a league of peace with the Canaanites, but not of mutuall friendship. and if it had beene sim∣ply unlawfull to haue made any sort of league with the Canaanites, then the posteritie of Saul would not haue beene punished for the breach of this oath. Ambrose saith well, Pacem quam dederant non censuerant revocan∣dam, quia firmata erat sacramenti religione, nedum alieni perfidiam arguat, suam fidem solveret; that is, they held
that it was not lawfull to break the oath that was made, least finding fault with other mens falshood, he should become perjured himselfe. Ioshua a type of Christ.Ioshua was a type of Christ; as Ioshua sent messengers to the Canaanites to receiue either peace or warre: so the Lord hath sent his Faeciales into the world, to bid them either receiue peace or warre;Rahb a type of the Church. and as Rahab held out a red threed to be a signe that whosoever remained in her house, should be saued; and they who went out of it, should be killed: so there is no salvation to those who are without the Church, which is marked with the bloud of Christ, Act. 2.47. Rahab being the first fruits of the Gentiles, implied that the Gentiles should be re∣ceived into the Church, and be saved. CHAPTER X. Whether the Kingdome of Iudah or Israel were the best Government? IT may seeme at the first, that the Kings of Israel did more formally proceed by way of Iustice,The Kings of Israel proceeded by way of Iustice formally. than the Kings of Iudah did; the Kings of Israel did not pro∣ceed by way of arbitrary Iustice, neither was there any peremptory execution upon the will of the King. When Naboth was to be stoned to death, the matter was hand∣led after a judiciall forme, which might haue given sa∣tisfaction to the ignorant people, who knew not the device and secrecy of the matter.
But the Kings of Iudah proceeded by their absolute authoritie, as may appeare in some of them,The Kings of Iudah proceeded by abso∣lute authoritie. who tooke away their Subjects liues by their absolute authoritie, without any order of law, or processe in Iudgement. David killed the Amalekite; and againe,What things objected to David. he seemeth to haue broken his oath, swearing that nothing should be∣fall Shimei, and yet he biddeth his sonne Salomon put him to death; thou art a wise man,Ioabs worthy deeds reckoned up. Ioab was Davids kins∣man. and knowest what thou hast to doe, 1 King. 2. and so caused to kill Ioab who was Davids neere kinsman, and who had undergone many dangers for the glory of God and the good of the Church, 2 Sam. 10.He gaue many things to the house of the Lord. And he dedicated many of the spoyles which he had taken in the warres to the house of the Lord, 1 Chro. 26.8. he fought for his Countrey all Davids time; he was faithfull to the King, he stood for David against Saul, he followed him still, although he was banished, and at that time when he was made Captaine, 2 Sam. 18.Repressed the sedition of Sheba. he did represse the sedition of She∣ba, even when David would haue put him from his place, and put Amasa in his stead, 2 Sam. 20.4.Disswaded David to number the people. It was he that forbad the King to number the people, 2 Sam. 24. It was he who first invaded Sion, 1 Chron. 11. It was he who by his wisedome taught the woman of Tekoa to obtaine pardon for Absalom;Reconciled Absalom to his father. It was he that was most skilfull in the warres; It was he that fought against the Syrians, and the Amorites,Subdued many wicked Nations. and all the enemies of the Church; and it was he who in modestie when he had gotten the victory, refused to take the praise to himselfe, but sent for the King that he might get the praise of the victorie, 2 Sam. 12.28. He was not  or implaca∣ble; when Abner sought peace at him, he willingly granted it, so did he to the people of Abel, 2 Sam. 20.He had good successe in his warres. He had good successe in the warres, he was a terror to all his enemies, 2 Sam. 10. as to Hadarezer, the Edomites, &c. therefore it may seeme that David by his absolute
authoritie,What things objected to Salomon. caused him to be put to death unworthily. And as for Salomon, he seemeth most unjustly to haue killed his brother Adonijah; for first, he was Davids el∣dest sonne now aliue; secondly, his father loved him most dearely; thirdly, he never did finde fault with him for seeking the Kingdome, and Salomon might seeme here to be too rigorous;Sutnius lib. 9. for Titus a Heathen Prince was more mercifull to his brother,Heathen Kings louing to their brethren. for when his brother did affect the Kingdome, yet notwithstanding he lovingly embraced him, and disswaded him from that course; and Seneca writeth of the like in his first booke of Clemencie, cap. 9. how Augustus spared Cinna, and made him of a foe a friend. David and Salomon Prophets.But if we shall consider that the Kings of Iudah, espe∣cially David and Salomon being directed by the spirit of God immediately, had a better warrant to proceede by their sole authoritie,David in killing the A∣malekite sinned not. than the Kings of Israel had, we shall be of another minde: and where it is objected, that David killed the Amalekite onely upon his owne confession;When one may be con∣demned upon his owne confession. the confession out of ones owne mouth, if it be the confession of one that is well at himselfe, and is not wearie of his life, and if he stand constantly at it, then the confession out of his owne mouth is sufficient, Luk. 19.22. Wicked servant, out of thine owne mouth will I judge thee. Secondly, this Amalekite gloried that he had killed Saul, and so flattered David: and lastly, he was an Amalekite, against whom the Lord had given out sentence long before, that they should all be killed with the sword, and the Lord was wroth with Saul for sparing the Amalekites. David brake not his oath in causing Shi∣mei to be killed.The second thing objected to David, is the breaking of his oath in causing Shimei to be killed, when he had sworne that nothing should befall him; but it was not for his former railing that he was put to death, but for his new transgression; David saith to his sonne Salomon,
Habes apud te, 2 Sam. 28. that is, confine him, and suffer him not to goe abroad; for he is a mightie man, and is able to gather together a thousand of Benjamin, 2 Sam. 19.17. therefore Salomon makes him to sweare that he should never goe beyond the brooke Kedron under the paine of death, and he most willingly assented unto it, yet he brake his oath and went to seeke his fugitiue ser∣vant, and for the breach of this oath, David comman∣deth to put him to death, and Salomon caused to execute him, and after his first transgression, he is kept in ward here, and he is like a fish taken upon the hooke,Simile. but yet not pulled out of the water to be dressed by the Cookes. But Salomon layeth to his charge that sin which was forgiven him, 1 King. 2.42. thou knowest what thou didst to my Father David. Both David and Salomon pardoned this sinne but conditionally, that he should not fall into a new sinne; Shimei had his former fault pardoned condi∣tionally. and even as an old Cicatrix being healed, if it get a new blow, is more dangerous than any other wound; so a fault pardoned, if the man fall into sinne againe aggra∣vateth the sinne more; he was pardoned conditionally onely, that he should not transgresse againe. But it may seeme too great a punishment for so small a fault, going but out to seeke his fugitiue servant. He was guiltie of treason, Shimei how guiltie of treason. in setting light by the Kings commandement, and he bound himselfe by an oath, if he did transgresse. As for the killing of Ioab,David sinned not in causing Salomon to kill Ioab. all the commendations set downe for his prayse are nothing, if yee will compare them with his foule offences; that which he did for his Countrey maketh him not a good man;Ioabs vices. his skill in mi∣litarie discipline, maketh him not a good man, but a good warriour; and justly he deserved death, for he would haue had the Kingdome from Salomon to Ado∣nijah,
hoping thereby to haue gotten preferment under him;He would haue Adoni∣jah to be King. as Abner would haue had the Kingdome from Da∣vid to Ishbosheth, and from Ishbosheth to David againe, onely for his owne advancement: so would Ioab haue Adonijah to haue the Kingdome, hoping thereby to get preferment to himselfe; therefore he was not to be rec∣koned amongst the loyall and faithfull Subjects of the King. And whereas the vertues are reckoned up, wee shall finde moe vices than vertues in him; first we shall see him delight to see one kill another,He delighted to see men kill others. which he thought to haue beene but a sport, 2 Sam. 2.14. And looke to his cruell murthering of Abner and Amasa,He killed Abner and Amasa. he shed the bloud of peace as it had beene in warre: and when Ab∣ner looked for no such thing, he traiterously killed him, neither was he a white moved when he was defiled with their bloud, when he saw the bloud both upon his gir∣dle, and his shooes, he gloried in it; and he was readie to kill Vrijah at the commandement of the King; So he killed Absalom the Kings sonne,He killed Absalom. contrary to the Kings commandement. Wherefore Salomon being a Prince of peace,Why Salomon killed A∣donijah, Ioab, and Shi∣mei. would not haue his servants turbulent like Ioab; but would haue them, as Christ would haue his Disci∣ples, not to seeke fire from heaven to be revenged upon the Samaritans, for then they knew not of what spirit they were, Luk. 9.55. Salomon sinned not in killing Adonijah.Now for Salomons killing of Adonijah, we must not judge rashly of Salomon, who had many excellent vertues in him; the great vertues which were in him, meekenesse,Foure chiefe vertues found in Salomon. veritie, fortitude, and justice, were the foure Horses, as it were, which drew his Chariot, Psal. 45. First,Salomons meekenesse in sparing Adonijah. his meeknesse, he was the Prince of peace, and therefore he pardoned Adonijah, regnum aupicandum a clementia, for this procureth the favour of his subjects; so David would not kill Shimei in the beginning of his
reigne; but Rehoboam that would not gratifie the people in the beginning of his reigne, his Kingdome prospered not. Secondly, his veritie; if thou be a good man,Salomons veritie in kee∣ping his promise to A∣donijah. a haire of thy head shall not fall to the ground. Thirdly, his justice when he failed againe,Salomons fortitude and justice. justly he caused to put him to death. Fourthly, his fortitude; although Ado∣nijah had a great faction which were against Salomon, yet he durst be bold to cause to apprehend him: so Sa∣lomon for Adonijahs second transgression justly caused to execute him, and we are not to measure his heaven∣ly wisedome by the morall vertues which are found in Titus and Augustus; Adonijah was guiltie of treason,How Adonijah was guiltie of treason. for he sought Abishaig onely for that end, that he might get the Kingdome. Secondly, he saith, that the Kingdome belongeth still to him; he was not like good Ionathan, who willingly gaue way to Gods ordinance, he knew well that the Lord had appointed the Kingdome for Salomon, 2 Sam. 7. The sonne which shall come out of thy loynes, shall build thy house, and succeede in the Kingdome: this was spoken after all his other sonnes were borne, & this aggravated all the rest of his sinnes, that he affected the Kingdome, his father being yet a∣liue, and although his father was decrepit, yet he ruled by his Counsellours, and he was not weake in minde now although in bodie. Wherefore wee may conclude,  the Kingdome of Iudah to be the best government, and still to be prefer∣red before the Kingdome of Israell.
CHAPTER XI. Whether the Iewes might chuse Herod for their King or not? DEVT. 17.15. Thou mayst not set a stranger over thee, which is not thy brother. THe Iewes distinguish those who were Gentiles both by father and mother, from those who were borne Iewes. Those who were strangers both by father and mother, they called them Bagbag, by a contraction, Filius Proselyti et Prose∣lyta. for Benger, and Bengerah, that is, fili∣us proselyti & proselytae, and they were called ; but those who were Iewes both by father and mother, were called Hebraei ex Hebreaes, Phil. 3.5. an Hebrew of an Hebrew, that is, both by father and mother they were Hebrewes, and they were called , and . Two sorts of Prose∣lytes.The Proselytes that were converted from Gentilisme to Iudaisme, were of two sorts; if they were newly con∣verted, they were called Gerim, which the Seventie translate ; Extrantus  Inhabitans.  Inquilinus. if they had dwelt long amongst them, then they were called Toshibhim, inquilini, and the Seventie translate them , as yee would say, Pari∣shioners; such a stranger was Achir, Iudith 14. who be∣leeved in God and was circumcised. Those Proselytes who were converted to the faith, and continued in the faith of their Parents, Gentilis fun∣damentalis.  Iudigena. they were called [Goignikkere] Gentiles fundamentales, that is, Gen∣tiles who embraced the grounds of Religion, and these became [Ezrahhim] Indigenae. When the Proselytes might enter into the Congregation.These Proselytes although they were converted, yet they might not enter into the Congregation untill the
third generation, that is, they might beare no publicke charge untill that time. God himselfe distinguished the Edomite and the E∣gyptian from other strangers, Deut. 23.7.Edomites and Egyptians distinguished from o∣ther strangers. He will not haue his people to account them as other strangers, Thou shalt not abhorre an Edomite, because he is thy brother; and hence we may see,The reasons why Herod might be King. why the Iewes might choose Herod for their King: First, because he was an Idumean their brother; secondly, because he was the sonne of Parents who were Proselytes, Antipar & Antipas both Proselytes: Thirdly, he himselfe was a Iew by profes∣sion, and standing in the third generation, therefore he might enter into the Congregation, and they might choose him for their King. Herodiani certaine wicked Iewes tooke Herod for their Messias, now if Herod had not beene accounted a Iew, they would never haue ac∣knowledged him for their Messias. The name of a Iew is taken sometimes largely,The name [Iew] taken strictly or largely. and sometimes strictly; when it is taken largely, it compre∣hendeth all which were Iewes by profession, Esth. 8.17. many became Iewes. Sometimes againe it is taken more strictly for those Iewes who dwelt on the west side of Iordan, and they were called Iudaei Hierosolymitani, the Iewes that dwelt about Ierusalem, Luk. 3.1. Pilate was governour of Iuda, and Herod of Galilie; Iuda here is strictly taken; but sometimes Herod is called King of the Iewes, here it is largely taken, Mat. 2.1. So the name [Gentile] is taken sometime strictly,The name (Gentile) ta∣ken strictly or largely. as Paul applieth it to the converted Gentiles, Galat. 2.12. but when Christ said, Goe not into the way of the Gentiles, Mat. 10.5. Here it is taken largely, for all the Gentiles. But Iosephus calleth Herod but a private man,Lib. 14 cap. 11. &c. 17. there∣fore it may seeme that the Iewes never acknowledged Herod for their King, and the Iewes said of Herod, Quòd non est rex, ne{que} filius regis.
Why Herod was called a private man.The reason why he was called a private man was this, because he was not descended of the Priests; for at that time the posteritie of David carried no sway amongst the people, but onely the posteritie of the Priests, and whosoever were not Priests, Populus terra. were called [Gnim haaretz] populus terrae, see Iosephus lib. 14. cap. 12. If yee will respect Herods first descent, then he may be called Alienigena, and not Iudaeus; in his first descent he is , and transcriptus, and his Kingdome may be called Malcoth Hagerim, the reigne of a stranger, but because Herods father, and grandfather were not alto∣gether strangers from the people of God (for they were Edomites and Proselytes) therefore he was not recko∣ned as a stranger: but it fell out amongst the Iewes, as it did amongst the Romanes and Athenians, that those who were , and adscriptitij, were alwayes hated of those who were naturall and inbred Citizens: So the Iewes hated those who were Proselytes, because of the old hatred that was betwixt the Iewes and the Gentiles; and they made a Canon amongst them, Vt caverent sibi in decimam generationem a Proselytis. We may conclude this point then, that the Iewes might safely choose Herod for their King now, being a Iew by profession, and descended of Parents who were Iewes by profession: and the latter Iewes distinguished not well betwixt Ger and Goi, who reckoned Herod ever to be a stranger.
CHAPTER XII. Whether Ishbosheth was a Rebell in affecting the Kingdome or not? 2 Sam. 2.8. But Abner the sonne of Ner, Captaine of Sauls Host, tooke Ishbosheth the sonne of Saul, and brought him over to Mahanaim, and he made him King over Gilead, &c. IT may be said of Ishbosheth,Their reasons who hold that Ishbosheth sinned not in taking the Kingdome. that he was no Rebell in accepting of the Kingdome after his father Saul was dead; for first, he was his fathers eldest sonne now liuing; and by the law of Nations, the first borne, or he that was in place of the first borne, did succeede,The first borne by the law of Nations succee∣ded in the Kingdome. Exod. 11.5. and 1 King. 2.15. And so amongst the Edo∣mites, the first borne succeeded in the Kingdome, 2 King. 3.27. he tooke his eldest sonne who should haue reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. Secondly, Ishbosheth had the consent almost of all the people, for eleven tribes acknowledged him for their King. Thirdly, he had good successe amongst his Subjects;The successe that Ish∣bosheth had. first, in Mahanaim; then amongst the Giliadites; thirdly, amongst the Ashurites; fourthly, in Izreel; fiftly, in Iu∣da and Benjamin; and lastly, over all Israel, 2 Sam. 2.9. Fourthly, he reigned seven yeares amongst them, and by that it may seeme, that it was a setled Kingdome. The thing that may be alledged against him is this,  that Mephibosheth was the sonne of the eldest brother, and therefore by right should haue succeeded before him. But Mephibosheth was a lame man,  and an impo∣tent
creature, and was not fit for Government, and therefore by right the Kingdome succeeded to Ishbo∣sheth.Inst. And if it be said, that David was appointed King by the Lord, we may say, that Ishbosheth knew nothing of this,  and he was in bonafide: and moreover, David calleth him a righteous person, 2 Sam. 4.9. therefore it may seeme that he did not usurpe or affect the King∣dome wrongfully. Ishbosheth compared with Ieroboam in affe∣cting the Kingdome.Now let us compare Ishbosheths affecting of the King∣dome, and Ieroboams affecting of the Kingdome; Iero∣boam had the word of the Lord by Ahija the Prophet that he should be King, and he confirmed it unto him by a signe, in renting of the Cloke in twelue peices, thus much he had from the Lord; but he was a wicked and prophane man, and got the hearts of the people ra∣ther by discontentment and mutinie than by heartie good will, and herein Ishbosheth farre exceeded him. Againe, Ieroboams affecting of the Kingdome might seeme to be a revenge; for he fled away to Egypt from Salomon as a traytor, and now to be revenged upon his sonne, he draweth away the ten Tribes from him, and so Ishbosheths entering to the Kingdome seemeth to be better than his. Ishbosheth notwithstanding of all that is said for him cannot be excused; he was his fathers eldest sonne, but the Kingdome goeth not alwayes by succession,Ishbosheth cannot be ex∣cused for affecting the Kingdome. it plea∣seth God to change this forme sometimes, as David was chosen King and not his eldest brother, and so was Salomon chosen and not Adonijah. And if it had come by succession, then Mephibosheth should haue succeeded and beene preferred before him, for although he was lame in his feete, yet he was not lame in his mind. And where it is said, that he had the consent of all the peo∣ple, their consent is nothing without the consent of the superiour God himselfe, by me Kings reigne, Pro. 8.9.
God had declared long before,Saul could not be igno∣rant that David should be King. that Saul should not reigne, but that David should reigne, and Ionathan gaue way to it, therefore he could not be ignorant of this, but being blinded by presumption, and misled by craf∣tie Abner (who thought in effect to be King himselfe) he affected the Kingdome. And whereas David calleth him a righteous person;Iustitia causae. personae. we must distinguish inter justitiam causae, & justitiam personae, betwixt the righteousnesse of his cause, & the righteousnesse of his person, although he was otherwise a good man, yet he had not a good cause in hand; and if we shall joyne his cause and his death together, we may thinke that it was a just punish∣ment of his Rebellion; for he was murthered by Baanah and Rechab upon his bed in his bed-chamber, 2 Sam. 4.7. The conclusion of this is;  He that affecteth Gods Kingdome in the heaven, & he who affecteth his Kings throne upon the earth, shall both miserablie perish; and as God vindicateth his owne honour when any man claimeth it; so he vindicateth the honour of the King, if any man affect it. Feare God, honour the King. 1 Pet. 2.17. CHAPTER XIII. Whether it was lawfull for the Iewes to pay tribue to Caesar or not? MAT. 22.17. Tell us therefore, what thinkest thou? Is it lawfull to pay tribute to Caesar? THe Iewes who were a people alwayes subject to rebellion and mutinie,The Iewes a people prone to rebellion. propounded this question to Christ, Is it lawfull for us to pay tribute to Caesar
or not?The speech of the Iewes in defence of their li∣bertie. As if they should say, we haue alwayes beene a free people, to whom many Nations haue payd tribute; we are a people who are commanded to pay our tithes and first fruits onely to the Lord. The Lord comman∣ded us to choose a King of our selues and not a stranger, Deut. 17. How shall we then pay to Caesar who is but a stranger? Caesar hath taken us violently, and made us captiues, & daily his Publicans most unjustly oppresse us; how then shall we pay tribute to him? and shall we giue him this penny which hath an Image upon it, con∣trary to the law of God which forbiddeth Images? And when we pay this wayes head by head this pennie to him, it maketh the Romanes insult over us, as if we were negligent of the worship of our God, & worship∣pers of a false God. Who can abide to see how these Romanes haue abused, and doe still abuse the Temple of God? And how Pompey and Crassus haue robbed the Temple? And how they exact of us that penny that should be payd onely to the Lord? And if any Nation in the world haue a priviledge to free themselues from the slavery and bondage of strangers, most of all haue we Iewes, who are Gods peculiar people; and we would gladly know, Master, what is thy judgement in this case, and we will stand to thy determination; if thou bid us giue it, we will giue it; but if thou forbid us, we will stand to our libertie, and vindicate our selues, as the Macchabees our Predecessors haue done.The Pharisies with the Herodians sought to in∣trap Christ. The Herodi∣ans came here with the Pharisies to Christ, waiting what word might fall from him; If Christ should haue an∣swered any thing contrarie to the Romane power, then the Herodians would haue fallen upon him; or if he had said at the first, giue this tribute to Caesar, then the Iewes would haue fallen upon him, as an enemy to their liber∣tie. So they thinke to ensnare him what way soever he answered. But the Lord who catcheth the craftie in
their owne craft, doth neither answer affirmatiuely nor negatiuely, but faith, Why tempt yee me? shew me a pen∣ny, and he asked them, whose Image and superscription is upon the penny? they say Caesars; then our Lord infer∣reth, that they were bound to pay it unto Caesar. And Christ reasoned thus; Those which are Caesars, and be∣long not unto God, should be given to Caesar; but this penny is such; therefore it should be given to Caesar. The Assumption is proved, because tribute belongeth to the Conquerour, and he coyneth the money, & put∣teth his Image upon it, in token of his Dominion over the Subjects, and they should pay it unto him as a to∣ken of their subjection. Shew me a penny. This was not the penny which was commanded to be payed to the Lord yearely. The Iewes payed a threefold halfe shekell to the Lord.The Iewes under the Law payed a threefold halfe shekell. The first was called Argentum animarum, Exod. 30.2. which every one payed for the redemption of his life. The second was Argentum transeuntis, that is, the halfe shekell which they payed to the Lord, when they were numbered head by head, 2 King. 12.5. The third was that halfe shekell which they offered freely unto the Lord. This halfe shekell had Aarons rod upon the one side, and the pot with Manna upon the other; and when they were under the Romans, or captiues under any o∣ther forraine Princes, the Maisters of their Synagogues used to gather this halfe shekell of them yearely, and send it to Ierusalem to the high Priest. This was not the penny which Caesar craved of them,This tribute which Cae∣sar exacted was not the halfe shekell which was due to the Lord. for it had Caesars I∣mage and superscription upon it. Neither would the Lord haue bidden them giue that to Caesar, which was due to God. This Didrachma which they payed to Caesar was as much in value, as the halfe shekell; and Christ himselfe although he was free and the Kings sonne,Christ payd this tribute. yet he payed
it for himselfe and for Peter, Mat. 17.27. And so Mary when Christ was in her wombe went to Bethlehem to pay this tribute to Caesar. Luk. 2.5. This Image set upon Caesars money was not contrary to that, thou shalt not make to thy selfe any graven Image; for it was not made for a religious use, but for a civill use. This penny which Caesar exacted of the Iewes was but Denarius, (Denarius, Didrachma, and Numisma, were all one) this Denarius was the ordinarie hire of a work∣man for a day, Mat. 20.2. and the daily wages of a Souldier, as Tacitus saith. What if the Romane Empe∣rour had exacted as much of them as Pharaoh did of their Predecessors? What if he had done to them as Salomon did to their Predecessors in his old age? or as Rehoboam did to them, whose little finger was heavier than his fathers loynes? What ingratitude was this for them to grudge for paying so little a tribute to the Em∣perour who kept them in peace,Caesar was more milde to the Iewes than Pha∣raoh or Rehoboam. who kept Legions, and Garrisons of Souldiers, to defend them from the Ara∣bians and Parthians? he did not make them to worke in bricke and clay, as the Egyptians did their predecessors, neither tooke he their liberties from them; he permit∣ted them to keepe their Sabboths,He permitted them to use their liberties. Circumcision, and their Synedria, their Synagogues, and ; and Dion testifieth of Augustus, that when he gaue comman∣dement to take tribute of the Iewes, that it should not be taken from them upō their Sabbath, but they should delay it till the next day. Now for all these benefits had they not reason to pay this tribute to Caesar? Men should not repine after they are become subject.Men may defend themselues and stand for their liber∣tie, but when they are once conquered, no place to re∣pine. Agrippa (as Iosephus testifieth) in his speech to the Iewes, who were called Zelotae for their preposterous desire that they had to free themselues from subjection
to the Romanes, said unto them after this manner, Intem∣pestivum est nunc libertatem concupiscere, olim ne ea amitte∣retur, certatim eportuit; nam servitutis periculum facere, du∣rum est; & ne id subeatur, honesta certatio est, at qui semel subactus, despicit; non libertatis amans ducendus est, sed servus contumax; that is, it is our of time now to de∣sire your liberty, yee should haue rather long since stri∣ven not to haue lost it; for it is a hard thing to under∣goe servitude, and it is a lawfull strife to withstand it; but when a man is once overcome & yeelded himselfe, & then rebelleth, he is not said to be a lover of his liber∣ty, but to be a rebellious subject. And Iosephus saith, Qui victi sunt & longo tempore paruerunt, si jugum rejecerint, faciunt quod desperatorum hominum est, & non quod liber∣tatis amantium est, those who are once overcome and haue served a long time, if they shake off the yoke, they play the part of desperate men, and not of those who loue their libertie. Now let us conclude this;  giue unto God that which is Gods, and to Caesar that which is Caesars, Math. 22. Homo est nummus Dei, because he carrieth Gods Image,Man is Gods penny, stamped with his I∣mage. giue to him that penny which was lost, Luk. 16. Light the Candle, sweepe the house, finde it out, and giue to him: and giue unto Caesar that which is Caesars. Pro. 24.21. Feare God and honour the King. Giue not divine honour to the King, as the Herodians did, who cryed the voyce of God and not of man. Say not, Divisum Imperium cum Iove Caesar habet, neither under pretext of Religion, withdraw that from the King which is due unto him, as the Essaeni did, and the Pharisies would haue done, but keepe an equall midst betwixt them both, and re∣moue not the ancient markes, Prov. 23.10.
CHAPTER XIIII. Whether Naboth might haue justly denyed to sell his Vineyard to Ahab, or not? 1 King 21.3. And Naboth said to Ahab, the Lord forbid it me, that I should giue the inheritance of my fathers unto thee. NABOTH justly refused to sell his Vineyard to Ahab, it being his fathers inheritance; no man in Israel might sell his inheritance, because the Is∣raelites were but the Lords , or Farmers, the in∣heritance was the Lords,The Israelites might not sell their land simple. Levit. 25.23. the Land shall not be sold for ever, for the Land is mine, for yee are strangers and sojourners with me; therefore it was called Emmanu∣els Land, Esay 8.8. All that the Israelites might doe was this, they might morgage their land, but simplie they might not sell it, because the Inheritance was the Lords. But it may be said Iere. 32.9. I bought the field of Ha∣nameel my Vncles sonne that was in Anatboth, and I weigh∣ed him the money for it, even seventeene shekels of silver. By the little price which Ieremiah gaue for this field in Anathoth (being but seventeene shekels) it may be ga∣thered that this was not a simple alienatiō of the ground,Hanameel did not sell his land, but morgaged it to Ieremiah. but onely a morgaging of it; wherefore his vncle or his vncles children might haue redeemed this land from Ieremiah, and Ieremiah was bound to haue restored this Land to them againe: neither doth the publicke writing of this Instrument proue the selling of the Land simply, and the full dominion of it, but utile dominium for the
time, as he who hath a peice of Land in morgage, may morgage it againe to another, but not simplie sell it. But it may be said,  that David bought the inheritance of mount Moriah from Arauna the Iebusite, therefore the simple right of the ground might be sold. It was permitted to the Iewes to sell a house within a walled Citie,  What houses or land the Iewes might sell. and the Gardens or Orchards belonging unto it; but they might not sell their grounds and Vine-yards, neither the houses nor the villages which haue no wals round about them, for they were reckoned as the fields in the Countrey. Secondly, this Hill Moria which was sold, was sold by a Iebusite, and not by an Israelite; and the ceremoniall Lawes of the Iewes obli∣ged not the Iebusites. Thirdly, this was an extraordina∣ry case, this ground was sold for the building of the Temple, and David would not haue it without a price. It may be said,  that the chiefe Priests tooke the thirtie pieces of silver and bought a Potters field with it to bury strangers in, Mat. 27.7. therefore they might sell a field, for they bought this field to bury strangers in it. First, this field was not a fruitfull field,  but a place where the Potters made pots; and it seemeth that this field was adjacent to some poore house; So Ioseph of A∣rimathea being of another tribe than those of Ierusalem (for Arimathea, or Rama was in the tribe of Ephraim; but a great part of Ierusalem, with Mount Calvarie and Iosephs Garden, wherein he had his Tombe, was in the tribe of Benjamin) yet he bought a Garden being neere Ierusalem, and the Hill Calvarie, because it was a thing which belonged to the house within the walled Citie. If a man might not sell his inheritance in Israel,  how could the Kings themselues inlarge their possessions, or haue places of pleasure proper for themselues? but we reade that the Kings of Iuda & Israel had Orchards and Gardens, and places of buriall proper to themselues,
which was a part of their peculium, or proper right. The Kings might haue Orchards and Gardens pro∣per to themselues, & places of pleasure, but they might not buy the propertie of any mans Land or Vineyard; Wherefore Naboth said well, God forbid it me that I should sell my fathers inheritance: they were but usu∣fructuarij, but the Lord was Dominus fundi, and he that hath no right to himselfe, cannot make a right to ano∣ther. Why might they sell their houses within a walled Citie, and not their fields and grounds in the Country? Levit. 25.13. The reason why they might sell their houses within the walled Ci∣ties.The reason was this, they might not sell their grounds, that their possessions might be kept still distinct; but because many came to dwell in the walled Cities, and the houses were not so distinguished as the grounds and Vineyards, therefore they might sell them: this was al∣so done in favour of the Proselytes, that they might haue a dwelling amongst the people of God. The conclusion of this is; as the Israelites when they morgaged their Land, they had not power simplie to sell it, because the propertie was the Lords; therefore it was to returne unto him in the yeare of the Iubile: So, although the children of God morgage their part of the heavenly Canaan, yet because the right is the Lords, it shall returne to them in the yeare of that great Iubile.
CHAPTER XV. Whether the Iewes should be tolerated in a Christian Common-wealth or not? ROM. 11.23. And they also, if they abide not still in unbeliefe, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graffe them in againe. THere may be many reasons alledged, why this sort of people should not be tolerated amongst Christians. First, if yee respect their profession and Religion, they are to be secluded from us Christians; and second∣ly, in respect of their dealing with us in their civill con∣tracts and bargaining. As for their Religion. First, they detest us Christi∣ans who professe Christ, for Christs cause. Secondly, they hold many damnable and blasphemous opinions concerning Christ; first, for his forerunner Iohn the Baptist; secondly, they hate Marie the Mother of our Lord Iesus Christ; thirdly, they oppose themselues a∣gainst Christs natures; fourthly, against his Offices, King, Priest, and Prophet; fiftly, against his death up∣on the crosse; sixtly, against his resurrection; seventhly, they oppose themselues to his imputed righteousnesse; and lastly, to his Gospell, and they expect a glorious Messias to come. First, in detestation of Christ, they detest us Christi∣ans, they call us [Goijm] Gentes and Edomites, vastavit. and when they would welcome a Christian, they say welcome Shed, that is, Devill,The Iewes detest Chri∣stians. hinking that the common people understand not the word; and they curse us Christians
daily, anathema sit externis in serpente, that is, they wish that we who are without their societie, may be execra∣ble as the Serpent. But they detest those most of all who are converted from Iudaisme to Christianitie, and they pray three times in the day against them, morning, midday, and e∣vening, and thus they pray, Ne sit quies Apostatis, ne{que} spes. The Iewes expect Elias to come.Secondly, they expect Elias Tishbites to be the fore∣runner of their Messias; and when they cannot resolue their hard questions to their Schollers, they say, Tishbi solvet nodos, that is, when Elias Tishbites shall come, he will resolue all doubts, but Elias is come alreadie, and they haue done to him whatsoever they listed, Math. 17.12. They hate Marie the Mother of Christ, and they call her [Mara] bitternesse, and the herbe called Herba Ma∣riae, by them is called Herba suspensi, because Marie bare Christ, who was crucified upon the Crosse: so a peice of money called grossa Mariae, they called it in despite, grossa suspensi. The Iewes deny the two natures of Christ.Then they deny the two natures of Christ, for they deny his God-head, inceptum est nomen Iehova profanari. Targum Hierosolymitanum paraphraseth it thus, illi caepe∣runt idola colere, & fecerunt sibi Deos erroneos, quod cogno∣minabant de sermone domini, he understandeth here blas∣phemously Christ, calling him Deum erroneum, whom the Scripture call . Of old they said Deus sanctus & domus Iudicij ejus fecerunt hominem, by the house of Iudgement they meant the trinity of persons, for all the inferior house of Iudgment consisted of three, and they said Duorum non est judicium, so the Chaldie paraphrast paraphraseth the trinitie of persons by this paraphrase; but now, the Iewes doe set themselues against this, and they deny it flatly.
They set themselues against his offices;The Iewes set thēselues against the offices of Christ. he was anoin∣ted King, Priest, and Prophet [Hameshiah] that excellent Prophet, but in detestation of Christ, they will not call their Tardigradum, or slow-comming Christ Messiah, but  delibutum, they hate so the name of Christ. They mocke the Kingly office of Christ, Mat. 27.19. they put a crown of thornes upō his head for a crowne; and they put a reed in his hand for a Scepter: So they mocke his Priestly office, he saved others, let him saue himselfe, Vers. 40. and his Propheticall office, Prophesie thou O Christ, who is he that smiteth thee. Mat. 26.68. So they mocke his death, and his crucifying upon the Crosse, they call Christs crosse the Woofe and the Warpe, and so mystically when they speake one to ano∣ther amongst Christians, they call Christ the Woofe and the Warpe. They deny the resurrection of Christ, Mat. 28.15. and it is noysed abroad amongst them unto this day, that Iesus Christ was stolen away by his Disciples, and that he did not rise againe. So they oppose his imputed righteousnesse, and they say, that every fox must pay his owne skin to the flayer, and they say, sit mors mea expiatio cunctarum transgressio∣num mearum. And lastly they oppose themselues against his Gos∣pell, they call  [Aven gilajon] nuntium vanum. Secondly, if ye will respect their dealing with us in civill matters: they are worthy to be secluded from the societie of Christians. They care not to forsweare themselues to us Chri∣stians, they are most mercilesse usurers in exacting from the Christians, and they who professe Physicke amongst them, care not to poyson Christians, whom they call [Goijm,] Gentiles. And if we shall adde further, that no false Religion
should be tolerated, and the Lord commanded here∣tickes to be put to death, how then should they be suf∣fered in a Christian Common-wealth? What Iewes may be suf∣sered in a Common-wealth, and who not.But we must put a difference betwixt these miscreants who raile against the Lord Iesus Christ, and blaspheme his name; and those poore wretches who liue in blind∣nes yet, but do not raile blasphemously against Christ; those we should pitie:The reasons that should moue us to pitie the Iewes. First, we should pitie them for their fathers cause the Patriarchs. Secondly, we should pitie them, because Christ is come of them who is bles∣sed for ever; thirdly, the Oracles of God were com∣mitted to them, Rom. 3.2. and the law was the inheri∣tance of Iacob, Deut. 33.4. they were faithfull keepers of the same to others, and they were like a lanterne who held out the light to others, although they saw not with it themselues. Fourthly, when we Gentiles were out of the Covenant they prayed for us, Cant. 8.8. We haue a little sister, what shall we doe for her? So when they are out of the Covenant; We haue an Elder brother, Luk. 16. what shall we doe for him? And lastly, because of the hope of their conversion, that they shall be graffed in againe, Rom. 11. Some Christian Common-wealths admit them, but with these Caveats. First, that they submit themselues to the positiue Lawes of the Countrie wherein they liue. Secondly, that they raile not against Christ, and be not offensiue to the Christians. Thirdly, that they be not suffered to marrie with the Christians to seduce them. Fourthly, that they be not permitted to exhaust Chri∣stians with their usurie. Fiftly, that they be not admitted to any publicke charge, and that they be distinguished from the rest of the people by some badge or by their apparell: with
these Caveats, sundry Common-wealths haue admit∣ted them. CHAPTER XVI. Of the Synedrion of the Iewes. MAT. 5.22. But I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of the Iudgement, and whosoever shall say to his brother Raca, shall be in danger of the Councell. THis word, Synedrion, is a greeke word, but chan∣ged and made a Syriack word, , are sitters in judgement, and Sanhedrin, are the Iudges who sat in the Councell, and the place it selfe was called Sy∣nedrion. In the Syriack, Domus judiciorum,The difference betwixt Domus judiciorum and Domus Iudicum. and Domus Iudi∣cum differunt: Domus judiciorum is the house where the Counsellers met, and Domus Iudicum according to the Syriack and Chaldy phrase, Domus Iudicum.  Domus judicij. signifieth the Iudges them∣selues. So the Chaldees when they expresse the Trini∣tie, they call it Domus Iudicij, because there were three that sat in their lesser Iudicatorie; and when Beth dina signifieth the Iudges themselues, it hath the point aboue judh, but when it signifieth the place of Iudgement, it hath the point under judh. There were two sorts of these Synedria amongst the Iewes, the great Councell and the lesser, the great Coun∣cell was called anhedrin Gedolah, and the lesser was cal∣led Sanhedrin Ketannah. The great Synedrion sate at Ierusalem onely, the lesser
Synedria sat in other places also, and they were called , judicia. Allusion. Vide Guilel Schickar∣dum de jure regio, & Ludovic: de Dieu.The great Synedrion sat in Ierusalem onely, and Christ alludeth to this, Mat. 23.37. A Prophet might not die out of Ierusalem. So, O Ierusalem, Ierusalem, which killest the Prophets, Mat. 23.37. The great Synedrion judged one∣ly of a Prophet. The great Synedrion divided into fiue parts.But Gabinius the Proconsul of Syria, divided this great Synedrion which sat onely at Ierusalem into fiue parts, whereof he placed one at Ierusalem, another in Gadara, the third in Amathus towards the red Sea, the fourth in Iericho, and the fift he placed in Sephra in Galilie. And Christ meant of these Councels when he sayes, they will deliver you up to the Councels, Mat. 10.17. At this time the great Synedrion was divided into fiue parts. They shall deliver you up to the Councels, and they will scourge you in their Synagogues;What meant by Syna∣gogues and Councels. by their Synagogues he meant their Ecclesiasticall Iudicatories, & by the Coun∣cels their civill. The number that sat in this great Iudicatorie were se∣ventie and two, six chosen out of every tribe; but for making the number round, they are called Seventie: the Scripture useth sometimes when the number is not full,Retundatio numeri quid? to expresse the full number, as Iudg. 11.5. Abime∣lech killed his brethren which were threescore and ten per∣sons, there were but threescore and nine of them, for Io∣tham fled. So Gen. 42.13. Thy servants are twelue bre∣thren, the sonnes of one man; although Ioseph was thought to be dead, yet, to make up the number, because he had once twelue sonnes, they are called the twelue sonnes of Iacob. So Num. 14.33. And your children shall wander in the Wildernesse fortie yeares, according to the number of the dayes that the Spyes searched the Land; this was spoken to them two yeares after they came out of Egypt; yet the number is made up here, and it is called fortie yeares.
So 1 Cor. 15.5. He was seene of the twelue; there were but eleven of them at this time, for Iudas was dead, and Mat∣thias was not chosen as yet; yet he calleth them twelue, because they were once twelue, to make up the num∣ber. Sometimes againe although there be moe for ma∣king round the number, they take away some, as Luke 10.1. the Syriack hath it, the seventie two Disciples, yet it is translated the seventie Disciples. So the Seventie two who translated the Bible, are called the Seven∣tie. The Lord charged Moses to gather Seventie of the Elders of Israel, Moses said, how shall I doe this? If I shall choose sixe out of every Tribe, then there shall be sixty and two;The uncertaine conje∣cture of Sol: Iarchi con∣cerning their Election of the Seventie. and if I shall choose but fiue out of eve∣ry Tribe, then there will be ten wanting; and if I shall choose sixe out of one Tribe, and but fiue out of ano∣ther Tribe, that will breed but strife amongst them. What doth he then? He made choise of sixe out of e∣very Tribe, and he brought forth seventie two blanke papers; upon seventie of the papers, Senex. he wrote [Zaken] senex; and upon the two that remained, hee wrote [Hhelek] pars. Pars. Now when the Tribes drew their Lots out of the Boxe, he who drew [Zaken] senex, Moses said unto him, Antea sanctificavit te deus benedictus; but he who drew [Hhelek] pars, he said unto him, Non cupit te deus. The Hebrewes say, that Eldad and Medad, Num. 11.26. were of those who were written, but they went not out into the Tabernacle, because they drew [Hhe∣lek] pars; but not [Zaken] senex, they were inter con∣scriptos (say they) but not inter electos; and so the num∣ber seventie is made up without them. There were two Presidents in this Councell;Two Presidents in the Councell.  Princeps. the first chosen in respect of his power, dignitie, and wisedome, and he was called [Nashi] princeps, and [Rosh hajeshibhah] Pater consessus, Pater Consessus. and he it was (as the Iewes say) that suc∣ceeded
Moses,The order how they sat in Iudgement. who was the principall and the chiefe in the Councell; and upon his right hand sat he who was greatest amongst the seventie, and he was called [Abh beth din] pater consistorij; Pater Consistorij. the rest sat according to their dignitie and age next to the Prince; and they sat in a circuit or a halfe Moone, that both the Presidents might haue them in their sight. The time when they sat in these Iudicatories.The time when they sat; the great Iudicatorie sat e∣very day except on the Sabbath, and festivall dayes; and when they sat, the little Synedrion sat but from the morning Sacrifice untill the sixt houre, that is, untill our twelue; but the great Synedrion sat from the morning Sacrifice untill the evening Sacrifice, that is, untill our three of the clocke in the afternoone. What matters were jud∣ged in the great Syne∣drion.The matters which they judged in this Iudicatorie, were matters of greatest weight; as to judge of a false Prophet, when to make warres, appointing Magistrates for inferior Cities; so for cutting off of a Tribe, and pu∣nishing the high Priest, and whether an Apostate Citie should be raised and cast downe or not; and they say, that none might giue the bitter waters to the woman suspected of Adulterie but this Iudicatorie, Num. 5.29. So they say, when a man was killed, and the killer not knowne, none might measure from the place where the man was killed to the next Citie, Deut. 21.7. but the Elders of the great Synedrion, this case was onely tryed by them; So the raising up seed to his brother, and pul∣ling off his shoe, if he refused, these were tryed by the great Synedrion. Bellarmines argument to proue the Pope to be aboue secular Iudges.Bellarmine the Iesuite to proue the Pope to be aboue secular Iudges, alledgeth Deut. 17.12. The man that doth presumptuously, and will not hearken unto the Priest, and to the Iudge, even that man shall die. Here he saith, the Magistrate doth onely execute the sentence of the Priest.
But first, ex decreto judicis, is not in the originall,  but according to the sentence of the Law, Deut. 17.11. and the word should be read disjunctivè, He that hearkeneth not unto the Priest or unto the Iudge, &c. And by the Priest here is understood, not onely the high Priest, but other Priests, Vers. 9. When the high Priest and the Iudges sat together, then he that hearkened not to the sentence given by the Iudge, and interpreted by the Priest, was to die; so he who hearkened not unto the Iudge, al∣though the Priest was not there, was to die; for these Iudicatories which are conjoyned, are sometimes di∣stinguished. Deut. 17.12. 2 Chro. 19.8. and they must be interpreted respectiuely, as the Lawyers speake. In the lesser Iudicatorie,When they might judge of capitall crimes in the lesser Iudicatorie. they might not judge of a capitall crime, unlesse they were twentie three a full number, so they judged of a beast that had killed a man or lien with a woman, to be put to death, Levit. 20.16. The seventie whom Moses chose now at the comman∣dement of the Lord, Num. 11.25.The difference betwixt the seventie which Mo∣ses chose, and the seven¦tie which were chosen at the direction of Ie∣thro. differed from the se∣ventie whom he chose at the commandement of Iethro, Exod. 18. they excelled the former seventie far in gifts, for they had the spirit of Moses upon them, and as the Mantle of Elijah when it was put about Elisha, then the spirit came upon him;The spirit of Moses was not diminished when it was put upon the se∣ventie. so came the spirit of Moses upon the seventie; and the spirit of Moses was not diminished when it came upon the seventie, but the spirit of Moses in that houre was like the middle lamp of the Candle∣stick, from the middle Lamp the rest were lighted, but the light of this Lamp was not diminished: so the spirit of Moses was not diminished when it came upon the se∣ventie. Moses spirit of judgement was upon them all, but not his other gifts; as Moses was mightie in words and deed, but not they. Moses was the meekest man in the world, but not they. One Moses ruling in a Councell will make it famous, but to haue seventie like Moses sit∣ting
in a Councell, (for they had the same spirit of ru∣ling which Moses had) that made it to excell all the Councels in the world, even Areopagus in Athens, and the Senate in Rome, and if we shall marke the unitie that was in this Councell, then we shall more admire it. Whether had the Seventie this gift of Prophesie con∣tinually or not? They prophesied for a day, but no more; therefore the Text said, Prophetarunt & non addiderunt, i.e. prophe∣tare;The seventy which Mo∣ses chose had not this gift of Prophesie con∣tinually. and so the phrase is used by the Hebrewes, Gen. 8.12. Non addidit redire, She returned not againe; so 1 Sam. 15. Non addidit Samuel redire ad Saulem, that is, he saw him no more; so Prophetarunt et non addiderunt, that is, they prophesied that day and no more. The conclusion of this is, the Lord did sit here in the midst of this great judicatorie, and he was their  and , he was the President of their Coun∣cell, and therefore they that hearkened not to this Councell were worthy to die. CHAPTER XVII. Whether a Iudge is bound to giue sentence according to things prooved and alledged, or according to his owne private know∣ledge? EXOD. 23 1. Thou shalt not receiue a report; put not thine hand with the wicked to be an unrighteous witnesse. The opinion of some concerning the procee∣ding of a Iudge scena allegata & probata.SVndry doe hold, that a Iudge must not judge con∣trary to that which he knoweth, whatsoever is alledged or proved to the contrary; for whatsoever
is not of faith is sinne, Rom. 14.23. that is, if a man doe a thing against his conscience, it is sinne; Wherefore, if a Iudge know a man to be innocent, and yet evidences be brought in against him that he is guiltie; then they hold that the Iudge should use all meanes to free the inno∣cent man; as first, he should deale with the accuser not to proceed in his accusation, and should signifie unto him, that he knoweth well the innocency of the partie. Secondly, if this cannot helpe, then he is bound pub∣lickly to testifie upon the Bench, the innocency of the partie, and he may deferre the giving out of sentence, unlesse he be charged by a superiour; but if the matter haue no successe that way, then he may remit him to a superiour Iudge, or will the partie accused to appeale to a superiour Iudge; but if he cannot prevaile any of these wayes, some doe will him rather to quite his place, than to giue out such a sentence against the inno∣cent. Although the light of nature it selfe, and the word of God both teach us, that the life of the innocent is to be maintained; yet when another law of greater force commeth in, then this must giue place;Why a Iudge must pro∣ceed according to things proved. for reason it selfe teacheth us, that a Iudge is to proceed according to things proved, otherwise justice could not be pre∣served, and the good of the whole, is to be preferred before the good of a private man. But it may be said,  this is both against the law of na∣ture, and against the law written, to kill an innocent man. To kill an innocent man accidentally,  and besides his intention, when he is exercised in his lawfull calling,How a Iudge sinneth in giving out sentence a∣gainst an innocent per∣son. this is not a sinne to him; but if he should of purpose kill an innocent man, that indeed were a sinne contrary to the law; and even as in just warre, when the victory cannot be had otherwise unlesse there be innocent men
killed, as well as the guiltie, yet they may be safely kil∣led, because the warre is just warre, and secondly, be∣cause it is not their intention directly to kill the inno∣cent, but because otherwise the victory could not be obtained: So a Iudge is bound to proceed according to that which is proved, and if he kill the innocent man, it is beside his intention; for his intention is here to doe justice, and not to kill the innocent, and he is bound to preferre the universall good, before the particular. But if he doe so, shall he not be guiltie, as Pilate was in condemning Christ? Pilate was an unjust Iudge, because he pronounced false sentence against Christ who was innocent,How Pilate sinned in giving sentence against Christ. and this might haue beene knowne Iuridicè, because they were not , their testimonies agreed not, as the Evan∣gelist Marke saith, Chap. 14.59. If a woman were proved to be the wife of Titius, whom Titius in his conscience knoweth not to be his wife; although the Iudge should command Titius to doe the dutie of an husband to her, yet Titius should rather suffer any punishment, than to performe that dutie to her, because he knoweth her not to be his wife. So &c. Here we must distinguish betwixt that which is in∣trinsecè malum,Malum intrinsecè. per accidens. evill in the owne nature of it, and that which is but accidentally evill; to commit whoredome is simply evill, but when the Iudge condemneth the in∣nocent man whom he knoweth to be innocent, he doth not giue out sentence against the man, because he is in∣nocent, (for that were simply sinne) but because he is bound to execute judgement; and here the Iudge pro∣ceedeth as a publick person; but Titius is a private per∣son onely, and therefore he is bound to doe according to his knowledge. If a Iudge should heare two men disputing, and one of them should hold a tenent which were hereticall,
and he should conclude for him that is hereticall, yet I am not bound to follow his sentence. A Iudge when he condemneth a man according to the law, he maketh not a lie, as when he saith,  A Iudge when he gi∣veth out sentence upon an innocent person, he maketh not a lie. Object. such a proposition is true, when it is false; and in matters di∣vine, he is not a Iudge as he is in the civill Court. But if a Iudge should be urged in his conscience, and posed, is this an innocent man or not? if he should an∣swere and say, he is not, then he should answere contra∣ry to his knowledge. As a Iudge, he must answere that he is not innocent;  here he must judge according to things proved,The sentence of the Iudge is the sentence of publick authoritie. and the sentence of a Iudge is the sentence of publick authori∣tie, and when he judgeth so, he doth not against his con∣science; and here we must distinguish betwixt his spe∣culatiue and practick knowledge;Scientia speculativa. practica. although he be inno∣cent according to private and speculatiue knowledge, yet he is guiltie according to the course of the Law and publick authoritie. He that is innocent should not be condemned;  this man is innocent; therefore he should not be condem∣ned. This man is innocent in judicio speculativo,A man innocent in spe∣culatiue iudgement and yet guiltie in practicall judgement. but not injudicio practico; but turne it this way, he that is guil∣tie in judicio practico should die, but this man is guiltie in judicio practico; therefore he should die. If a man should produce an Instrument privately to a Iudge, a Iudge could not proceed upon this, because he saw such a thing, if it were not publickly produced in Iudgement; this knowledge which he hath by the sight of this Instrument privately, he had it not as a Iudge, but as a private man. So &c. Whether is the Executioner bound to execute the man, whom he knoweth to be unjustly condemned? He is not the Interpreter of the Law;  for that is the
part of the Iudge,Whether the Executio∣ner be bound to exe∣cute one that is con∣demned being inno∣cent. but he is onely to execute the sen∣tence pronounced by the Iudge: but if he should know the sentence to be false which is given out upon the in∣nocent man, then he should absolutely refuse and say, It is better to obey God than man, Act. 4.19. He is bound to obey his superiour in a good cause, and in a doubt∣full cause; but not in that which he knoweth altogether to be false. But what if a Iudg doubt in his conscience, in such a case what is he to doe? Here he is not to giue out sentence, for that which is not of faith is sinne, Rom. 14.23. That is, whatsoever he doth against his conscience. The conclusion of this is, seeing the sentence of judgement dependeth upon the witnesses, there is great fidelitie required in them, that the Iudge may proceed orderly in judgement, and that he make not a false sen∣tence proceed as it were out of the mouth of God. CHAPTER XVIII. An partus sequitur ventrem? GEN. 21.10. Cast out the handmaid and her sonne: for the sonne of the bond-woman shall not be heire with my sonne Isaac. GOD who is the God of order, and not of confu∣sion, hath debarred the children from sundry priviledges for their fathers sinnes. The children of Hea∣then Parents were not admitted to the Cove∣nant, untill they be∣came Proselytes.First, if both the Parents were Heathen, the Lord se∣cluded the children from the Covenant, and they were not circumcised, untill they became Proselytes, & they were not circumcised nomine Parentum, in the name of
their fathers, but when they imbraced the faith & were converted. Secondly, If both the Parents were Iewes, and did not beget their children in wedlocke, then the children were secluded from the inheritance, Iudg. 11.2. Thou shalt not inherite with us, because thou art the sonne of a strange woman. Thirdly, If an Israelite had married a bond-woman, then the children were secluded from the inheritance, although their fathers were free; those who were borne of Handmaids were alwayes reputed servants; and God applyed this to Christ himselfe as he was man, Esay 49.5. I haue called my servant from the wombe; so Esay 42.1. Behold my servant whom I uphold, my Elect in whom my soule is well pleased.Christ as man was a servant. Marie called her selfe the Lords handmaide. Luk. 1.28. therefore Christ as man borne of Marie the hand-maide, was a servant. But yee will say,  that things take their denomination from the best part; as Water and Wine mixed together, is called Wine; so Chaffe & Wheat mingled together, yet it is called Wheat; Why then should not the childe be reckoned to be free, after his father, and not recko∣ned bond, after his mother, who is a bond-woman? In Physicall mixtures it is so,  but it is not so in mar∣riage;In Physicall mixtures, things take their deno∣mination from the bet∣ter part. this is rather like that which is spoken in the Schooles, Conclusio sequitur deteriorem partem, if any of the premisses be particular, so is the conclusion. The Doctors of the Iewes propound this case, if a Heathenish captiue woman were taken in the Warres, she is converted and becommeth a Proselyte; whether should her childe be judged to be a free man or not in Israel? And they answere, that this childe borne of this stranger, is not to be counted a free man, Verum Senatus suo decreto Lustrari eum tantum curat,H. Melahh. 8.9. they cause onely to wash him, but they will not circumcise him, untill he
be able to make confession of his faith, and become a Proselyte; and here they say, Partus sequitur ventrem, if the mother had beene a free woman, either before, or after the birth amongst the Romans, the childe was reputed to be free; but not so amongst the people of the Iewes. Wherefore the Iudges in Israell willed all true Israelites, not to match themselues unequally in de∣grees, for the disgrace which it brought upon their children, making them uncapable of freedome, and un∣fit to be heires. Conclusion. Difference betwixt the Iudiciall Law and the Covenant of grace.The conclusion of this is: Here we may see the ex∣cellency of the Covenant of grace aboue the Iudiciall Law; for if any of the Parents be faithfull, then the childe is holy, 1 Cor. 7.14. that is, he may be admitted to the Covenant. CHAPTER XIX. An error personae irritat contractum? IOSH. 8.18. And the children of Israel smote them not, because the Princes of the Congregation had sworne unto them by the Lord God of Israel. IT may seeme that Error personae irritat contractum, as if a man married one woman in stead of another, the marriage is nullified. If the error of the person make the contract null, what shall we thinke of Isaacs blessing, who blessed Ia∣cob in stead of Esau? and yet the blessing was effectuall; and what shall we thinke of Ioshua's Covenant made with the Gibeonites, whom he tooke to be strangers?
and yet the Covenant stood firme and sure; and what shall we say of Iacobs marriage with Leah in stead of Ra∣chel? Here the marriage was not irritat and made voide, although there was an errour in the person. First,  for Iacobs marriage with Leah in stead of Ra∣chel, if Iacob had not afterwards approved this mariage,Of Iacobs marriage with Leah. and gone in unto her, and begotten children upon her, the marriage had beene voyde; but because he went in unto her, and begot children upon her, this error was taken away. Secondly, it may be answered for Isaacs blessing,Of Isaacs blessing Ia∣cob in stead of Esau. in blessing Iacob in stead of Esau, & Ioshua's Covenant made with the Gibeonites. There were three who concurred here. First God; secondly, the persons who craftily concurred here to deceiue; and thirdly, the persons who were deceived. In Isaacs blessing we haue to con∣sider; first God, who cannot deceiue, nor be deceived;In blessing of Iacob three persons concur∣red. then Rebecca and Iacob, who craftily deceived; and thirdly, Isaac, who was deceived. Now because it was Gods intention to giue the blessing to Iacob, therefore neither Iacobs craft, nor Isaacs error, could hinder the blessing; Isaac giveth the blessing ignorantly, but be∣cause it was according to Gods intention and revealed will, who was the principall giver of the blessing, there∣fore the blessing was effectuall.Ioshua's Covenant with the Gibeonites. So in the Covenant with the Gibeonites, the Lord commanded to offer peace to the seven Nations if they would seek it, now in com∣meth the deceit of the Gibeonites, and errour of Ioshua who is deceived, yet because it was Gods chiefe inten∣tion, that those of the seven Nations who sought peace should be saved; therefore the oath stood firme, and the errour in the person did not make it voyde; and the matter may be cleared thus:Simile. the Lord forbiddeth a bro∣ther to eate with a railer, a drunkard, or an extortioner. 1 Cor. 5.11. but if a drunkard, or a railer, or an exor∣tioner
should come to the Table of the Lord, I am not to refuse to eate at that Table, although the drunkard be there. The reason is, because this is not my private Table, but the Lords banquet, and I expect the blessing onely from him in it, and the sinnes of the drunkard cannot hinder me; but if I should bid such a one to my house to eate with me, then I should be guiltie of their sinne. So the Covenant here is the Lords Covenant, and the deceiver is not able to make it of no effect. But where the principall intention of the contracter is deceit, and the person with whom the contract is made is deceived,When the errour of the person maketh the con∣tract of no effect. then the contract is nullified; as if a man should ignorantly buy a free man for a slaue, here the free man should be released, & error personae irritat con∣tractum. But yee will say, in all contracts God hath an hand, and he is never deceived, therefore no such contract should be dissolved, where there is error personae. In the blessing betwixt Isaac and Iacob; and the con∣tract betwixt Ioshua and the Gibeonites, God had set downe his revealed will,God had revealed his will in the blessing of Iacob, and the sparing of the Gibeonites. what he was minded to doe in both of these; and therefore neither the error of Isaac, nor the deceit of Rebecca and Iacob made the blessing of no effect, so neither in the contract betwixt Ioshua and the Gibeonites. But the Lord forbiddeth fraudulent contracts in his Word, neither is it his intention that such contracts should be made, therefore they are of no effect.
CHAPTER XX. That a Iudge may giue out sentence by the in∣formation of the false witnesses, and yet be free. 2 SAM. 1.16. And David said unto him, thy bloud be upon thy head; for thy mouth hath testified against thee. IN Iudgement the principall part dependeth upon the witnesses, and if they testifie an untruth,The chiefe part in judg∣ment dependeth upon the witnesses. they make a wrong sentence to proceed out of the mouth of a just Iudge: David here giueth out sentence against the Amalekite, it was a just sentence in respect of the Iudge, because he condemned him out of his owne mouth, but a wrong sentence in respect of the Amale∣kite, because he did not kill Saul, but bragged onely that he had killed him, for the Text saith, that Saul killed himselfe, 1 Sam. 31.5. When the Grecians besieged Troy,Simile. Palamedes was kil∣led there amongst the rest; and when the Greekes had raised their siege from Troy, and taken Ship to returne to Greece; Nauplius the father of Palamedes (to be reven∣ged upon the Greekes) tooke a Boate in a darke night, and went into the Sea, and set up a Beaken upon a rock, which when the Greekes did see, they tooke it to be the Harbour, and directed their Course towards it, and so they runne the most of their Shippes upon the rockes, and were cast away. We cannot say here, that the fault was in the Pilots, because the Shippes were cast away; but the fault was in false Nauplius, who held up a wrong light unto them. So when a good Iudge giveth out a
wrong sentence, the fault is not in the Iudge, but in the false witnesses, who hold up a false light unto him, and therefore the Iudge should labour to punish these false witnesses, and to restore the partie who is wron∣ged to his right; and as Telephus was healed by the speare that hurt him, so should they studie to cure the person whom they haue wounded by their sentence. A Iudge must not pro∣ceed without witnesse.If a Iudge call two or three witnesses, that is the first thing required of him in tryall of the truth, nam testimo∣nio unius non proceditur, and one witnes doth not proue. There are three witnesses in heaven to certifie us of the truth, the Father, the Word, and the holy Ghost. And there are three that beare witnesse to us in the earth of the re∣mission of sinnes, the Spirit, the water, and bloud, 1 Ioh. 5.7.8. So in Iudicatories of the Church three witnesses are required, 2 Cor. 13.1. This is the third time that I am comming to you, in the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established. So in the tryall of civill cau∣ses, every thing was established by the mouth of two or three witnesses. Deut. 21.15. A Iudge is to make choise of faithfull wit∣nesses.Secondly, The Iudge must call faithfull witnesses; they are called faithfull witnesses when they are repu∣ted so in the common estimation of men; Esay 8.2. And I tooke unto me faithfull witnesses, Vriah the Priest and Zechariah the sonne of Ierebechiah, Vriah was not a faith∣full man, yet because he was so reputed amongst the people; therefore he is called a faithfull witnesse. They must be eye-wit∣nesses.Thirdly, Hee must call witnesses who haue both heard and seene, 1 Ioh. 1.1. That which we haue heard, that which we haue seene with our eyes, which we haue loo∣ked upon &c. Fourthly, They must be contestes, and their testimo∣nies must be , agreeing in one, Mark. 14.56. Now if the Iudge proceed this way, and the sentence be false, it is not his fault, for by the mouth of two or
three witnesses every word shall be established, that is shall be holden for truth. When a Iudge demaundeth of the witnesses, hee as∣keth them not , what murther is. Secondly, he asketh not of them, , the effects and consequents of murther which follow it, as the guilt and punishment. Thirdly, , he asketh them whether it were casual∣ly or maliciously done. And fourthly, , if they saw him kill such a man; this is the speciall thing that they require, and if the Iudge giue out sentence this wayes according to things proved, then the blame lieth not upon him if there bee a wrong sentence pro∣nounced. It may be said,  when a man taketh a thing to bee a truth, although it be an untruth, he speaketh an un∣truth: why doth not a Iudge then pronounce a sentence which is not true, although he take it to be a truth? There is a greater vniformitie required betwixt the mind and the tongue,  then betwixt the sentence of the Iudge, and the testimonie of the witnesses; for there is nothing required in the Iudge, but that he proceed se∣cundùm allegata et probata, according to things alledged and proved. CHAPTER XXI. Of one who killed in suddaine passion. 2 SAM. 14. And thy hand maid had two sonnes, and they two stroue together in the field, and there was none to part them, but the one smote the other and slew him. THere is a difference betwixt those things which wee doe in suddaine passion,Difference betwixt things done in passion, and deliberately. and those things which are done deliberately: those things which
children, mad men, and beasts doe, they are not said to be done deliberately, they come not from the will, which is principium agendi; possunt laedere, sed non injuriâ afficere. Violenti. Coactum. Non spontaneum. Voluntarium.Againe, there is a difference betwixt violentum, co∣actum, non spontaneum, & voluntarium. Violentum is that, which by outward force a man is constrained to doe, and here the will giveth no consent at all: as when they drew the Martyrs before their Idols, and put incense in their hands. Coactum is that, when there is some exter∣nall violence used to enforce and compell a man to doe such a thing, against which he standeth out and resisteth for a time, but yet in the end he yeeldeth for feare: as Origen did to Idolatrie. But non spontaneum is this, when it is partly with the will, and partly against the will; Christ sayd unto Peter, Ioh. 21.18. they shall carry thee whither thou wouldest not, meaning what death he should dye; It was partly with Peters will, and partly against his will, that he went to martyrdome. Voluntarium, is that when the will giveth full consent to doe a thing. When a man killeth his neighbour in suddaine pas∣sion he is not violently drawne to this sinne; neither is he compelled to this sinne; prima principia concupiscible et irascibile, sunt interna homini, and cannot be compel∣led: and in this sense he who killeth in suddaine passi∣on, is sayd to doe it willingly; but if we will respect the will as it is obnubilated with the perturbation of an∣ger for the time, he did it not willingly, but non spontè. which is a midst betwixt spontè and invitê. Peter sayd to Christ, Lord I will lay downe my life for thy sake, Iohn 13.3. no doubt hee had an intention to dye with him when he spake these words; but they shall carrie thee whither thou wouldest not, here he was not willing to dye; so that he was partly willing, and partly not willing, hee was not altogether willing, nor it was not altoge∣ther
against his will, but it was partly with his will, and partly against his will. We doe a thing Spontè, we doe a thing invitè,Spontè. Invitè. Non invitè. and we doe a thing non invitè. We doe a thing Spontè, when we are altogether willing to it; we doe a thing invitè, when it is partly with our will, and partly against our will; we doe a thing non invitè, quando procedit ex ignorantia comitante,Simile. as when Mutius Scaevola killed another in stead of Porcenna, and when it was told him that he had missed the King, and killed another, he was sory that he had not killed the King; this action was neither done Spontè, nor invitè, but non invitè; but when a man kil∣leth in suddaine passion, and after that his passions and perturbations are setled, he is sory that he hath done such a thing, and is grieved that primus impetus non est in sua potestate, then he doth it invitè. There is a twofold concupiscence,Concupis∣centia Antecedent. Consequent. an antecedent concupiscence, and a consequent concupiscence; the antecedent concupiscence is that, when the passion preventeth the will, and moveth it; but the consequent concupiscence is that, when the will willingly work∣eth, and stirreth up the passion, that it may execute the sinne more readily; when passion preventeth the will, then it extenuateth the sinne, but when the will stirreth up the passion, then it augmenteth the sinne. Againe,Agere Ex ira. Iratus. we must make a difference betwixt these two, to doe a thing ex ira, and to doe a thing iratus; when a man doth a thing ex irâ, anger is onely the cause of it, and it repenteth him of it afterward that he hath done it; but when he doth a thing iratus, it doth not proceed principally from his anger, but from some o∣ther bad disposition, and hardly such a man repenteth him of his fact. Lastly,Eligere. Praeligere. there is a difference betwixt eligere and prae∣eligere; eligere is to follow sense and appetite, but prae∣eligere
is to follow reason: When a man killeth in sud∣daine passion,Anger followeth the complexion of the bodie. it is electio non praelectio: This sinne of anger commeth commonly of the complexion of the body, nam ex iracundis nascuntur irati; the Philosopher saith, a certaine man being challenged for beating of his father, gaue this answere; My father beat his father, and pointing to his sonne with his finger, he said, this my sonne will beat me also; these hereditary evils are hardly cured. The woman of Tekoah when one of her sonnes killed the other, she begged of the King to remember the law of the Lord, that her other sonne might be saved in the Citie of Refuge, which the King granted unto her wil∣lingly, 2 Sam. 14. because he killed him in suddaine passion. CHAPTER XXII. Whether they might take the sonnes of the Prophets widow for debt or not? 2 KING. 4. Now cryed a certaine woman of the wiues of the sonnes of the Prophets unto Elisha saying, the Creditour is come to take unto him my two sonnes to be bondmen. IT is a pitifull thing to adde griefe to those who are in griefe already; this widow shee was in griefe al∣ready, and those who would take her sonnes from her, adde new griefe unto her. The Lord saith, Make not sad the heart of the widow. Iere. 22.3. Elias 1 King. 17.20. said unto the Lord, O Lord my God, thou hast brought evill upon this widow with whom I sojourne, by slaying her
sonne: As if he should say, is it not enough O Lord, that thou hast taken away her husband, but thou wilt take away her sonne also? The Lord could not doe wrong to this widow by taking away both her sonne and her husband; but they who came to take this poore widowes children, did great wrong to her, in adding new griefe to her. The widow in the Hebrew is called [Almonah] muta ab [Alam] silere, Vidua ab  Silere.  Vacua. because she hath no body to speake for her; and she is called [Rikam] emptie. Ruth 1.21. be∣cause she wanteth a husband to defend her; a widow who liveth in pleasure, shee is dead while shee is living, 1 Tim. 5.6. but a widow that is a widow indeed and deso∣late, trusteth in God, and she is civilly dead when shee wanteth the meanes to helpe her. The Lord forbiddeth in his Law to take to pledge the upper or the nether Milstone, which are the meanes to maintaine the mans life, Deut. 24.6. The widowes two sonnes were (as it were) the nether and the upper Milstone to gaine her living. Secondly, the Lord for∣biddeth to take to pledge the cloths in which the poore man lieth in the night, for he saith, when he cryeth unto me I will heare, for I am gracious, Exod. 22.27. And when those two sonnes of the widow were taken from her, did not the Lord heare her, a poore woman, a poore widow, the widow of one that feared the Lord, the widow of a Prophet? Yes verily, he heard her and that quickly; And, he that saith, Touch not mine anoin∣ted, and doe my Prophets no harme, Psal. 105.15. so he saith, touch not the Prophets widow, nor her sonns, and doe them no harme. Thirdly, the Lord comman∣ded them when they went to seek the pledge, that they should not goe in into the house to fetch it, but they should stand abroad, and the man should bring it out himselfe, Deut. 24.10. But they who violently tooke
away the womans sonnes observed not this, but did as the wicked servant in the Gospell, who tooke his fel∣low-servant by the throat, saying, Pay me that thou ow∣est, Mat. 22.28. Yee will say, this was a just debt, and therefore ought to be payd. See what Esay answereth, Chap. 58.6. Is not this the Fast that I required, to undoe the heavie burden, and to let the oppressed goe free? This debt was a heavie burden vpon the poore womans shoulders, and therefore they ought to haue remitted it. Pignus. Funis. Iob. 22.6. Thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother: Hhobhel, signifieth both pignus and funis a pledge, and a cord, because it bindeth as strongly as cords doe; and the Greekes call it , Quasi obligatio, suppositum, & obnoxios sibi subijcere, with this cord they would haue bound the poore widow. Iob when he describeth the oppressor, Chap. 24.3. he saith, he taketh away the widowes Oxe for a pledge; he taketh the Oxe, the beast that is so needfull for her, therefore he that tooke an Oxe was bound to restore fiue Oxen for him, Exod. 22.1. Againe, to take the wi∣dowes onely Oxe, we see how Nathan exaggerateth the rich mans fault, for taking the poore mans only sheepe, 2 Sam. 12. And if it be oppression, and a crying sinne to take the poore widowes Oxe, what a sinne was it to take her sonnes, who should haue relieved her in her necessitie? Ezek. 18.16. it is a note of the childe of God, that he withheld not the pledge from the poore. In the Originall it is [Hhabhol lo hhabhal] Pignorando non pigno∣ravit, Pignorando non Piguo∣ravit. the repetition of the same word signifieth to take away the pledge, and to keepe it. The widow of Tekoah, when one of her sonnes had killed the other, and the revenger of the bloud came to kill, she desired that her other sonne which was aliue, might be saved, because he was her unica pruna, her
onely sparkle that was left aliue, 2 Sam. 14. Wherefore to take this widowes two sonnes from her, was to put out her light. The conclusion of this is.  Of all sorts of oppression this is one of the greatest, to doe wrong to the fatherlesse, and the widow; for the Lord is a father to the fatherles, and a Iudge of the widowes, Psal. 68.6. therefore men should beware to wrong or harme them: God will de∣fend their cause, he relieveth the fatherlesse and the wi∣dow, Psal. 146.9. And he that is their Redeemer is strong. CHAPTER XXIII. Whether a man may sell his sonne for debt, or not? MAT. 20 25. But for as much as he had not to pay, his Lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made. THere are three sorts of commanding in the fami∣ly; the first is Herilis potestas; the second is Ma∣ritalis potestas; and the third is Patria potestas; these three sorts of power differ. Herilis potestas, is like the government Monarchicall, which hath more absolute commandement to dispose of things, so had the Master, Mat. 20.25. over his ser∣vants, when he commanded the man, his wife and chil∣dren to be sold. The second sort of commanding in the family, is the
authoritie which the man hath over his wife, and this is like the Aristocraticall power, for the man in his necessitie, may not sell his wife to set himselfe at li∣bertie, Et uxor non est in bonis, she is not a part of his goods. The third sort of commanding in the house, is Pa∣tria potestas; and here the father hath a greater autho∣ritie over the children, for they are a speciall part of their fathers possession, Deut. 32.6. Ipse est pater tuus qui possedit te? Is not he thy father that hath bought thee? The Lord permitted a man to sell his children under the Law, Exod. 21.7. If a man sell his daughter to be a hand-maide. So Ezra 2.5. the Iewes being in debt sold their children. Iacob when he made his latter will, Gen. 42.22. he saith, I gaue to thee one part aboue thy brethren, which I conquered with my bow and with my sword. Iacob himselfe never purchased Sichem, but his sonnes purchased it when they killed the Sichemites. Why doth he say then; which I haue purchased with my Bow? The reason of this was, because Iacob was Lord over his children, and o∣ver all that they conquered. A father hath such authoritie over his sonne, that he might sell him untill he was sui juris, that is, untill he was one and twentie yeares old. First, he might sell him before he was seven yeare old; then he might haue sold him the second time, untill he was fourteene yeare old, if his debt had not beene payed: and thirdly, he might haue sold him untill he was twentie one. So he might sell his daughter. Exod. 21.7. It is not un∣derstood here, that he might sell his daughter when she was readie to be married,Allusion. but simply, he might sell her at any time. And the Lord alludeth to this forme, E∣say 50.1. Which of my Creditours is it, to whom I haue sold you? The father might sell himselfe, therefore he
might sell his sonne, because his sonne is but a part of himselfe. But there are sundry things which cannot be sold Quia nullam admittunt aestimationem, as bloud, chastitie,  libertie, and such like. This was not properly a sale,  but only an enterchange of his libertie for his fathers redemption. Non est con∣ditio absoluta, sed quasi sub pacto,D. ll. 2. Cap. de Pa∣tribus qui filios distraxe∣runt. tenetur enim emptor fili∣um restituere, si justum pretium offeratur illi; That is, this condition in selling of his sonne was not absolute, but the contract was so made, that the buyer was bound to restore his sonne backe againe to him, if he had offered him a sufficient price. In the naturall body, the hand or any other member will cast up it selfe to saue a stroke from the head; so should the naturall sonne doe to relieue his father. Ru∣ben offered himselfe in stead of Benjamin, to be a bond-servant, Gen. 44.33. Now if Ruben offered this for his youngest brother, much more should the sonne offer to become a bond-servant for his old father. The conclusion of this is, the children ought not to lay up for the Parents, but the Parents for the children, 2 Cor. 12.17. yet to supply their fathers necessitie, they should be content to quite their libertie, and all that they haue for their fathers libertie.
CHAPTER XXIIII. Of their diverse sorts of Rulers and Commaunders. EXOD. 18.25. And Moses choose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, Rulers over thousands, &c. virga.  Tribus.THe people of the Iewes were divided into twelue Tribes, those Tribes were called Shibhte, because they had a rod carried before them. Before the renting of the ten Tribes from Iuda they were called Israelites; but after the rent of the tenne Tribes, the two Tribes and the halfe were called Iuda, and the tenne Tribes were usually called Israel; and sometimes Ioseph, and Izreel, and sometimes Iacob. And in the Captivitie they are called Iewes, as Ester 2.5. Mordecai of Benjamin is called a Iew, so Ester 3. Haman sought to destroy all the Iewes: and they are all called Isra∣el in the Captivitie, and thou shalt beare the iniquitie of Israel and Iuda, cum ה demon∣strative. Ezek. 4. And once halevj, Mal. 2.8. cum [he] demonstrativo, to signifie that levi is not put here for a proper name. Those who ruled the twelue Tribes were divers, Io∣shua 23.2. Ioshua called for all Israel, for their Elders, for their heads, for their Iudges and for their officers. Seniores.For the Elders, these are called Zekenim, and the Se∣ventie translate them , id est, majores; Zekenim is sometimes taken for the great Synedrion, and sometimes for the Kings Councell, 2 King. 1.10. And Iehu sent unto Samaria to the Rulers of Izreel, here the word El∣ders is taken for the Kings Councell, and not for the Sy∣nedrion,
for it sate in Ierusalem: and sometimes in the lesser Cities Zekenim are called Senatores. Secondly; He called for [roshim] their heads, which the Seventie translate , Principes; Capita, Priu∣pes. This word [rosh] is taken sometimes for the Captaines of the Armies, 1 Sam. 11.11. And Saul divided his Armie into three heads, that is three Companies. Iudg. 11.7. eris nobis [lerosh] in caput, the Seventie translate it . So [rosh] is taken for the heads of the families, and they are called [roshe abhoth] here; Ioshua sent for the Cap∣taines of the Armie. Thirdly; He sent for [Shophetim] the Iudges, vel  Iudices. that is the Rulers of the Cities, and these also were called [Omanim] 2 King. 10.1. These who ruled the people,. were either the heads of the Tribes, and they were called share hashebhatim, or : these conveined the Tribes, and were Cap∣taines in their warres, for the Tribes had their owne proper warres, sometimes one against another; so the Danites made warre against them of Lachis, and they of Ephraim against Iepthe, Iudg. 12. Or else they were Commanders in some part of the Tribe, for the Tribes were divided into families, and these who were cheife in the familie were called [Share mishpahhim] or Patriarchae, capita familiarum, Capita Familiarum. the Patri∣archs or heads of the families. These families againe were divided into thousands; Example. In Iuda there were fiue great families, or [alphe] thousands, and they had fiue Commanders who were called , Numb. 1.16. these were the heads of thousands in Israel. And Micha alludeth to this chap. 5.2. Bethleem Ephrata although thou be little amongst the thousands of Iuda. Secondly, some were Commanders over hundreds, and they were called . Thirdly, they were Commanders over fif∣ties,
Esay 3.3. And lastly, Rulers over ten. This divi∣sion was instituted by Moses by the Councell of Iethro, and approved by Iehosaphat, 2 Chron. 19. These Com∣manders over thousands, hundreds, and fifties were [bagnale ribhoth] Lords to take away strife from the people, like our Iustices of peace; and they differed from the ordinary Iudges called Shophetim. Lastly, They had their [shoterim] which word is di∣versly translated by the Seventie: first they translate it , because by force they compelled men to obe∣dience, loro et baculo cogebant: and sometimes they trans∣late them , because they carried a rod: and some∣times , Pro. 6 6. Goe to the Pismire, who hath not [Shoter] over seer or ruler. So Exod. 5.15. they trans∣late Shoterim , as yee would say, institu∣tores vel doctores, because they taught the people obedi∣ence to the Magistrates: and Act. 13.35. ; Syrus habet, caput vrbis. Iunius translates it moderatores, & Aqui∣la translateth it , facinorum Vindices. Lastly, they translate shoterim, , under-rowers; for as in a Gallie there are commanders, rowers, and under-ro∣wers; so in this well constituted Common-wealth of the Iewes, there were supreame Commanders, Commanders in the middle degree, and Commanders in the inferiour degree. CHAPTER XXV. Of their civill counting of their times, and first of their Houre. Of their times.THe Greekes deriue the houre from , ter∣minare, because it measured the times of the yeare; or from  custodire, because they fai∣ned
that the houres kept Apolloes gates; but it seemeth rather to bee derived from the Hebrew word [Or] lux, and hence the Egyptians call the Sunne  Apollo. The Greekes at the first had no other division of the yeare but into foure seasons, which they called quatuor horae anni: and the Latines called them quatuor tempesta∣tes anni. The like division they made of the day, and they said, solis occasus suprema tempestas esto. Afterward they divided these tempestates into so ma∣ny houres in the day, those houres were either called horae minores, and they were measured by the Zodiack, and planetarie or unequall houres, because of the obli∣quitie of the Zodiacke; or else they were called horae equinoctiales equall houres, because of the streightnesse of the Equinoctiall. The Iewes at first learned the division of the day into whole houres from the Romanes, for before this the houres were either halfe-houres, or  occasionall houres, as to dine and to suppe; So the houres of din∣ner and supper were described of old by drawing of water, as Rebecca came out to draw water, Gen. 24.11.Septuaginta dixerunt . Dinner and Supper described by drawing of water. This was the evening time when women came out to draw water. So they noted the dinner time by drawing of water, Ioh. 5.31. when the woman of Samaria came out to draw water, then the Disciples brought meat to Christ and desired him to eate; This was dinner time. Of the houres upon Ahaz Diall. THe houres set upon Ahaz Diall were unequall, or planetarie houres, because this diall was made up∣on a polar ground.
Fiue sorts of Dials.There are fiue grounds upon which a diall must be made; First upon the elevation of the Equinoctiall, whose houres are alwayes equall. Secondly verticall, and it sheweth onely from sixe to sixe equinoctially. Thirdly meridionall, which sheweth the houres from the rising of the Sunne  the mid-day, upon the East side, and from the mid-d till the Sunne set upon the West side. Fourthly horizoall, which hath no sha∣dow under the Equinoctiall, or neere the Equinoctiall. And the last is the polar diall, which followeth the Zo∣diacke, and the houres are contracted upon the South side of the Equinoctiall in the Winter, and enlarged upon the North side in the Summer. Vpon what ground A∣haz Diall was made.This Diall of Ahaz could not be made upon an equi∣noctial ground, because the houres of the Equinoctiall diall are equal. Secōdly, it could not be made verticall, because the verticall sheweth onely from sixe to sixe, and not the rising and setting of the Sunne. Thirdly, it could not be made meridionall, because the East side & the West side are divided by the meridionall, and it wanteth the twelfth houre. Fourthly, it could not be made horizontall, because they lay so neere the Equi∣noctiall that the style could cast no shadow. Therefore it behoved to be polar, and the houres behoved to be unequally divided for Summer and Winter, or else they behoved to haue two Dialls, one for Summer, and another for Winter. The forme of this Diall was Hemispheriall, or an halfe Circle. What things are to be considered in this diall.In this Diall we haue to consider these points; First, that the lines were but halfe houres upon the diall, and not full houres. Secondly, that this miracle hath been wrought when the Sunne was in the height, for if it had beene in the declination, or in the after-noone, then it could not haue gone forward ten degrees; or if
it had beene soone in the morning, it could not haue gone backe ten degrees. Thirdly, this miracle was wrought in the Summer time, the day being at the lon∣gest; it could not be brought backe ten degrees in the winter day, for when the day is shortest, the Sunne ari∣seth to them at seven of the clocke: neither could this miracle be wrought at the Equinoctiall, for then they could not haue discerned the Sunne to cast a shadow upon the diall, because then the shadow is so long; but the Text saith, that the Sunne went backe so many de∣grees upon Ahaz diall, 2 King. 20. Therefore it seemes to haue beene wrought in the Summer time, at the lon∣gest day, when it was drawne backe from the eleventh houre to the sixt, which is one houre after the Sunne rising; for in the longest day it ariseth to them at fiue of the clocke in the morning. Whether went the Sunne backe ten degrees,  or did the Sunne stand still, and the shadow goe backe up∣on the lines, [as Abulensis upon 2 King. 20. holdeth, the shadow went backe ten degrees;] or did the Sunne go back and the shadow also? If the shadow had gone backe, and not the Sunne,  the miracle had not beene so great, for when the Sunne goes forward naturally, the shadow goeth backward, now if the shadow had gone backe in an instant, and the Sunne stood still, it had beene a miracle quoad modum,Three sorts of mira∣cles. sed non quoad substantiam, and it had beene but a miracle in the third degree; A miracle in the highest degree is, when nature had never a hand in a thing, as to make the Sunne goe backe so many degrees, or to stand still. A miracle in the second degree is this, when nature had once a hand in producing of a thing, but when nature fayleth once, it cannot restore it to the former case a∣gaine. Example. Nature bringeth forth a man seeing, now when he becommeth blind, nature cannot restore
him to his sight, and when he is restored to his sight a∣gaine, it is a miracle in the second degree. A miracle in the third degree is this, when nature in time could doe such a thing, but cannot doe it upon a suddaine. Exam∣ple. Peters Mother in law was sicke of a Fever; Nature in time could cure one of a Fever, but Christ curing her upon a suddaine, this is a miracle in the third de∣gree. Example 2. When a lumpe of figges was layd to Hezekias boyle, the figges in time would haue matured this boyle, and broken it, but when the Lord doth it upon a suddaine, this is a miracle in the third degree. So for the shadow to goe backe when the Sunne goeth forward, this is naturall to it, but for the shadow to goe backe upon a suddaine, this was a miracle in the third degree, but when the Sunne and the shadow both went backe, this was a miracle in the first degree, & quoad mo∣dum & quoad substantiam. What confirmation of his faith had this beene, if the Sunne had gone forward ten degrees, that had beene but the ordinary course of it? If it had gone forward ten degrees in an instant, that had beene a miracle; but when it went backe ten de∣grees peice by peice, this was a greater miracle; there∣fore he chose rather that it should goe backe ten de∣grees. If the Sunne went backe onely, and not the shadow, then it should haue beene knowne through the whole world, and some of the Heathen would haue made mention of it in their writings; as Dionysius Areopagita maketh mention of the Eclipse of the Sunne in Christs Passion. The heathen in their writings might haue made men∣tion of it which are not now extant: In the Booke of Iason there is mentiō made of the standing of the Sunne and Moone in Ioshua's dayes, and that Booke is peri∣shed
now; shall we say then, that nothing is written in this Booke, because this Booke is not extant? Whether was this a greater miracle when the Sunne went backe in Hezekias dayes,  or when the Sunne stood still in Ioshua's dayes? If ye will respect them to whom this miracle was wrought in Ioshua's dayes, it was a greater miracle;  Whether this miracle or that in Ioshua's dayes was greatest? it was wrought for the confirmation of all Israel, and this was wrought but for the confirmation of Hezekias; Secondly, Ioshua's day was longer than Hezekias day; Hezekias day was but twentie two houres, and Ioshua's day was twentie and foure: Ecclus 46.4. Stetit Sol & una dies facta est in duas, Did not the Sunne goe backe by his meanes? And was not one day as long as two. This miracle was wrought at three of the clocke in the afternoone, for the Moone was a quadrant of the Heaven distant from the Sunne, and quarter Moone; for Gibea was Southwest from Megiddo where they did fight, and there the Sunne stood, and Ajalon where the Moone stood was Southeast. How stood the Sunne here at three afternoone South∣west from the Moone, seeing it is said to stand in the midst of Heaven. There is a twofold midst, the first medium aequidistan∣tiae, and the second is interpositionis;Medium aequidistantia. interpositionis. the Sunne is in me∣dio aequidistantiae, when it is in the middle point, betwixt the Sunne-rising and the Sunne-setting, this is in the midst of the day; but it is in medio interpositionis, when it is in any part of the Heaven betwixt the two ex∣treames, it was now but in medio interpositionis. Againe,This miracle was wrought twentie dayes after the Equinoxe. this miracle was wrought twentie dayes af∣ter the Equinoxe; for Ioshua instituted the Passeover Cap. 5. the fourteenth day of Nisan, which was at the Equinoxe, and that Moone had but fourteene dayes to runne to the change, and now the Moone was before
the Sunne; but when the miracle fell out, the Moone was behinde the Sunne, and it was quarter-Moone; so that the fourteene dayes of the old Moone, and the eight dayes of the other Moone, made up twenty dayes after the Equinoxe. Ioshua's day was 24. houres.Thirdly, Ioshua's day was twenty-foure houres, nine houres alreadie past, and three houres to the Sunne-setting; then the Sunne stood a whole Equinoctiall day, which all being joyned together, maketh twenty-foure houres, then it is said Iosh. 10.14. That there was no day like to it before or after, which must be understood, that there was no day before or after like unto it for length. Hezekias day was 22. houres.Hezekias day was but twenty-two houres in length, which is proved thus; the Sunne had runne twelue de∣grees already forward upon Ahaz Diall, which maketh sixe planetary houres; then it goeth backe againe tenne degrees, which maketh fiue planetary houres, and this made eleven houres. Might not the Sunne haue gone backe to the Sunne∣rising, and so haue made sixe planetary houres? Not; because the Sunne casteth no shadow upon the Diall of Ahaz an houre after it riseth, and an houre be∣fore it set; neither upon any other Diall, for then the shadowes are so long, that they shew not the houre, it went backe then but to the houre after that it arose, which was the second planetary houre, then it had fiue planetary houres to the midst of the day, which made up sixteene houres; and six houres to the Sunne-setting, which maketh in all twenty-two houres. Now to make some application and spirituall use of these Dials. The spirituall use of these Dials.Christ before his Incarnation was like to the Sunne shining upon the Equinoctiall Diall, where the shadow is very low; secondly, before Christ came in the flesh, there were many Ceremonies, and a long shadow, but
since Christ came in the flesh, this is like the Sunne shi∣ning upon the Polar Diall, the shadow is short and the Sunne is neerer. Thirdly, our estate in this life compared with the life to come, is like to the meridionall Diall; for the meri∣dionall Diall sheweth not the twelfth houre; so in this life, we see not the sonne of righteousnesse in his bright∣nesse. Fourthly, our estate in this life, is like the verticall Diall, which sheweth neither the rising nor setting of the Sunne; so in this life we know neither our com∣ming into the world, nor the time when we are to goe out of it. Fiftly, our estate in the life to come is like the Hori∣zontall Diall, for as the Sunne shineth alwaies upon the Horizontall Diall; so shall the Sunne of righteousnesse shine alwayes upon us in the life to come. CHAPTER XXVI. Of their Day. GEN. 1.3. And the Evening and the Morning were the first day. A Day in the Scripture, is either a naturall,Dies Naturalis. Artificialis. Propheticu. artifi∣ciall, or a propheticall day. The naturall day consisteth of foure and twen∣tie houres, comprehending day and night, Num. 8.17. In that day that I smote every first borne in the land of E∣gypt. But Exod. 12.29. it is said, that at midnight the Lord smote the first borne of Egypt; so that by day here is meant the whole twentie foure houres.
The artificiall day began at the Sunne-rising, and en∣ded at the Sunne-setting, Exod. 16.14. Why sit yee all the day from morning till night? And it had three Peri∣ods in it, morning, mid-day, and evening; and the mid-day is called Zeharaijm, Meridies. and it is put in the duall num∣ber, because it containeth a part of the forenoone, and a part of the afternoone. Psal. 65.8. Thou makest the outgoings of the morning, and the evening to rejoyce; the outgoings of the morne, is the rising of the starres before the Sunne rise, as , and the outgoings of the evening, that is, when the Moone riseth, and the starres with her, as Hesperus; the Sunne is said to go out as it were out of his chamber, when he ariseth out of the Sea, or the earth, Psal. 19. And he is said to goe in and to dip in the Sea, Mark. 4. when he setteth. Ortus Heliacus. Chronicus. Cosmicus. Ortus Heliacus, is when the starres arise with the Sunne; Ortus Chronicus, is the rising of the starres with the Moone; Ortus Cosmicus, is when the starres rise at certaine seasons in the yeare, as Orion, Plejades, &c. A Propheticall day is taken for a yeare in the Scrip∣tures; as they had a propheticall day, so they had pro∣pheticall weekes, propheticall moneths, and propheti∣call yeares. Propheticall dayes, weekes, and yeares.A weeke signifieth a weeke of yeares, as Daniels se∣ventie weekes, Dan. 9.25. So the moneth signifieth a moneth of yeares, according to the Greeke computati∣on, counting thirtie dayes to a moneth; so the yeare sig∣nifieth a yeare of yeares, Iere. 28.3. Adhuc duo anni an∣norū; So these places in the Revelation, Forty two moneths an hundreth and sixtie dayes three yeares and an halfe, so time, times, and halfe a time, are prophetically to be un∣derstood; A propheticall day, is a yeare; the weeke se∣ven yeares, the moneth thirtie yeares, and the prophe∣ticall yeare three hundreth and sixtie yeares, and this
way they counted, to signifie the shortnesse of the time. A day is applyed in the Scripture first to our estate in grace, Heb. 4. To day if ye will heare his voyce,A day applied to the e∣state of grace. harden not your hearts; and all the Comparisons in the Scriptures are taken from the forenoone, to shew the growth of grace; First, , or the morning Starre, and the dawning of the day, and the day-starre arise in your hearts, 2 Pet. 1.19. Secondly, to the Sunne-rising, Esay 8.10. It is because there is no morning in them; and thirdly, to the Sunne in the strength of the day, Iudg. 5.3. Then the declination of grace is compared to the Sunne in the afternoone, Iere. 6.4. Arise,Declination of grace compared to the de∣clining of the Sunne. let us goe up at noone; woe unto us for the day goeth away, for the sha∣dowes of the evening are stretched out, Micah 3. And the Sunne set upon the Prophets. The forenoone is compared to the time of grace be∣fore it come to the declining, therefore let us make great reckoning of this time to redeeme it, Psal. 108.2. I my selfe will awake early: but in the Originall it is more emphaticall, [Hagnira shahher] Expergefaciam auroram. Expergefaciam Auroram. As if David should say, the morning never tooke me napping, but I wakened it still. Secondly,The day representeth the shortnesse of our life. the day representeth the shortnesse of our life to us, and it is compared to an artificiall day, Psal. 90.5. In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up, but in the evening it is cut downe and withereth: it is like Ionas Gourd, which groweth up in one artificiall day, and decayeth againe; and the houres of the day whereunto our life is compared, are like planetary houres, long in the Summer, and short in the Winter: Compare our dayes with the dayes of our fathers, they are but few and evill, in respect of their dayes, therefore our dayes are called dies palmares. The Lord made the day for man to travaile,The day was made for man to travaile in it. and the
night for him to rest in, therefore they are monsters in nature, that invert this order, who sleepe in the day and wake in the night, Psal. 104.23. Man goeth forth unto his worke, and to his labour, untill the evening. And Vers. 20. Thou makest darknesse, and it is night, wherein all the beasts of the Forrest doe creepe forth: Those who turne day into night, follow the beasts, and not man; such a monster was Heliogabalus, who would rise at night, and then cause morning salutations to be given unto him: the History saith, that the world seemed to goe backward in this monsters dayes: this sort of people Seneca calleth them our Antipodes, for when we rise they goe to bed & contrà. How they reckoned the dayes of the Weeke. THe Iewes reckoned their dayes thus; Prima Sabbath, secunda sabbath, the first day of the weeke, the se∣cond day of the weeke, &c. Secondly, the Latine Church reckoned from the Passeover, Prima feria, se∣cunda feria, &c. Thirdly, they borrowed afterward a∣nother sort of reckoning from the Heathen, who recko∣ned their dayes by the Planets, the Sunne, the Moone, Mercurie, Mars, &c. What is the reason that they reckoned not the dayes of the weeke according to the order of the Planets, for the Planets stand after this order, Saturne stands in the highest place, then Iupiter, next Mars, and so in order Sol, Mercurie, Venus, and then Luna. Iupiter followeth not Saturne in the dayes of the weeke, but Sol; so Mer∣curie followeth not Sol but Luna. The order of the dayes of the weeke is Mathemati∣call; for the seven Planets being set downe in a circle according to their owne naturall order, by an equall di∣stance, they make seven triangles, reaching from their
bases to the Hemisphere, whose bases arise from the se∣verall corners drawne in the circle, in whose circumfe∣rence, the seven Planets are set downe according to their owne order, making up one equall triangle in e∣very one of their two sides, as, ☉ Sol, ☽ Luna, ♂ Mars; ☉ Sol is in the right side of the triangle, ☽ Luna in the top, and ♂ Mars in the left side of the triangle; and so from ♂ Mars to ♃ Iupiter by ☿ Mercurie; and from ♃ Iu∣piter to ♄ Saturne by ♀ Venus; and from ♄ Saturne to ☽ Luna by ☉ Sol, and from the ☽ Moone to ☿ Mercurie by ♂ Mars; and from ☿ Mercurie to ♀ Venus by ♃ Iupi∣ter, as yee may see in the figure following. A Demonstration to shew how the dayes are reckoned according to the seven Planets.
Whether may these names of the weeke dayes which are imposed by the Heathen, be used in the Christian Church or not? The Apostles themselues used such names for di∣stinction, as Areopagus, Mars streete, Act. 17. So, we sai∣led in a Shippe whose Badge was Castor and Pollux. Act. 28. and such like. CHAPTER XXVII. Of their moneth. EXOD. 12.2. This shall be the beginning of moneths to you. BEfore the people of God came out of Egypt, the moneths were reckoned according to the course of the Sunne,Reasons proving how many dayes every moneth had. following the custome of the Egyp∣tians and Chaldeans, and their moneths were full thirtie dayes, as may be gathered out of the eight of Genesis, the floud began to waxe the seventh day of the second moneth Iair, answering to our May; and it began to decrease in the seventh day of the seventh moneth Ti∣shri: from the seventh day of the second moneth, to the seventh day of the seventh, are one hundred and fiftie dayes, which being divided by thirtie, giveth to every moneth thirtie dayes. After they came out of Aegypt their moneths were full thirtie dayes, Numb. 11.19. Yee shall not eate one day, neither fiue dayes, neither tenne dayes but even a whole moneth. Hence we may gather that their moneth was full thirtie dayes;Reasons proving how many moneths are in the yeare. because they reckoned by fiue, ten, twentie, thirtie. So there were twelue moneths in the yeare, every moneth consisting
of thirtie dayes: 1 King. 4.7. And Salomon had twelue Officers over all Israel, which provided victuals for the King and his houshold. Each man in his moneth through the yeare made provision: now if there had beene more then twelue moneths in the yeare, (as afterward the Iewes made their intercalar yeare Veadar) then one should haue had two moneths. So 1 Chron. 27.1. and 12.15. The chiefe Officers served the King by courses, which came in and out moneth by moneth throughout all the moneths in the yeare: here we may see that there were twelue moneths in the yeare, & every moneth had thir∣ty dayes, which made up in the yere three hundred and sixtie dayes. But because there were fiue full dayes lacking in the moneths to fill up the course of the Sunne,The twelue moneths come short of the course of the Sunne fiue dayes. which is three hundred sixtie and fiue dayes, the Egyptians put to the fiue dayes called  to the last moneth Ti∣shri: and they illustrate the matter by this apologue,The fiue odde dayes il∣lustrated by an apo∣logue of Mercurie and the Moone. they say, that Mercurie and the Moone at a time did play at the dice for the fiue odde dayes, and that Mercurie did winne them from the Moone, and Mercurie follo∣wed the course of the Sunne. And in respect the Sunne every yeare runneth three hundred sixtie fiue dayes and sixe odde houres,How the leape yeare or bissextile is made up. which sixe odde houres every fourth yeare maketh a day, they added this day to the fourth yeare, which yeare by the Egyptians was called , as ye would say the dog turning about to him∣selfe, as when he biteth his owne taile: and the Latines called it annus from annulus, because it turned about to the same point againe. So Ioh. 18.13.  is a yeare, so Luk. 3.2. This odde day which was added every fourth yeare was called dies desultorius,This desultorie or bis∣sextile day at the first did run thorow the twelve Moneths. because it wan∣dered to and fro through the whole yeare, for the space of one hundred and twentie yeares. This is called saeculum, Gen. 26. and therefore they inter-la∣ced
a whole moneth for this desultorius dies,What makes an embo∣limie yeare. which in the space of one hundred and twentie years maketh up a moneth of thirty dayes: and because that day which afterward was inter-called in the fourth yeare lacked some scruples of a whole day,The Sunnes course commeth alwayes backe in the moneths. therefore in the space of one hundred thirty and sixe yeares the Sunne turned backe a day in every moneth, when it commeth to the Equinoxe or Solstice. The Sunne was in the Equinoxe at Christs death, in the twentie fifth of March, now it is come to the tenth of March, and if the world should continue long, it should come to the tenth of Ianuary and so backward.The Sunne followeth the first mover. This sheweth that the Sunne keepeth the revolution of the first mover, who comes alwayes neerer to the North Pole, as the Astronomers haue observed. These fiue  dies, the last of them Nehemias calleth Nephthar, a  Purifi∣care. from the word patar, purificare, for writing to the Iewes which were in Egypt, 2 Macc. 1.36. he sayes, that the Temple was purified upon the last of these  dies, called naphthar: for the Egyptian moneths had alwayes thirtie dayes,These fiue intercalar dayes had divers names among the Egyptians. which make up in the yeare three hundred and sixtie dayes, and fiue odde dayes which added to the end of the yeare were called , and by Egyptians and Arabians, Nasi, the first of them was called Osiris, and the fift naphthar. The moneth of the Moone hath twenty nine dayes and twelue houres, therefore amongst the Iewes the moneths were either twenty nine, or full thirty. A threefold computati∣on of the moneths of the Moone.The moneths of the Moone are considered three manner of wayes. First, as the Moone goeth from one point of the Zodiacke and returneth backe to the same againe: and this is called periodus, vel cursus lunaris, which space of time is more then twenty seven dayes, and lesse then twenty eight. The second is the retur∣ning of the Moone to the same place where she went
backe last from the Sunne, and this is called : this consisteth of twenty nine dayes and twelue whole houres. The third is the second day from the conjunction, and it is called  or , the apparition of the new Moone; this is in the second day after the conjunction. All the time before the captivitie the moneths had no proper names, Ezek. 1.1.No proper names of the moneths before the Captivitie. Now it came to passe in the thirtieth yeare, in the fourth, that is, in the fourth moneth. So the Romanes gaue the names to the moneths from their number, as September, October, &c. Therefore these three names spoken of, 1 King. 6.37.38. Ziph for the second moneth, and Bul for the eight, and so etha∣nim; These first names Ziph and Bul,The names of the moneths before the captivitie were appella∣tiue. Scaliger holdeth them to be Sydonian names, or Tyrian: but we may say rather that they were appellatiue names all this time; Ziph, significat amaenitatem, Dan. 2.31. so the moneth ethanim, mensis antiquorum, a Chaldie word, because they reckoned the creation of the world from that moneth. Alexander the great changed these Chaldie names which they had learned in the Captivitie, into Macedo∣nian names, as Adar he called it Xanthius, and tishri he called it , as yee would say Iupiters boy, 1 Macch. 9.50. It was after the captivitie before they learned to in∣ter-call their moneth,The reason of the moneths intercalation after the captivitie. and then they began to inter-call them, that they might make both the Sunne and the Moone come both to one period every second or third yeare. And that they might know the time of the change of the Moone, for the keeping of their feasts the better: and for every second or third yeare they dou∣bled the moneth adar, and called it veadar, and this yeare was called the embolimie yeare. And because the Sunne and the Moone met not in one period the second
or third yeare, therefore they made up the golden num∣ber consisting of nineteene yeares,The course of the Sun and Moone agree after nineteene yeares are compleat, and called the golden number. wherein the Sunne and the Moone met both in one period together. The rule for this embolimie amongst the Hebrewes was this; ter ter bis bis ter ter ter, id est, mensis intercalandus est, anno tertio, sexto, octavo, undecimo, decimo quarto, decimo septimo, decimo nono; et annus decimus nonus erat interca∣landus, consisting of seven moneths. Before the captivitie they had no other inter-calling or reducing the Moone to the Sunne, but onely dies  Egyptiorum: and the Turkes at this day ob∣serving onely the lunarie yeare, and never reducing the Moone to the Sunne, therefore the moneth Rammadon falleth sometimes in Summer, and sometimes in win∣ter. When they inter-called their moneths, they called the moneth which they inter-called, Veadar; and this Veader was their twelfth moneth, and Adar was their thirteenth moneth; this Veadar was but esteemed as momentum temporis among the Iewes, and in their civill computations it had no use, neither judged they any cause in this moneth, and the Iewes set downe this case. Ruben and Simeon were two twins; Ruben the eldest was borne in the last day of the intercalar moneth Ve∣adar, and Simeon his brother was borne in the first day of the ordinary moneth adar, so that Simeon was but a day younger then Ruben. And the case was handled a∣mongst the Iudges which of them should enter into the inheritance first, and they ordained that Simeon should enter a moneth before his brother Ruben, because Ru∣ben was borne in that moneth which was not reckoned amongst the moneths, and therefore they counted him a moneth younger then his brother Simeon. The Sunne exceedeth the Moones course eleven dayes.This reckoning they kept, that they might reduce the course of the Moone to the Sunne, for the Sunne ex∣ceedeth
the Moone eleven dayes;The Sunne exceedeth the Moones course eleven dayes. The moneth exceedeth the Moones course sixe dayes. The Sunne exceedeth the twelue moneths fiue dayes and sixe houres. What maketh up the leape yeare. and also the moneth exceedeth the Moone in the whole yeare sixe dayes, (when the moneths are full thirtie dayes.) And third∣ly the Sunne exceedeth the twelue moneths, fiue dayes and sixe houres, which sixe houres every fourth yeare maketh up a day, and this yeare we call leape yeare: these eleven odde dayes are not cast away, they are insi∣titij dies, or ingrafted daies, as a graft is grafted in a tree, and they are called the Epact, because they are cast to, to the end of the year, for to reduce the Moones course to the course of the Sunne; neither are they left as dies desultorij, to runne at randome through all the moneths of the yeare. This time of the Epact with them is counted as no time, and they illustrate the matter thus.The embolimie epact counted as no time. A man had thirty sonnes and thirty daughters, and three which were neither his sonnes nor his daughters, but abor∣tives, borne out of time; these thirty sonnes and thirty daughters were the dayes & the nights of the moneths, and the three odde dayes after the third embolimie were reserved as insititij dies, untill the next embolimie, and were no part of the moneths of the yeare, untill the se∣venth embolimie. The spirituall use which the Scripture maketh of the Moone is, first to shew us the instabilitie of the world, therefore Revel. 12.1. the Church is the woman cloathed with the Sunne, having the moone under her feet: to signifie that the Church shall tread under foote the changeable world. Secondly, as the Moone changeth, so doth the life of man, Iob 14. while my change come: so Prov. 31.8. Filii muta∣tionis. aperi ostuum in causa filiorum mutationis, that is, for him that is going to be put to death; and as we pray when the Moone changeth, Lord send us a good change, so should we pray especially when we are ready to
die, that the Lord would giue us a happie change. CHAPTER XXVIII. Of their Yeare. 2 CHRO. 24.23. And it came to passe at the end of the yeare, (or in the revolution of the yeare) that the Host of Assyria came up. THe Iewes had a twofold beginning of the recko∣ning of their yeare; the first was from Tishri, the second was from Nisan. They began their first reckoning from Tishri, in the moneth Elul their yeare ended, and in this moneth their new yeare began; Revolutio. this was called [Tekuphah] revolutio anni. 1 King. 20.26. it was in this moneth that the Kings went forth to battaile, 2 Sam. 11.1. And it came to passe when the yeare was expired at the time when Kings went out to battaile. They went out to battaile at this time of the yeare, because then the heat of the yeare was declining; Mensis Anti∣quorum. and the Chaldees called this moneth, Mensis Ethanim, id est, veterum, 1 King. 8.2. In this moneth they began to reckon before they came out of Egypt, because the Iewes held that the world was created in this moneth; chaldaicè Pueritia et Hyems. this moneth is called [Hhoreph] pueritia, for as Tishri is the beginning of the yeare, Gen. 8.22. so the beginning of our age is our childhood, Iob 29.4. Their Ecclesiasticall reckoning began in Nisan.Their Ecclesiasticall reckoning began in Nisan, Ex∣od. 12.1 Chron. 12.15. These are they who went over Ior∣dan in the first moneth, when Iordan had overstowed all the bankes: this was in the moneth Nisan, for then the snow melteth upon the mountaines of Libanus, and the wa∣ters
overflow the banks of Iordan. Ioh. 4.35. Say ye not there are yet foure moneths and then commeth the harvest? that is, the Pascha and the Pentecost; the first was the be∣ginning of the harvest, and the last was the end of the harvest; the beginning of the harvest fell in the first moneth of the yeare in Nisan; for on the fourteenth day was the Pascha, & on the fifteenth day they brought in handfuls of new Corne; and Zach. 7.1. The word of the Lord came unto Zachariah in the fourth day of the ninth moneth, even in Chisleu, that is, in the ninth from Nisan. So the feast of the Tabernacles was kept in the seventh moneth Tishri, which is the seventh from Nisan. From Nisan they reckoned their feasts,What they reckoned from every moneth. the reigne of their Kings, their contracts, bonds, and Obligations. From Elul answering to our August; they reckoned the age of their young beasts which they were to offer to the Lord, none of their beasts were offered before E∣lul. Thirdly, from Tishri answering to our September, they reckoned the seventh yeare of the resting of their land, and their Iubilees;Vide Buxtor. Synag. and from this time they rec∣koned how long their trees were circumcised or uncir∣cumcised. Fourthly, from Shebat answering to our Ianuary, they reckoned all their trees which payed fruit, they payed tithe onely of these trees which began to flourish at that time. The conclusion of this is;  As the Lord changed the reckoning of the Iewes from Tishri to Nisan, because the Iewes then were delivered out of Egypt; so the Lord hath changed our reckoning now from the old Sab∣bath of the Iewes, to the new reckoning of our Sabbath, because this day our delivery and redemption was fini∣shed; 2 Cor. 5.17. Old things are passed away, behold all things are become new.
CHAPTER XXIX. Of their numbring, and manner of counting. PRO. 3.6. Wisedome commeth with length of dayes in her right hand. THey numbered of old three manner of wayes; first, by their fingers; secondly, by letters; and thirdly, by Ciphers. First, by their fingers, for as their first measure was their hand. Esay 40.12. Who hath measured the waters with the hollow of his hand, and met out the heavens with his span? So their first numbering was by their fingers; and Salomon alludeth to this forme, Pro. 3.6. Wisedome cōmeth with length of dayes in her right hand. The Greeks called this , because they numbered upon their fiue fingers;Lib. 2. Fast. so Ovidius, Seu quia tot digitis per quos numerare Solemus. So Invenal writing of Nestor; —Sua dextra computat annos. They numbered upon their ten fingers, because no simple number can go beyond nine, and the tenth num∣ber is the complement of all simple numbers. They numbered, first with their right hand upon the left, because the right was the most fit hand for ac∣tion, for the spirits lie in the right side of the heart, and so make the right hand more fit to doe any thing; and the bloud lieth more to the left side, and therefore the left hand is not so fit for action. Salomon saith, that the wise mans heart is at his right hand, Eccles. 10.2. the spi∣rits
enableth his hand more to doe; and the fooles is at his left hand, because there are not so many spirits in the left side of the heart to quicken the hand; but when the spirits encline equally to both the sides, then he is [Itter jad] ambidexter, Ambidexter. that could use the left hand as well as the right; such were the men of Benjamin and Ehud; it should not be translated left handed, Iudg. 3.15. but he who used both the hands. They numbered upon the left hand from one to nine∣tie nine,Plinius. Lib. 44. and at an hundreth they began to turne to the right hand; therefore Ianus was set up at Rome, with the number of the dayes in the yeare upon his hands, ha∣ving the great number upon his right hand, and the small number upon his left. The way how they numbered upon the left hand was this; when they counted one,Beda de ratione tempo∣rum. they laid the point of their little finger in the midst of their palme;The manner of their counting from 10. to 100. when they counted 2, they laid the ring finger upon the palme of their hand, when they counted 3, they laid their mid∣dle finger upon the palme of their hand; when they counted 4, they lifted up their little finger from the palme of their hand, and they left other two fingers lie still upon the palme of their hand; when they counted 5, they lifted up the ring-finger from the palme of their hand; and when 6, they lifted up the middle finger; when 7, they laid the point of their little finger about the middle of their hand; and when 8, the ring-finger about the middle of their hand; when 9, the middle finger about the middle of their hand; when 10, they laid the naile of their forefinger at the middle of the thumbe; when 20, they laid the naile of the forefinger betwixt the joynts of the thumbe; when 30.All numbers under an hundred were counted upon the left hand. they laid the naile of the forefinger and the naile of the thumbe together; when 40, they laid the thumbe upon the forefinger crosse-wayes; when 50, they inclined the
thumbe to the palme of the hand; when 60, they laid the top of the forefinger to the thumbe; when 70. they laid the naile of the thumbe to the top of the forefinger; when 80, they laid the naile of the thumbe betwixt the forefinger and middle finger; when 90. they laid the naile of the forefinger at the roote of the thumbe. Luk. 15.4. The Parable seemeth to allude to this forme of counting, he left ninetie and nine and sought that one which was lost. All numbers from an hundred to a thousand upon the right hand.Then they transferred the numbers from their left hand to the right hand, and they numbered hundreths upon the right hand, as they number simple numbers upon the left hand. When they came to reckon 1000, they laid the palme of their left hand upon their breast, with their fingers spread; when 2000, they laid the backe of their left hand upon their breast with their fingers spread;All numbers from 1000 to 100000. they num∣bered with their left hand. when they numbered 30000, they laid the palme of their left hand upon their breast with their fingers upward; when they numbered 40000, they laid the backe of their left hand upon their breast, and their fingers downward; when 50000, they laid the palme of their left hand upon their navell, with their fingers upward; when 60000, they laid the backe of their hand upon their navell, with their fingers downward; when 70000, they laid the palme of their left hand upon their left thigh, with their fingers crossewayes; when 80000, they laid the backe of their left hand upon their left thigh, with their fingers upward; when 90000, they laid the palme of their left hand upon their left thigh, with their fingers downward; so that the hand was laid twice up and twice downe, backward and forward up∣on their breast, navell, and thigh, therefore Plautus saith, Ecce autem avertit nixus laeva, in femore habet ma∣num, dextra digitis rationem computat feriens femur, that
is, he turneth his left hand from his left thigh, & is come with his right to smite upon his right thigh, to signifie an exceeding great number. When they came to 100000,After 100000. they counted the same way with their right hand. they counted with their right hand upon their belly, navell, and thigh, as they did before untill they came to 10000000. The Hebrewes, Greekes, and Latines, counted like∣wise by the letters of their Alphabet;M. Mille. D. Dimidium mille. X. Because it consisteth of two VV. V. Because it standeth in the fift place amongst the Vowels. the Hebrewes and Greekes numbered by all the letters of the Alphabet; but the Latines had onely sixe by which they counted, M.D.C.X.V.I. M. for 1000. D. for 500. C. for 100. X. for 10. and I. for 1. Afterwards they numbered by Ciphers, which were but lately found out: The Turkes learned it from the Arabians; we from the Turkes; and it commeth from the Hebrew word [Saphar] numerare; in the Arabicke, Numerare. Siphra est privatio, that is, a figure in the number which signifieth nothing by it selfe. The Ancients did not onely number with their fin∣gers, but also speake with them; unto which Salomon alludeth, Pro. 6.13.Allusion. In tarentilla. The wicked man he speaketh with his fingers; therefore Naevius saith, Alij dat annulum, alium invocat, cum{que} alio cantat, alijs deni{que} dat digito literas;Loqui digitis quid. He giues a ring to one, he calls upon another, he sings with a∣nother, and to others he giues letters by his fingers, that is, he mixeth his speeches with others by poynting out Letters with his fingers.Beda libello de indigita∣tione. Beda in his Booke de indigita∣tione, sets downe the manner how they spake with their fingers, after he hath set downe the manner how they counted with them, for he saith, De ipso computo quaedam manualis loquela figurari potest, quâ literis quis sigillatim expressis, verba quae eisdē literis contineantur, alteri qui hanc quo{que} noverit industriam tametsi longè posito legenda & in∣telligenda contradat: that is, out of the same numbering there may be drawne out a certaine speaking by the hands,
which a man may deliver to another who stands a farre off, who hath the same skill both to read and understand, and this is by Letters expressed severally, and the whole words are contained in these Letters. So that the same way a man counts with his fingers, that same way doth he speake with his fingers, for the first number upon the hand, poynteth out the first Letter, the second number the second Letter, and so to the end of the Alphabet, and the man that had the best dexteritie did joyne the Let∣ters together, and made up a word or phrase, which onely he and the speaker understood. They reckoned their numbers upon their fingers: when we looke upon our fingers, we should learne to number our dayes; Wisedome biddeth us binde her pre∣cepts to our fingers, Prov. 7.3. Alluding to their Phy∣lacteries which they had upon their Armes; so should we put those numbers upon our hands, and continual∣ly make use of them for the shortnesse of our life. CHAPTER XXX. Of their civill Contracts, and manner of writing them. IERE. 32.7. Buy thee my field that is in Anathoth, for the right of redemption is thine to buy it, &c. IN this contract and bargaine betweene Ieremie and his Vncles sonne Hanameel, consider first the man∣ner how the contract was written; and secondly, how this testimony is cited by Matthew, Cap. 27.7. Scaliger in Elencho.First, for the manner of writing the contract, he who was to buy the ground wrote two Instruments, the one
he sealed with his owne Signet,Two Instruments writ∣ten at the buying of Land, one closed and another not closed. the other he shewed unclosed to the witnesses, that they might subscribe and beare witnesse of that which was written: this the wit∣nesses did subscribe upon the backe of the inclosed in∣strument, and these two Instruments were almost alike in all things, saue onely that in the sealed Instrument something was concealed from the witnesses,What things were con∣cealed from the wit∣nesses in the closed Instrument. the things concealed were these, the price of the Land, and the time of the redemption, these they concealed, (for none knew these but the buyer and the seller) in case that the Goel or the next of the kindred knowing the time of the redemption, and the price, and the Morgager not being able to redeeme it at the day, it was lawfull for the next of the kindred to haue redeemed it; these two being concealed, there was place still for the poore man to re∣deeme his Land after the day, therefore they set downe in the inclosed Instrument, onely the bare disposition without the price or time of redemption.Calius Rodogineus. So amongst the Romanes, when they sealed their latter will, they concealed the name of the heire, lest any wrong should be done unto him. It may be asked how these words are cited by Ma∣thew, chap. 27.9.  Then was fulfilled that which was spo∣ken by Ieremie the Prophet saying, and they tooke the thirtie peices of silver the price of him that was valued, which they of the children of Israel did value, and gaue them for a pot¦ters field, as the Lord appointed me; he alledgeth Ieremie, but the words are spoken by Zecharie, chap. 11. This testimonie in Mathew is made up of the saying of Ieremie and Zecharie,  The New Testament citeth two places out of the old to make up one testimonie. and yet Ieremie is onely cited by Mathew: for it is the manner of the new Testament to make up one testimonie of two cited out of the old Testament, although written in divers places in the old Testament. Example. Peter Acts 1.20. maketh up but one testimonie of divers places collected out of the
Psalme 69.17. and 109.8. so 1 Pet. 2.7. this testimo∣ny is made up of diverse testimonies out of the Psalme 118.22. and Esay 8.14. So Christ, Math. 21.5. maketh up one testimony out of Esay 62.11. and Zach. 11.11. So Mat. 21.14. made up of Esay 56.7. and Iere. 7.11. The New Testament in citing of two Pro∣phets, expresse him who hath the chiefe part of the testimonie.Secondly, this is the manner of the New Testament, when testimonies are cited out of two, they leaue out the one and expresse onely the other, and they cite the whole testimony as written by one: example, Mat. 21.5. there is a testimony cited out of two Prophets, yet they are cited but as one testimony, it is cited out of two Prophets, Esay 62.11. and Zach. 9.9. Yet the Evange∣list saith, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet; the first words are Esayes, the latter are Zacha∣ries, and yet they are cited as if they were the words of Zachary. So Mark. 1.2. As it is written in the Prophets; this testimony is written both in Esay and Malachy, Be∣hold I send my Messenger before thy face, &c. yet Mat. 3.3. Esay is onely cited and not Malachy. Now let us consider here why the Evangelist citeth here Ieremie rather than Zacharie,Why Matthew rather cites Ieremie than Za∣charie. the Evangelist would giue a reasō here, not so much why Christ was bought by the Scribes and Pharisies, as of the feild which was bought for such a price; Zachary speaketh nothing of the field that was bought, wherefore it had not beene pertinent for the Evangelist to haue brought in the te∣stimony of Zachary here. Ieremie in his thirtieth second Chapter telleth when the Captivitie was now approa∣ching, he is commanded to buy such a field, and in buy∣ing such a field there was some secret mystery; second∣ly, there was some analogie, for this feild bought by Ie∣remy was a type of the Potters field, whereof Matthew speaketh, and the analogie consisted especially in this, the field which Mathew maketh mentiō of, was bought to be a buriall for strangers, and this was typed in the
field which was bought by Ieremy,What time Ieremiah bought this field. for Ieremy was com∣manded to buy this field at that time when he was ta∣ken prisoner, and when there was little or no hope for him to come out of prison, and when the City was be∣sieged by the Chaldeans; the buyer might thinke now that he had but small reason to buy that land, which was presently to be taken by the Chaldeans; Ieremie might haue said unto the Lord, the Citie is to be deli∣vered into the hands of the Chaldeans, and thou bidst me buy the field for so much money, & the Lord saith, I will deliver this Citie into the hand of the Chaldeans; hence it may seeme that this field was bought rather for strangers than for the buyer himselfe, or any that belonged unto him; therefore Lament. 5.2. Ieremie saith, our inheritance is turned to strangers, our houses to Aliants. But how could Anathoth be turned into a buriall place? It is answered,  the feild which was in Anathoth was assigned to the Levites, Iosh 11.18. These Cities which were assigned unto the Levites, they had no feilds which were arable about them, to beare Corne, but some ground for the feeding of their Cattle; and it is most probable that they had some Gardens wherein they buried their dead; as we reade of Ioseph of Arima∣thea, who had a Garden neare the Citie in which Christ was buried: Secondly, this feild by Matthew is called the Potters feild, & here we may see some resemblance betwixt this feild and the feild spoken of by Ieremie; for after the writs were perfected, Ieremie said to his Scribe Baruch, take these writs and put them in an ear∣then pot, that they may continue there for many dayes, vers. 14. There must be something typed by this, that he biddeth take these writs and put them in an earthen pot, for men use to put their writs in Chests and boxes
and safest places; and as this buying of the field was set downe as an argument to strengthen the Israelites, that they should returne out of the Captivitie, and possesse their own lands; so it was a type of that which Matthew speaketh; & as this feild which Ieremie bought was tur∣ned into the use of strangers, so was the field which Ma∣thew speaketh of made a buriall for strangers; and as the writs were hid in the earthen pot in Ieremies time, so was this feild which Matthew speaketh of, a Potters feild. In Zachary there is no mention made of the buy∣ing of the feild with the thirtie peices of silver, but Mat∣thew speaketh of buying of the feild, and so doth Iere∣mie, therefore the Evangelist pertinently citeth Ieremie and not Zacharie. From the citing of this testimony we may draw this Conclusion, there are many things written in the old Testament, which at the first sight might seeme to look no wayes to the new; but if we looke neerer and neerer unto them, we shall see how they agree together, there∣fore we should search the Scriptures, which beare testi∣mony to Christ, Ioh. 5.39. CHAPTER XXXI. What things the Goel was bound to doe to his kinsman, and what things were done to him by his brethren. PROV. 23.10. Remoue not the old land marke, and en∣ter not within the feild of the fatherlesse, for their Re∣deemer (or Goel) is mightie, and he will plead their cause. The priviledges of the neerest kinsman.HE that was the Goel in Israel, was bound to doe three things for his brethren; first, he was vindex
sanguinis, the revenger of the bloud; secondly, he re∣deemed the morgaged lands of his kinsman: thirdly, he delivered him out of prison. These three things he was bound to doe jure propinquitatis, because he was his neerest kinsman. Now let us apply these to Christ our Goel, first our Goel, or vindex sanguinis, the revenger of our bloud,Christ our neerest kins∣man hath taken all their priviledges upon him for us. revengeth all our wrongs. When the heart of the reven∣ger of the bloud was hot within him, Deut. 19.6. it was a terrible thing for the manslayer to meete him, he pur∣sued eagerly after him. So Iesus Christ pursueth after his enemies, who shed the bloud of his Church. Secondly, the Goel redeemed the morgaged Land, Ruth 4.4. and Iere. 32.7. Ieremie cousin to Hanameel redeemed his morgaged Land; we haue morgaged our inheritance in heaven, but our Goel Iesus Christ, who is flesh of our flesh and bone of our bone, will redeeme it to us againe. The the third thing which the Goel did to his kins∣man, was to relieue him out of prison. So we being condemned to that everlasting prison, Christ hath bai∣led us. Now the priviledges which the first-borne who was the Goel had done to him were two;The priviledges of the neerest kinsman as he was first borne. First he had the double portion of his Fathers goods; And secondly, his second brother was bound to raise up seed to him. Iesus Christ our eldest brother, he is annointed with gifts aboue his fellowes, Psal. 45. and from him we receiue grace for grace, Ioh. 1. The second thing which was due to the Goel was this,VVhat the second bro∣ther was bound to doe for the eldest. if he died without children then his second bro∣ther was bound to raise up seed to him: and if he refu∣sed to doe it, they pulled off his shoe and spit in his face. The application of this is;Ministers are Christs second brethren. Christ our Eldest brother shall never want a seed in his Church to the worlds
end. When Onan refused to raise up seed to his bro∣ther, then Selah was bound to doe it, Gen. 38. So there shall be still some who shall performe this dutie to our Eldest brother. Againe the children were not called their children, but the eldest brothers children. The application is, the Preachers are Christs younger brethren, therefore they should beget children to Christ, and not seeke their owne honour. The portion of a sloth∣full Minister.If they refused to raise up seed to their brother, then their shoe was pulled off, and they did spit in their face. Great shall be the shame of these who refuse to doe this dutie to their elder brother Christ: their shoe shall be pulled off, and they shall loose their part of that hea∣venly inheritance. The Church having such a Goel, men should be loth to meddle with her.  Prov. 23.10. Remoue not the old markes, and enter not within the field of the fatherlesse, for their Goel, or redeemer, is mightie, and hee will plead their cause: here he alludeth to that place, Deut. 25.8. The Lord is a Goel to all his poore and distressed mem∣bers: he was Iosephs Goel when he was in prison: The armes of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Iacob. Gen. 49.24.
CHAPTER XXXII. The difference betwixt the brother naturall, and the kinsman in raising up seed to the eldest brother, and what was done to them if they refused. LEVIT. 25.9. Then shall his brothers wife come un∣to him, &c. THere was a twofold pulling off of the shoe in Is∣rael, the first was for a religious use,A two fold use of the pulling off the shoe. the second for a civill use. First the religious use we see in Exod 3.5. and in Iosh. 5.13. The second use was a po∣liticke use, and this politicke or civill use was two fold;Discalceatio firmateria Dedcora. the first served for the solemnity of their contracts, & it was called firmatoria discalceatio; the second was for a punishment and disgrace Deut. 25.9. And it differed from that which was used in confirmation in sundry points. First, when their shoe was taken off for a punishment  or disgrace, the woman herselfe pulled off the shoe of him who refused to raise seed to his brother, but in the contract of confirmation the man himselfe loosed his owne shoe and pulled it off. Secondly, that pulling off the shoe was for the disgrace of the man; but this which was used in con∣tracts  was to secure the man in his right: it tended to no disgrace to him; or if he sold the land, it was onely a signe that he was willing to quit his right; and if he bought the land it was a signe to him of his possession. Thirdly, that pulling off of the shoe was by com∣maund,
but this pulling off the shoe was by custome. Ruth 4.7. This was the manner in former times in Israel. Fourthly, this shoe was pulled off from the naturall brother, if he refused to raise up seed; but that shoe for confirmation was pulled off by any who made a con∣tract, in token of possession: And the Lord alludeth to this forme Psal. 60.8. Over Edom I will cast my shoe, that is, Detractio. I will take possession of it: this was called [Hhali∣zah] detractio. Fiftly, when the shoe was pulled off for disgrace, it was given to no bodie, but the shoe which was pulled off in bargaining was given to him who bought the land. Sixtly, In the former pulling off of the shoe, there was no request made that the shoe should be pulled off, but it was pulled off against his will; but in the latter, they desired him to pull off his shoe, and he did it wil∣lingly. Seventhly, In the former the shoe was pulled off against his will in the presence of the Iudges; but in this bargaine the shoe might be pulled off before any suffici∣ent witnesse. Eightly, The former was onely pulled off when the brother refused to raise up seed to his brother; but in the latter the shoe was pulled off in any contract of a∣lienation. Ninthly, When they pulled off the shoe in disgrace, they spit in his face, which the Seventie translate , and Iosephus  to smite him in the face: but in this litter there was no such disgrace offered to the man. Tenthly, In the former when the shoe was pulled off, the woman said, so shall it be done to the man who refuseth to build his brothers house, Deut. 25.9. but in the latter there were no such words spoken. Lastly, he that refuseth to raise up seed to his brother
his house was called domus discalceati in Israel; but there followed no such disgrace to the man who pulled off his shoe in the contract. They make another difference to be this,The differene betwixt the naturall brother and the kinsman. that he who was the naturall brother, when he raised up seed to his brother, the children were not called his children, but his brothers children, and the shoe was pulled off his foot, because he refused to doe that honour to his bro∣ther; but when a cousin-german raised up seed to his kinsman, the children were not called after his kinsman that was dead, but as the father pleased to call them. Boaz called not his sonne Machlon, after the first hus∣band of Ruth, but Obed. But the question is,  whether they were bound to giue them the same names or not? For Deut. 25.6. the words in the originall are these; Primogenitus quem pe∣pererit stabit super nomen fratris sui, shall succeed in the name of his brother: therefore it may seeme they were called after the elder brothers name. To succeed in the name is to succeed in the place,  and not to be called after his name: and Ionathan paraphra∣seth it, exurget in haereditate nomine fratris, to continue his name, but not to be called after his name. There were two sorts of brothers amongst the Iewes, naturall brethren and legall brethren; the naturall bro∣ther was bound to raise up seede to his eldest brother; the elder first, and if he died, then the second, and then the third, &c. Mat. 22. And if they did not, then they were punished and disgraced; but those who were le∣gall brethren, or cousin-germanes, as N. was to Mach∣lon, they were not compelled to marry them, but if they did not, there was some disgrace put upon them, but not that great disgrace which was put upon the na∣turall brother. If a cousin-germane, or a legall brother had married his cousines wife, the children which he
begot upon her, were not called his children, but his cousines children; even as the children which the natu∣rall brother begat, were not his children but his elder brothers, and therefore N. saith, Ruth 4.6. I cannot re∣deeme it, lest I marre my owne inheritance; that is, these children begotten upon Ruth should not be called my children, but my kinsmans, and so all that I inherite should goe to them. The conclusion of this is; the Holy Ghost here mar∣keth the cousin-germane with a note, not naming him by his name, but passing him by; but they who were naturall brethen, if they refused, they were noted with a greater marke of infamie: so the moe obligations that Pastors haue, if they refuse to doe their dutie to Iesus Christ, the greater shall be their shame. CHAPTER XXXIII. Of their Marriages. IVDG. 14.7. And he went downe and talked with the woman, and she pleased Sampson well, and after a time he returned to take her. THey had their Sponsalia de futuro, & de praesenti; de futuro, as Lots sonnes in law were but affianced to his daughters, they were not as yet married, [Lokeh he benathau] accipientes uxores, accepturi filias eius. should be interpre∣ted, Brevi pòst accepturi, for they knew not as yet a man, Vers. 8. So Deut. 20.7. What is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not taken her. So Ioseph and Marie were affianced, see Deut. 22.24. Betwixt their affiance and their marriage there inter∣vened
a time. Iudg. 14.7. And he went downe and tal∣ked with the woman. This was for the affiancing; and Vers. 8. After a time he returned againe to take her; that is, to marry her: the first time that he went downe he killed the Lyon; and the second time when he went downe to the marriage, he found honey in the Lyons belly. After some dayes, cannot be understood of a yeare, that a whole yeare intervened betwixt their affi∣ancing and their marriage, when the word Dies,When the word [Day] signifieth a yeare, and when a moneth. is put in the plurall number, and some lesse number follow∣ing it, then it signifieth a yeare, and the lesse number sig∣nifieth moneths; as Gen. 24.55. Let her abide with us dayes or ten; that is, a yeare of dayes, or at the least ten moneths. So 1 Sam. 27.7. David abode with the Phili∣stims dayes and foure moneths; that is, a yeare of dayes and foure moneths; so Ezek. 1.1. in the thirtieth yeare, in the fourth, in the fift of the moneth; that is, in the fourth moneth, in the fift day of the moneth;Dayes absolutely set downe in the Scripture signifie an infinite time. but when dayes are put alone, they signifie an indefinite time, and not an yeare; so Gen. 40.4. Fuerunt dies in custodia, that is, a cer∣taine time; so Lev 28.29. He shall redeeme it within dayes, that is, within the time that he and the man to whom he had morgaged the house agreed upon. So Iudg. 14.8. After dayes he returned to take her, that is, after a few dayes, and not after a whole yeare; the preparation of a whole yeare, was enough for a Kings marriage. Sponsalia de praesenti, were, when he said I take thee to my wife in the present. The time of their marriages was in the night, Mat. 25.6 At midnight the Virgines came to wait for the bridegroomes returning with their Lamps in their hands; so Luk. 12.36. Marriages of old were made three manner of wayes, the first was called Vsucapio, the second, confarreatio, and the third was called coemptio. Per usum, vel usucapio,Perusum, vel usucapio. when a man married a maide
which had stayed almost a yeare with him; the example which most resembleth this in the Scripture,Per confarreatinem. was that of David, when he was old he tooke Abishaig to him, 1 King. 1.2. Brissonius de ritu nupti∣arum.Per confarreationem, when the bridegroome married the bride, the bridegroome tooke a Cake of bread, and brake it betwixt him and the bride, or some Corne, and put betwixt their hands; to signifie that they were to breake bread, and to liue together in mutuall societie; Hosea alludeth to this forme,Allusion. Cap. 2.3. I bought her for an Homer of Barley. So Iesus Christ the husband of his Church, married her per confarreationem, putting the bread in her hand, and marrying her to himselfe in the Sacrament, to signifie that he would dwell with her for ever. Per coemptionem.The third sort was per coemptionem, for it was the manner of old, that the bridegroome bought the bride for so much, and the bride gaue little or no dowrie to the bridegroome; so the sonnes of Sichem bought Di∣na,The man gaue the dowrie and not the woman. Gen. 34.12. Aske me never so much dowrie and I will giue it: so David bought Michol, Sauls daughter for so many foreskins of the Philistims, 1 Sam. 18.25. And Iacob served seven yeares for Rachel. The bride brought onely Donationes, vel paraphernalia, as chaines, brace∣lets, Gen. 24. but the dowrie which they gaue was but a small thing.Pharaoh giving Gezar to Salomon, it was a pre∣sent and not a dowrie. 1 King. 9.16. it is said that Pharaoh tooke Gezar from the Philistims, and gaue it to Salomon for a present, it should not be translated for a dowrie. Exod. 22.17. He shall pay money according to the dowrie of Vir∣gins; which is but a little summe, fiftie shekels, Deut. 22.29. Thus Christ bought his spouse with his bloud, Act. 20.29. she was a poore Damsell, and had nothing to giue. Marriages dissolved af∣ter the same manner they were made.As their marriages were made by one of these three Ceremonies, per usum, confarreationem, & coemptionem;
So amongst the Romanes,Vsurpatio. Diffarreatio. Renuncipatio. the marriage was dissolved af∣ter the same manner. The first was dissolved usurpati∣one, if the woman whom he had married (being his maide before) had stayed but three nights from her husband, then by the Romane law he might put her a∣way; the second was dissolved diffarreatione, they brake bread and so departed; the third was dissolved re∣nuncipatione, they tooke their hands asunder and so de∣parted; this the Greekes called , and the Latines, Divortium. The Ceremonies which they used in their Marriages were these; first, he put a Ring upon her finger; Postulationes Sponsalio∣rum, Sponsalia sacra ob matrimonium. the He∣brewes called this [Tebhignoth Kedushim] and he said, be thou my wife according to the law of Moses and of Israel, and this he did before witnesses; this was called Subarrhatio, this Ring was put upon the fourth finger of the left hand, because a veine commeth from the heart to that finger, as the Physitians say. The day when the bride was married, shee tooke the vaile off her face, this was called , and the gifts which were given that day, were called ; before she was married, she put a vaile upon her face, and this was called , and the gifts which were given to her before the marriage were called . The solemnities in the marriages were these; first,Divers solemnities used at the marriage. they put a crowne upon the head of the bridegroome, and then upon the bride, and the crowne was made of Roses, Mirtle, and Ivie, and the mother of the bride∣groome put this crowne upon his head. Cant. 3.11. Goe forth, O yee daughters of Sion, and behold King Salo∣mon with the crowne wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladnesse of his heart. This crowne wherewith the bride and the bride∣groome
were crowned, was but a corruptible crowne; but that crowne, non pollutus, est & nomen gemma sic dicta quod in ignem con∣jectae non consumatur. which we shall get in the life to come, fadeth not, nor falleth not away, 1 Pet. 1.4.  is a precious stone, which if yee cast it in the fire it never consumeth; so  flos amoris, a flower that never fadeth. immarces∣sibilis, nunquam marces∣cens, flos quidam sic dictus quod non marcescat. In their marriages they had those who accompanied the bridegroome, and they were called Socij sponsi, the children of the wedding; and the Greekes  or  a , circuire. All the time of the wed∣ding they might doe nothing but attend the bride∣groome, they might not fast in the time of the marriage nor mourne, Mat. 9.15. Can the children of the wedding mourne so long as the bridegroome is with them? Who was the bride∣groomes friend.He who chiefly attended the bridegroome was called , such a one was he to whom Sampsons wife was given, who was called his companion, the Chaldie called him [Shushebhinah] Pronubus or auspex; Pronubus, Auspex. this was not a friendly part in Sampsons companion to take the bride from him, for he that hath the bride is the bride∣groome, but the friend of the bridegroome which standeth and heareth him, rejoyceth greatly, because of the voice of the bridegroome, Ioh. 3.29. So in the spirituall marriage the Preachers who are Auspices or Pronubi, should not seeke the bride to themselues, seeking themselues and their owne prayse, but let the bridegroome haue the bride. VVhat was the chiefe office of the bride∣groomes friend.They who were , brought the bride into the tent of the bridegroomes mother, to signifie now that she should be in that same place that his mother was in, Gen. 24.67. They brought her into the tent of Sara, and so the bride brought the bridegroome into her mothers chamber, Cant. 3.4. I held him and would not let him goe, untill I had brought him to my fathers house, and to the chambers of her that conceived me; she brought
him into her mothers tent, to signifie that she should leaue father and mother and cleaue unto her husband. They did two things after the marriage, first they blessed them, and then they sang , a marriage song, rejoycing for their marriage. First, they blessed them, Ruth 4.11.The manner of blessing the bridegroome. All the people that were in the gates, and the Elders said, we are all witnesses; and the blessing was this, the Lord make the woman that is come into thine house, like Rachel and like Leah, which two did build the house of Israel, and doe thou worthily in Ephrata, and be thou famous in Bethlehem: This was the blessing given to the bride. And againe, Vers. 12. Let thy house be like the house of Pharez (whom Tamar bare unto Iuda) of the seede which the Lord shall giue thee of this young woman: This was the blessing which they gaue to the bridegroome. They prayed, the Lord make thee like Rachel;The explanation of the blessing. it was their manner in their blessings to alledge the examples of those who had beene happie and prosperous, and so when they cursed any body, they brought forth the example of the most wretched and miserable creatures, Ierem. 30.21. The Lord make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the King of Babylon rosted in the fire; such was the curse pronounced against the adulterous woman, Num. 5.2. The Lord make thee an oath and a curse among thy people. The Lord make thee like Rachel and Leah:VVhy Rachel and Lea are taken for examples in the blessing. Why like Rachel and Leah? Because these two came out of their Countrey with their husbands, and left their Parents, so did Ruth with Naomi to get a husband; secondly, like Rachel and Leah, because these two sought children of their husbands modestly, Gen. 30.1. and vers. 16. So did Ruth of Boaz. Thirdly, why like Rachel and Leah, and not like Bilhah and Zilpha? Because these two were but handmaids, and they were not the mothers of ma∣ny
children, as Rachel and Leah. Fourthly, why first like Rachel and then like Leah? Because Rachel was more beloved than Leah. Fiftly, why like Rachel and Leah, and not like Sara and Rebecca? Because there came of them the Ismaelites, who were not of the Church, as well as the Israelites. To doe worthily is to doe vertuously.Doe thou worthily in Ephrata: in the Hebrew it is fac virtutem; the Hebrewes put vertue for the substance gotten by vertuous doing, Psal. 49. He shall leaue his substance behinde him; in the originall it is, he shall leaue his vertue behinde; and Prov. 31. Fecerunt potentiam, id est, comparârunt opes. Let thy house be like the house of Pharez; because there were fiue families in the Tribe of Iuda, and Pharez was the chiefe of them, Num. 26.20. They pray then first that they may haue children; secondly, that they may haue meanes to maintaine and bring up their children; and thirdly, that they may liue in credit among their people. What song they sung af∣ter the marriage.After the marriage they did sing epithalamium, a song of prayse in commendation of the Bride-groome and Brid, Psal. 45. so Psal. 77. your virgins were not praised, that is, they were not married: and the house of mar∣riage the Iewes called it [beth hillel,] domus laudis. The morrow after the marriage the Bridegroome came forth out of his bride-chāber in great pomp with his Bride, out under the vaile; and these who heard his voice rejoyced because then the marriage was consum∣mated: and David alludeth to this, Psal. 19. for as the Bridegroome made glad the hearts of his friends when he came out of his Tent or covering;An anologie betwixt the Sunne rising and the Bridegroomes comming out of his chamber the morrow after his marriage. so the Sunne when he commeth out of his chamber gladdeth the earth: his going out is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit to the end of it. Luk. 1. Christ is called , the Sunne rising from the East, that Sunne of righteous∣nesse
comming out of the bosome of his Father, and out of his bed-chamber rising in the East, did shine up∣on the Iewes in the South, and next upon us Gentiles in the North, Cant. 7.9. The conclusion of this is. We are married to Iesus  Christ per confarreationem, when he giues us the blessed Sacrament, therefore let us come worthily to it, that we take it not as Iudas did the soppe, Ioh. 13. for that will make diffarreationem, or , a divorce from him for ever. Secondly, we are married to him per coemptionem,  what was the Church when he married her? She was blacke like the Tents of Kedar: Miriam and Aaron grudged against Moses because of the Ethiopian woman whom he had married Numb. 12.1. so was his Church Cant. 1.5. I am blacke, but yet if shee had beene rich, which is a second beautie, it had beene something; but being both blacke and poore, there was a hard matter for the Lord to marrie her. A certaine woman being as∣ked what dowrie she gaue to her husband, she answered that she should keepe her selfe chast unto him onely, as a chast spouse. So we having nothing to bestow upon him, but he having pittie upon us when we were naked and uncomely, let us studie to meete him with heartie affection againe, and not to fall a whoring after other gods, which if we doe he will make us comely as the curtaines of Salomon. Thirdly, they sung praises and rejoyced at the marri∣age  of the Bridegroome and the Bride. So let us bee glad and rejoyce, and giue honour unto him, for the marriage of the Lambe is come, and his wife hath made her selfe readie, Revel. 19.7.
CHAPTER XXXIIII. Whether a brother naturall (to keepe the Tribes distinguished) might marrie his brothers wife or not in Israel, or is it meant onely of the next kinsman? DEVT. 25.5. If brethren dwell together, and one of them haue no seed, &c. THe Law is given first to naturall brethren, and not to kinsmen onely: for the Text saith, if bre∣thren dwell together, and one of them die and haue no child,Numerus cardinalis pro ordinali, vuus pro primo: as the evening and the morning was one day, that is, the first day. Gen. 1. now what brethren dwelt together? are they not naturall brethren: and one of them haue no seed, that is, if the eldest of them haue no seed, vnus pro pri∣mo. And that it is meant of naturall brethren, see it by the practise of the people of God, for when Er died Onan was bound to raise up seed to him, Gen. 38.9. So Ruth 1.The second brother was to marrie his eldest brothers wife. when Machlon the elder brother died without chil∣dren, then the inheritance came to Chilion. And when Chilion died without children, then his Vncle his nee∣rest kinsman was to succeed; and last the brothers chil∣dren or cousin germans, and he who was to succeed in the inheritance, it was he who was bound to marrie his brothers wife: wherefore the Law meaneth first of the naturall brother, and if there were no naturall brethren, then the cousins or next kinsmen were to doe this du∣tie. When the Sadduces propounded the question to Christ, that seven brethren married one wife; it is meant
of seven naturall brethren, see Tobit 3.8. And where it is said Deut. 25.5. the wife of the dead shall not marrie with a stranger, what is that, with a stranger? That is with one who is not of the familie of him who is dead. And first she was bound to marrie with the naturall brother, who was not a stranger, and if there had not beene a naturall brother, then with the next of the kinsmen, who was not a stranger. Wherfore ijbbam and  are understood first of the naturall brother, and then of the next kinsman. But it is promised under the Law as a great blessing, that he should leaue a posteritie behind him, and that his name should not be blotted out in Israel. But if the brother married his brothers wife, then his children were not called his children, but his eldest brothers children, and so his name was blotted out in Israel: and so he might haue set up a pillar as Absalon did for con∣tinuance of his name, because he had no children of his owne. But to haue the name of Iesus Christ continued is a greater blessing, Psal. 72.19.To be the father of Iesus Christ according to the flesh, a greater blessing to the second brother, then to haue children of his owne. coram sole filiabitur nomen e∣jus per successionem filiorum, we see what befell Onan be∣cause he refused to doe this dutie, hee said the seede should not be his, therefore the Lord slew him, Gen. 38.9.10. But God expresly forbad in his Law, that a man should lie with his wives sister, and by the same Law it is forbidden that a man should lie with his brothers wife, this might seeme to bee incest and confusion. God indeed forbad in his law that a man should lie with his brothers wife, but God who gaue that law,God hath many excep∣tions from his owne Law. hath given this law also. And as the Iewes say, qui ob∣servare jussit Sabbatum, is etiam jussit profanare Sabbatum. So the Lord who forbad a man to lie with his brothers wife, hath reserved this priviledge to himselfe to make
an exceptiō from the law. The Lord commanded in his Law Deut, 24.4. If a man put away his wife and shee goe from him, and become another mans wife, he may not take her againe to wife; yet the Lord tooke his Church againe Ier. 3.1. he hath reserved sundry priviledges to himselfe and exceptions from the Law. Morale positivum. Divinum positivum.Secondly, we must distinguish here betwixt these lawes which are morall positiue lawes, and these which are divine positiue lawes.We must distinguish be∣twixt the morall posi∣tiue part of the Law, and the divine positiue part. Morall positiue lawes are such, which the very light of nature commaundeth. Divine positiue lawes are these, which are accessory commaun∣dements added to the first. Example. This is a morall positiue law, that a man should not lie with his mother, nor with his mother in-law; for this is a fornication that is not named amongst the Gentils, 1 Cor. 5.1. And it was for this sort of incest that the Cananites were cast out of Canaan. So this is primarium jus naturae, or morale posi∣tivum, that a man should not lie with his daughter, nor his daughters daughter, descendendo descending down∣ward.What is primarium, and what is secundarium ius naturae. But this againe is divinum positivum, or secundariū jus naturae, in the collaterall line that a man should not lie with his sister or his brothers wife, no marriage in the collaterall line was forbidden at the first by the law of nature, or morall positiue law, but it was forbidden afterwards by the divine positiue law, Levit. 18.16. When Iuda lay with his daughter in-law, this was incest in the highest degree, because it was contrary to jus naturale, or morale positivum. So when the Corinthian lay with his mother in-law, it was against morale positi∣vum, Amita, it should not be translated Patru∣clis his cousin german but, his fathers sister. See Num. 26.59. or jus naturale. But when Amram married Io∣chabed his fathers sister, Exod. 6.20. this was not against the morall, positiue, or naturall part of the Law, be∣cause it was not in the right line, but in the collaterall, although in the neerest degree, it was against the divine positiue law.
And for to replenish his Church with people, God oversaw this sort of marriage at the first. But God doth more here, he commandeth the brother to raise up seed to his brother. First this is not contra primarium jus na∣turae, because it was not in the right line. Secondly it is an exception from secundarium jus naturae: for when God willed them to doe this, he willed them not to doe this to satisfie lust, for that was contrary to primarium jus naturae, but onely that the elder brother might bee a type of Iesus Christ, who should neuer want a seed in his Church. If a woman were barren, the Lord could not command another man to goe in unto her and be∣get children upon her, for that were contra primarium jus naturae; the Lord will not suffer now that a brother should marrie a sister, as he did in the beginning of the world, neither if a brother now should marrie his eldest brothers wife were it lawfull, for now the eldest bro∣ther is not a type of Christ, and it should not bee an exception from the Law, but contra secundarium jus na∣turae. The conclusion of this is. God who giveth the Law maketh not a Law to himselfe, but he hath reserved to himselfe exception from the Law, when and where it pleaseth him. CHAPTER XXXV. Of their prisons and places of punishment. GEN. 39.20. And Iosephs Master tooke him, and put him into the prison: a place where the Kings pri∣soners were bound. THey had sundry sorts of Prisons; first, they had Warding,Of their place of pu∣nishment. as Shimei was confined not to come over the brooke Kedron; and, Abiather in Ana∣thoth,
and he who killed casually was confined in the Citie of Refuge;Three sorts of Prisons among the Iewes. this was a free sort of Prison, at the first Carcer non erat pars paenae, the Prison was not a part of the punishment. Secondly, they had another sort of Prison, in which they were more restrained than in the Ward, they were kept in Prison, but others had accesse to them, as when Iohn was in Prison, his Disciples had accesse to him; so Paul was in bonds, but yet he begot Onesimus in his bonds, Phil. 1. Thirdly, they had a more straite Prison called , Custodia, a close Prison. And fourthly, they had a deepe or a low pit; the Greekes called it Barathrum in Athens, and at Rome it was called Tullianum; such was that Prison in which Ieremie was let downe with cords in a Dungeon, where was no water but myre,Allusion. Iere. 38.6. And Zacharie allu∣deth to this, Zach. 9.11. As for thee also by the bloud of thy Covenant, I haue sent forth thy Prisoners out of the Pit wherein is no water. See Nehem. 3.25.There were some Prisons within the Citie of Ierusa∣lem, and some without the Citie; within the Citie, as the house of Ionathan,Some Prisons within, and some without the walles of Ierusalem. which was neere the Kings Pa∣lace, Iere. 37.15. So the Dungeon of Malchior, the son of Hammelech, Iere. 38.6. So they had Prisons without the gate, as that Prison wherein Peter was put, Act. 12.10. And when they had passed the first and the second Ward, (that is, the quaternions of Souldiers that kept him) they came unto the yron gate that leadeth unto the Citie: this Prison was without the gate neare Mount Calvarie, and it was the loathsomest and vilest Prison of all, for in it the theeues who were carried to Calvarie to be exe∣cuted were kept.Allusion. And Christ alludeth to this Prison, Mat. 25.30. Cast him into utter darkenesse, where there shall be weeping and wailing, and gnashing of teeth: which
Allusion could not be understood, unlesse there had beene a darke Prison without the Citie, where was ut∣ter darkenesse. Now let us compare Ezechiels Ward, Cap. 4.A difference betwixt three sorts of Prisons. Ieremies Prisons, Iere. 37. and 38. and Peters Prison, Act. 12. Ezechiel when he was warded in his owne house by the Lord, Cap. 3.24. First,These things were not done in vision but re∣ally, for when he saith a thing was done in visi∣on, he saith, in simi∣litudine onely. he was commanded to stay in his owne house; secondly, he was commanded to lie three hundreth and ninetie dayes upon his left side, Cap. 4.4. and fortie dayes upon his right side, Vers. 6. Then for his dyet, he is commanded to take wheat, bar∣ley, and beanes, and lentils, and millet, and fetches, and to put them all in one vessell, & to make bread of them, Vers. 9. there was no choise of bread here, and then to cover and bake it with mans dung, Vers. 12. or at the least with cowes dung, Vers. 15. And for the quantitie, he should eate it by measure, twentie shekels weight e∣very day, Vers. 10. which was ten ounces; and his drinke was by measure the sixt part of an Hin of water, Vers. 11. which was as much as twelue egges would hold. Now let us see how Ieremie was handled in his Pri∣son, Shemajah gaue commandement by a Letter to put him in the stockes, Iere. 29.26. In the Hebrew it is [El. hazinok] navis sugentis, as yee would say, the ship of the sucker, they closed the Prisoner betweene two boords, and they gaue him some liquor in the meane time to preserue his life. So Iere. 11.19. Mittamus lig∣num in panem ejus; Chaldeus, proijciamus lignum, that is, if he will, let him eate the stockes, he shall haue no o∣ther bread, or, corrumpamius panem ejus, the english trans∣lation hath it, let us destroy the stalke with his bread; and Ieremie was in a deepe Dungeon where he stood in myre and clay, Iere. 38.6. So they used to put them in the stockes; they were at the first called Nervi, because they
were made of the sinewes of beasts, and afterwards they were made of yron, Psal. 105.18. whose feete they hurt with fetters, he was laid in yron. Peters Prison a loath∣some Prison.Then for Peters Prison, it was utter darkenesse, with∣out the Citie, that the stench and filthinesse of these prisoners might not be offensiue to the Citizens, the most loathsome Prison of all, and the darkest Prison, and therefore a great wonder when the light shined in it, Act. 12.7. Three sorts of Prisons.There are three Prisons; first, our mothers belly, in which we are first Prisoners; and secondly, the graue; and thirdly, the Prison of the wicked in hell. This first prison it is a straite prison; it was a great preservation when Ionas was preserved three dayes in the Whales bellie, the weeds being wrapped about his head, and the earth with her barres closed him round a∣bout, Ionah. 2.5. Yet his life was brought up from corrup∣tion; it is as wonderfull a preservation in our mothers belly how we should liue, being so wrapped there and preserved from corruption; he was but kept there three dayes, but man is kept nine moneths. The graue a strong Prison.Our second Prison is the graue, Ionas was kept in the Whales belly with jawes and teeth; Peter was kept in the Prison with foure quaternions of Souldiers; but man is kept within this Prison with a more terrible guard, when the body is sowne in corruption, in disho∣nour; and in weakenesse, 1 Cor. 15.43. And oftentimes with sinne the greatest enemie of all, Iob 10.11. their sinnes lie downe in the dust with them, that is, in the graue, this Prison keepeth a man sure. Hell a terrible and fearefull Prison.The last Prison is that of the wicked in hell; man when he dyeth is said to returne to his owne earth. Ps. 146.4. That is, he hath right to the earth, because he was made of the earth, and he must returne to it againe; So the wicked haue right to hell, it is their proper inheri∣tance, Iudas went to his owne place, Act. 1.35.
A childe when he is in his mothers belly, his first pri∣son, although he be wrapped up there, and closely kept, yet he hath a kinde and louing keeper, his mother; but the graue is a terrible keeper and an enemie, 1 Cor. 15.26. Yet this enemie must render up her dead againe; & even as the Whale spued out Ionas, because he could not concoct him; so shall the graue cast up her dead a∣gaine, not being able to concoct them; but there is no redemption out of hell the last prison: In other Pri∣sons, men haue found some mitigation and favour, but never any in this prison. Ioseph was put in fetters, the yron entered into his soule, Psal. 105.18. That is, the yron cut his flesh, and came as it were to the soule; but the Lord was with him, and extended kindnesse unto him, and gaue him favour in the sight of the Keeper of the Prison, Gen. 39.21. But in this prison the Lord is not with them, neither finde they any favour in the eyes of their Keeper; but as the Task-maisters doubled the Taske upon the poore Israelites in Egypt, and were heavie ex∣actors over them, and said daily to them, Get you to your burthens; so these fiends of hell are rigorous ex∣actors over the wicked: Ieremie when he was in a deepe Prison, yet he had Ebedmelech to intercede for him, Iere. 38.7. but none doe intercede for the wicked. Peter was in a darke Prison, yet the light did shine about him, his fetters fell off from him, & the Angell led him forth, and set him free; But in hell, there is no light nor no redemption out of it. The conclusion of this is; as Ieremie prayed unto the King Zedechias, that he would not cause him to returne to the house of Ionathan the Scribe (which was the prison) lest he died there, Iere. 27.20. So let us put up our sup∣plications to the Lord, that he would not send us into that eternall Prison to die for ever.
CHAPTER XXXVI. Of their Whipping. DEVT. 35.3. Fortie stripes may be given him, and not exceede. Divers sorts of punish∣ments.THere were sundry sorts of punishments amongst the Iewes; first, damnum, secondly, vincula, thirdly, verbera, fourthly, talio, fiftly, ignominia, sixtly, servitus, seventhly, mors. But they never used to banish any, because they would not put them where there was a strange Religion professed. When they whipt their malefactors; first they had a respect to the offence committed; and secondly, to the person who was to be whipt; and thirdly, to the whip. They had a respect both to the person and to the offence in whipping.First, they had a respect to the offence; in simplici de∣licto, they might not exceede fortie stripes, but they might diminish the number of the stripes, if the person offending had beene of a weake body; Secondly, for a double offence they might not exceed fortie, but they were to giue him the full fortie all at once; if a man had committed theft, and with all had added perjurie, this was a double offence, and for this he got the rigour, full fortie. If he had a strong body, and committed a double of∣fence, then he got the full fortie all at one time; second∣ly, if he had a strong body and committed a simple of∣fence, then he got not the full number; thirdly, if he had had a weake body & committed a double offence, then he got the full number, but at two severall times; but if he had beene of a weake body, and committed a simple offēce, then the number of the stripes was much diminished.
Againe, they considered how many stripes the offen∣der might beare, and the number of the stripes which the whip gaue: Example, the offender is able to beare twentie stripes, and they adjudge him to haue twentie stripes; now they giue him but sixe blowes, for if they had given him seven blowes, they should haue excee∣ded the number prescribed, for the whip wherewith they whipped them had three thongs, and if they per∣ceived that he grew faint and weake, when they were beating him, they diminished some of the number; if they ordained that he should haue twelue stripes, and observed in the meane time that he fainted not, yet they exceeded not that number twelue, which they had or∣dained to giue him at the first. When they whipped Paul, 2 Cor. 11.24. and gaue him thirtie-nine stripes at three severall times; first, it seemes that he hath beene of a strong body; secondly, it was for three severall offences (as they thought) that they beat him;The offender was not whipt thrice for one fault. for if the offender had thrice committed the selfe same fault, then he was no more beaten, but he was shut up within a narrow wall, wherein he might neither sit nor stand, and there he was fed Pane afflictio∣nis & aquâ pressurae; example, if he had eaten the fat twice, Levit. 3.17. he was but beaten twice; but if he had eaten the third time of it, then he was shut up in a close prison, or such a prison in which Ahab comman∣ded Micheas to be put, 1 King. 22.27. The offender was bowed downe when he was bea∣ten, Deut. 25.2. he neither sat nor stood, and he who whipt him, stood upon a stone, and he let out or in the whip, by drawing up or downe the knot upon it; for when the knot was drawne up, then the thongs spread farther and gaue a shrewder blow; and when the knot was drawne downe, then the thongs were contracted, and they gaue the lesser blow; when he stood behinde
him, then he whipt him upon the breast and belly, and he gaue him three blowes at a time; and when he stood before him, he lashed him upon the shoulders, and gaue him sixe blowes, three upon every shoulder. Three Iudges stood by vvhen they were vvhipt.There stood three Iudges by when he was whipt, the first repeated these words of the Law to him, Deut. 28.58. If thou obey not all these things, then the Lord shall multiply thy plagues: the second Iudge numbered the stripes; Maymone Hal: Sauht: cap. 16. and the third Iudge said to the whipper, Lay on, shelishi omer lachozen hacce, Dicit ei qui portat fla∣gellum, percute. He who was beaten, was not disgraced by this bea∣ting,Whipping was not a disgrace amongst the Iewes. for whipping amongst them was but as a civill mulct, or fyne, not a disgrace as it is amongst us, and therefore the Lord said, Deut. 25.3. That thy brother should not seeme vile in thine eyes. When they whipt a∣ny of their brethren, they did it not in scorne or derisi∣on, but in compassion, they looked upon him, and re∣ceived him after the punishmēt, as their brother againe: and as he who looked upon Cato Vticensis seeing him drunke, turned away his eyes and seemed to take no no∣tice of it, being ashamed that such a graue man should be so overtaken; so did they behold their brethren with pitie, and were readie to cover their offence, and would not upbraid them afterwards for it. The spirituall uses which wee are to make of these whippings, are first, as they fitted the whip to the per∣son, if he were weaker or stronger, so the Lord layeth no more upon us than we are able to beare. Secondly, as the Iudge stood by and numbered the stripes; so the Lord our God numbereth all the afflicti∣ons which befalleth his children. Thirdly, although they were beaten, yet they were not vile in the eyes of the Iudges; so when the Lord cor∣recteth us, he counteth not basely of us, but esteemes us as his children.
Fourthly, as they were reckoned still brethren when they were whipped; so should we account these who are afflicted, and the Lords hand upon them, to be still our brethren. CHAPTER XXXVII. Whether an Israelite that had lien with a bond∣maide, that was betrothed, was whipped or not? LEVIT. 19.20. And whosoever lyeth carnally with a woman that is a bond-maide, betrothed to a husband, and not at all redeemed nor freedome given her, shee shall be scourged. THe Iewes did hold, if an Israelite had lien with a bond-woman betrothed, and not redeemed, she was to be beaten, and he was to offer a sacri∣fice for his offence; shee was to be beaten, because shee was not a free-woman, and shee had nothing to offer, and although she had, yet she could not offer it, because she was a stranger and not converted. The Seventie translate it , Vapulatio erit a  Bos from [Bakar] Inquirere; but it commeth from [Bakar] Bos, because they were whipt with a thong of oxe-leather, and some translate it Nervo bovino. The reason why the Iewes held that the woman should onely be beaten is this, The Iewes held that the woman was beaten and not the man. because the word [Tihich] is in the feminine gender, and they reade it, she shall be beaten and not the man; he committed not adultery, he pollu∣ted not another mans wife, nor a free-woman, but a
stranger, and a slaue, therefore he was not to be beaten, but to offer a sacrifice; but this word [Tihieh] may a∣gree as well with [Bikkoreth] which is in the feminine gender, and not to reade it ipsa erit vapulatio, she shall be beaten, but there shall be a beating, that is, they shall be both beaten, and the man so much the rather, because he lay with her who was betrothed to another; and the words following seeme to imply so much, they shall not be put to death; this whipping shall be a sufficient pu∣nishment for them: the Seventie translate it , but Ionathan in his Paraphrase following the rest of the Hebrewes, paraphraseth it thus, Scrutatio erit in judicio ejus; ut vapulet ipsa rea, & non ipse. But the man is bound to bring a Ram for his trespasse offering; if he had beene whipt, why is he commanded to bring an offering? Because his sinne was greater than the womans, therefore he was both whipt and brought his offering,The punishment of the man & the woman was alike for every unclean∣nesse. in cunctis nuditatibus pares sunt vir & faemina; if a free man had lien with a free-woman in Israel, then he was bound to marry her, or else to pay her dowrie; second∣ly, if a free man lay with a bond-maide that was betro∣thed and not redeemed, then they were both whipt; but neither of them put to death; he died not although the woman was betrothed, because she was not a free∣woman; thirdly, if a free man had lien with a freewo∣man betrothed, then they were both to die; fourthly, if a free man had lien with a married woman, then they were both to die, Deut. 25. Fiftly, if a married man had lien with an unmarried woman, they were both to die: lastly, if both the persons had beene married, they were both to die; here in cunctis nuditatibus sunt pares, vir & faemina. Those who are equall in sinne, shall be equall in pu∣nishment.
The punishment did not expiate the sinne, but the sa∣crifice. The whore and the harlot are one flesh, therefore but one sacrifice for both. CHAPTER XXXVII. De Lege Talionis, Of the Law of Retaliation. EXOD. 21.24. Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foote for foote. THe Lawyers when they interpret this Law, they say, that there is talio analogica & talio jdentitatis;Talio Analogica. Identitatis. and they say, that talio identitatis should be obser∣ved, if the cause be alike, and the persons, and the man∣ner of doing. Example; a private man beateth out his neighbours eye in spite and malice, therefore his eye should be pulled out againe; but talio similitudinis is then to be observed: when the fact varieth in many cir∣cumstances, as who did it, to whom he did it, &c. then talio analogica should be observed, but not identitatis: example; if a sonne should beat his father, he should not be beaten againe, but he should die the death; here they obserue not medium rei, but medium personae.Medium Rei. Personae. Example the second, in that Parable of Nathan to David, when the rich man came and tooke the poore mans sheepe, 1 Sam. 12.3. Here medium rei was not to be observed, but medium personae, because he was a rich man. So in commutatiue Iustice we obserue medium rei, but in distributiue Iustice we obserue medium personae. Againe, they distinguish betwixt Radamantheum jus,The strict sense of the Law of Retaliation. the strict sense of the Law, and  or ,
or reciproca paena. The strict sense of the Law is, when literally they will haue eye for eye, and tooth for tooth; the milder sense of the Law, is, when they will haue some other satisfaction for the wrong done: the Iewes generally follow this sense of the Law, if a man did beat out his neighbours eye, or his tooth; they fol∣lowed not this Rhadamantheum ius,The milder sense of the Law of Retaliation. or the strict sense of the Law, that he should pay one of his owne eyes, or one of his owne teeth for it, but that he should satisfie the man whom he had wronged, by paying so much money to him; for in these cases that were not deadly, they held that they might make recompence and satis∣faction by money: and they giue this instance out of the Law; if an Oxe were wont to push with his horne, and it hath beene testified to his owner, and he hath not kept him in, but that he hath killed a man or a woman, then the Oxe shall be stoned to death, and his owner shall be put to death, or if there be a summe of money laid up∣on him, then he shall giue for the ransome of his life what∣soever is laid upon him, Exod. 21.30.31. Here he might redeeme his life with a ransome, because he was not the direct killer, if he satisfied the parties by giving a sum of money. So they held that they might satisfie for such transgressions which were not capitall, by paying of money. And the law of the twelue Tables amongst the Romans saith,The Roman Law of Retaliation. Si unum perfoderit unius jactura multari, si utrum{que} unius tantùm ut sceleris sui notam gestare possit; & quoniam funesta & impia manus amputari ei debet, pro manu ablata, bessis patrimonij sui irrogatur, id{que} in solatium vitae ejus cui oculi sunt effossi, auferto. If he had put out both the mans eyes, they would take but one of his eyes, and cut the hand from him for the other eye, and then they mitigated that part of the punishment, and they made him pay the fourth part of his substance to relieue the man whose eyes he had put out.
The Heathen say, that Ceres the goddesse of Corne,Simile. cut off the shoulder of Pelops, Ceres could not set in a shoulder of flesh and bone againe, therefore the gods tooke the next best course, and they ordained her to put in a shoulder of Ivorie to Pelops: so he that had beaten out an eye or a tooth of a man, he could not put it in a∣gaine; therefore they thought it good that he should put in a shoulder of Ivorie, that is, with his goods to maintaine him whom he had hurt. CHAPTER XXXVIII. That theft amongst the Iewes, was not capitall. EXOD 22.1. If a man shall steale an Oxe or a Sheepe and kill it or sell it, he shall restore fiue Oxen for an Oxe, and foure Sheepe for a Sheepe. THeft by the Law of Moses was punished by resti∣tution, paying sometimes two for one,Three sorts of Precepts amongst the Hebrewes. or foure for one, or at the most fiue for one, & not aboue. The Hebrewes had three sorts of Commandements, Graviae  Levia.  Media. Praecepta first, they had [Mitzboth Hhamuroth] Praecepta gravia, and [Mitzboth Kalloth] Praecepta levia: those which they call, Praecepta gravia, here they say the punishment is al∣wayes indispensable, as the murtherer is alwayes to die the death. Secondly, they had Praecepta levia, as not to kill the dam sitting upon the egges; this was one of the judiciall Lawes of the lightest sort, for there was no punishment in Israel for transgression of this Law; so if an Oxe had killed a man, his flesh was not to be eaten, this was one of their judiciall Lawes; but if a man had eaten the flesh of such an Oxe, he was not to die for it.
Thirdly, they say, they had Praecepta media, where the punishment might be enlarged or diminished, but not unto death, as in theft. How affirmatiue and negatiue Precepts bind.Affirmatiue commandements binde not so strictly as Negatiues doe, this is a Negatiue, yee shall not suffer a Witch to liue, but this is an Affirmatiue, that the theefe shall pay fourefold or fiue; this Law had sundry excep∣tions and mitigations, it might be extended or mitiga∣ted, he was bound to pay fourefold, but yet the Magi∣strate might haue mitigated this, and taken but twofold from him; and they might haue extended it further, as Salomon extendeth it to sevenfold, Proverb. 6.31. [Ieshallem Shibhgnathaijm] he shall pay sevenfold: VVhat the doubling of the duall nūber among the Hebrewes signifieth. the He∣brewes double the duall number, ten in the duall num∣ber, is twentie; three is thirtie; and foure is fortie; but when they come to seaven, here they double not. The light of the Moone shall be as the light of the Sunne, and the light of the Sunne shall be sevenfold; then he addeth for explanation, as the light of seven dayes, Esa. 30.26. Here Shibhgnathaijm doubleth not in the duall number, as in the former numbers, but onely standeth for seven, he shall pay Shibhgnathaijm,VVhat the number se∣ven signifieth. that is, seven for one; some interpret it a definite number for an indefinite, or he shall pay sevenfold, that is, as much as two for foure; but it is not the manner of the Scriptures to take the number under seven, for seven; or he shall pay seven∣fold, that is, much more then he tooke; and the words following seeme to approue this interpretation, he shall pay all the substance of his house. And sometimes this pu∣nishment was extended to death, as Davids sentence was, that he should die the death, because he tooke the poore mans onely sheepe. Some answere that it was not for his theft that David gaue out sentence of death up∣on him, but for his oppression and violent theft, as if a man had come by night, and had broken into a mans
house, and had stollen any thing, then he might haue safely killed him by the Law, and he was not to die for it; but if he had come after the Sunne rose, and had sto∣len any thing, and the owner of the goods had killed him, then he was to die for it. But out of Davids answere we may obserue this,The person against whom the theft is com∣mitted aggravateth the sinne. that the person against whom the sinne is committed, aggra∣vateth the sinne, as for a rich man to steale a poore mans sheepe; so the time aggravateth the sinne, if the theefe came in the night to steale, then the owner of the goods might safely kill him, because of his violent theft. But it may be asked, what is violent theft? If a man steale to satisfie his hunger, that is not violent theft, but if a man steale who may get his living other wayes, and liue upon the sweat of other mens browes, or if he steale from one that hath small means to liue on, or if he haue meanes to liue upon who stealeth, this is judged vio∣lent theft,Tom. 1.2. Municipall Lawes bind onely in the Countrey where they are made. and the Magistrate for this may put him to death. Thomas observeth well, that the Magistrate may adde to the judiciall Law of Moses according to the ne∣cessitie of the time, and greatnesse of the offence; and as the Municipall Lawes of other Countries oblige not men, but in the Countrey where they are made, so doth not Moses judiciall Law; A Magistrate in Israel was bound when a malefactor was whipt not to giue him a∣boue fortie stripes, this Law bindeth not the Magistrate now, sed crescentibus delictis exasperantur paenae, but the equitie of Moses judiciall Lawes bindeth all people; this is the equitie of Moses Law, that for violent theft, a man should alwaies die, and the Law judged that vio∣lent theft, which is not for a mans necessitie to satisfie his life. What if a poore man had but a little to saue his life, and another were in as great extremitie, whether were this violent theft for him to take from the poore man in such a case.
How Christs words are to be understood in workes of charitie.No doubt it were, therefore Christ sayth, hee that hath two coats, let him giue his neigbour one, to wit in his necessitie, but not he that hath one coat, for then he was not bound to giue it. It is alledged Prov. 6.30. that the theife should pay seven-fold, and not be put to death, but the jealous hus∣band will kill the adulterer. This place proveth nothing, it sheweth onely what the jealous husband doth, it sheweth not what he may doe. And secondly, for the theife, it sheweth onely what was the usuall punishment amongst the Iewes, by their judiciall Lawes to take seven fold, but it sheweth not what may bee done by the positiue lawes of other Countries. The conclusion of this is; Now under the Gospell theft is a greater sinne then under the Law,A difference betwixt that which is done, and that which should bee done. and the ne∣cessitie is greater amongst us generally, then it was a∣mongst them. And thirdly, that selling of men to make restitution for things taken by theft, is not in use a∣mongst us, and therefore theeues may bee put to death. CHAPTER XXXIX. Of their proceeding in judgement before they executed the malefactor. EzEK. 9.10. Goe through the midst of Ierusalem, and set a marke upon the forehead of those that sigh &c. Those that were to bee saved, the Lord caused to marke them.THose who were appointed to be saved amongst the people of God, he used to set a marke upon them, Exod. 12. When the Egyptians were to be
destroyed, the Lord commanded his people to sprinkle the bloud of the Paschall Lambe upon the lintels of their doores; and from this as Epiphanius marketh,Lib. 1. cont. haer. 18. the Egyptians used at the Equinoxe in the Spring, to take vermilion and to rubbe over all their trees and houses with it, saying that, at that time of the yeere the fire had almost burnt up all Egypt, and therefore they use this as a signe in remembrance of their deliverance. So the Lord commanded Ezekiel to set a marke upon those of Ierusalem that mourned, whom he was minded to saue. Ezek. 9.4. But what was the reason that he set not a marke of destruction upon them that were to be destroyed, as he set upon these who were to be saved? The reason was, God did not marke those who were to be destroyed, because of their great number. because of the great number that was to be destroyed, in respect of the handfull that was to be saved, for where there was one to be saved, there was a hundred to be destroyed; there were but seven thousand who bowed not their knee to Baall, and of the great multitude that came out of Egypt, onely two entred into the land of Canaan. And Revel. 7.4. of all the Tribes of Israel there were but one hundred and for∣tie foure thousand sealed in the fore-head. And in Ie∣remies time it was very hard to find one that executed judgement in all the streetes of Ierusalem, Ier. 5.1. There were a few good men at that time, as Ieremie himselfe, Ebedmelech the Blackmoore, Vriah the Prophet, and the Rechabites, But the most of the rest were naught, and if Ierusalem had beene searched few had been found in it. And this was a griefe to the Prophet Micah, which made him to complaine, that hee could not get a cluster to eate, Mica. 7.1. meaning that the good men were perished out of the earth. The Heathen learned this of the people of God, to marke those who were to be saved with the letter ,
and these that were condemned with the letter θ theta.The heathen marked the condemned with theta, and them that were absolved in judgement with tau. Ascon. pad: It was the custome of the ancient warriors, when they re∣turned from battaile, he who kept the register of their names, marked the names of those who returned safe with the letter tau, and the names of those who were wanting with the letter theta, the Latines learned this from the Grecians, the Grecians from the Egyptians, and the Egyptians from the people of God. Persius Si potis es vitio nigrum praefigere theta. The Iewes put not two to death in one day, but for the same crime.They put not two to death in one day, except they were guiltie of one crime, and they giue this example; If a man had lien with the Priests daughter, he and she were not put to death both in one day, because she was guiltie of a greater sinne then he, therefore she was to be burnt quicke, but he was not to be put to death that day, neither was he burnt quicke as she was. How came it to passe then that they put Christ and the two theeves to death in one day, seing Christ was condemned for affecting the Kingdome, and the theeves for theft? seditiosi Mark. 15.7. á  seditio factio.Christ and the two theeves were condemned for one fault because they were , troublers of the peace of the Kingdome; and therefore the theife said, thou art  in the same condemnation, Luke 23.40. Barrabas was a murtherer and so should haue dyed by the sword, Effractores. but because he made insurrection and trou∣bled the common peace, therefore he was to be cruci∣fied. And the Hebrewes call these [perizim] effractores, and the Rabbins called them listin, from the Greeke word , they tooke armes to trouble the peace of the Common-wealth, and they used to crucifie all these who troubled the Kingdome and made insurrection.
CHAPTER XL. Of their Capitall punishments. IOSH. 7.25. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them with fire after they had stoned them with stones. THere were sundry sorts of punishments inflicted upon malefactors by the house of judgement a∣mong the Iewes. Some of them were burnt, some of them were strangled, some of them were stoned, and some of them were beheaded, and some of them were drowned. He that lay with his mother, or daughter in law the wife of his sonne, or with a maide that was betrothed,Who were stoned. Deut. 22.24. Or if a woman bowed downe to a beast, Levit. 20.16. so the blasphemer, Levit. 24.14. and I∣dolater, Deut. 17.5. So he who offered his seed to Mo∣lech, Levit. 20.2. He that had the spirit of divination or was a wizard, Levit. 20.27. He that profaned the Sab∣bath, he that cursed his father or his mother, Levit. 20.9. so the disobedient sonne was stoned to death. Deut. 21.21. He that perswaded or enticed others to Idolatry, Deut. 13.1. all these were stoned to death. First the Priests daughter if she committed adulterie. Secondly he who lay with his owne daughter.Who were burne. Thirdly he who lay with his sonnes wife. Fourthly he who lay with his daughters daughter, or with the daughter of his wiues daughter. Fifthly he who lay with his mo∣ther in law, or with the mother of his mother in law, or hee who lay with the mother of his father in law, his wife being yet aliue; even all these
were burnt. Iosh. 7 15. He that is taken with a cursed thing shall be burnt with fire, and vers. 25. all Israel stoned him with stones, first he was stoned, and then burnt. Who were beheaded.Those who killed were beheaded, and those who fell away to Idolatry. Who were strangled.The fourth sort of punishment was strangling; wch was the lightest sort of punishment capital among the Iewes. First he who did strike his father or his mother. Secōdly he who stole a man in Israel. Deut. 24.7. Thirdly any old man who hearkened not to the voice of the Synedrion. Fourthly a false Prophet; and he who lay with another mans wife. Fiftly, he who defiled the Priests daughter; all these were strangled. And the Iewes say, wheresoever this punishment is set down, let his bloud be upon his owne head, it is to be understood of stoning; but where the phrase is found, let him die the death, and the punish∣ment not set downe in particular, then it is to be under∣stood of strangling. But this holdeth not, it is said Exod. 21.12. he that smiteth a man that he die shall surely bee put to death: so it is said, that the adulterer shall die the death, yet he was not strangled but stoned. Ezek. 16.40. Ioh. 8.45. crucifigere  Crux.  Arbor. .This strangling the Romanes changed into crucifying, which was called [Zacaph] crucifigere, and the crosse was called [Zeceph] crux, and [gnetz] arbor, and the Greekes called it  lignum geminum. Lastly drowning, Mat. 18.6. It were better that a mil∣stone were hanged about his necke, dimersio in pelagus, sub∣mersio. and that he were drowned in the midst of the Sea; and the Greekes had , they were put in a chest of lead, and sunke in the Sea, as Casaubon sheweth out of Athenaeus. Excisio.What sort of punishment is meant Gen. 17.14. he that is not circumcised, that soule shall bee cut off from his peo∣ple? The Hebrewes expound this sort of punishment di∣versly.
Kimchi saith, he shall be punished by the Lord, but he addeth, that he is much mistaken who thinketh that the child not being circumcised is secluded from the life to come. Moses Cotzensis thinketh, that these who were not circumcised the eight day, should dye without children, alluding to that place Levit. 20.20. But all of them agree in this that the punishment is in∣flicted by the Lord. Exod. 31.14.  Whosoever doth any worke on the Sabbath day he shall be cut off from his people, and bee surely put to death, by cutting off here is meant, cutting off by the Magistrate, why should it not then be so understood in that place Gen. 17.14. so Levit. 20.6. If any goe after wizards, I will set my face against him, and cut him off; by cutting off here is meant, to be cut off by the Magistrate, why is it not so then to be understood in that place of Genesis before mentioned? Maymone answereth to these places,  distinguishing betwixt the manifest transgression, and the hidden trans∣gression of the Law, if one did violate the Sabbath with a hie hand, and if there were witnesses, and he were ad∣monished before not to doe so, then he was cut off by the hand of the Magistrate; but if he was not admoni∣shed secretly before, and did transgresse, then hee was cut off by the hand of the Lord. But wee must distin∣guish betwixt these phrases Levit. 17.10. and 21.6.Difference betwixt these two phrases, I shall cut off &c. and thou shalt cut off &c. I shall cut off that soule, and thou shalt cut off that soule; Exod. 22.18. thou shalt not suffer a witch to liue, but when hee sayth, I will set my selfe against that soule which eateth blood, and will cut him off from my people, then it is meant, that by his owne hand immediately hee will cut him off. But what sort of cutting off by the hand of God is meant here? It is not meant of any bodily punishment inflicted
upon their bodies, or upon their posteritie, as the Iewes interpret it, but of excommunication and secluding them from the Church. So Calvin, Iunius, Deodati ex∣pound it. CHAPTER XLII. Why they gaue wine to those who were go∣ing to be executed. PROV. 31.6. Giue wine unto those that be of an hea∣vie heart. THey used to doe three things to them who were condemned. First, they gaue them wine to drinke to comfort them. Amos 2.8. They drunke the wine of the condemned in the house of their God; that is, they dranke the most excellent wine, for such wine they gaue to the condemned. Secondly, they used to apply , soft wooll, which the Chirurgians apply to wounds to mitigate their paine, because their death was a lingering death. Thirdly, they used to hold odorife∣rous canes or reedes to their nose to refresh their braines. But see what miserable comforters the Iewes were to Christ, Luke saith , they derided him, Luk. 23.35. for in stead of wine, they gaue him vinegar and gall to drinke, which was a most bitter sort of drinke; and the Lord saith Ier. 9.15. I will feed this people even with wormwood, and giue them water of gall to drinke. And for  they gaue him , hysope tyed about a read and dipped in vineger, and they gaue it him not to quench his thirst, but to smell it in derision.
They gaue him wine to drinke mingled with myrrhe, but he received it not, Mark. 15.23. Christ would not drinke this cup mingled with myrrhe (for it intoxicated the braine) that he might be sensible of the paine which he was to suffer for us. It is a great judgement to be beaten and not to feele it, Prov. 23.35. The Lord who went willingly to death, did willingly drinke the cuppe of Gods wrath for us; and therefore he was unwilling to drinke this cuppe, which would haue made him sense∣lesse of the paine. They gaue him hyssope in stead of wooll which should haue mitigated his paine, the tender mercies of the wicked are cruell. Prov. 12.10. Christ suffered in all his senses, in his tast, they gaue him veneger mixed with gall; in his feeling, whereas they should haue applied soft wooll, and bound up his wounds, & mitigated his paine, they applied but hysope so in his hearing, he heard their bitter mockes and scof∣fing. And as he felt the grievous paine of the crosse in all his senses, so the wicked shall suffer the paines and torments of hell in all their senses. The conclusion of this is, sin is sweet in the beginning, but bitter in the end; Adam did eate asweet fruit,  but here is vineger and gall a bitter potion offered to Christ for it; the lippes of a strange woman drop as an hony combe, and her mouth is smoother then oyle, but her end is bitter as wormwood, sharpe as a two-edged sword, Pro. 5.3. They giue him hysope; hysope was the last purgati∣on and sprinkling when the leper was brought into the Campe againe: and David alludeth to this, Psal. 51. wash mee with hysope. So Christs death must purge us from all our sinnes, and bring us into the societie of the Saints of God, that there we may dwell for ever.
CHAPTER XLIII. Of their VVarres. DEVT. 20.10. When thou commest neare to a Citie to fight against it, then proclaime peace vnto it, &c. FIrst let us consider in their warres, the time when they went to battell; secondly, the manner how they pitched about the Tabernacle; thirdly, the manner how they marched when the Camp removed; fourthly, the Proclamation made to them at their re∣moving; fiftly, the conditions of peace offered to the e∣nemie; sixtly, what they did before they joyned bat∣tell; and lastly, the song which they had after the vic∣torie. The time that they en∣tred to be Souldiers.First, what time they entred to be Souldiers? the Levites entred to their Ministery when they were thir∣tie yeares, Num. 4.42. But the Souldiers entred when they were twentie yeares, and they left off when they were fiftie; none went to the warres but they who pay∣ed the halfe shekell; the Levites were exempted, be∣cause they served the Lord in the Tabernacle, they nei∣ther payed this halfe shekell, nor yet went to the warres. Women likewise were exempted, She that tarrieth at home, divideth the spoyle, Psal. 63.12. So were the weake, sicke, and infirme, the yong, and the old under twentie and aboue fiftie; so the captiues, and Idolaters, all these were exempted, none of them payed the halfe shekell, or went to the warres. Secondly, when they pitched about the Tabernacle, they pitched their Tents with their faces towards it, Num. 2.2. because of the respect that they carried to it.
They pitched round about the Tabernacle when they rested in their Tents; and David alludeth to this, Psal. 76.11. Let all that be about him, bring presents unto him that ought to be feared; there were three Tribes vpon e∣very quarter; Iuda, Issachar, and Zabulon upon the East; Ruben, Simeon, and Gad upon the South; Ephraim, Ma∣nasse, and Benjamin upon the West; Dan, Asher, and Nephthali upon the North, Num. 23.10. Who can num∣ber the fourth part of Israel? Here is an allusion to the Campe as it was divided in foure quarters. There were three Tribes on every quarter, and a space betwixt them and the Tabernacle, and Moses and Aa∣ron and the Priests upon the East; the Coathites upon the South; the Gersonites upon the West; and the Merarites upon the North; these lay betwixt the Tribes and the Tabernacle to watch the holy place; So betwixt Gods throne and the foure and twentie Elders compassing it, were foure living creatures full of eyes, Rev. 6.10. In the first place Iudah pitched and removed first,The priviledges of Iudah. Iudah got the first place, of him the Kings were to come, he marched first, he sacrificed first, Numb. 7.12. Iudah gaue a Lyon in his Colours. Themistocles said, it was better to haue a Lyon to be a Captaine to a com∣pany of Harts, Catulus leonis.  Leo juvenis.  Leo cordatus. than to haue a company of Lyons and a Hart to be their Captaine: The Lyon is first [Gur] Ca∣tulus Leonis, then he is [Cephir] cum incipit praedari, when he beginneth to catch the prey, and then he is [Labhi] when he groweth old. First,When Iudah was the Lyons whelpe, the Ly∣on, and the fierce Lyon. Iudah was the Lyons whelpe in Ioshuah's time, Iosh. 1. when they went out first to Conquer the Land; then he was Cephir in Da∣vids time; and thirdly, he was [Labhi] Cordatus Leo in Salomons time. And in placing of these Tribes, ye shall obserue that alwayes with the feebler Tribes there is a warre-like and a couragious Tribe placed, as with Issachar and Za∣bulon
two feeble Tribes,A warrelike Tribe pla∣ced with the more fee∣ble. Iudah is placed; Issachar was dull like the Asse, and loved to coutch betweene two bur∣dens, Gen. 49.14. So Iudg. 15.16. Why abodest thou a∣mongst the sheep-folds, Sibilare. to heare the bleating of the flookes (or delighting to whistle by the flockes) having no minde to helpe thy brethren in the warres. Zabulon had no skill in the warres, he dwelt by the Sea-side, and gaue himselfe onely to shipping, therefore Iudah was joyned to helpe these two weake Tribes; so in that vision, Esa. 21.7. The Asse and the Camell are joyned together; the Camell signifying the Medes, the more generous people, and the Asse the Persians, the more dull people. In the second companie was Ruben, Simeon, and Gad; Ruben unstable as water, Gen. 49.4. So Simeon a weake Tribe divided in Iacob and scattered in Israel, Gen. 49.7. now to helpe these they had the warre-like Tribe of Gad joyned with them, Elegans paranomasia. Gen. 49.19. Gad jedud jeguden∣nu vehu jagud gnakabh, Gad a troupe shall overcome him, but he shall overcome at the last: the men of Gad, were mightie men of warre, and had faces like Lyons, 1 Chron. 12.8. In the third companie were Ephraim, Manasse, and Benjamin, and Ephraim the most warrelike of the three, Ephraim had skill to handle the Bow, Psal. 78.9. but Ben∣jamin was [Ittor jad] he could sling with both the hands. Ambidexter. 1 Chron. 12.2. In the fourth companie were Dan, Asser, and Neph∣thali; and of these three, Dan was the most valiant: Zabulon and Nephthali were a people that jeoparded their liues unto the death, Iudg. 5.18. but Dan was their Cap∣taine, he came in to saue the taile of the hoast, and he was called the gathering hoast; and the Lord alludeth to this forme, Esa. 51.11. I will goe before you and gather you in: they left none of the weake behinde them, Num. 12.15. and Miriam was shut out of the Campe seven
dayes for Leprosie, and the people journeyed not, till Miriam was brought in againe: David alludeth to this, Psal. 27.10. Though my father and my mother should for∣sake me, yet thou wilt gather me up: Amalek cut off the taile of the Host, Deut. 25.17. these are called the hindmost of the Host, Iosh. 10.19. Every one of these quarters had their Captaine,Every one of the Quar∣ters had their Captaine and he was the wisest and most couragious, for strength and counsell are for the warres, Prov. 10.5. 2 Sam. 23.8. the Tachmonite, for his wisedome is [Ioshebeang] he sat in the Councell, and for his valour and courage he is called Hadino the Eznite, that is, who delighted to lift up the speare; young and rash youths are not fit to be Cap∣taines, such as was Alexander the Great,Quando animali additur genitivus famininus plu¦ralis, tunc significatur a∣nimal illud tenerumesse, Gen. 38.7. who ran vio∣lently rather thorow the world, than by skill or wise∣dome, therefore Dan. 8.21. he is called Hircus capra∣rum, that is, a young Goat. There were foure memorable things to be observed in this Campe; first, their order; secondly, their clean∣linesse, thirdly, Salus castrametantium; and lastly, how the Lord provided meat and cloath for them. First, the order that was in this Campe;The order of this Campe. this was A∣cies benè ordinata, and God who is the God of order and not of confusion set them in this order. Balaam saw this when he said, Num. 24.5. How goodly are thy Tents, O Iacob, and thy Tabernacles O Israel. As the vallies are they spread forth, as Gardens by the River side, as the trees of Lign-aloes, which the Lord hath planted, and as Cedar trees beside the waters. Secondly, Mundities, the cleanenesse and neatnesse of this Campe, for the Lord commanded them when they were to ease nature to goe without the Campe, and to take a padle with them, and dig in the ground to cover their excrements. Deut. 23.12.
Thirdly, Salus castrametantium, there was none feeble in their Tribes, Psal. 105.37. and pes tuus non fuit fermen∣tatus, thy foote did not swell these fortie yeares, Deut. 8.4. The Lord provided meat and cloths for this Campe.Fourthly, the Lord provided well for this Campe, both meat and cloths; meat, He rained downe Manna from the heavens, and fed them with the bread of Angels, and for their clothes they waxed not old, Deut. 8.4. And it is most probable that their cloaths did grow with them as they grew, muinve∣terârunt. & their shoes waxed not old upon their feete, Deut. 29.5. Their shoes did grow with their feet, and it seemeth that the childrens clothes were made of the clothes of them who died. The foure Captaines pitched their Tents at the foure corners of the Campe, Iudah pitched in the Northeast corner; Ruben in the Southeast; Ephraim on the South∣west; and Dan on the Northwest corner. Num. 2.2. E∣very man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own stan∣dard, with the Ensigne of their fathers house, farre off about the Tabernacle of the Congregation shall they pitch.

When they arose to march they spread their Colours, and they said, Vexillis utamur in nomi∣ne Dei nostri. Vexillabimus in nomine Dei nostri, in the name of our God we will set up our Banners, Psal. 20.5. They had their Colours, their Ensignes, and their Motto's. Their Colours were answerable to the stones in Aarons brestplate.First, their Colours; their Colours were according to the Colours of the stones in the breastplate of Aaron: Iudah gaue a greene Colour like the Smarag: Ruben a red Colour like the Sardius; Ephraim a golden Colour like the Chrysolite; Dan gaue partie coloured of white and red like the Iasper. In their Ensignes they had the Emblems of Beasts.Their Ensignes were; first, Iudah gaue a Lyon; Ru∣ben the head of a man, because he was the first borne, and the head of the familie; Ephraim gaue the head of an Oxe, because he was the sonne of Ioseph, who was cal∣led Bos Dei, Deut. 33.17. His glory is like the firstling of his Bullocke; and Dan gaue an Eagle in his Colours, be∣cause the Eagle is an enemy to Serpents, the Serpent should not be put in his Colours but the Eagle, an ene∣my to the Serpent; Dan shall judge his people, Gen. 49.16. Dan is a Lyons whelpe, he shall leape from Bashan. Here he is commended both for his wisedome and his strength, the Serpent doth not expresse these two well, but the Eagle doth expresse them very fitly. Their Motto's in their Ensignes were out of the Testament of Iacb, or of the song of Moses.Thirdly, their Motto, Iuda's Motto was this; Iuda is a Lyons whelpe, Gen. 49.8. Ruben had this, Vnstable like water, Gen. 49.4. Ephraims Motto was, his glorie is like the firstling of his Bullocke, Deut. 33.16. Dan had this Motto, he shall be a Serpent by the way, an Adder in the path, and so every one of the Tribes had their Mot∣to. The Lord was their Generall.The Lord as their Generall dwelt in the midst of their Campe, and his Ensignes were the Cloud and the pillar of fire; the Cloud to direct them by day, and the pillar by night, then he was the guide of their youth, Iere. 3.4.
The motto which they gaue him was this, Mi camocha baelohim Iehova, quis sicut tu Iehova inter Deos; and hence they made the name of the Macchabees, Mem, Caph, Beth, Iod: and they were called Machei at the first, and after∣ward Macchabaei: and like unto this was that abbrevia∣tion, Agla, attagnebher legnolam adonai, Tufortis in aeter∣num Domine. When they marched,Their marching was different from their pit∣ching about the Taber∣nacle. they kept not the same order as when they pitched about the Tabernacle, for when they marched, Iuda, Issachar, and Zabulon went before; and the Gersonites and the Merarites next them set for∣ward, bearing the Tabernacle, Num. 10.17. In the se∣cond place came Ruben, Simeon, and Gad, who lay upon the South; and next them came the Cohathites with the Arke, Num. 10.21. After them Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasse; and David alludeth to this, Psal. 80.2. Be∣fore Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh, stirre up thy strength, and come and saue us; he saith, before Ephraim, for when they carried the Arke Ephraim came behinde the Arke, and the Arke was before him, and when they rested, Ephraim was upon the West side of the Arke, which Num. 2.18. is called [jammah] the Sea-ward, be∣cause the Sea lay towards the West, so that the Arke both when they pitched and when they marched was ever before Benjamin, Ephraim, & Manasseh. In the last place came Dan, Asser, and Nephthali; Dan was in the Reareward of all their Camps throughout their Hosts, Num. 10.25. When they marched Ascendebant Chamusshim,The manner of their Marching.  Exod. 13.18. Aquila & Symmachus, , qui quintam costam habebant cinctam, because they carried their sword at the fift rib, but Theodosion translateth it , they went fiue in rankes, when they marched they were said to be Accincti, Gen. 49.19. Num. 32.17. 1 King. 10.11. And Salomon alludeth to this Prov. 30.
31. speaking of the horse girt in his loines, a warlike beast, fit for the battell, and contrary to this is discinctus when they lay aside their armour. In their marching they made a Proclamation for foure sorts of peo∣ple.Thirdly, they made a Proclamation in the Campe, that he who had built a new house, and had not dedica∣ted it, should goe backe: Secondly, if he had planted a Vineyard, and had not made it common, he should goe backe: thirdly, if he had betrothed a wife, and had not lien with her, he should goe backe: and fourthly, they cryed that all those who were fearfull and faint hearted should returne. What new house was meant in this Procla∣mation.He who built a new house, and had not dedicated it, he should goe backe, which they expounded thus, if he had built a new house, either for his dwelling, or for his Cattell, or his Corne, then he was to goe backe to it, but if he had built a new house for pleasure, and let it and taken hyre for it, then he was not to goe backe. Secondly, if he had planted a Vineyard and had not made it common, then he was to goe backe; where there is an Allusion to that forme set downe in the Law, that the first three years after that a man had planted a Vine∣yard, he might not eat of the fruits thereof, then the fourth yeare they were the Lords, and in the fift yeare they were made common, and then turned to the plan∣ters owne use, and it was all one whether he planted the Vineyard, bought the Vineyard, or had gotten it by inheritance or by gift. Thirdly, if he had betrothed a wife, and had not lien with her, whether shee had beene a maide or a widow, he was to returne home: and this Immunitie from the warres lasted for a whole yeare to those who were new married; but they say, if the high Priest had married a widow he was not exempted, so if an inferiour Priest had married a repudiate woman, or a common Israelite if he had married a bastard, then he was not exempted.
Fourthly, all those who were fearfull and faint-hear∣ted, Qui mollis est corde, Hebraicè, he should returne, lest he make his brethrens heart faint also, Deut. 20. So all those who were guiltie of any crime were sent away,All that were knowne for notorious sinners, were discharged from the warres. for sinne alwayes makes a trembling and a faint heart, but the misery is now that the most lewd take them∣selues to this calling, Psal. 68.30. Rebuke the company of the spearemen, Hebraicè, rebuke the beasts of the reedes; the Lord accounteth those profane Souldiers for all their speares but like beasts amongst the reeds, there are few like unto the Centurion, or Cornelius, who haue good Souldiers. Gideon made a Proclamation, Iudg. 6.Gideons Proclamation. Whosoever is fearefull, let him returne, and so there remained but ten thousand; and he tryed his Souldiers againe, and all that bowed downe to drinke he sent them away, & he tooke with him onely those who lapped like dogges, which were but three hundred. Whether made he choise of these as the most coward∣ly, or the most couragious? It is commonly holden that they were the most cou∣ragious who lapped like dogges,  and lay not downe to glut themselues; but if we will looke to the Lords in∣tention here, we shall see that the most feeble were kept here, and not the most couragious, for the Lord would not haue Israel to bragge here, and to say, Mine owne hand hath saved me, Iudg. 7.2. The Lord would onely haue the whole prayse of the Victory. Now whether made it more for the praise of God, when he overcame with a few cowards, than if he had overcome with a number of valiant Souldiers: were not they most co∣wardly, who durst not lie downe to take leasure to drinke? But ran and lapped as the dogs doe about Ni∣lus; the Lord made choise of the most fearefull and co∣wardly for his glorie; But Marcus Crassus amongst the
Romans, caused to let bloud of the cowards, & he giues this to be the reason, that that bloud which they would not shed in defence of their Countrey, should now be shed to their disgrace and shame. There are two sorts of warres.They had two sorts of warres; the first were bella spontanea, and the second was bella praecepti, new marri∣ed men and those who planted a vineyard were exemp∣ted from the first warre, but not from the second warre which was against the Canaanits, the Bridegroome was not exempted from this neither. Fourthly, before they joyned battle with the enemy to destroy them or to sacke their Citie, they offered conditions of peace to the enemies that were not to be destroyed, if they sought peace of them; we haue one example, in the Cherethites, that were Davids guard; they were called Curetae by Virgil, Curetum allabimur oras: So they were called Cretenses, these came of the Phenicians or Philistins; Creta was a Colonie belonging to them, see Act. 27.12. Phenice which is a haven of Creet. Deut. 20.10. And the conditions were three espe∣cially. First, that they should receiue the seven precepts of Noah: Secondly, that they should be tributaries to them; And thirdly, that they should bee servants to them. The Moabites and Ammonites were still excepted Deut. 3.3. but Deut. 2.9. distresse not the Moabites nei∣ther contend with them in battle, how then shall wee re∣concile these two places, when hee bids them not to seeke the peace of the Ammonite. The reconciliation is this, thou shalt not seeke the peace of the Moabite or Ammonite, but if they seeke it of thee, then thou shalt not distresse them, nor contend with them in battell. Let him flie that will fle.If they would not receiue the peace offered, then they cryed, dedat se qui vult, fugiat qui vult, pugnet qui vult.
Before they joyned battell they comforted the Soul∣diers after this manner, he that will haue peace, let him haue peace.  He that will make warre let him make warre. Lam. 5.9 in anima nostra ferimus panem, id est, in periculo animae. so Psal. 119. anima mea in manu mea. trust in him who is the Saviour of Israel in affliction, Ier. 14.8. this day thou fightest, pro confessione vnitatis divinae, quòd deus unus est, that thy God is one, therefore, thou mayest carrie thy life i thy hand securely, Iob. 13.4. and thinke neither upon thy wife nor thy children, but put the care of them out of thy heart. And the Apostle alludeth to this, 2 Tim. 2.4. that he who goeth to the warres, entangleth not himselfe with the cares of this world. And they exhorted them to cast the care of their houses, wiues, children, and fami∣lie upon the Lord, who will provide for them: 1 Sam. 25.28.29. The Lord will provide a sure house for my Lord the King, because he fights the battles of the Lord, and his soule shall be bound up in the bundle of life. When they marched neerer their enemie,What they did when they were at the shocke of the battell. they rai∣sed the dust with their feete which was the neerest signe of warre: and Christ alludeth to this forme Mat. 10. When you come into a house offer your peace, and if they re∣fuse it, shake off the dust of your feete, and let your peace re∣turne to your selfe: when the enemies were overcome, they fell downe at the Conquerours feete, and seemed to licke the dust under his feete, Psal. 18. And so they used to cast a fire-brand within the e∣nemies land, and the Prophet Obadiah alludeth to this, vers. 18. there shall not one be left aliue in the house of E∣sau, the Seventie translate it , that shall carrie a fire-brand. Such were those faeciales amongst the Ro∣manes, who threw a speare into the enemies land in de∣fiance of the enemie. After the victory they divided the spoile, and then they sung , or carmen triumphale. It was their manner after the victory to sing a song of praise, as Moses and Miriam did, Exod. 15.When the song of try∣umph was sung. so Barak and Deborah, Iudg. 5. so David after he had conquered all
his enemies sang the eighteenth Psalme, so Revelation 19. when all the enemies of the Church shall bee sub∣dued, they shall sing a song of praise to the Lambe who sit∣teth upon the throne. The women did sing the song of victorie. The women especially did sing this song, and there∣fore Psal. 68.11. it is said, great were the company, [ham∣mebhassheroth,] of those that published it, in the faemi∣nine gender, of the women that published it. In this song of victory the King is commended, that he ascended on high, and led captivitie captiue, and received gifts or ransomes from the captiues, Vers. 18. And the A∣postle applieth this to Christs victory over all his ene∣mies, he ascended on high, and gaue gifts to men, Ephe. 4.8. And in this song of victory, they sung this Carmen ama∣baeum, a song by intercourse, I will bring againe from Ba∣san, I will bring my people againe from the depths of the Sea, Vers. 22. They remembered these two deliveran∣ces in all their songs of thankesgiving for deliverance: first, how the Lord delivered them out of the red Sea; and secondly, that deliverance from Og King of Bashan when he came against them. The subject of Debo∣rahs song.That song of Deborah, Iudg. 5. first, containeth a praise to God, who gaue the victory. Secondly, it maketh mention of the instruments which he used in this victo∣ry, as the starres. Thirdly, it condemneth those who would not come, as Merosh: and fourthly, it commen∣deth those who came willingly. And lastly, a prayer against the enemies of the Church, Vers. 28.
CHAPTER XLIIII. Of their Burials. GEN. 49.29 And he charged them and said unto them, I am to be gathered to my people, burie me with my Fathers. IN their burials, first,The circumstances that were used in Buriall. we are to consider the place where they buried them; secondly, the ceremonies which they used at their Burials; thirdly, the forme of their Tombes; fourthly, the great charges that they were at in their burials; and lastly, how they comforted the living after the dead were buried. First, the place where they buried them,The place where they used to bury. it was com∣monly without the Citie; In Ierusalem they were buri∣ed without the Citie neare the brooke Kedron, Mat. 27.53. And many arose, and came out of the graues, and went into the holy Citie, and appeared there: so the widowes sonne of Naim was buried without the Citie, Luk. 7.12. so the possessed men walked amongst the graues in so∣litarie places, Mark. 4.37. And Christ was buried in a Garden without the Citie. They buried all of one familie together, 1 Sam. 3.1.With whom they were buried. they buried the bones of Saul and Ionathan in the buriall of their Fathers: so Gen. 33.2. therefore they were said to be gathered to their fathers; and David alludeth to this forme when he saith, gather me not with the wicked. Psal. 30. For all the bodies of the faithfull were laid toge∣ther, so are their soules gathered together, & this is cal∣led, the bundle of life, 1 Sam. 25. The Greeks called those who were not buried with their Fathers, , out∣buried.
They buried the man and the wife together, as Abra∣ham and Sara in the field of Ephron,The faithfull were bu∣ried together. Gen 25. so Iacob and Leah, Isaac and Rebecca, so Tobias and his wife were bu∣ried together, Tob. 4.4. And hereby they signified the constancie and loue which should be betwixt the man and the wife, and that they died in the same faith, there∣fore the Orthodoxe Church when they died they would not be buried besides Heretickes; Sophronius said, Noli me tangere haeretice neque vivum neque mor∣tuum. The strangers conver∣ted, desired to be buri∣ed with the faithfull.They buried strangers in a part by themselues, Act. 1.18. this place they called it Kebher galaja, sepulchrum exterorum: when the strangers were converted to the faith, they desired to be buried with the faithfull; as Ruth said to Naomi, where thou diest there will I die and be buried, Ruth 1.17. The Ceremonies in buriall.Secondly, they used many Ceremonies in their bu∣riall, first, they fasted, 1 Sam. 31.13. 2 Sam. 1.12. and they mourned and wept and fasted while even; so 2 Sam. 3.34. David fasted for Abner till the Sunne was set. Secondly, they wept, as for Aaron thirtie dayes, Num. 20.29. so for Moses, Deut. 34.8. so for Saul and Iona∣than, 2 Sam 1.12. so for Iosia did all Israel mourne, 2 Chron. 35.24. Families lamented, the men by themselues and the women by themselues, Zach. 12.12. so Luk. 23. and the women followed after weeping. They mourned and la∣mented chiefly for their Kings, Iere. 34.5. and they will lament thee, saying ah Lord; they lamented for their King as the widow doth for her husband, for the King is the husband of the Common-wealth, and when shee wan∣teth him she is a widow, Lament. 1. How these words are to be understood, he taught them the use of the Bow.Such was the lamentation which David made for Saul and Ionathan, 2 Sam. 1.18. it is called there the la∣mentation of the Bow, he commanded to teach the chil∣dren of Israel the Bow, it is commonly translated, he
taught them the use of the bow, or to shoot with the bow, but this is impertinently cast in, in the midst of Davids lamentations, that he taught them the use of the bow, but it should be this way translated, he taught them this lamentation, intituled the Bow, for it was the man∣ner in old times to giue sundry titles to these lamentati∣ons, as, Fistula, Scutum, Ovum, Ala, Securis; so Psal. 45.Eustatius lib. 4. to the chiefe Musitian upon Shonannim, as yee would say upon the lillies, the song of the marriage is intituled the lillie. Christ is, the lillie of the valleyes, and his Church is as the lillie among thornes, therefore this marriage-Psalme is intituled the lillie; so the title of this lamenta∣tion was Arcus, the Seventie translated it well David e∣didit threnum hunc, & it is subjoyned that he made this lamentation, that he might teach it the children of Isra∣el; and Iosephus addeth, that the Iewes did diligently learne these Lamentations even unto his time, the rest of this Lamentation is set downe in the Booke of the just, vers. 18. and to translate it he taught them to shoot with the bow, were not pertinent, for they had skill in the use of the bow alreadie, 1 Par. 12. and it was not for vn∣skilfulnesse in the use of the Bow that the Philistims o∣vercame them. When Iosias was killed in the battaile, Ieremie made his Lamentations or  for him.Alexander ab Alexandre lib. 3. Genialium. When they buried their dead they had Minstrels, Mat. 9.23. who sang the praises of the dead, this the Greekes called , and when the corps were to be carried out, they cryed Conclamatum est; and they hyred Praeficas, mour∣ning women. Iere. 9.17. and when these women did sing the dolefull song, she that was the chiefe mourner sung over carmen  at every rest; the like wee see in Psal. 136. for his mercie endureth for ever: so Iere. 9.18. the chiefe mourner repeated these words in the Lamen∣tation, that our eyes may run downe with teares, and our eye∣lids gush out with waters: so Ezek. 26.7. how art thou de∣stroyed
that wast inhabited of Sea-faring men. They lamented not for their wicked Kings when they died; Herod fearing that he should not haue this honour done to him when he died, commanded when he was a∣bout to giue up the Ghost, that a number of his wisest Counsellours should be gathered together,Iosephus: The stratageme that Herod used that men might lament for his death. and that his Guard should inviron him about, and put them all to the sword, that there might be a lamentatiō at his death, which they were purposed to haue done, unlesse that Salome the sister of Herod had prevented it, and disco∣vered to them the plot, and then they kept a feast of joy in remembrance of that deliverance, as they did at Ha∣mans death. Thirdly, they used to wash the bodies of the dead, this was called , and so they washed the body of Dorcas and laid it in an upper chamber, . there was also , Ecclus 31.25 that is, a washing of themselues for touching of the dead; and the third was , baptized for the dead, that is, counted as dead men, 1 Cor. 15.29. for when they were baptized they went downe into the water, and were baptized all over the body. They embalmed the dead.They embalmed the bodies  &  differ.  is to prepare all those things which serue for the embalming of the body, and this was called a bury∣ing among the Iewes, they used much this emblming of the bodies before they buried them, but now because the doctrine of the Resurrection is so cleare, this cere∣mony of embalming should not be used. They burned sweet O∣dours for them.When they embalmed the bodies of their Kings, they burnt sweet odours for them, as for Asa and for Zedekiah, Iere. 34.5. Thou shalt die in peace, and with the burnings of thy fathers the former Kings, so shall they burne Odours for thee; Although Zedekiahs eyes were pulled out of his head, and carried captiue to Babylon: yet he
is said to die in peace, because he had all these solemni∣ties performed to him in his funerals. Those of Iabesh Gilead tooke the bodies of Saul & his sonnes and burnt them, and buried their bones under a tree, 1 Sam. 31.13. To burne their bodies here is not meant, that they burnt them to ashes, and then buried their bones, but they burnt odours upon their bodies untill they were buried; for these speeches are all one, comburent te,How these phrases are to be understood, Com∣burent te & comburent tibi. as the Latines say, comburent tibi, as the Hebrewes say, , as the Greekes say, et aromatizare, as the E∣vangelists say, for every one of these phrases signifie the great pompe which was used at their burials. And where it is said, they buried their bones, it is to be under∣stood by the figure Synecdoche, their bodies, 2 Sam. 1. Are we not all of his bone: so Gen. 2. She is flesh of my flesh, and bone of my bone, and this last part here is but an ex∣planation of the first. Iechonias wanted this honorable buriall, and therefore is said, to be buried with the buriall of an Asse, Iere. 22. which was, insepulta sepultura. The heathen burnt the bodies to ashes before they buried them, because that they thought,The Heathen burned them to ashes. that the fire purged the bodie, but the greatest abuse of all in bur∣ning of the dead, was when the King of Moab tooke the King of Ammons sonne, and burnt him to Lyme, and then, (as the Iewes say) with that incrustârunt muros, they plaisterd their wals. By this we may understand why the Scripture brin∣geth in Og the King of Bashans bed, saying, is it not in Rabbath of Ammon unto this day? Deut. 3.11. this was not his sleeping bed, but his funerall bed, for when they were dead, they laid them upon a rich bed, and burnt odours over them, untill their friends carried them to the graue, and then they came home and burnt the bed and things belonging unto it. Now the reason why this bed of Og burnt not, was because it was made of yron,
so say Rabbi Isaac Abrabaneel, and Arrias Montanus. Of the feasts at their Burials.They had funerall feasts called , therefore Ezek. 24.17. when his wife died he was forbidden to eat of that bread, eat not the bread of men; Enoshim, that is, the bread of mourning men; these feasts they called afterwards, feralia & silicernia, and they used to set the meat upon the graues of the dead, Iob. 4.17. poure out thy bread upon the buriall of the just: so Eccles. 30.18 as mes∣ses of meat set upon the graue. The third thing to be considered in their burials, is the forme of their Tombes, the Kings were buried in stately Tombes together in the Citie of David, and those Kings who were not buried there, were thought to be basely buried, if they were not buried in the buri∣all of David, or in the buriall of the Kings in Mount Sion. Their burials were hewed out of a rocke.The nobler sort some of them had Caues hewed out of a rocke, which had severall burials within them, and Christ was buried in such a buriall, Esa. 53.9. He made his graue with the wicked, Excelsa eius. and with the rich, [Bamathau] in excelsis, that is, although he was crucified with the wic∣ked, yet he was buried in the Tombe of Ioseph, not in a base buriall but an honourable buriall, which was Io∣sephs owne buriall, who was an honorable man. The Prophets were al∣so buried in stately bu∣rials.The Prophets were usually buried in stately Tombes, Iere. 26.23. And Iehojakim sent for Vrias the Prophet out of Egypt, and caused to slay him with the sword, and cast his dead bodie in the graues of the common people: the Prophets were not usually buried in the burials of the common people; so Mat. 23.29. Woe be to you, because yee build the Tombes of the Prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous. For the common people they were but laid in the ground, without any Tombe, Luk. 11.4. Yee are like graues which appeare not, and the men that walke over them are not aware of them.
They had some markes of distinction to discerne the Tombes of the better sort; example we haue of this in Ioshua 24.30. it is said there, that they buried him in Tim∣nath-herah, but Iudg. 2.9. they buried him in Timnath-heres; Heres is called the Citie of the Sunne, Sol. and they changed the name of the Towne, because Ioshua was bu∣ried there, whose sepulchre had the picture of the Sun drawne upon it, as the Iewes write, and the sepulchre of Elisha was knowne by it selfe in the fields, 2 King. 13.21. Fourthly, they were at great charges in burying of their dead, it was so great that many times their friends refused to bury them, therefore Gamaliel who was a man of power and credit amongst them, restrained this. Nicodemus sent for an hūdreth pound weight of Myrrhe and Aloes, to embalme Christ, Ioh. 19.39. and Christ alloweth the fact of Marie, Mat. 26.10. when she pou∣red the boxe of precious oyntment upon his head, Why trouble ye the woman, for she hath wrought a good worke up∣on me: and Gamaliel ordained that none should be wrap∣ped in silke, but all in linnen, and no gold put upon them.Cicero lib. 2. de ll. So amongst the Romans they were glad to dimi∣nish these charges, tria si velit recinia & vincula purpu∣rea, & decem tibicines plus ne adhibeto. Lastly,They comforted the living after the dead were buried. after the buriall was ended they used to com∣fort the living after this manner; first, sit consolatio tua in Caelis; secondly, quis audet deo dicere, quid fecisti? thirdly, they repeated these words of Esay, chap. 25.8. he will swallow up death in victorie, and wipe away all teares from their faces; and Psal. 72.16 they shall flourish and spring againe as the grasse on the earth: they bleeved the resurrection of the bodie, Domus viventium. therefore they called the Church-yard [Beth chaijm,] domus viventium, and as our soules lodge but a while in the bodie as in a taber∣nacle, 2 Cor. 5.1. so our bodies lodge but a while in he
graue as in a tabernacle,. Act. 2.26. , my flesh resteth in hope as in a tabernacle, and then they cryed, Zacor ki gnapher anachun, Dominus penset jacturam tuam. remember that we are but dust, and they conclude with this of Iob 1. the Lord hath gi∣ven & the Lord hath taken, blessed be the name of the Lord. When their little children died, they used not many speeches of consolation, but onely said, the Lord recom∣pence thy losse; Iob hath a notable saying, I came naked out of my mothers wombe, and I shall goe naked thither a∣gaine; How shall I goe thither againe? it is not taken for the same place, but for the same condition; hence it is that the inferior parts of the earth are called both the mothers wombe and the graue, Psal. 139.15. I was curiously wrought in the lower parts of the earth; that is, in my mothers wombe, Ephes. 4.9. Christ is said to des∣cend into the lower parts of the earth, that is, into his mothers wombe, and see the affinitie betwixt the belly and the graue, Christ joyneth them together, Mat. 12. As Ionas was three dayes and three nights in the belly of the Whale, so shall the sonne of man be in the heart of the earth: and Salomon, Prov. 30. joyneth them together, there are three things that are not satisfied, the graue, and the barren wombe, &c. The conclusion of this is, let us remember, Iob 30.23. that the graue is, domus constitutionis omni vivo, that is, the house in which we are all appointed to meet, and it is domus saeculi, the house of our age in which we dwell a long time, therefore we should often thinke of it, and not put the evill day farre from us, and make a covenant with death.
Of the IEVVES Oeconomicks. Of the time of their Repast. THey had but two times of their Repast, Dinner and Supper, they had no break∣fast; Peter had eaten nothing at the sixt houre, Act. 10.10. and Act. 2.15. those are not drunke as yee suppose, seeing it is but the third houre of the day. But it may seeme,  that they used to breake their fast in the morning; for Ioh. 21.4. it is said, that when the morning was come, Iesus stood on the shoare and said, chil∣dren haue yee any meat? The reason of this was,  because they had fished all the night, and being wearie they refreshed themselues in the morning; but we reade not that they used ordi∣narily to breake their fast in the morning. Eccles. 10.16. Woe to thee O land, when thy Princes eate in the morning: they did not eat in the morning, because it was the fit∣test time for judging and deciding Controversies; and therefore the Whores of old were called Nonariae,Persius Satyr. 1. be∣cause they came not out to commit their villany till af∣ter the ninth houre, when men had ended their busi∣nesses; and the Lord biddeth them execute judgement in the morning, Iere. 21.12. The time of Dinner was the time when they refre∣shed themselues first. Ioh. 21.12. Iesus said unto them,
come and dine: so Luk. 11.37. And as he spake a certaine Pharisie besought him to dine with him: and the second re∣freshment was at the time of Supper; this was called ; they spent a longer time at Supper than at Din∣ner,All Banquets called Suppers sometimes. and therefore afterward they put  for , Dinner, and they called all Banquets, Suppers, in what time soever of the day they were, although they were not in the Evening, and  & permutantur, the one is put for the other, as that which Matthew calleth a Dinner, cap. 22.4. Luke calleth a Supper, 14.16. The Greekes fed more sumptuously.The Greekes had , prandium, secondly, they had , a refreshment betwixt Dinner and Supper, which is called Merenda, a beaver or afternoons drinke; and they called this Caenae ; thirdly, they had their Supper, and then they had Banquets after Supper; and this the Greekes called , Latinè comessa∣tio, , to keepe a Banquet with whores; and Paul alludeth to this word, Deus Moabita∣rum. Rom. 13.13. Let us walke honestly as in the day, , not in rioting and drun∣kennesse, not in chambering and wantonnesse. And because the Iewes used to travaile so farre before the heat of the day, therefore they called this space which they travai∣led diaetam terrae, Gen. 35.16. This sheweth their mode∣rate dyet. They were sparing at Dinner, and they fed more free∣ly at Supper; the Lord gaue them bread in the mor∣ning, and but Quailes at night, Exod. 16.12. They measured the houres by their sha∣dow.They went to Supper at the ninth houre, after the E∣vening Sacrifice, and before the setting of the Sunne they ended it; this was called Hesperismus; the ancient Greekes called this , that is, the time when a mans shadow was ten foot in length, for they measu∣red the houres by their shadow, when the shadow was of such a length, then it was such an houre; when their shadow was six foot long, then they used to wash them∣selues,
and when it was ten foote long, then they went to Supper. The meat upon which they fed at Dinner and Supper was called [Sagnadah] their sustentation, Fulcrum. a  Fulcire.  rapere. and [Tereph] victus their foode, which commeth from the roote Ta∣raph, to take by rapine, or hunt for the prey; because of old they hunted for their meat, Gen. 27.3. Take thy wea∣pons, thy Quiver, and thy Bow, and goe out to the field, and take [hunt] me some Venison. Things set before them upon the Table were Esculen∣ta, poculenta, & condimenta, the first for meat,What things were set upon the Table. the second for drinke, and the third for sauce to relish their meat; Meat and drinke the Scriptures oftentimes expresse by bread and water, 2 King. 6.22. set bread and water be∣fore them, that they may eat and drinke: then it is added in the next verse, he prepared great provision for them. Their bread was of Wheat, Barley, Lentils, & Beanes,Of their bread. Wheat was the most excellent bread, Deut. 32.14. I fed thee with fat of the kidnies of Wheate; this bread when it was not fermented, was called the poores bread, Deut. 16 3. because the poore had not leasure to ferment it. The second sort of bread was of Barley,Barley a base bread. which was abaser sort of bread, used onely in time of scarcitie, Revel. 6.6. And for the basenesse of it Gideon is com∣pared to a Barley Cake, Iudg. 7.13. those were called by the Greekes , eaters of Barley; this Barley-bread is a bread which nourisheth little, therefore it was a great blessing of Christ, when he fed fiue thousand with fiue barley loaues, Ioh. 6.9. They had a more baser sort of bread made of Lentils, Millet, and Fitches. Ezek. 4.9. Daniel and his compa∣nions eat of the Lentils, Dan. 1.12.Why Daniel eat Len∣tiles. And the reason see∣meth to be this why they eat Lentils and refused the Kings meat, because they used not these Lentils in their Sacrifices to their Idols. The Romans of old tooke their
name from those, and they were called Lenticuli & Fa∣bij. They used also to eat herbes, Prov. 15.17. Better is a dinner of herbes where loue is, than a stalled Oxe and hatred therewith: and Rom. 14.2. another who is weake eateth herbes: and the reason why they would eat herbes seemeth to be this, because men before the Flood eat herbes onely. Their other meats were called Opsonia, and their cour∣sest sort of meat was Locusts and wilde honey, Mat. 3.4. there were sundry sorts of Locusts, of which, foure sorts were cleane, Levit. 11. the rest they might not eat of them. Of their drinke.Their drinke was water, Sicera a composed strong drinke, and wine mixed, or  not mixed; if they mixed it with water, vinum mixtum  miscuit. then they were said , and when it was mixed with spices, it was called [Mimsach] Libamen, mustum. Their Condimenta, the sauces which made their meats to relish, were Salt and Vineger onely. Ruth 2.14. Dip thy morsell in the Vineger. The spare dyet of Gods people.By this which hath beene said, we may perceiue what was the sober dyet of the people of God in old times, they used but a spare dyet; this was called by the La∣tines, Mensa necessaria, & Seneca hanc mensam produxit ad aquam & panem. Three sorts of dyet.There are three sorts of dyets set downe in the Scrip∣ture; Iohn Baptists dyet, Christs dyet, and the Epicures dyet: Iohn the Baptist came neither eating nor drinking, Mat. 11.18. That is, he eat wilde honey, and the coursest things; Our Lord dranke Wine, but yet very mode∣rately: the Epicures dyet is, Let us eat, let us drinke, for to morrow we shall die, 1 Cor. 15.32. Iohn the Baptists dyet and Christs dyet are not the two extreames, but they are both vertues, the two extreames are the Epicures
dyet, Let us eat, let us drinke; and the dyet of the scru∣pulous man who eateth onely herbes, Rom. 14.2. the Epicure taketh God to be an indulgent father to him, in giving him the creatures to eat of them at his plea∣sure; and the other taketh God to be a niggard, who granteth not the liberall use of the creatures to his chil∣dren. Of the manner how they sat at Table. AT the first in the daies of the Patriarches they sat streight up as we doe now, and afterwards they sat in beds; and some hold that they learned this custome from the Persians, but this custome was more ancient than the Persians, for it was in the dayes of Samuel, 1 Sam. 9.22. And he brought them into the Par∣lor, and made them sit in the chiefest place. Ezek. 23 41. 2 Sam. 4.5. Sometimes they had triclinia, when three sat in a bed, or biclinia, when two sat in a bed, and they had , when they did Luxuriare. Christ and his Disciples when they eat the Sacra∣ment, they sat in beds, therefore when the Church of Corinth received the Sacrament together, we must not thinke that they sat in beds as Christ and his Apostles did, for then they should haue had too many beds, which had beene excessiue, and contrary to the more modest custome of the Greekes. This kinde of sitting was halfe sitting and halfe lea∣ning, which the Evangelist calleth , yet because it was usuall Table-gesture, they call it sitting. Ezek. 23.41. and the Hebrewes call their Chambers Mesubboth, and their sitters Mesubhim.
If three sat in a bed, then the midst was the chiefest place, and he that lay in his bosome erat secundus a pri∣mo, he was in the second place, and he that sat next un∣to him, was in the third place; he that was best belo∣ved leaned in the bosome of the Master of the feast;To leane in the bo∣some a token of loue. from this custome is that speech borrowed, to be in A∣brahams bosome, to signifie that familiaritie and socie∣tie, which the Saints of God shall haue with the Father of the faithfull in the Heaven, and also to signifie the u∣nitie of essence in the Father and the Sonne, he is said to come out of the bosome of the Father, Ioh. 1.18. Of their Feasts. OF their sundry sorts of feasts, of those who were invited to their feasts, of the number of those who sat at their feasts, the end wherefore they made feasts, and more particularly, of their excesse and pompe in their feasting compared with the Greekes. They had feasts at their marriage.First, they had feasts before their marriages, in their marriages, and after their marriages; before their mar∣riage, and these feasts were called Kedushim, sponsalia; and the Greekes called them  and . Secondly, they had a feast at the day of their marriage, Gen. 29.22. And Laban gathered together all the men of the place and made a feast; and Ioh. 2. Christ was present at a marriage feast in Cana of Galile: and Christ allu∣deth to this forme, Luk. 14.8. When thou art bidden to a wedding, that is, to the feast at the wedding; so Rev. 19.9. And so they had a feast after the marriage; and the Greekes called these , and the gifts which were brought to the bride after she was married were called , because the vaile was taken off her face then, and these things which were offered to her after she was unvailed, were called .
Secondly,Feasts at the weaning of their children. the Iewes had feasts at the weaning of their children, and not at the day of their birth, Gen. 21.8. but the Heathen had feasts at the day of their birth, as Pharaoh, Gen. 40.20. and Herod, Mat. 14.16. and this was called . Thirdly, they had feasts at the day of their death,Feasts at their death and buriall. Iere. 16.7. Neither shall men teare themselues for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead, neither shall men giue them the cup of consolation to drinke for their father, or for their mother; thou shalt not also goe into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drinke: the Greekes called these , and  was Epulum se∣pulchrale: & afterwards this feasting degenerated much, for they used to set meat upon the graues of the dead; and Syracides alludeth to these delicates poured upon a mouth shut up, are as messes of meat set upon a graue, Ecclus 30.18. So afterwards in the primitiue Church they had Caenam novendinalem for the soules departed, they feasted the poore for the space of nine dayes, and they prayed, that the soules might haue a refreshment in that time; and this was discharged in the Councell of Car∣thage. So they had a feast when they made a Covenant,Feasts at their Cove∣nants. as Iacob and Laban, Gen. 31.54. so Ioshua and the Gibeonites, Iosh. 9.14. And the Greekes called these feasts , from  libo. The Scythians in their Covenants and feasts did drinke others bloud, these the Greekes called , sanguinipotas, drinkers of bloud. So they made feasts when they departed from others at their farewell, Gen. 31.27., sacrificia ante expeditionem. and these the Greekes cal∣led . So they made feasts at the returning of their friends to welcome them home, as the father of the forlorne sonne killed the fed Calfe when his sonne came home; and these feasts the Greekes called ; so Ioseph
made a feast when his brethren returned to him, Gen. 49.16. Who were invited and who not?Those who were invited to their feasts were called , and they who were not invited were called  adscititij, and they were called , umbrae, et mus∣cae advolantes, and  qui lingua sua se nutriunt; and they were said , a metaphor borrowed from the dogges who fanne with their tailes when men feede them. The number at their feast.The number which they invited were not many; in that feast of Iobs children were his seven sonnes and three daughters; and Christ and his twelue Disciples, and therefore that is false, septem convivium, & novem convitium: the Greekes said, incipere debet a Gratiarum numero, & progredi ad Musarum, that is, they would haue no fewer than three at a feast, and no more than nine. What persons were to be invited.The persons invited should be the poore especially; when thou makest a feast, bid not the rich but the poore, that is, the poore rather than the rich, men should not in∣vite to be invited againe. Luk. 6.12. men should not in∣vite  or , whose God is their bellie. Heliogabalus invited to his feast, eight black, eight blind, eight lame, eight hoarse; he made no choise of his guests, but he made a mocke of it. The end of their feasts.The end wherefore they made feasts, was the glorie of God, 1 Cor. 10.31. Whether therefore yee eat or drinke, or whatsoever yee doe doe all to the glorie of God: Asshuerus feast was onely to shew his magnificence and pride, but Esthers feast was for the glorie of God, and for the safetie of the Church. Breaking of bread a to∣ken of loue.The second end of their feasts, was to expresse their heartie loue and friendship, for to eat and drinke toge∣ther, was the greatest token of loue and friendship, 2 Sam. 12.3. He had an Ewe-lambe &c. which did eat of
his owne meat, and dranke of his owne cup, & lay in his owne bosome: so Psal. 41.9. Yea mine owne familiar friend in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread: and so the com∣munion in the life to come is expressed by eating of bread, Luk. 14.15. Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the Kingdome of God: and Obadiah 7. these three are joyned together, viri faederis, pacis, & panis, that is, that makes a Covenant together, that hath peace, and that eat to∣gether; but Absolon killed Amnon at the feast; so Geda∣liah was killed by Ismael at the feast, Iere. 40. and Iohn the Baptist by Herod, Mat. 14. Of the place where the Romans used to make their Feast. THe place where the Romans sat at their meat was called Caenaculum, and where they lay it was cal∣led Cubiculum, and by the Greekes Triclinium. The ancients at the first sat in the Kirchin,The place where they feasted. or a place neere to the Kitchin, where they did dine or suppe, and this was called Atrium, from the blacknes of the smoke, and the Courts afterward kept this name, & they were called Atria, then they changed from this place and re∣moved to an upper chamber, and there they used to dine and suppe, the Iewes following the Roman custome who had subdued them, sat also in an upper chamber; Christ and his Disciples eat the Passeover in an upper chamber, according to the custome of the Romans; these Chambers were called Conclavia, closets, or secret places; and Christ saith, when thou prayest enter into thy Closet, Mat. 6.6. The beds which they had were called Discubitorij Lecti, or Toralia, and they were covered with herbes
& straw before they found out Quilts or sowed Cove∣rings called stragula,How the beds on which they eat were called. and the Greekes called them  & , and they differed from the slee∣ping beds called , a bed wherein one slept, and sometimes they had three and sometimes foure of those beds in a Chamber. The forme of their beds.For those three beds, the Ancients made one long bed called , after the forme of the Greeke Letter , that it might almost compasse about the round Table, which they called Semirotundum suggestum, an halfe round Table, like the Greeke , and it was thus pain∣ted Ϲ Martial. Accipe lunata scriptum testudine sigma. Octo capit, veniat, quisquis amicus erit. And the round Table joyned with it, was called Anti∣sigma, because it made a semicircle upon the other part, it was semirotundus suggestus, and joyning with the bed, it made the full circle; this great bed sometimes contai∣ned seven; Martial: De Stibadio, Lib. 14.Septem sigma capit, sex sumus, adde lupum. Christ and his Disciples sat not in Stabidio, but in seve∣rall beds, in biclinijs, or triclinijs. He who made those beds was called Lectisterniator, & he who kept the chamber cleane after the beds were made,The decking of their beds and chambers. was called Mediastinus, the charge of those was to hang the Chamber with Tapestry and Curtaines; and Christ meaneth of such a Chamber when he saith, he will shew you a large upper roome furnished and prepared, there make readie for us, Mark. 14.15. The Tables which they had, either stood upon one foot, and they were called , or upon two, and they were called bipedes, or upon three, and they were called tripodes.
At the first, their Tables were not covered with linnen,How their Tables were covered. but after Supper they tooke a Brush or Sponge & swept the Table. Martial: Haec tibi sorte datur tergendis spongla mensis. Afterwards they used to cover their Tables Gausapo villoso, with a cloath made of rough Cotton, and after∣ward with linnen, and they had Napkins with which they wiped their hands called . They had mensam urnariam a Table upon which their vessels stood; by Varro called Cylibantum ,Of their Tables. because it kept the Cups, and it was called Gartibulum or Gertibulum, a gerendis vasibus; this mensa urnaria stood but in the Kitchin, but the other stood in triclinijs, in their upper chambers. When the Chamber and the Table were thus pre∣pared, the guests were washed in baths,Of their washing be∣fore meat. and then they were anointed; the servants who anointed them were called Vnctores or , & the place where they were anointed was called , they washed their feete, and the vessell in which they washed their feete was cal∣led Pelluvium, & that in which they washed their hands was called Malluvium; when they washed before the dinner, it was called , and after dinner . They were curious in anointing of their bodies;Of their anointing. for every part of the bodie they had a severall ointment; they anointed the feete with Egyptian ointment, the cheekes and the breast with the Phaenician, but the armes with the Sisymbrian, the necke and the cheekes with the ointment made of the herbe Serpillum. Chiefly they anointed their head and their feete with Nardus, and this by Marke, cap. 14.3. is called , upright Nard, and the box in which it was kept, was called Alabastris, a box cut out of a precious stone in Egypt.
When they sat at these costly Tables, they had great banquets and feasts; this was called Cana dubia, caena opipara, caena ebria, by Plautus, caena triumphalis, by Pli∣nius, caena dapsilis; Opposit to these was caena pura, caena sine sanguine, & caena terrestris, in which they eat onely herbes. Of their manner of drinking. THey measured their drinke by a cup called Cya∣thus, and some were said potare sextantes, qua∣drantes, trientes; He that dranke Sextans was of a weake bodie; he that dranke Deuux was a drunkard, he that dranke triens was one of the middle sort; they used to drinke harmonicè, there were three sorts of mix∣tures like three harmonies in musicke, the first was , three parts of water and two of wine; secondly, , when they mixed three of water and one of wine; thirdly, , when one part of wine, and two of water were mixed. They dranke sometimes nine cups for the nine Muses, and three for the three fatall sisters. Ausonius, Ter bibe, vel toties ternos, sic mystica lex est. Vel tria potandi, vel ter tria multiplicandi. And sometimes they dranke as many cups as there were letters in their friends name, to whom they dranke. Martial. Nevia sex Cyathis, septem Iustina bibatur. And sometimes amongst the Romans, they dranke as many cups as they wished years to him for whom they dranke, and they used to coole their wine in snow wa¦ter; so they had a vessell in quo solebant aquam colare, in which they used to straine the water.
Martial. Attenuare nives nôrunt, & Lintea nostra, Frigidior caelo non salit unda tua. They had a Master of the feast, called Pater discubitus, and by Tacitus, Rex convivij, and the Greekes called him  & , who assigned to every man his place where he should sit, and , who tasted the wine before others dranke. When they were at Supper, they had all sort of mu∣sicke and perfumes, and when they departed the Master of the feast gaue them , gifts; so our Lord in his great and last feast, had his perfumes, his prayers sweet∣ning the prayers of the Saints, they had their hymne, and he had , he gaue them his flesh and his bloud. Of their Apparell. THe matter of their Apparell was Wooll, Linnen, and Silke, and Xylinum, which was a middle be∣twixt Wollen and Linnen. Silke was called Meshi, Ezek. 16.10.13. Sericum. a  extrahere. Aquila tran∣slateth it , because it was soft and smooth, and easie to be handled, or it was called so, from [Ma∣shah] extrahere, because it was easily drawne out; silke is not a new invention, as some take it to be, for it was in use amongst the Hebrewes and Greekes, and it was called Serica Medica, because the Medes brought it upō Camels from Bactria. Secondly, they had Wooll; and thirdly, Byssus, white Linnen, which groweth in Egypt and Palestina, like to the leaues of the Poppie; and this is called Shesh; Xylinum. shesh is not rightly translated Linnen, but it should be translated Xylinum or Cotton, and the reasons are these,
the Lord forbiddeth to make a garment of linnen and woollen, therefore the Curtaines could not be made of linnen and woollen, but of [Shesh] byssus, or Cotton; se∣condly, Linnen doth not receiue the scarlet dye, as this Xylinum or Byssus doth; their courser cloaths were of Camels haire, such as Iohn the Baptist wore. Of the colour of their cloaths.The colour of their cloaths, first white, Eccles. 9.8. Let thy garments be alwayes white; those the Hebrewes called [Hhorim] Candidi.White cloaths a signe of prosperitie. They used this white as a signe of prosperitie, victorie, felicitie, joy and gladnesse. Christ himselfe upon the Mount appeared cloathed in white, so he appeared to Iohn in white, Revel. 1.13. so the white robes given to the Martyrs in signe of victo∣rie, Revel. 7.14. and white horses, Zach. 6. and Rev. 7.9. the Saints are brought in cloathed in white, bearing Palmes in their hands. Secondly, they had cloaths of scarlet colour, this was called , which commeth of a worme bred in the stalke of a certaine herb, and it hath Shani joyned with it, because the cloath was twice dyed in it, and this was celled ; Matthew saith that they put Christ in Coccinea tunica, in a scarlet coat; the other E∣vangelists say, in purple, that is, in scarlet tending more to purple, it was not bright scarlet; and the whore is called the scarlet whore, because she was dyed with the bloud of the Saints, Revel. 17.4. So there was hyacin∣thinus color, a violet or purple colour. Of the divers names of their stuffes, whereof their cloathes were made. FIrst, the Babylonians caused to weaue in divers co∣lours and pictures in their cloath, and this was cal∣led vestis babylonica: such was that which Achan stole, Iosh. 7.21.
The second was the Phrygian cloath, sowed with nee∣dle worke, and this was called opus Phrygionicum, the Hebrewes call it rokem. The hangings of the Tabernacle were such; The Queenes vesture was such, Psal. 45. This the Seventie call , from  a needle, and  sowed with a needle. Thirdly, Alexandrinum, the Alexandrian; This was when threeds of divers colours were woven together, and this was called , multilicium, or varie∣gatum: such was Iosephs partie coloured coate, and the Queenes daughters in those dayes wore a partie colou∣red gowne. 2 Sam. 13.18. This was also called Pluma∣rium, which shined like the Doves necke, Psal. 68.13. The Assyrians and Canaanites made opus barbaricum, woven in both the sides, or , such was the veile of the Tabernacle, both woven on the one side, and on the other. So they had opus plectile, as Aarons girdle; opus inter∣rasile, imbossed worke; so they had vestes undulatas, vel scutulatas, water chamlet. Of their husbandrie. FIrst, they plowed the ground, aravit.  Novellare. this was called [Hha∣rash] Then they plowed it the next yeare, and this was called [nir] novellare: and Ieremiah alludeth to this 4.3. Plow up your fallow ground; then he harro∣weth the ground, breaketh the clods and maketh it smooth, Esay 28.24. and prepareth it for the seed: This was called occare. The Oxe when hee plowed the ground hee eate cleane provender, so the asse: and Esay alludeth to this Esay 30.24. The Oxen likewise and the young asses that
eare the ground, shall eate cleane provender, which hath bin winnowed with the shovell, and with the fanne. Their other herds they fed them with Sycamores or wilde figges, Amos 7.14. I was a herdman and a gatherer of Sycamore fruit. They sowed divers sorts of graine, Esay 28.25. as fitches, cummin, wheat, barley, and rie. The barley and the flaxe were smitten with the thunder, but the wheat and the rie were not smitten, because they were hid in the darke, Exod. 9.31.32. There was not such difference betwixt the barley and the wheat, that the one was hid in the ground, when the other was shot up; therefore it is not rightly translated hidden in the darke, but erant serotina, or somewhat latter. There were three moneths betwixt their sowing and their first reaping, and foure moneths to the full har∣vest, Ioh. 4.35. Say not yee, there are yet foure moneths, and then commeth harvest? their barley harvest was at the Passover, and their wheat harvest was at the Pente∣cost. Of the manner how they threshed their corne. THey had sundry formes in threshing of their corne; First, they beat out their weaker graine with a staffe, as their fitches, and cummin, Esay 28.27. And this staffe was not unlike to our flailes. Againe, some of their graine was trodden out with the feete of Oxen or Horses; with Oxen Deut. 25.4. Thou shalt not mussle the mouth of the Oxe, that treadeth out the corne. And Hosea alludeth to this forme, Ephraim is an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corne, Hos. 10.11. So with the feete of horses, Esay 28.28.
nor bruise it with his horsemen; or else it was bruised out with an instrument of wood, which was either a plaine peice of wood set with teeth of yron, to cut the straw and bruise out the corne; This was called hharutz, for the sharpnesse of it. Or else they used a wheele to bruise it out, and this was called gneglah, as the first was cal∣led trahea. A comparison taken from the ripe figges. HOSEA 9.10. I found Israel like grapes in the wil∣dernes, I saw your fathers as the first ripe in the figge tree at her first time, Cant. 2.13. the figge tree putteth forth her greene figges, the greene figge was called grossus, and the ripe figge was called carica, matura fi∣cus. When it is said, that Christ came to the figge tree, and found nothing but leaues, for the time of figges were not as yet, Mark. 11.13. it is meant of those first ripe figges, these are called greene, or untimely figges, Revel. 6.13. The first ripe figges are easily shaken off and fall a∣way. And Nahum alludeth to this, Nahum 3.12. All thy strong holds shall be like figge-trees with the first ripe figges, if they be shaken, they shall fall into the mouth of the eater. And as men long most for the first ripe figs, so did the enemies for Nineve, and one shaking of the enemie should make them fall like the first ripe figges into their mouth. A comparison taken from their shepherds. THe shepherd in cold weather keepeth his cloake close about him, and the Lord alludeth to this forme, Ier. 43.12. He shall aray himselfe with the
Land of Egypt, as a shepheard putteth on his garment, that is, hee shall take away the spoiles of Egypt, and keepe them as sure as the shepheard keepeth his cloake about him. The shepheards in the East went out and in before their sheepe, and their sheepe followed them, and Christ sheweth this, Ioh. 10.3. The shepheard calleth his sheepe by name, and leadeth them out. The shepheard hath his call, whereby he calleth his sheepe, and they know his voice, Ioh. 10.3. Hee hath his shepheards crooke, and his rodde; the one to catch them, the other to driue them: and David alludeth to these, Psal. 23.4. Thou art with me, thy rodde and thy staffe they comfort me. The shepheard hath his whissle, and his pipe where∣with he delighteth himselfe when he feedeth his sheepe Iudg. 5.16. Why abod'st thou among the sheepfolds to heare [sharikoth gadarim] it should not be translated, Fistula. the blea∣ting of the flockes, but why abodest thou amongst the sheep∣folds, delighting to heare the whissle.
Of the miseries of the Children of GOD in this life, and their happie estate in the life to come. LVK. 6.19 Then there was a certaine rich man which was cloathed in purple and fine linnen, and fared sump∣tuously every day, and there was a certaine begger na∣med Lazarus which was laid at his gate full of sores, &c. IN this Parable are brought in to us the condition of a rich Glutton and a poore begger, they are described by their life, and by their death; in their life, the rich man is described by his great wealth, by his daily fare, and by his apparell; the begger by his povertie, and by his disease; by his povertie, that he lay at the rich mans gate, and begged but the crummes which fell from his Table, and yet could not get them, and thirdly by his companions, the dogges who licked his sores; then they are described by their death, he was carried to heaven by the Angels to Abrahams bosome, and the rich man to hell by the Devils, and the Parable setteth down to us the petition of him who was in hell, and the occasion of it, because he saw Lazarus a far off in Abrahams bosome; his petition was, that Abraham would send Lazarus with one drop of water to coole
his tongue, that is refused to him, and the reason set downe; then he putteth up a second petition, that A∣braham would send Lazarus to his brethren to testifie unto them of the paines & torment which he endured, but this is also denied, and the reason is subjoyned. How to know a Para∣ble from a History.It may be asked first here, whether this be an Histo∣ry or a Parable? It may seeme to be an Historie and not a Parable; for the Fathers make this difference be∣twixt an Historie and a Parable, they say, that is an Hi∣storie when the proper names of men are set downe, as they say, Iob is not a Parable but a History, because pro∣per names are set downe in it; so Lazarus proper name is set downe here, then it may seeme not to be a Para∣ble but an History. But we are to answere, that Laza∣rus is not a proper name here, but an appellatiue com∣mon to all miserable, wretched, and poore creatures; for in the Syrian Language which Christ spake, Vir cui ferri o∣portet adjumentum. Lagna∣zar, est is qui auxilio destitutus est, he that wanteth all helpe; it is not rightly translated Eleazer; as if it were a proper name, but an appellatiue Lagnazar, that hath no helpe, therefore that collection of some who thinke, that the rich mans name is omitted here for disgrace, is not so materiall, it being a Parable and not an History. He was a rich man, and he is described by his cloa∣thing, he was cloathed in purple and fine Linnen. He was cloathed in purple, this purple was the dye that was gotten from a shel-fish,Purple a costly dye. and it is not knowne now in those parts of the world. Man should not glorie in his apparell.Man hath little cause to glory in his apparell, he bor∣roweth it from the fish and from the Worme; the Iewes when they describe a man, they say, that man is a worm, cloathed with the excrements of the worme, the expe∣ctation of the wormes, and to be consumed, with the wormes; the first clothing that ever God made to man, was of the skins of beasts, and that man should not be
proud of his apparell, see what Christ saith, Mat. 6.29. I say unto you, that even Salomon in all his glorie was not a∣rayed like one of the Lillies: this might seeme strange at the first, but if we will consider it rightly, we shall finde it to be most true; First, Salomon in all his glorie,How the Lillie excee∣ded Salomon in his glorie. his ornaments were but artificiall, but the cloathing of the Lillies are natu∣rall; and looke how farre nature exceedeth art, (for art is but an imitatrix of nature, and her perfection is to imitate nature) therefore the Lillie exceeded Salomon in all his glorie. Secondly, Salomon when he was so gloriously dec∣ked, he was beholden to many creatures, he was behol∣den to Egypt for his linnen, to the earth for his gold, to the silk-worme for his silke, to the shel-fish for his pur∣ple, and had nothing of his owne; so that if every one of those should haue claimed their own, he should haue stood up like Aesops Crow stript of all, when every one of the foules craved their own feathers which they had lent her; but looke to the Lillie which is beholden to no other for its beautie, doth not the Lillie then exceed Salomon in all his glorie? Thirdly, when Salomon was cloathed thus,Mans cloaths a note of his shame. it was but a remembrance to him of his fall, and he had as little cause to glory in these ornaments, as a theefe hath to glory in a silken rope in which he is to be hanged, or if a man should glorie in the plaister that covereth his wound; but the beautie of the Lillie is naturall, it co∣vereth not the shame of it, therefore the Lillie exceeded Salomon in all his glorie. Fourthly, Salomon in all his glorie was but one, and how much adoe was there to get one Salomon so dec∣ked and cloathed? But all the Lillies of the field are so clothed, therefore the Lillie exceeded Salomon in all his glorie; this should teach us to make but little recko∣ning
of our apparell, because when we haue done our best, and spent all that we haue gotten upon apparell, yet the sillie Gilly-floure or a Dasie, shall exceed us in all our glorie; make but small reckoning then of this cloathing; labour to put on the Lord Iesus Christ, that clothing of nedle-worke, with which the Church is decked, Psal. 4.5. put on Christs righteousnesse, and then thou wilt exceede all the Lillies of the field in glo∣rie. And fared sumptuously every day. Why this rich man is called a Glutton.Because he fared so sumptuously every day, there∣fore he is commonly called the rich Glutton, Deut. 20.21. the disobedient sonne is called a drunkard and glut∣ton; what man is to be esteemed a glutton? the He∣brewes upon this place say, that he who eateth, tarte∣mar carnis, a pound of flesh is a glutton, and he who drinketh logum vini, an English quart of wine is a drun∣kard; but we must not restraine it so here, for Iudea be∣ing a hot Countrey, a little flesh served them, but in those cold Countries, where the cold driveth in the heat, mens stomackes digest the meat better, and there∣fore a man cannot be accounted a glutton, although he exceed this measure; but he is called a glutton, who delighteth in nothing but in eating and drinking. Sene∣ca saith, turpe est mensuram stomachi sui non nosse. The Glutton made a god of his backe and his bellie.He fared sumptuously every day.] He sacrificed to his backe and his belly, to make a god of the belly, what a base god is that? the belly of the beast was not sacrifi∣ced but cast out: Some make a god of their braine and sacrifice to their owne net or yarne, as Habakuk saith, cap. 1.16. as Ahitophel: Some make a god of their armes and strength, as Goliah; and some of their feete, as Ha∣sael trusted in his feet; but the most base and filthy god of all is to make a god of their panch; the Lord calleth Idols Deos stercoreos,The bellie a base god. gods of dung; to make a god of
the bely, is Deus stercoreus, a god of dung: if the Lord should bring in man, and let him see the Idolatry of his heart, as he let Ezechiel see what vile Idolatry the Iewes were committing in the Temple, Ezech. 8. he should see more vile abhomination and Idolatry in his heart, than ever Ezechiel saw; some sacrificing to this beastly lust or that, some making a god of their wealth, and some making a god of their belly, but God will destroy both the meat and the belly, 1 Cor. 6.13. Let us be content then with sober fare, all a mans travaile is for his mouth, Ec∣cles. 6.7. the mouth is but a little hole, & it should teach us to be contented with little;Man should learne to be content with little. but the gluttons appetite is such, that he thinketh he could swallow up Iordan; nature is content with little, but grace will be content with lesse. The Israelites when they gaue way unto their appetite, they cryed for flesh, for Garlicke, Onyons, and for Pepons, nothing would content them. Lazarus could not get the crummes that fell from his Table; a man hath a double use of his riches,A double use of a mans goods. a naturall use and a spirituall use, there is a sowing to the flesh, and a sowing to the spirit, Gal. 6.8. the naturall use is to main∣taine our selues and our families, the spirituall use is, to giue to the poore; Nabal knew not this use, 1 Sam. 25.11. Shall I take my bread, and my water, and my flesh, which I haue killed for my shearers, and giue it to men whom I know not whence they be? Here he knew the naturall use how to provide for himselfe and his familie, his shea∣rers, but he knew not the spirituall use, to giue to Da∣vid and his men in their neccessitie. So the rich glutton here knew nor the spirituall use of his riches, to feede poore Lazarus with them, it is this which the Lord will lay to the charge of the wicked at the last day, I was an hungred, and yee gaue me no meat, Mat. 25.42.The poore in necessitie are Lords of the rich mens goods. The poore in their necessitie are Lords of the rich mens goods, Prov. 3.27. and the rich men are but Stewards
and dispensators to them in that case; the Fathers call the money given to the poore, Trajectitiam pecuniam, for as he that goeth a farre journey, taketh a bill of ex∣change with him, and carrieth not his money along with him, for feare of robbing; so the children of God, they lay out their money to the poore, they take Gods bill of exchange for it, and then it meeteth them in the world to come; and so their money receiveth them in∣to eternall tabernacles, that is, it testifieth that they are to be received into eternall tabernacles. The miseries of Laza∣rus.Let us consider Lazarus his miseries; first, hee was poore, then he was sore, he had none in the same case with him, he seeth the rich glutton that Epicure to pro∣sper, and himselfe in such a hard case: hee might haue beene here overtaken with Davids temptation, Psal: 73.13. Verily I haue cleansed my heart in vaine, and washed mine hands in innocencie, for all the day I am plagued, and chastened every morning. A comparison betwixt Iob and Lazarus.Let us compare Iob and Lazarus together; Lazarus lay at the gate, Iob on the dunghill; Lazarus had no friends but the dogges, but Iob was in a worse case, for his friends vexed him, and were miserable comforters to him, Iob 16.2. Iob was once rich, and then poore, La∣zarus was ever poore, solatium aliquando nunquam fuisse foelicem. A comparison betwixt the rich glutton and Lazarus.Compare the rich glutton with poore Lazarus; La∣zarus full of sores, the glutton sound and whole; La∣zarus was hungry, he was full and fared sumptuously every day; Lazarus was cloathed in ragges, the glutton in purple and fine linnen; Lazarus lay at the gate, but he sate in his Palace; Lazarus could not get the crums that fell from his table, but he had good store of dain∣ties: Lazarus had no others to attend him, but the dogs onely, but hee had many gallant men to wait upon him.
Moreover the dogs came and licked his sores,The creatures are in league with the children of God. all the crea∣tures are in league with the children of God, but they are enemies to the wicked: The Ravens that fed Eliah, pull out the eyes of those that are disobedient to their parents, Prov 30.17. The Serpents stung the rebellious Israelites in the wildernesse, yet the Viper upon Pauls hand hurt him not, Act. 28.5. The Lyons that tou∣ched not Daniel, devoured his accusers, Dan. 6.24. And the dogges that licked Lazarus sores, eate the flesh of Iezabel; And the reason of this is, the dominion which the Lord gaue to man over the creatures at the beginning, and the image of God in man maketh them to acknowledge him as their Lord. But yee will say,  may not a beast hurt a child of God now? They may: and the reason is,  because this Image of God is not fully repaired in them againe.Why the beasts stand in awe of the children of God. When Adam was in his innocencie, he was like unto a Herauld that hath his coat of Armes upon him, all stand in feare of him, because he carrieth the Kings coat of Armes, but pull this coat off him, no man respecteth him; so man when he was cloathed with this Image of God, the beasts stood in awe of him. Eusebius in his Ecclesiasti∣call Historie recordeth, that the Persecutors tooke the Christians, and set them naked before the Lyons, yet the Lyons durst not touch them, they stood foaming and roaring before them, but hurt them not, and ther∣fore they were glad to put the skinnes of wild beasts upon them, to make the Lyons runne upon them and teare them; Thou that art a wicked man, and hast no part of this Image of God to defend thee, no marvaile if thy dogge bite thee, thy horse braine thee, or thy oxe gore thee: Let us studie then for to haue this Image re∣paired in us, if we would be in league with the beasts of the field.
Beasts surpasse man in many duties.The dogges came and licked his sores; The beasts ma∣ny times out-strip man in many duties: The Kine of Bethshemesh went streight forward with the Arke and declined neither to the right hand nor to the left, but man many times declineth either to the right hand or to the left, and he keepeth not this midst: The Oxe know∣eth his owner, and the Asse his Masters crib, but Israel doth not know, my people doe not consider. Esay 1.3. and Ier. 8.7. Yea the storke in the heaven knoweth her appointed times, and the turtle and the crane, and the swallow obserue the time of their comming, but my people know not the judge∣ment of the Lord. And the Lord sendeth man to the Ant to learne wisedome, Prov. 6.6. Goe to the ant thou slug∣gard, consider her wayes and be wise. Balaams Asse saw the Angell sooner then Balaam himselfe; and therefore is it that the Scripture calleth men beasts, and sendeth them to be taught by beasts, which sheweth how farre man is degenerated from his first estate, and what a low forme hee is in, when the beasts are set to teach him. Why God gaue his children a small porti∣on in this life.It may seeme strange why the Lord distributeth things so, that he giveth such plentie and abundance to the rich glutton, and so little to Lazarus, seeing the earth is the Lords and the fulnesse thereof, Psal. 24.1. God who doth all things in wisdome, doth not this without good reason: The Lord dealeth with his children in this life,Simile. as he did with the Israelites when he brought them to Canaan, Numb. 13.17. When he brought them to Canaan,South a barren Coun∣trey. he made them to goe Southward into the Moun∣taines, the South was a dry and barren part, Iudg. 1.15. Thou hast given me a South-land, giue me also springs of water: so Psal. 126.4. Turne againe our captivitie O Lord, as the streames in the South, hee prayeth that the Lord would refresh them now in the midst of bondage as the waters refreshed the dry and barren South. And
Iarchi noteth, that the Lord did with his people here, as Merchants doe who shew the worst cloath first,Simile. so dealeth the Lord with his children, hee sheweth them the worst first: and as at the wedding in Cana of Galilie, the last wine was the best, so is it here; the Lord she∣weth his children great afflictions and troubles, the South part as it were at first, but afterwards he bring∣eth them to the Land that floweth with milke and ho∣ney. Secondly, he bestoweth these outward and tempo∣rarie things but sparingly upon his children, that hee may draw their hearts to the consideration of better things: he giveth the wicked their portion in this life, Psal. 17.14. Sonne remember that thou in thy life time receivedst thy good things, Luke 16.25. but he reserveth the good things for his owne children, that is the holy Ghost, the graces of the Spirit, Luk. 11.9. It is a matter of great consequence to discerne what are the gifts of Gods favour;Great skill required in discerning the gifts of Gods right hand. many men thinke because they haue wealth and prosperitie, they are the gifts of Gods favour, and they seeme to stand under the Lords right hand, but they are deceived.Simile. When Ephraim and Manasseh were brought before Iacob, Ephraim was set at Iacobs left hand, and Manasseh at his right hand, but Ia∣cob crossed his hands, and laid his right hand upon E∣phraims head, and his left upon the head of Manasseh, Gen. 48. So many men who seeme to stand at the Lords right hand, shall be set at his left hand, and many who seeme to stand at his left hand, shall be set at his right hand. Lazarus seemeth to stand now at his left hand, but stay till you see him die, and the Angels carry him to glory, and then yee shall see him stand at the Lords right hand. It is a point of great wisedome to know the Lords dispensing hand; David prayeth Psal. 17.7. separa be∣nignitates
tuas, as if he should say, giue us something O Lord, that we may be discerned to be thy children from the wicked, for by these outward favours wee shall never be knowne to be thy children. The Lord careth not to throw a portion of this world to a wic∣ked man, as if one should throw a bone to a dogge; but he will know well to whom hee giveth this rich gift of eternall life. Death separateth the godly from the wicked.And it came to passe that the beggar dyed, and the rich man also dyed. Death maketh a full separation betwixt the children of God and the wicked: the sheepe and the goates may feed together for a while, but the shep∣heard separateth them; the wheat and the chaffe may lie in one floore together, but the fanne separateth them; and the good and the bad fish may be both in one net, untill they be drawne to the land; and the tares and the wheat may grow in one field for a while, until the time of harvest: so may the godly and the wicked liue toge∣ther here for a while,Simile. but death maketh a totall and full separation: Moses said to the Israelites, stand still and see the salvation of the Lord, which hee will shew to you to day: for the Egyptians whom yee haue seene to day, yee shall see them no more for ever Exod. 14.13. the red Sea made a separation betwixt the Israelites and the Egyptians for ever. So death separateth the children of God from the wicked, that they shall never meete againe. Betwixt us and you there is a great gulfe fixed, so that they which would passe from hence to you, cannot; neither can they passe to us,Gods children should haue little medling with the world. that would come from thence, Luk. 16.26. This should teach the children of God to haue little medling with the wicked, why? because one day there shall be a to∣tall and finall separation, and this is a great comfort to his children, oftentimes now they are afraid of the in∣cursions of the wicked, and of their bloodie hands, but then they shall never be afraid of them: The gates of the
new Ierusalem were not shut at all, Revel. 21.25. to sig∣nifie that there shall be no feare of the enemie there. And he was carried by the Angels into Abrahams bo∣some.] Here consider three things, first, how it commeth that the Angels are ministring spirits to man; second∣ly, what they minister to man; thirdly, the comfort that we haue by their ministerie. First, the ground of their ministery is, because we are reconciled to God in Christ, when man fell from God, the Angels stood with a flaming sword to hold him out of Paradise, Gen. 3.24. When Christ reconciled us to God, he re∣conciled us also to the Angels:Why the Angels mini∣ster to us. Iacob saw in a vision a Ladder reaching from the earth to the heaven, and the Angels ascending up and downe upon it, Gen. 28.12. Christ is this Ladder, upon which the Angels come downe to minister unto us, Ioh. 1.51. Verily, verily, I say unto you, hereafter yee shall see heaven open, and the An∣gels of God ascending and descending upon the sonne of man. Whether doe the Angels minister to wicked men or not? For outward things they may helpe them,  Whether the Angels doe minister to the wicked? even as the Lord makes his Sunne to rise on the evill and on the good, Mat. 5.45. We haue examples of this in the Scrip∣tures, when the Israelites were in the Wildernesse, the Angels brought downe Manna to them, therefore Da∣vid saith, He fed them with the bread of Angels, Psal. 74.25. It is called the bread of Angels, because it was brought downe by their ministery; there were many wicked men amongst the Israelites who did eat Manna, yet the Angels by their ministery brought it downe to them; another example wee haue, the Angels came downe at certaine times and stirred the Poole, Ioh. 5.4. and whosoever stepped in first, after that the Poole was stirred, was healed, whether he were bad or good, the
Angels then may minister to wicked men in outward things, but they doe not defend them from spirituall temptations, as they doe the children of God in resi∣sting Satan. Secondly, when they minister to man; they minister to him in his life time, in his death, in the graue, and at the resurrection. First, they minister to him in his life, and they keepe him that he dash not his foote against a stone; Secondly, in his death they waite about his bed to repell Satan, and when the soule is out of the bodie, they carry it into Abrahams bosome; and they attend the bodies of Gods children in the graue, because they are the Temples of the holy Ghost; and so at the resur∣rection they shall gather them from the foure corners of the earth, and shall attend them to glorie. Thirdly, we haue great comfort by their ministery; first, Vigilantes.  Robustissimi. they are [Gnirim] vigilantes, the watchfull ones, Dan. 4.13. Secondly, they are [Habhirim] strong ones, Psal. 78.25. When Salomon went to bed he had three∣score valiant men about it of the valiant of Israel to defend him, Cant 3.7. But what comfort is it to the children of God then to haue so many watchfull and strong An∣gels attending them? He was carried by the Angels. What strange change was this, that he who was now lying amongst the dogs is carried by Angels; lying amongst dogs, the most base and uncleane creatures, (therefore they are called Impuri canes, obscaeni canes,) that he should now be carri∣ed by Angels the most excellent creatures that GOD made, and not carried by one Angell, but by many An∣gels, as if they were striving every one to carry him? when a great man dieth all men striue to be about the Coffin,Simile. one to carrie a legge, and another to carry an arme; so doe the Angels striue here to carrie Lazarus soule; never man in this world rode in such triumph
as Lazarus soule did:The pompe of the Ro∣mans in their Chariots. the Romans after their Victories in their triumphs they had their Chariots drawn some∣times with Elephants, sometimes with nimble footed lennets, sometimes with pyde horses; and we reade of Amasis King of Egypt, who had his Chariot drawn with foure Kings whom he had conquered; but what is this to Lazarus Chariot, who is carried here by the Angels of God; he rode here [Bemirkebbath hashecinah] in cur∣ru majestatis: What shall be done to the man whom the King will honour? Esther 6.9. he shall not ride upon the Kings best horse, but in the Kings best Chariot. Into Abrahams bosome.] This is a speech borrowed from the custome of the Iewes, for they that lay in ones bosome were most deare and familiar with him, as Iohn leaned in Christs bosome; therefore it is said that Christ came out of the bosome of the Father, Ioh. 1.18. The fathers were partakers of the same salvation that we are partakers of,The fathers partakers of the same salvation that we are of. therefore Lazarus is in Abrahams bosome, they shall sit downe with Abraham Isaac and Ia∣cob in the Kingdome of God, Mat. 8.11.Our Sacraments haue the same name with the Iewes Sacraments. And they eat the same spirituall manna with us, 1 Cor. 10.3 And our Sa∣craments haue the names of their Sacramēts, we are cir∣cumcised with circumcision not made with hands, Colos. 2.11. And Christ our Passeover is sacrificed for us, 1 Cor. 5.7. Those then who thinke that the fathers were but fatted up like hogges with the temporary promises of this life, are foully deceived: Paradise is called Abrahams bo∣some, because the faithfull as Abrahams children are re∣ceived into that same fellowship with him; what is then become of this Limbus Patrum? The rich man also died and was buried;] Many were the solemnities which were in this funerall, but nothing of the Angels that carried his soule to heaven; he carried nothing of all that he had with him, but onely the pric∣kles of an evill conscience, now he leaveth all his pomp
behinde him. R. Salomon observeth, that David some∣times is called David the King, and David King of Israel, but when the Scripture speaketh of his death, he is cal∣led but David, the dayes of David drew nere that he should die, 1 King. 2.1. so vers. 10. David slept with his fathers and was buried. All externall glory and worldly pompe leaveth a man in his death. How to make use of Parables. Arguments drawn from the lesse to the more.To make use of Parables, we are to consider how the spirit of God in a Parable draweth an argument from the lesse to the more, as if the unjust Iudge because of the importunitie of the widow granted her request, how much more will God grant the earnest petitions of his children? so the man instantly seeking bread from his neighbour: the end of these Parables, is to teach us perseverance onely, and no other thing to be gathered out of them. Secondly, the unjust Steward is commended for providing for himselfe, here we are to follow him in the Parable for his foresight, and not for his deceit, so we commend the Serpent for his craft, but not for his poison. Nothing to be gathe∣red besides the scope of the Parable.Thirdly, nothing is to be gathered in a Parable be∣sides the scope, and as we looke not to every particular colour in the picture, but to the whole picture; so wee should not looke in a Parable to every particular cir∣cumstance in it, but to the generall scope; example, the rich Glutton lift up his eyes and saw Lazarus in hea∣ven, therefore the damned in hell doe see the glorified in heaven;False Collections from this Parable. a false collection, and it is besides the inten∣tion of the Parable; so the rich Glutton prayed to A∣braham; therefore we may pray to the Saints departed; or that there is water in heaven to quench the thirst of the damned; or that the soules departed haue fingers or eyes or tongues; or that the damned desire that their brethren come not to those torments, all false collecti∣ons;
but if they should gather, that the children of God are in great joy, and the damned in great paine, that were pertinent; Secondly,What may be gathered from this Parable. that there is no redemption out of hell; thirdly, that there is no refreshment to the wicked in hell; fourthly, that the desires of the wicked shall not be granted to them; fiftly, that those who will not be instructed by the Word here, will not beleeue although one should come from the dead to them; and lastly, that the Word of God, Moses, and the Pro∣phets, are the onely meanes to beget faith in us here. Thus farre we may stretch the Parable, and then wee shall bring a good sense out of it, but if we stretch it farther, then we shall bring a wrong sense out of it, the wringing of the nose bringeth forth bloud, Prov. 30.33.
How the wicked may be inlightned by the Preaching of the Gospel, and yet become worse after they be illuminated. MAT. 12.43 When the uncleane spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through drie places seeking rest, and findeth none, then he saith, I will returne unto mine house, &c. CHRIST having taught long amongst the Iewes, and illuminated their minds by wor∣king sundry miracles amongst them, and casting out Devils;The scope of the Parable. but having wrought no sanctification amongst them, he bringeth this Parable of a man dispossessed of a Devill, and being cast out, finding the house emptie and trimmed, returneth with seven spirits worse than himselfe. The parts of it.There is the Parable here, and the application of the Parable; the Parable is set downe at large, and the ap∣plication in few words, even so shall it also be with this wicked generation. The Parable it selfe hath three parts, first, possession; secondly, dispossession; and thirdly, repossession. Possession in these words, when the evill spirit is gone out of a man: which implieth, that he must first haue possession before he be cast out: secondly, dispossession, and when he is dispossessed, he wandreth in dry places and findeth no rest untill he returne; and thirdly, re∣possession,
he goeth and taketh with himselfe seven other spirits more wicked than himselfe, and they enter in and dwell there, and the last state of that man is worse than the first. When the uncleane spirit is cast out.] He is an uncleane spirit; first, in the manner of his apparition; secondly, in the manner of his revelation; and thirdly, in the man∣ner of his operation. First, in the manner of his apparition,Satan uncleane in the manner of his appa∣rition. he appeareth in the likenesse of a Goat, a stinking and a vile creature, therefore the Lord saith, They shall no more offer their sacrifices to Devils, Deut. 17.7. In the Originall it is [Leshegnirim] to the hayrie ones; they are called the hayrie ones, because they haue appeared in the likenesse of Satyres or wilde Goates. Secondly,In his revelation. . the Devill is an uncleane spirit in the man¦ner of his revelation, thou shalt not suffer [Obh] a Witch to line, Exod. 22.18. Obh is called a Bottle or a Bladder, the Witches are so called, because Satan gaue his an∣swers out of their bellies, and out of the secret passages of nature, and for this they were called by the Greekes . Thirdly,In his operation. he is an uncleane spirit in the manner of his operation, where ever he lodgeth he defileth that soule and that bodie, therefore the Scriptures call such som∣times dogges and swine, Revel. 22.15. and the filthiest beasts that are; but the holy Spirit is most comely in the manner of his apparition, in his revelation, and ope∣ration. First, in the manner of his apparition, when he appea∣red it was either in the likenesse of a man or a Doue,How the Holy Ghost appeared. or in the likenesse of fiery tongues; but he never appeared in the likenesse of any filthy beast. Againe, in the manner of his revelation; he revealed himselfe to his Prophets in a most comly manner when
he spake in them, he spake not out of the secret parts of nature, they did not foame at the mouth as those who were blasted by the Devill, but the holy Ghost sancti∣fied their tongues, and in great modestie and comeli∣nesse they spake the truth. Thirdly, in the manner of his operation he is most ho∣ly, for where ever he lodgeth, he sanctifieth and purifi∣eth that soule and bodie, therefore he is compared in the Scriptures to water and to fire, and to the Fullers sope, Psal. 51.7. Wash me and I shall be whiter than the snow: in the originall it is [Tecabbeseni] play the Fuller upon me. We may know then whether we be possessed by Satan or not, if we delight in filthinesse or unclean∣nesse, for uncleannesse is the unseparable effect of the uncleane spirit: a man may be overtaken by Satan som∣times, and Satan may in part pollute him, but he de∣lighteth not in it;The godly delight not in sinne. but if he delight to wallow in that sinne, and make no resistance to Satan, then he is cer∣tainly the habitation of Satan; when one offered vio∣lence to a woman under the Law, Deut. 22.27. if shee cryed out, she was not to die the death; but if she held her peace, and consented to that villany, she was to die the death: So when Satan commeth to pollute the soule and defile the bodie, if he cry out with Paul, O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the bodie of this death? Rom. 7.24. then we are not to die; but if wee hold our peace, & delight in Satans temptations which pollute the soule and the bodie, then wee are to die. Is cast out of a man.] There is no creature in which Sa∣tan delighteth to lodge,Satans delight is to lodge onely in man. but onely in man; when he en∣tred into other creatures, it was but onely to deceiue man, as when he entred into the Serpent, it was for this end, to deceiue Eva; he cared not for the Serpent it selfe: so when he entred into the Gergesites swine, it was
not for the swine that he cared, but onely that he might draw the hearts of the Gergesites from Christ by drow∣ning of their swine; and the reason wherefore he de∣lighteth to dwell in no other creature but man, is, be∣cause there is no visible creature that can commit sinne but man, where there is not a Law, there is no transgressi∣on, for sinne is the transgression of the Law, Rom. 4.15. but no Law is given to any visible creature but onely to man. This should be a great motiue to humble man,A motiue to humilitie. when he seeth such a great change, that he who was the Temple of the holy Ghost, should now become a cage for uncleane spirits, and to make the house of God a den of theeues, Mat. 21.13. Was not this a great change, when a mans house in which he dwelt was made a dung∣hill? Ezra 6.11. But this is a farre greater change when man who should be the Temple of the holy Ghost, is made a receptacle for uncleane Devils; it was a great change in Naomi, when her beautie was changed into bitternes; and when the Nazarites that were whiter than the snow, became blacke like the cole, Lament. 4.8. and when Nebuchadnezzar, who was a mightie King became a beast, Dan. 4.33. but those changes were no∣thing to this change, when man who was the Temple of the holy Ghost, should become the cage of uncleane Devils. When the uncleane spirit is gone out of a man. Whether did Satan goe out willingly here,  or was he cast out by force? He was cast out by force here,  he goeth not out wil∣lingly but by collusion, this is not ,Satan goeth not out willingly. by force to cast him out, Satan doth not cast out Satan; but when the Lord casteth him out by his power, then he is cast out by force. Whether is this gift in the Church now or not,  to cast out Satan?
This extraordinary gift to compell Satan to goe out of a man, is not in the Church now, we haue prayer and fasting now, desiring the Lord to cast him out, Mat. 17.21. but to charge him to goe out, or to conjure him, the Church hath no such power;Not lawfull to use the signe when the thing signified is not. to use the signe when the thing signified is not, this is a great abuse, if the high Priest under the Law should haue put in two counter∣feit stones in the brestplate, when there was neither V∣rim nor Thummim, and promised by them, to haue the Lord to answere him, had not this beene a delusion, so for men now to use the words of authority, to charge Satan to goe out, when this power is not in the Church, this is but a delusion; the Church hath power now by excommunication to giue over wicked men into the hands of Satan, but yet they become not , re∣ally possessed, as it was in the Primitiue Church. So the Church now hath power to pray to God for the delivery of the partie, but they haue not power with au∣thoritie to charge the uncleane spirit; the Church in her infancie had some extraordinary gifts which are now ceased, as to speake tongues, to cure the sicke, to cast out Devils, and to kill, as Peter did Ananias and Sa∣phira, Act. 5.5. to strike blind, as Paul did Elymas the sorcerer, Act. 13.11. God never withdrawes from hi Church gifts which are simply good.Those gifts which are the best gifts God never with∣draweth them from his Church altogether; but other gifts which are not simply the best gifts, he withdraw∣eth them; example, to speake diverse Languages was a gift profitable for the planting of the Church at the first, but yet it was not simplie necessary; Paul said, he had rather speake fiue words in a knowne tongue, than ten thousand words in an unknowne tongue, 1 Cor. 14.19. Those gifts which are most excellent and simply neces∣sary in the Church, he taketh not away, I shew unto you a more excellent way, 1 Cor. 12.31. And the Lord hath
turned these gifts into more excellent gifts, Ioh. 14.12. He that beleeveth in me, the workes that I doe, shall he doe also, and greater workes than these shall he doe. When Christ was here bodily present with his Dis∣ciples, his bodily presence was not so comfortable to them as his spirituall presence, so when he was present by miracles, signes, and wonders in the Primitiue Church, this was but a bodily presence in respect of his spirituall presence with us now; when the LORD wrought these miracles then, it was either to convict the Infidels, or to strengthen the faith of the weak ones, these miracles were signes, not to them that beleeue,Why miracles were wrought. but to them that beleeue not. 1 Cor. 14.22. When Paul healed the father of Publius the Consull, of a Fever, he healed him by a miracle, and made him presently to arise, Act. 28.8. but he healed not Timothy that way, but see∣meth rather to play the Physitian to him, bidding him drinke no longer water but wine, 1 Tim. 5.23. What was the reason of this? Timothy beleeved, therefore he nee∣ded not a miracle; but the father of Publius beleeved not, he was an Infidell as yet, and therefore a miracle was more necessary for him. He walketh through dry places.] That is, he counteth all other places but deserts in respect of his former ha∣bitation. Seeking rest and findeth none.] Satan hath three places;Three places of Sa∣tan. first, his place of pleasure; secondly, his place of wan∣dring; and thirdly, his place of torment; his place of pleasure is an uncleane soule, in which he delighteth to wallow: his place of wandring is, when he goeth about compassing the earth too & fro, seeking whom he may devout; and his place of torment is hell. Satan is tor∣mented now when he is in his place of pleasure, and in his place of wandring, but his full torment is not come, Art thou come hither to torment us before the time, Mat. 8.29.
The childe of God hath three places.So the childe of God hath three places; his place of pleasure, as Psal. 84.1. How amiable are thy Tabernacles O Lord of Hosts, my soule longeth, yea even fainteth for the Courts of the Lord: so he hath his place of griefe, Woe is me, that I sojourne in Mesech, that I dwell in the Tents of Kedar, Psal. 120.5. and he hath his place of joy in the Heavens. The spirits haue their rest.And findeth none.] Spirits haue their rest, they are not like quick-silver which hath principium motus in se, sed non quietis, but they haue principium motus & quietis, the soule resteth when it is delighted, as the bodie re∣steth when it lyeth or sitteth. Satans rest is sinne, but this is a restlesse rest, the true rest of the soule is God onely,When the soule re∣steth. therefore David said, returne my soule to thy rest, Psal. 116.7. When the soule is not set upon God the right object,Simile. then it is extra centrum; and as the Needle of the Compasse trembleth alwayes untill it stand to the North-Pole, so the soule hath no rest untill it be set upon the right object God himselfe. The rich man said, soule take thy rest, when he had his Barnes full, Luk. 12 9. But riches cannot bring rest to the soule, for the more that a covetous man hath, the more he co∣veteth; an example of this we see in gold-thirstie Ba∣bel, Esa. 14.4. the more they had, the more they cove∣ted: the soules of the wicked are in a sling, 1 Sam. 25. a stone in a sling is violently tossed about, so are their soules, and they shall get no rest day nor night, Rev. 14.11. So David compareth the wicked to a wheele which alwayes turneth about, Psal. 83.13. and to a drunken man that lyeth upon the top of a Mast,How to finde true rest. Prov. 23.24. If thou wouldst haue true rest to thy soule, disburden it of sinne; Looke how the poore shippe was tossed, so long as Ionas was in her, but when he was throwne in∣to the Sea, the storme was calmed: so cast out sinne, and then thou mayest haue rest. When a man enter∣taineth
his sinne, he is like a man that is sicke on the Sea, he runneth from this place to that place to seeke rest, but all in vaine, because he hath the sicknesse with∣in himselfe. vel sapius  per antiphra sin quasi illocalis, infinitus, qui nullo loco capitur, sed omnibus rebus locum dat. God is called by the Hebrewes [Makom] locus, because he containeth all things, and is contai∣ned of none; every thing is kept in its owne place, God is the place for the soule to rest in: the Philoso∣phers say, Bonum ex integra causa consistit, malum ex quo∣libet defectu, Goodnesse cannot consist without the in∣tegritie of all the parts, but evill is a defect of any of them, that a man be in good health, it is necessary that every humour keepe his just temper and proportion, but to make a man sicke, it is enough that one humour onely be distempered: the rest of the soule is GOD, who is all goodnesse, but any griefe will disquiet the soule; the soule is a disturbed thing, therefore we must admire his power who can settle it: when Christ cal∣med the winde and the Sea, they said, Who is he that both Sea and winds obey? so we may say, when God calmeth the soule, and putteth it to its rest;Why Satan can haue no rest. who is this that the unsetled soule doth obey? Satan being so farre from God, who is the place of rest, he cannot finde rest. Then he saith,  I will returne vnto my house from whence I came out. How can Satan returne to that place out of which he hath beene cast? Satan is cast out two wayes,  either partially or to∣tally: Partially he is cast out by illumination, totally by sanctification; this partiall casting out of Satan,A twofold casting out of Satan. is wrought sundry wayes; first, by civill education, as Nero was very meeke the first fiue yeares of his Raigne, because he was brought up under Seneca a good Master, so Iulian so long as he was a Reader in the Church, Satan was cast out of him partially; and
sometimes by the constitution of the bodie,Wicked men how re∣strained from sinne. as some abstaine from some sinnes, because of the constituti∣on of their bodies, as they abstaine from drinke, be∣cause they haue a weake braine; and sometimes by shame; and sometimes by the restraining power of God; but it is easie for Satan to enter in againe when he hath but such barres to hold him out; but where there is a totall sanctification, he cannot enter in againe there. Now when we call it a totall sanctification, it is meant totall here in parts, but not in degrees, that is, there is no facultie in the soule, but there is grace in it as well as there is sinne, and therefore Satan cannot en∣ter there againe. Vnto mine house from whence I came. Satan desires to goe backe into his ancient habitation.No place can content him so well as his former ha∣bitation, wherein he hath dwelt a long time, and he glorieth more to repossesse himselfe in his former ha∣bitations, than to purchase new places. When Satan was dispossessed out of the people of the Iewes in the Wildernesse by the doctrine of Miracles which Moses wrought, he sought to be repossessed againe; first, by Idolatrie; secondly, by Whoredome with the daughters of Moab, and by rebellion: so when hee was dispossessed out of the Christian Churches in the East, first, he sought to be repossessed again by schismes and heresies, but especially by Arrianisme, then he fully repossessed himselfe againe by Mahomet.How to keepe us free from Satan, that he enter not againe. If thou be free from Satans possession, looke not back againe as Lots wife did; Satan is like a Raven, when he is driven from a dead carkasse, he fleeth but a little from it, and is readie to returne to it againe;Simile. when a man commeth out of a Bathe, the Physitians prescribe to him then, that he looke well to himselfe, for he is readie to catch cold, because his pores are open; so when Satan is cast out, a man hath neede then to be very vigint,
that Satan surprise him not againe, For if after they haue escaped the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Iesus Christ, they are againe in∣tangled, and overcome, the latter end is worse with them than the beginning, 2 Pet 2.20. And when he is come, he findeth it emptie, swept, and garnished. This house was swept and hung, but it was not well furnished within. Obserue that God never commeth to the soule with a privation, but as he taketh away sinne,God commeth never with an emptie hand. so he putteth in grace, pull up the thornes, and then sow the wheate, Iere. 4.3. Cease to doe evill, and then learne to doe good, Esay 1. The Lord liketh not this privatiue Di∣vinitie, Curse yee Meroz, because they came not to the helpe of the Lord, Iudg. 5.23. So when I was an hungred, yee gaue me no meat at all. Mat. 25.42. Many men doe con∣tent themselues with this, they will doe their enemy no harme, they will haue no medling with him, but this is the sweeping of the house onely, but they come not to the positiue part, I will doe him good, and there∣fore Satan may get entrance againe. Then goeth he, and taketh seven other spirits with him more wicked than himselfe. Here the question may be mooved,Whether some Devils be worse than others? whether some Devils be worse than others? It may seeme there are, because Beelzebub their Prince he is worst, goe to the hels prepared for the Devill and his Angels, Mat. 25.41. And as amongst the good Angels, some are Powers, Dominions, and some Thrones; so it seemeth that a∣mongst the wicked Angels, there are some more wic∣ked than others, they are not then called worse spirits, because they are moe in number onely, but they are worse, because they are more malicious; they are all bad spirits, but some exceed others in malice and wic∣kednesse;
many men doe mistake Satan and his Angels, they thinke that some of them are spirits which doe no harme, but they are all sworne enemies to mans salva∣tion, therefore Satan is called the red Dragon, the red Dragon delighteth not onely to kill men for hunger, but also for sport to kill them; what can we looke for then of those infernall spirits of destruction? And the last end of that man is worse than the first. The end of the wicked is worse than their be∣ginning three wayes.His last end is worse than his beginning in three re∣spects; first, in respect of God; secondly, in respect of himselfe; thirdly, in respect of Satan. First, in respect of God, who justly punisheth him this wise, by giving him up unto a reprobate sense, be∣cause he loved not the truth: secondly, his last end is worse in respect of himselfe, because he is dyed over a∣gaine with sinne; those sinnes in the Scripture are cal∣led Scarlet sinnes. Scarlet is called Shani or , because it is twice dyed. So men when they fall backe, they are dyed anew againe, and as recidivatio in morbis est periculosa, so is the falling into sinne anew againe. So it is worse in respect of himselfe, because after that a man is illuminated, he is more readie to become pro∣phane,Simile. if he be not sanctified: Take water and heat it, and set it in the ayre, it will freeze sooner than cold wa∣ter; So if a man be illuminated, and haue some taste of sanctification, and then fall backe againe, he is in a worse case than he was in before. Thirdly, he is worse in re∣spect of Satan, for when Satan catcheth him againe, he maketh him twice more the childe of hell. A Iailor hath a prisoner fettered by the hands, necke, and feete, the prisoner beggeth of him, that he would release him, he releaseth him all to the foote, he slippeth his foote out of the fetters and escapeth; if the Iailor catch him againe, he layeth a double weight upon him, and fette∣reth him twice as sure as he was before; so when a sin∣ner
seemeth to escape from Satan, being enlightned and in some shew sanctified, it he fall backe againe, he brin∣geth seven worse spirits with him. The application of the Parable is,The application of the Parable. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked Generation. As if Christ should say, when I came amongst you, yee were in darkenesse, but by my ministerie yee haue beene illuminated, but maliciously now yee impugne this truth, and yee are possessed with seven worse spirits than before, therefore your end must be worse than your beginning. FINIS.
¶An Addition. Pag. 122. line 11. TO raise up seed to the brother, that is, to the el∣dest brother, Deut. 25.5. If brethren dwell toge∣ther, and one of them die, that is, if the first or el∣dest die and haue no seede, then his second brother was bound to raise up seede to him if he were not married; for the Law speaketh of brethren dwelling together, and not married or forisfamiliate: an example of this we haue in Er and Onan, Gen. 38. Secondly, if he had no brethren, then his neerest Kinsman was bound to performe this duty to him, if he had not beene married. But it seemeth that this dutie is required of N. Rut. 4.  although he had children, for he saith, then I should marre mine owne inheritance. It is onely required of him here to redeeme the inhe∣ritance, but not to marrie his Cousins wife;  this was onely stare super nomen defuncti, that is, to make his childe to be reputed as the childe of the dead, and so the childe should not be counted his sonne, but the sonne of Chilion; thus his inheritance should haue beene marr'd, and his name rased out, and this made N. to re∣fuse, but if the Cousin were not married, then he was bound to marry the wife of his Kinsman.

TO The Right Honorable, Sr. Thomas Coventrie Knight, Lord Coven∣trie, Baron of Alesborough, Lord Keeper of his Majesties Great Seale of ENGLAND. Most Honorable and my very good Lord, IOB the wisest and the richest Prince in the East,Iob. 28.7. searching where wise∣dome might be found, he could not finde the place thereof; He could not finde it in the land of the living; the depth saith, it is not with me; and the Sea saith, it is not with me; the Vultures eye hath not seene it for all his sharpe sight; and for the worth of it, it cannot be got∣ten for Gold, neyther can Silver be weighed for the price thereof; then hee subjoyneth, God understandeth the way thereof, and he
knoweth the place thereof: for he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the whole heaven. The wisedome which Job speaketh of here, is Gods secret wisedome in his workes of nature, which none of the world, although they were as sharpe sighted as the Eagle, can understand. Now if man be so ignorant in Gods woTkes of nature, much more is he in the workes of grace; and he may say as Agur sayd, when he considered Jthiel and Vcal (Iesus Christ the wisedome of the Father) surely I am more brutish then any man,Pro. 30.2. and have not the understan∣ding of a man. David when he lookt upon the heavens,Psal. 19.1. the workes of Gods hands, he sayd; The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handy worke: then he telleth how they declare his glory and what sort of Preachers they be, The vniversality of their preaching, their line is gone out through all the earth even, to the ends of the world; Then their diligence in preaching, both day and night; Lastly, how plainely they preach, n all languages. Yet this their preaching is but an indistinct fort of preaching in respect of the preaching of the Gospel. We may see some of his wise∣dome
in the heavens which are his handy worke: but nothing of the hid treasure and riches hid up in Iesus Christ, can we learne by this preaching. But Paul speaking of the preaching of the Gospel by the Apostles, saith, their sound went out into all the earth, and their words into the ends of the world;Rom. 10.18. hee changeth their line into their sound. There is a great difference betwixt these two sorts of preaching, a naughty person winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feete, and teach∣eth with his fingers,Pro. 6.13. but hee speaketh more distinctly with his tongue: So the Lord preacheth indistinctly (as it were) by his worke; but by the sound of his Gospel, hee preacheth clearely and plainely. Where shall we finde these treasures of grace and hid wise∣dome? this treasure is to bee found in his Law; therefore the Iewes call it desiderium mundi, and it is more to be desired, than Gold yea than most fine Gold.Psal. 19.10. The Angels them∣selves with stretched out neckes, desire to looke into this mysterie; even as the Cheru∣bims with stretched out neckes looked downe to the propitiatorie.1 Pet 1.12. If the Angels have such a desire to behold this wisedome, much more should man have a desire to
search into these mysteries: for he tooke not upon him the nature of Angels,Heb. 2.16. but he tooke on him the seede of Abraham: Happie is that man that findeth this wisedome, and the man that getteth understanding, this wise∣dome is onely to be found in the Law of the Lord.Pro. 3.13. I have indevoured (my Noble Lord) in this treatise to make some small path for the younger sort to this wisedome; And I have abstained from these questions which doe more hurt than good to the Church. Plutarch maketh mention of a number of Su∣ters to one maid, but they fell to such conten∣tion amongst themselves, that they did teare her all in peeces: too many disputations in effect doe rent the truth, & nimium altercando amittitur veritas: the best way to come by the knowledge of the truth, is, to bee con∣versant in the Text it selfe, and to bee ac∣quainted with the phrase of the holy Ghost speaking in his owne language. Let it not seeme strange to any, that I seeming a stran∣ger should take this boldnesse to offer these my labours to your Lordship. I cannot acknowledge such strangenesse: for wee have one Lord,Ephe. 4.13. one faith, one baptisme, one God and Father of us all; We live all under
one gratious King,Heb. 13.13. and there is small or no difference in our language:Act. 1. we differ not as the Cananites and these of Ashdod, yee say sibboleth and we say shibboleth,Matth. 26.73. yee speake the Dialect of Jerusalem, and we the Dialect of Galilee, small or no difference. But the reason wherefore I made choise of your honour, is the good re∣port which I heare of you every where, your name smelleth as the wine of Lebanon, yee have put on righteousnesse as a garment, yee are eyes to the blind and feete to the lame:Hos. 14.7. the blessing of him that is ready to perish commeth upon you,Iob 29.14. and you have caused the widowes heart to sing for joy. There were many notable and excellent parts in Iob, he despised not the counsell of his man-servant or of his maid-servant, here was his humi∣lity; yet when he sate in judgement, what grace and majestie had he? they gave eare and kept silence at his counsell; the young men saw him and hid themselves, and the aged arose and stood up before him; he was hospitable to the poore,Iob. 30.1. he did not eate his morsels alone, he was pitifull to the father∣lesse and to the widdow, and he disdained the wicked, that he would not set them with the dogges of his flocke: happy is that Land
where there are such judges. Another cause which moved me to grace this worke with your Lordships name, is the desire I have, that others may reade it the more willingly for their owne profit, and even as a faire entrie leadeth the beholder to looke more particu∣larly upon every part of the building: so the beholder of this worke set out under the pro∣tection of your honours vertue, will the more earnestly affect the perusing of the same, in confidence that so much worth as is eminent in your Lordship would hinder any mans boldnesse to present unto you a trifle. And for conclusion, when Jacob was to send his sonne Benjamin into Aegypt,Gen. 42.14. he prayed that God Almighty would give him favour before the man: So my earnest prayer to God is, that this treatise may first be acceptable to the Church of God, and then unto your Lord∣ship: And so I have obtained that which I desire. The grace of God be with your Lord∣ship, and make that the long continuance in the charge which his Majestie most worthi∣ly hath layd upon you, may produce long happinesse to this Commonwealth. Your honours in all dutifull submission, Iohn Weemse.
A loving advertisement to young Students in Divinity, who desire to come to the knowledge of the holy Scriptures. LOving Brethren; There be three Schooles in which young Divines must bee exercised; the schoole of Arts and Sciences, the Schoole of grace, and the Schoole of your vocation. It is a great helpe and an introduction to Divinitie, to bee trained up in the first Schoole of Arts and Sciences: Moses was learned in all the wisedome of the Aegyptians, Daniel in the learning of the Chaldeans, and Dionysius Areopagita was trained up in Philo∣sophie.Act. 7.22. A certaine Scholler amongst the Jewes asked one of the R. His Master,Dan. 1.4. whether he might read any of the humane Writers or not?Act. 17.34. he gave him this An∣swere; you may reade them, providing you reade them neither day nor night: this was a foolish answere, for the Jewes hated all humane learning; therefore
they say, maledictus qui aluerit Suem, aut didicerit Sapientiam Graecorum, they call all humane learning the wisdome of the Greekes. But to shut up this Schoole, and to take away all humane learning from a Divine, were in effect to make him no Divine. The knowledge of all Arts and Sciences is necessarie for him, as of Geometrie, Arithmeticke, Geographie, the knowledge of Physicke, but above all the knowledge of the tongues is more necessary for him, because they are Vehicula scientiarum. But here ye must not onely studie that part of the tongues which is called , which is mere Grammer, as to stand upon Letters, Accents, Pronounciation and such, but ye must goe farther to that part which is called , the true meaning of the words, to interpret them out of one language into another, and to understand one Phrase by another: neither should ye stand here, but ye must goe further to that part which is called , to censure and discerne the true reading from the false as the Masoreth did who excelled in this. Jn the warres there are three sorts of signes to direct the Souldiers, muta, semivo∣calia & vocalia: Muta, as the ensignes, Semi∣vocalia, as the trumpets: Vocalia as the words of the Captaine: So some signes are Muta, as Arts and Sciences; Semivocalia, as the knowledge of the tongues; and Vocalia, as the meaning of the holy
Ghost speaking in the Scriptures. The knowledge of these is most necessarie for you who intend to apply your minds to the studie of Divinitie: for by them ye shall understand the Properties and Phrases of the holy Ghost, the ancient customes of the people of God, and the sweet allusions in the third, which other∣wayes ye shall never bee able to understand. And if ye begin to learne these tongues when ye are young, to what great perfection may ye attaine unto before ye come to be teachers of others? Cicero maketh mention of Marcus Crassus,Cicero De orators: who walking one day upon the sea shore, saw a boy who had found a boate there, but he having no helpes to further him to saile; first he got Oares, then a Mast, raes, sailes, and ropes, and then he set to the Sea: so from little beginnings, if ye be willing, ye may attaine to a great measure of knowledge, having such helpes in this age, which your Fathers never knew,Iud. 8:21 and the gleanings of Ephraim now, are better than the vintage of Abiezer was then; ye have now many learned and skilfull guides. The Jewes say, Qui discit a junioribus cui similis est? Edenti uvas acerbas, & bibenti è torcu∣lari: at qui discit à Senioribus cui similis? Edenti uvas maturas & bibenti vinum vetus. Ye need not set your teeth on edge with sowre Grapes, for now ye have store of ripe Grapes gathered by your old Masters. The sluggard that keepeth his hand in
his bosome, and saith, there is a Lyon in the way; al∣ledgeth that the Jewes are but fabulous,Prov. 22.13. and that it is but lost time to read them: but remember that hee said well, who said, Malogranatum inveni, corti∣cem abjeci, & quod intus est comedi. Cast away the unprofitable things and make choise of that which is profitable. Others say, they cannot attaine to such perfection in these tongues as the Translators have done who have Translated, the Scriptures already: and therefore they will content themselves with their travels; but how shall they know whether they have translated well or not? They must give credit onely to the bearer, and if the Trench-man faile them, then they are gone. The Queene of Sheba was much more delighted to heare Salomon himselfe speake than heare of him by report,1 King. 10.7. for she said she beleeved not that which was reported of him; and yet the halfe was not told her: so brethren, when ye heare an Interpreter speake, scarce the halfe is told you: but when ye see it in the originall tongues, then ye will say; it was true which was spoken, and the wis∣dome that is in them exceedeth the report which wee heard. There is such profunditie in the Scriptures, that all the wits of men can never sound the depth of them;1 King. 4. it fareth with them as it did with the widdowes Oyle, it lasted as long as the Children brought vessels: so there is much store and plentie in them, that when
they have filled the wits and understandings of the best, yet there is enough to bee gotten out of them, by those who come after. And here J cannot let passe how much these honourable Patrons are to bee respected, who entertaine and cherish these professors in the tongues, for without such, knowledge would soone decay. David made a statute in Israel, that they who taried by the stuffe should part alike with those who went to battell. The professors of the tongues are they who keepe the stuffe, and they should bee as well rewarded as they who goe to the field and fight in the ministerie.1 Sam. 30.24. I have indevoured (brethren) accor∣ding to my meane measure of knowledge to make a little path unto you, to encourage you, and to let you see what profit you may have by this kind of studie, and how it may serue you in your ministerie, and if ye reap any benefit by it, be thankefull to the God of heaven the Father of lights from whom all good things descend, and then to my Noble Patron my Lord Keeper who doth incourage me much to go on in this kinde of studie. And now when we have made some progresse in this first Schoole, and have attained to some measure of knowledge, see that your knowledge turne not like the waters of Iordan that run into the dead Sea, but let them be like those waters which come from the Sea and rturne to the Sea againe, let them returne to the praise of him who gave them.Eccles. 17. Next when ye
are in the Schoole of grace, that ye may understand the Spirituall meaning of the holy Scriptures, ac∣quaint your selves with prayer. Elias was a man subject to the like passions as wee are,Iam. 5.17. yet he prayed, and the Heavens were opened and gaue raine: so al∣though ye be men, subject to the same passions to which others are subject; yet if yee pray earnestly to the Lord, he will open the heavens, and send downe that Spirituall raine upon you, and fit you for the Schoole of your calling.Ier. 2.8.  And here ye must be carefull to studie the Law of the Lord, and to handle it diligently. Ieremiah borroweth this speach from those who are trained in the warres, and they are said Tractare bellum, ye must be skilfull and trai∣ned before ye enter into this calling,Num. 31.27. that being entred in it, ye may begin to turne the key of knowledge to open the Scriptures to your headers, so that ye may have store both of new and old to bring forth when your Lord and Master shall set you over his houshold to give his servants their meat in due season. And at last he will say unto you,Matth. 25.23: ye have beene faithfull over a few things, J will make you ruler over many things. Lectio stata juvat,Seneca: varia delecta. Your Loving brother in the Lord, IOHN WEEMSE.

EXERCITATIONS DIVINE. The first Booke, containing diverse Questions for the understanding of the Scriptures in generall. Exercitat. Divine. 1. Of the excellency of DIVINITIE, above all other Sciences. 2 TIMOT. 3.16. All Scripture is given by inspiration of God, &c. HVmane Sciences and Arts,Humane Sciences and Arts compared to the dough brought out of Egypt, and Divinity to Manna. have beene fitly compared to the dough which the Israelites brought out of Egypt, Exod. 12.34. which they fed upon untill they got Manna: This dough was prepared by much labour; by plowing, by sowing, by rea∣ping, by grinding, kneading, and baking: So humane Sciences which are the birth of reason, are bred below here: but Divinitie is like unto Manna which was pre∣pared
or ready to their hand; they neither plowed for it, neither did sow it, nor reaped it. So Divinity is pre∣pared in heaven, and sent downe to teach the Church here below. The dough which they brought out of Egypt,The dough the bread of the poore. Deut. 16.3. is called, panis pauperum, the poores bread; it is called the poores bread, because the poore in their necessity could not bee at leasure to ferment it, and it had not so pleasant a relish; therefore it is called the poores bread:Manna the bread of Angels. but Manna is called the bread of Angels, Psal. 78.25. It is called the bread of Angels, be∣cause it was brought downe by their ministerie; and it was so pleasant in taste, that if the Angels had eaten bread, it might have served them: So 1 Cor. 13.1. If I speake with the tongue of Angels, that is, if the Angels had tongues to speake with: And as farre as Manna surpas∣sed the poores bread, as farre and farther doth Divinity surpasse humane Sciences and Arts. The world compared to Egypt, and the Church to Canaan.Againe, the world hath beene well compared to E∣gypt, and the Church to Canaan: Egypt was a Land that was watered with the feete of men, Deut. 11, 10. It was said to be watered with the feete of men,Egypt watered with the feet of men. as a garden, because they carried water on foote out of Nilus, and watered their Land with it:Canaan a land blessed of God. but Canaan was a Land blessed of God, and his eyes were upon it from the be∣ginning of the yeere to the end, Deut. 11.12. It was a land of hils and valleyes, and drinketh water of the raine of heaven. The world is but watered with hu∣mane Sciences and Arts, which are drawne out of the troubled reason of man like Nilus: but the Church is watered with these celestiall graces which come from above. A comparison betwixt Divinity, and all other Sciences and Arts in generall.Now that we may see the excellency of Divinity a∣bove all other Sciences and Arts, let us observe where∣in they differ in generall, and then let us make a particu∣lar comparison betwixt Divinity & other Sciences and Arts.
First, they differ origine, in the originall: humane Sciences and Arts proceede from God as hee is God and generall ruler of the world, but Divinity procee∣ded from the Father by the Sonne to the Church, Revel. 22.1. And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, cleare as cristall, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lambe: but these humane Sciences and Arts, al∣though they proceede from God, yet they proceede not from God and the Lambe like a cristall ri∣ver. Secondly, these humane Sciences and Arts, are but humano-divinae, they are but the broode of reason, which proceedeth from God enlightning every man that commeth into the world, Scientia hūano-divina Scientia humana. Scientia diabolica. Scientia divino-divina Iohn 1.9. Some againe are humane and the birth of corrupt man onely, as Sophi∣strie: And thirdly, some are Diabolicae, as necromancie and witch-craft: But Divinity is Divino-divina, that is, it is originally from God and immediately. And if we shall compare Faith the daughter of Di∣vinity,A comparison betwixt sense, reason, & faith. with Reason the mother of all other Sciences and Arts, we shall see how farre Divinity excelleth all other Sciences and Arts. There are in man, sense, reason, and faith; and as farre as reason surpasseth sense, much farther doth faith sur∣passe reason; and by consequent Divinity surpasseth all other Sciences. Reason differeth much from sense,How sense, reason, and faith apprehend things. for sense the far∣ther that the object is from it, it is magis universale & magis confusum, it is the more universall and more con∣fused; and the nearer that the object comes to the sense, it is the lesse universall and more distinct: Example, when we see an object a farre off, we take it up first to be ens somewhat, then we take it up to be a living crea∣ture, then we take it up to be a man, and last to be Peter or Iohn; Here the neerer that the object commeth to
our sense, it is lesse universall and more distinct; and the farther that it is removed from our sense, it is the more universall and more confused.Simile. The knowledge which a young child hath at the first is wonderfull confused, and he will sucke any woman for his nurse, this know∣ledge is very confused: then his knowledge becom∣meth more distinct and more generall, and then he be∣ginneth to know, this is not my nurse, and this is not my nurse, but this is my nurse; here his knowledge begin∣neth to be more distinct, and he will sucke none but his owne nurse: and his knowledge now, resembleth the knowledge which we have by reason, which ascendeth from the particular to the generall, and the farther that it is from sense, it is the more universall and lesse con∣fused. But faith the daughter of Divinity, ascendeth higher than reason or sense, and the further that it goes from sense and reason the more perfect it is, and it go∣eth from minus universale, to the supreame and highest cause, God himselfe; and the neerer that faith commeth to reason or sense, the weaker it is and more indistinct. Thomas his faith was an indistinct faith and weake, and could not beleeve unlesse hee put his fingers in the wounds of Christ, Iohn 20.28. here his faith leaned too much to sense; but faith the higher that it goes from sense and reason, the more perfect it is; We have a no∣table example of this, Gen. 49. when Ioseph tooke E∣phraim and Manasse, Ephraim in his right hand towards Israels left hand, and brought him neere unto him, and Manasse in his left hand toward Israels right hand, Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon Ephraims head, and his left hand upon Manasses head, guiding his hands wittingly, or as Onkelos the Chaldee Para∣phrast hath it, Prudenter egit manibus suis, when he dealt wisely with his hands: But when Ioseph saw that his fa∣ther laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it
displeased him, and he held up his fathers hand, and he said to his father, not so my father, for this is the first borne, put thy right hand upon his head: and his father refused and said, I know it my sonne, I know it truly, the younger shall be greater than he, Gen. 48.19. Ioseph thought because his father Iacob was blind that his faith was a confused and weake faith, but Iacob knew that the farther his faith was from sence, and the higher that it ascended from reason, it was the more perfect, and therefore he sayd jadanghti bene jadanghti, I know it my sonne, I know it; that is, certainely I know it. This is then the excel∣lencie of faith, that the higher that it goes from sence and reason the more perfect it is, which sheweth the excellency of Divinity above all other Sciences and Artes; for if faith the daughter of Divinity surpasseth them all, much more doth Divinity it selfe: and it may bee said of faith, as it was said of the vertuous woman, Prov. 30. Many daughters in Israel have done vertuously, but thou surpassest them all. Last of all, other Sciences and Artes are but hand∣maids to Divinity, and as the Nethinims the posterity of the Gibionits were appointed by Iosuah to hew wood and draw water for the Sanctuary, but never to meddle with the Sacrifices, neyther to kill them nor offer them, Iosh. 9.23. so humane Sciences and Arts are appointed but to attend and serve Divinity, they are but to hew the wood, and draw the water onely to the Sanctua∣rie. There are three principles from whence Sciences and Arts are derived, the first is contemplation,A comparison betwixt Divinity and other Sciences. the se∣cond is action, the third is operation. For contemplation, the metaphysicks are the most abstract, considering ens ut ens onely: the second are the mathematicks, which considereth the quantity and
the number of things; geometry the quantity, and arith∣meticke the number. Thirdly, the Physicks consider onely naturall properties of the body. These who are exercised in actions and morall phi∣losophie, are lawes and such. Arts which are exercised in operation are rhetoricke and grammer. A comparison betwixt Divinity and Metaphy∣sicks.Metaphysicke considereth God onely, ut ens vuum, verum et bonum, as he hath a being, as he is one, as hee is truth and goodnesse; but it considereth not God as Creator, Christ as Redeemer, it considereth not God in his attributes as Divinity doth, & therefore they say metaphysica parit scientiam tantum, sed theologia fidem. A comparison betwixt Divinity, Mathema∣ticks, anp Physicks.Secondly, compare Divinity with physicke and the mathematicks, the mathematician searcheth visible formes in visible things, the Physition invisible formes in visible things; but the Divine invisible formes in vi∣sible things. A comparison betwixt the Divine, the Lawyer, and the Physition.Thirdly, let us compare the Divine, the Lawyer and Physitian; the Physitian est minister naturae, the servant of nature, the Lawyer est minister justitiae, but the Di∣vine est minister gratiae: and looke how farre grace ex∣ceedeth nature or justice, so as farre doth Divinity sur∣passe the Physitian or the Lawyer. A comparison betwixt the Divine, and morall Philosopher.Fourthly, let us compare Divinity and morall philo∣sophy, the Philosopher saith, that Iuvenis non est idone∣us auditor moralis Philosophiae, that a young man is not fit to heare morall philosophy, but David saith, Psal. 119.9. Wherewith shall a young man cleanse his wayes. Chry∣sostome hath a good observatien to shew the force of Divinity above all morall philosophie, when he com∣pareth Plato the moralist and Paul the Apostle toge∣ther: Plato saith he, that wise Philosopher came three times to Sicilie to convert Dionysius the tyrant to mo∣rall philosophy, yet he went away without any successe:
but Paul a Tent-maker did not onely convert Sicilie, but ran from Ierusalem to Illyricum, Rom. 15.19. and conver∣ted thousands of soules by the preaching of the Gospel. See how farre Divinity excelleth morall philosophie.August. de Civitate Dei. lib. 6. cap. 11. And Augustine observeth how Seneca the most excellent of all the moralists, mocked the Iewes, because they spent (as hee thought) the seventh part of their life in idlenesse, which was the Sabbath day. Iustine Martyr being first a philosopher, and after a martyr, searched thorow all the sects of philosophy, and could never find contentment to his soule till hee came to Di∣vinity. First he came to the sect of the Stoickes and gave himselfe to be a scholler in that schoole, but hearing nothing of God in Stoa in that schoole, he turned to be a Peripatetick: but when he entred with the Peripateticks, he perceived his master nundinantem sapientiam mercede (as he speakes) selling his wisedome for gaine, then hee left that sect also. Thirdly, he came to the sect of the Pythagoreans, but having no skill in geometrie (which knowledge Pythagoras required of his Schollers before he taught them philosophy) he left the Pythagoreans and fell into the society of the Platonickes: at last he met with a Christian Divine Philosopher who perswaded him to cast aside all these circular disciplines, and to stu∣die Divinity which should give him greater content∣ment than all the philosophy in the world, and he re∣nouncing all gave himselfe to the studying of the holy Scriptures, and of a Philosopher became both a Christian and a Martyr.A comparison betwixt Divinity, and Physicke alone. Fiftly; let us compare Divinity and Physicke alone, they say ubi desinit physicus ibi incipit medicus, Where the naturall philosopher leaveth, there the Physitian beginneth, but we may say, ubi desinit physicus, ibi inci∣pit Theologus, where the Physitian leaveth off, there the Divine beginneth; for when the Physitian hath done
his last cure and given over the patient, here signes him into the hands of the Divine, or if he be a religious Physition, hee is glad to play the Divine to him him∣selfe; the Physitian sheweth the patient that his health consisteth in letting of blood, but the Divine sheweth that the health of his patient consisteth by the letting of the blood of Christ. A comparison betwixt Divinity and the Ma∣thematicks alone.Sixtly, compare Divinity and the mathematicks, the mathematician considereth the length, the height and the breadth of things, but be never considereth what is the height, the breadth and the length of the love of Christ, Ephes. 3.8. he never teacheth a man to number his dayes, that he may apply his heart to wisedome, Psal. 90.12. as the Divine doth. A comparison betwixt Divinity, Grammer, and Rhetorick.Lastly, compare Divinity with grammer and rheto∣ricke: hearing of others teacheth us to speake; gram∣mer teacheth us to speake congruously, and rhetoricke teacheth us to speake eloquently, but Divinity teach∣eth us to speake the language of Canaan, Esay 19.18. Whether commeth Lawes or Physicke nearer to Divinity? Wee must answer here by distinction, the Law hath two parts in it, the first is that which is called ,Pars legis. . . of constituting and making of lawes: the se∣cond is that ligitious part which is exercised about the pleading of causes; the first part commeth nearer to Divinity than physicke doth, because the Physitian is exercised onely about the health of the body, and if he speake any thing to his patient of temperance or re∣straining of his passions, all this he doth but for his patients health. But the nomotheticke or maker of the law, doth all things for the well ordering of the people; and looke how much more excellent it is to live well, than to live in good health: so much more that part of the law excelleth physicke. But physicke againe is to
be preferred to that part of the Law which is called li∣tigisa or the litigious part of the law, because that part of the law doth not respect the commonwealth, or the manners of the people, but to give this or that particu∣lar man his right: But to cure this or that particular man, is better than to restore this or that particular man to his goods; for skin for skin, and all that a man hath will he give for his life, Iob. 1. therefore physicke excelleth the litigious part of the Law. It may be said that Divinity borroweth many things of other Sciences, therefore it may seeme not to be so absolute in perfection. This argueth no want in Divinity,  but onely a defect in our understanding; for by these inferiour things we are led to the knowledge of more divine things. Divinity is not  or a generall summe of all Sciences and Arts, or one universall director to all our actions as they are naturall, civill, or oeconomi∣call. But Paul biddeth Timothy take a little wine to comfort him,  1 Tim. 5.23. So Moyses setteth downe weights and measures in the Law. When Paul biddeth Timothy take some wine to com∣fort him, he is not playing the Physition here:  so when Moses setteth downe weights and measures, this is not his last end that there may be commutative justice a∣mongst the children of Israel; Pauls last end and cheife consideration is this, that Timothy having a sound body may be able to glorifie God in his ministery. So Mo∣ses considereth weights and measures, that Gods people might doe no wrong, but glorifie God in their calling; And as one thing may belong to the mathematitian in respect of the middest, and to the Physitian in respect of the thing it selfe, as when a Physitian sheweth that a round wound is more hardly cured than a long
wound, although the Physitian shew this by the prin∣ciples of geometry, yet he cureth not the wound as a Goemetrician but as a Physitian. So when a Divine speaketh of weights and measures, and health of body, although they belong to the politickes or physickes in respect of the midst, yet in respect of the end they belong to Divinity. Other Sciences are not directly subordinate to Divi∣nity; these sciences which are directly subordinate, the conclusions of the superior Sciences are the principles of the inferior, as the conclusions of arithmeticke are the principles of musicke, and these sciences which are directly subordinate here, have but some new accident added to them, to make a distinction betwixt them and the superior. Sciences, as musicke subordinate to arithmeticke hath this accident superadded to it, to be numerus sonorus a number with sound, but Divinity and other Sciences toto genere differunt, they are alto∣gether different. Subordi∣natio directa. ratione finis. Sciences and Arts sub∣ordinate to Divinity, in respect of the end.Other Sciences are not directly subordinate to Di∣vinity but onely in respect of the end, the Apothecary is directly subordinate to the Physitian; therefore hee prescribeth unto him all his ingredients, what hot things he must use and what cold, what drachmes and what scruples: the Taylor againe is not directly subor∣dinate to the Doctor, but onely in respect of the end, therefore the Doctor prescribeth not unto him how much he should make in a gowne; aske the Doctor why he giveth physicke to a man? and he will answere, for the preservation of the body: So aske the Taylor why he maketh cloathes for him? he will answer for the same end; here the inferior, the Taylor, is subordi∣nate to the Doctor, onely in respect of the end: So all Sciences and Arts are but indirectly subordinate to Divinity, and in respect of the end, and therefore
they have nor their particular directions from Divini∣ty. The conclusion of this is:Conclusio. 1. All Sciences are found out for the benefit of man, but all of them can doe him but little good, untill Divinity come in and rectifie him. All Sciences are subordinate to Divinity in respect of the end;Conclusio. 2. therefore every man should studie to be ho∣ly, what Science soever he professe: but profane men thinke that it becommeth not a Physitian to bee holy, because they understand not that these Sci∣ences are subordinate to Divinity in respect of the end. EXERCITATI. II. What use reason hath in Divinity. 2 Cor. 10.5. And bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. AS God in the creation set up two lights to guide and to direct the world, Gen. 1.16. so the Lord hath given two lights to direct man; the light of rea∣son to direct him in things below here, and Divine light to direct him in things above:Grace doth not extin∣guish reason, but recti∣fieth it. these two lights the one of them doth not extinguish the other, but onely diminish it, and maketh it fall downe and give place, and then rectifieth and exalteth it. Esa. 42.15. I will make the rivers ylands, and I will dry up the pooles. The rivers come from the fountaines, but yet when the light of grace commeth in, then the rivers are dimi∣nished and they decrease that the dry land may ap∣peare: reason is not taken away here, but it falleth downe and giveth way to grace; but the pooles shall be
dryed up, that is, grace taketh away schismes and heri∣sies and drieth them up: but when reason submitteth her selfe to Divinity and is rectified, shee hath good use in Divinity. And even as a Dwarfe set upon a Gyants shoulders seeth much further than hee did before: so doth reason when it is rectified by Divinity; and so grace doth not extinguish reason but perfecteth it: and therefore Iustine Martyr called religion true philosophie, and then he saith, he became a Philosopher when he became a Christian. Things that reason is not able to do in Divi∣nity and matters of Faith.Let us consider first what is above the reach of rea∣son in Divinity. First, reason cannot bee a judge in matters Divine, for reason can never judge of the ob∣ject of supernaturall verity. Reason sheweth this much to a man: when it seeth the antecedent and the consequent, that this followeth rightly upon that: but reason never judgeth of the object of supernaturall ve∣rity, but Divinity enlighteneth the mind and maketh the spirituall man to judge of this. A Carpenter when he is working,Simile. doth see by his eye when he applieth the square to the wood, whether it be streight or not; but yet his eye (without the which he cannot see) is not the judge to try whether the tree be streight or not, but onely the square is the judge: So reason in man (with∣out the which he could not judge) is not the square to try what is right or what is wrong, but the Word it selfe is onely the rule and square; reason cannot con∣sider how faith justifieth a man, or whether works bee an effect of faith or not, but reason can conclude one∣ly ex concessis, of things granted, if faith be the cause and works the effect, then they must necessarily goe toge∣ther, and reason goeth no higher. Secondly, no midst taken from philosophy can make up a Divine conclusion, neyther would it beget faith in a man. Example, God is not the efficient cause
of sinne, the efficient cause is a terme attributed to God: here if a Divine should goe about to prove eyther by logicke or grounds of metaphysicke, this conclusion were not a Divine conclusion, whereupon a mans faith might rest, as if he should reason this wayes, No effici∣ent cause can produce a defect but an effect, God is an efficient cause, and sinne is a defect, therefore God cannot produce sinne; this were but an humane con∣clusion and could not beget faith.. So if he should rea∣son from the grounds of metaphysicke this wayes, God is ens entium, and the properties of ens are vnum verum bonum, therefore God who is ens entium cannot produce sinne, because hee is goodnesse it selfe; the conclusion were but an humane conclusion and could not beget faith: but if a Divine should prove the same by a midst taken out of the Scriptures, and should rea∣son thus. 1 Ioh. 2.16. All that which is in the world, is ey∣ther the concupiscence of the flesh, or the lust of the eye, or the pride of life, not from the Father, this midst will make up a Divine conclusion which will beget faith in a man, and then the Christian man may say to the Philosopher as the Samaritans said unto the woman of Samaria, I beleeve not now for thy reason, but for the authority of God, which is the ground of my faith. Thirdly, Philosophy doth not inlighten the minde with spirituall knowledge, it inlightneth the minde one∣ly with a generall knowledge whereof Iohn speaketh, Iohn 1.9. Rom. 1. when he beleeveth, his reason at the first is mere passive; therefore this speech of Clemens Alexandrinus would be very warily taken,Lib. 1. Strom. Philosophiam  vocat; as though philosophy made an in∣troduction to saving faith: And this speech of some Divines is harshly spoken, lumen naturae accendit lumen gratiae, and Basils comparison must not be stretched o∣ver farre, as Dyers before they bring on the most
perfect dye, they dye first with the baser colour, to make it the more fitte to receive the more bright co∣lour: So humane learning may be a preparation to grace. But the comparison is too farre stretched here, humane learning is a preparation to make a man under∣stand the axiomes, syllogismes and logical part in Divi∣nity; but a heathen philosopher having the helpe of nature, is no sooner converted to the truth. A learned Philosopher converted to the faith,Certi∣tudo evidentiae. adhaerentiae. may have a grea∣ter certainty of evidence than a laicke, and may know the literall sense better, but hee hath no greater cer∣tainety of adherence, as wee see oftentimes when it commeth to the poynt of suffering. But seeing zeale is not alwayes according to knowledge, therefore know∣ledge of humane Sciences is a great helpe to the knowledge of faith once bred, when it is sancti∣fied. Reason must not tran∣scend her bounds.Philosophie must not transcend her bounds and commit Saltum, as they speake in the Schooles, when shee taketh midsts which are mere philosophicall to prove any thing in Divinity; this was the fault of most of the Schoolemen: but when shee doth keepe herselfe within her bounds, then she hath good use in Divinity. Matth. 22. the Sadduces reason this way concerning the resurrection. If there were a resurrection, then there should follow a great absurdity, that seven men should have one wife at the day of judgement: but this is absurd: therefore, &c. But Divinity telleth reason, that here she goeth without her bounds, measuring the estate of the life to come, by the estate of this life, and borroweth midsts which are not Divine to prove this conclusion; for in the life to come wee shall be like Angels, who neyther marry nor give in marriage, and neede not to propagate their kind by generati∣on.
Another example. Nicodemus reasoned this wayes, He that is borne againe must enter into his mothers womb, Ioh. 3.4 no man can enter againe into his mo∣thers womb, therefore no man can be borne againe: but Divinity teacheth reason that she transcendeth her bounds here, and useth a midst which is mere naturall to prove a supernaturall conclusion. A third example, Arrius reasoneth this wayes; hee that is begotten is not eternall, Christ is begotten, therefore he is not eternall: here Divinity telleth rea∣son that shee is out of her bounds, and applyeth her midsts falsly. There is a threefold generation,Gene∣ratio Physica. Metaphysica. Hyperphysica. first a physicall generation, secondly a metaphysicall, and thirdly an hyperphysicall: physicall generation is this, when a mortall man begetteth a sonne, and this is done in time: metaphysicall generation is this, when the mind begetteth a word, and this is alwayes done in time: but hyperphysicall generation is that eternall ge∣neration, and this is done before all time; and Divinity sheweth reason how shee misapplyeth her physicall and metaphysicall generation; to this eternall generation. Whether is such a proposition true in Divinity,  and false in reason, the Sonne of God begotten from all eterni∣ty, true in Divinity, the Sonne of God begotten from all eternity, false in the court of reason: So Mary the Vir∣gin bare a Sonne, true in Divinity: Mary the Virgin bare a Sonne, false in the court of reason? That which is true in one Science,  is not false in ano∣ther. In Israel there was a judicatorie of seventy who judged of matters of greatest weight, and there was an inferior judicatory, consisting of three, and these judged of goods and matters of least moment: that which was truly concluded in the highest judicatory was not false in this inferior judicatory, although they
could not judge of a false Prophet as the great Synedri∣on did, yet they held it not false in the lowest judicato∣ry, when the great Synedrion concluded such a one to be a false Prophet: So that which is true in Divinity is not false in reason, but onely above her reach; and if any thing were true in one Science, and false in ano∣ther, then verum non esset reciproca affectio entis, that is, that which hath a being should not bee true, and that which is true should not have a being, these two pro∣positions should not be converted.Veri∣tas supra rationem. juxta rationem. rationem. There is a verity that is above reason, and there is a verity which is agreeable to reason, and there is a verity that is under reason, the first is of things taken up by faith, the se∣cond is of things taken up by reason, the third is of things taken up by sense, but there is no verity con∣trary to reason, it is not against reason to beleeve that a Virgin conceived and bare a Sonne, but it is above reason. What use reason hath in Divinity.Wee must not seclude reason altogether from Divi∣nity, Christ himselfe used the helpe of reason against the Sadduces, and Paul against the Iewes, Heb. 7.17. Thou art a Priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedek. This is revealed by God himselfe that Christ is the King of peace and righteousnesse, yet to prove this and to make it manifest to the misbeleeving Iewes, he borroweth a helpe of a logicall notation, saying, which is by interpre∣tation, the King of righteousnesse, the King of peace, Heb. 7.2. So Christ useth reason against the Sadduces: God is the God of Abraham, Isaack and Iacob, hence he infer∣ferreth this consequent, that they must live. But they say that Christ and Paul were immediatly directed by God, that they could not erre in their Midsts, and conclusions as we doe. If Pauls extraordinary calling had given him power to use reason, then they had spoken to the purpose, but
he useth reason as common to him and to all other men, whether Apostles or not Apostles. But they say,  that Christs authority and Pauls was greater than ours is. This wee grant,  they disputed against those who acknowledged not their authority, but yeelded onely to them, in respect of the force of the argu∣ments, is it not lawfull for us to doe the same against our adversaries? which Christ did against the Sadduces, and Paul against the Iewes. But whatsoever was pronounced by Christ against the Sadduces, or by Paul against the Iewes,  it became by and by holy Scripture, which we cannot say of our conclusions. Although arguments used by Christ and his Apo∣stles became by and by the Word of God,  yet it will not follow that we may not use these midsts brought forth by reason, although they become not Scripture; but then that would follow if wee brought forth these principles of reason, to make them the object of our saving faith. Whether were the Sadduces bound to beleeve this argument of Christs, as an article of their faith,  or not? By the force of this consequence as it were the worke of reason, they were not bound to beleeve it,  but as it was proved to them out of the Scriptures they were bound to beleeve it. Seeing humane midsts have no force to binde of themselves, why are they used in proofe against men? This is done for the infirmity of man, who is hard to beleeve,  and the Divine midsts will not serve to refute the naturall man.Simile. These who have good and per∣fect sight need no other midst to see by, but the light; but a man who is of a weake sight and purblind, useth
Spectacles as a helpe to his sight: so the perverse heri∣ticks make us to bring in these humane midsts, where∣as the midsts taken out of the Word of God should serve by themselves to convince. When Christ rose againe, Thomas doubted of the resurrection and thought that his body had beene but a Spirit, but Christ bea∣ring with his infirmity, by this humane midst proveth that hee is flesh, because hee may bee touched and felt. Observe againe that in Divinity some propositions are merely Divine, and some are mixtly Divine. These that are merely Divine, reason can doe little thing here, it can but joyne the tearmes together, but it cannot take up these great mysteries; example, if I were disputing against the Monothelites who denyed that there were two natures in Christ, and should reason thus; Where there are two natures, there are two wils; but in Christ there are two natures, therefore two wils. That in Christ there are two wils, this is a proposition merely Divine, rea∣son can never take up this, yet reason sheweth this much, where there are two natures there must bee two wills, and it judgeth onely of the connexion of these two, but it cannot judge of the verity of this, whe∣ther there be two wills in Christ or not. Yee will say then, what doth reason in the ve∣rity of these propositions which are merely Di∣vine? Reason in a regenerate man concludeth not that to be false which is above her reach, but onely admireth and resteth in this great mystery; and reformed reason enlightened by the Word of God, goeth this farre on, that she beleeveth these things to be possible with God which shee cannot comprehend; but reason in a corrupt man will scorne and mocke these things which shee cannot comprehend, as the Stoicke called
Paul a babler, Act. 17.18, when hee disputed against them for the resurrection, and called it a new do∣ctrine. In these propositions againe which are mixtly Di∣vine, reason hath a further hand; example, No naturall body can be in moe places at once, Christs body is a naturall body, therefore it cannot be in moe places at once; this is mixtly Divine, for the properties of a na∣turall body sheweth us that it cannot be in moe pla∣ces at once, and the Scripture also, sheweth us that Christs body is a naturall body. But is not this a mixture of Divinity and humane reason together, when wee borrow a midst out of the Scriptures, and then confirme the selfe same thing by reason? This maketh not a mixture of Divinity and philoso∣phie, but maketh onely philosophie to serve Divini∣ty. When we use reason to helpe our weaknesse, we doe not ground our faith upon reason or upon the light of nature, but upon that supernaturall light; and the light of nature commeth in,Simile. but as in the second roome to confirme our weaknesse: and as we ascribe not the price of the Ring, or the worthinesse of it to the Ham∣mer which beateth it out, but to the Gold it selfe, so our faith is not grounded upon humane reason or the light of nature, but upon the Word of God it selfe. How can reason serve in Divinity seeing the naturall man perceiveth not the things of God;  and the greater Philosophers, the greater enemies of grace? Wee must distinguish inter concretum & abstractum betwixt philosophie and the Philosopher: many of the Philosophers oppugned the mysteries of Divinity by their corrupt and naturall reason: but true philosophie
impugneth it not, and the greater light extinguisheth not the lesser, and verity doth not contradict it selfe; and truth in philosophie, is but the footestep of that truth which is in God by way of excellency. Conclusi.The conclusion of this is, contra rationem nemo sobri∣us dicit, contra scripturam nemo christianus, & contra ec∣clesiam nemo pacificus: we must learne then to give eve∣ry one of these their owne place and not to reject rea∣son altogether from Divinity, but to captivate her and make her a handmaid to Divinity. EXERCITAT. III That the end of Divinity here consisteth rather in practise than in contemplation. Luke. 11.28. Blessed are they that heare the Word of God, and keepe it. THe end of our Divinity here consisteth in doing rather than contemplation. If we speake properly, doing is not in the understanding but in the will; when reason divideth,The understanding is speculative, and setteth the will on worke. compoundeth, or frameth any propo∣sition within it selfe, then the understanding is not sayd properly to doe, but contenting it selfe within it selfe, then it is speculative: but when the understanding set∣teth the will on worke, then the will doth, & the under∣standing but directeth the will; and when the understan∣ding reasoneth within it selfe,Actus elicitus. imperatus. they call this actus elicitus; but when the understanding setteth the will on worke, they call this actus imperatus. A proposition in Divi∣nity commandeth pra∣ctise, virtually or for∣mally.A proposition in Divinity commandeth us eyther virtually to practise, or else formally. Virtually it com∣mandeth us to practise; example, This is life eternall, to know thee to be the onely true God, and whom thou hast sent,
Christ, Ioh. 17.3.11. This is a proposition which vir∣tually includeth in it practise; for as the Hebrewes say, verba notitiae includunt verba affectus, Words of know∣ledge include words of affection: if it be life eternall for us to know God, then it is life eternall also for us to love God. This proposition againe in Divinity, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soule, and with all thy mind, Matth. 22.37. and thy neighbour as thy selfe, vers. 39. commandeth practise formal∣ly. Secondly a proposition in Divinity urgeth practise eyther mediatly or immediately: mediatly,A proposition in Divi∣nity, commandeth pra∣ctise, mediately or immediately. as God is summum bonum the chiefe good; out of this mediate proposition we gather an immediate, therefore we are to love him above all things. Thirdly, these conclusions in Divinity which con∣clude for practise,If the conclusions be practicke, the propositi∣ons must be practicke. the propositions out of which they are drawne, must also be for practise and not for con∣templation, nam nihil agit extra genus suum, as they say in the Schooles; as we cannot gather grapes of thornes, or figgs of thistels, Matth. 7.16. So new wine cannot be the cause why the Apostles spake with divers tongues, Act. 2. So we cannot gather conclusions of practise from speculative propositions. Fourthly, these rules which serve to direct men to practise may be called rules of practise, as the Carpen∣ters line in his hand is a line of practise,The word of God is a line and rule of practise. because it lea∣deth him to practise. So the Word of God is the line by the which wee should walke, therefore it is a rule of practise, Gal. 6.6. As many as walke according to this rule, peace be unto them:  is to worke by rule or line,. the Word is the rule of our working, therefore it tea∣cheth us practise. But it may be said,  that contemplation is the end of
Divinity in heaven to see God face to face, therefore is the end of our Divinity here upon earth. Contemplation in heaven leadeth us alwayes to pra∣ctise, and they can never be separate; for as below here those Sciences which we call inspectrices, as the mathe∣maticks, physicke, and such (whose end consisteth not in doing) are the parents of morall philosophie and of doing, for by these we take up the nature of things, the goodnesse and the truth of them, and then we begin to esteeme of them, and love them when wee know them; so that contemplation bringeth forth alwayes practise. The glorified Saints in heaven, comming nea∣rer to the first cause, esteeme more highly of him, and therefore they love him more sincerely, and returne all praise to him. But it may seeme that contemplation is more excel∣lent than practise; for Mary is preferred unto Martha, Mary for her contemplation to Martha for her acti∣on. When Mary and Martha are compared together, they resemble not the contemplative and the active life, but the naturall and spirituall life; Mary careth for the spirituall life, and Martha for the naturall. Did not Mary care for practise as well as Martha? sate shee not at Christs feete that shee might learne practise, that she might wash them with her teares and wipe them with her haire? And because practise is, joyned alwayes with know∣ledge, therefore the wisedome which is proper to the understanding is ascribed sometimes to the will, Iob. 28.28. to depart from evill is understanding: and there∣fore it is, that justice and judgement are joyned toge∣ther in the Scripture, and they are called fooles who doe not according to their knowledge. And Salomon saith Eccle. 10.2. The heart of a wise man is at his right
hand, because his heart teacheth his hand to put things in practise. The end of our Divinity is more in practise than in contemplation; therefore these onagri or wilde asses, the Heremites who lived without all society of men, for∣get the cheife end wherefore they were let here, living rather like beasts than like men: and if wee shall take a view of the ecclesiasticall history, as out of Theodoret and Zozomen, wee shall see how unprofitablie these men have spent their time, leaving the congregation of the Saints of God. Theodoret writeth of one Mace∣donius qui  & gubba dictus est;Cap. 13. de historia reli∣giosa.  gubba in the Syri∣acke tongue is a Ditch, he was called gubba because he stoode in a Ditch all his time, and he was called , because he eate nothing but Barley pulse: See how unprofitablie this man spent his time, not giving himselfe to reading of the holy Scriptures, for he was altogether ignorant of them; for when Flavianus the Bishop sent for him that hee might make him a Mini∣ster, he was so ignorant of that which the Bishop had done unto him when he ordained him Minister, that being required the next Sabbath day to come againe to the Church, answered him who came for him, that he was affraid to be made Minister the next Sabbath day also, and so refused to come; see how this holy man spent his life for forty yeares in contemplatin and what great progresse he made in Christian Religi∣on.From  a pillar. So Theodoret maketh mention of one Styllites who stoode under a pillar all his life time, and never came in∣to a house. So Zozomen in his ecclesiasticall history,Lib. 6.29. writeth of one Pior, who going out of his fathers house into a desert, vowed solemnely that he should never see any of his kinsmen or friends againe, and living fifty yeares there he had a sister who longed to see him be∣fore shee dyed: the Bishop pitying the poore woman,
granted leave to Pior to come and visit her, and he re∣turning into his countrey, & standing before the doore called out his sister, and shutting his eyes, he said unto her, behold, I am your brother Pior, looke upon mee as much as you please; but shee entreating him earnest∣ly to come to her house, he altogether refusing went backe againe to the Wildernesse: and so wee reade in Theodoret of one Adynus;In Sacra hist. lib. 14. 8. who lived ninety yeares in the Wildernesse and never spake to any man, as if he had beene possessed with a dumb Divell: this is that holy contemplative life which the Church of Rome com∣mendeth so much, but this is pure Religion, to visite the fatherlesse and widdow in their necessity, Iam. 1.27. These Heremites living this contemplative life were like Poly∣phemus having but one eye in his head, and looking e∣ver up but never downe. The opinion of the Schoolemen in this point.The Schoolemen differ but little in this poynt, how Divinity teacheth us practise. Thomas and his follow∣ers say, that fides non est recta ratio agendi, sed recta ratio sentiendi; and therefore Contra gentiles hee compareth faith to hearing rather than to sight, but he addeth that practise followeth faith as the fruit of it: but Scotus maketh faith to be habitus practicus. Yee see how both of them insist in this, that Divinity consisteth in pra∣ctise. The end of the Sadduces and Pharises Divinity.The Lord Num. 15.38.39. commanded the Israelites to make fringes upon the borders of their garments, that they might remember the Commandements of the Lord and keepe them; the Sadduces gave them∣selves onely to looke upon the fringes, and if they had onely remembred the Law, they thought then they had discharged their duties; but the end of the Pharises was to remember their owne traditions.The end of the Monks and Iesuites Divinity. So the end of the Monkes Divinity now is onely idle contemplation with the Sadduces; and the end of the Iesuites Divinity
now is onely to practise mischeefe: and many Christi∣ans when they reade the Scriptures now, they reade them not for practise, but for to passe the time with; they are like little children who seeke Nuts to play, but not to breake them and eate the kernels. The conclusion of this is, Iam. 1.22.Conclusi. Be yee doers of the word, and not hearers onely, deceiving your selves. EXERCITAT. IIII. Of Adams knowledge before his fall. Gen. 2.19. Whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name of it. FIrst, consider in Adams knowledge, the manner how he got this knowledge, and secondly the measure of his knowledge. His knowledge was inbred knowledge and not ac∣quired; for as soone as he did behold the creatures,Of the manner how Adam got his know∣ledge. ne∣ver having seene them before, he gave them all names according to their nature. This knowledge being in∣bred it could not be acquired also; nam duplex ejus∣dem scientiae in vno subjecto, non datur causa, there cannot be two causes given of one, & the selfe same knowledge in one subject, although one and the selfe same know∣ledge cannot be said both to be acquired and inbred,Adams inbred know∣ledge, and our acquired knowledge, are not di∣verse sorts of know∣ledge. yet Adam might have had experimentall knowledge, afterward of his inbred knowledge: His inbred know∣ledge and our acquired knowledge, are not divers sorts of knowledge, for as the sight restored to the blind al∣though it was miraculous, yet when he saw, it was one sort of sight with our sight: so these inbred habites and acquired habites, are but one sort of habits; but
these inbred habits in Adam, and infused habits, were more excellent than acquired habits; for these things which God doth, are such that nature cannot produce the like, or so perfect: as that wine which Christ made miraculously at the marriage of Cana in Galilee,Things done miracu∣lously, are more excel∣lent than nature can produce them. Iob. 2. was more excellent wine than other naturall wine: so when Christ cured the blind, their sight was more per∣fect than our naturall sight; so when he made the lame to goe Act. 3.16. So the habites of inbred knowledge in Adam, were more perfect than any other sinfull man could ever attaine unto, after him. Of the measure of Adams knowledge.The creatures are lesse than the knowledge of God; they were equall with the knowledge of Adam before his fall, but they exceed our knowledge now. When the eye looketh upon the white colour,Simile. it scattereth the sight, and the white colour exceedeth it; but when it looketh upon the greene colour, exaequat visum, and it is a proportionable object for the eye: but when it looketh upon a taunie colour, it is lesse than the sight. So the creatures are lesse than Gods sight; they were equall with Adams sight before his fall, like the greene colour, and they exceed our sight since the fall, as the white colour doth exceede our sight; and because the heart since the fall is not so capable and so large to com∣prehend the knowledge of these creatures as it was be∣fore the fal, therefore it is said, 1 King. 4.29. that the Lord gave Salomon a wise heart as the sand of the Sea shoare, that is, to know an innumerable kind of things like the sand of the sea.Simile. When a man is to infuse liquor into a narrow mouthed vessell, that none if it runne by, hee enlargeth the mouth of the vessell: So did the Lord enlarge the heart of Salomon that hee might conceive this heavenly wisedome, and the knowledge of all things; but the minde of Adam before his fall nee∣ded not this extention to receive these gifts.
Secondly, the great measure of this knowledge which Adam had before his fall, may be taken up this wayes. The Hebrewes write that there were foure gates by the which Adam entred to see the Lord: Por¦ta creaturarū visibiliū Por¦ta intelligentiarum. Por¦ta majestatis. Por¦ta gloriae. the first was the gate of the visible creatures, the second was by the gate of the Angels, the third was by the gate of majestie, and the fourth was by the gate of glory; and they say that Adam entred three of these gates, but the fourth was shut that hee entred not in at it in this life. The first gate was opened unto him, for in the crea∣tures below, here he saw the majesty and glory of God. The Scriptures when they express any great thing, est epitheton omnis rei admirandae & magnae.  they joyne the name of God with it, as Ezek. 13.9. great haile is called Gods haile or sent by God, el gabbish. So 1 Sam. 26. cecidit sopor domini super eos, that is, a great sleepe fell upon them. So a strong Lyon is called ariel, the Lyon of God, 2 Sam. 23.10. So Moyses is said to be faire to God, that is, very faire, Act. 7.20. So Ni∣nive was great to God, that is, very great. The beau∣ty and greatnesse in the creatures led Adam to take up how great the Lord was. Iacob when he saw Esau re∣conciled unto him, sayd, I have seene thy face, as though I had seene the face of God, Gen. 33.10. This glimpse of goodnesse in the face of Esau, made Iacob take up, how good God was unto him. The second gate was porta intelligentiarum, the know∣ledge of the Angels, they resembled God more than any visible creature doth, therefore they are called Gods Sonnes, Iob. 1. Chapt. and 38. Chapter, 7. verse, and they see his face continually. Mathew 18. verse 10. As the Kings courtiours are sayd to see his face con∣tinually, 2 King. 25.25. and the Angels conversing with him, made him to come nearer to the knowledge of God.
The third gate was porta Majestatis, he saw the ma∣jesty of God more clearely than any other did. Moyses is sayd to see the face of God, and yet it was but the sight of his backe parts, compared with Adams; and we see him but through a grate, Cant. 2.11. Heb. 11.26. The fourth gate was porta gloriae. That gate was reserved to bee opened for him in the hea∣vens. Let us compare the most excellent men with Adam, and see which of them came nearest unto him; in some things Moyses came nearest to him, in somes things Sa∣lomon came nearest unto him, and in some things Daniel, in some things Ioseph, but Christ the second Adam excel∣led them in all. A comparison betwixt Moses and Adam.In the knowledge and sight of God and his attributes, Moyses came nearest to him Exod. 33.13. Teach mee thy wayes, that is, thy attributes. So Psal. 103.7. He made knowne to Moyses his wayes, that is, his attributes, for hee subjoyneth, the Lord is mercifull and gracious, slow to an∣ger, and full of compassion, and he chideth not for ever; here his wayes are his attributes, Moyses came nearest to Adam in this knowledge. A comparison betwixt Salomon and Adam.Salomon in the knowledge of the politickes came nea∣rer to Adams knowledge than Moyses did; Moyses sate all the day long to judge the people, Exod. 18. and hee stoode in need of Iethro's counsell to make choyse of helpers; but Salomon could have found out all these things by himselfe without the helpe of another. Salo∣mon begged wisedome of God, and it was granted unto him, he desired wisedome to be his , to be pre∣sident of his counsell, and to be his assister or , & to be his , to rule happily, Wisedom. 9.4. Sa∣lomon came nearest to the knowledge of Adam in the Politickes, and he is preferred to the wisest within the Church, as to Heman and Dedan, 1 King. 4.3. and
to the wisest without the Church, as to the Egypti∣ans. As he came nearest to Adams knowledge in the Po∣litickes, so likewise in the knowledge of naturall things,Salomon came neerest to Adams knowledge in the Politicks. for as he wrote from the Cedar of Lebanus to the Hyssope that grew out of the Wall, 2 King. 4.33. that is, as Iosephus explaineth it; he wrote parables and similitudes taken from every one of these kinds: and Tertullian saith well, Familiare est sacris scriptoribus ut sublimiores veritates ex∣plicent per sensibilia; nam idem qui est author naturae, est author gratiae: It is an usuall thing to the holy writers to illustrate heavenly things by earthly comparisons, for he that is the God of nature is also the God of grace. Salomon wrote from the tall Cedar to the small Hyssope that groweth out of the wall, that is, from the greatest to the smallest, then he passeth by none of them:The Hebrews marke the two extreames and leave the midst for brevity. for it is the manner of the Hebrews to marke the two extreames, and to leave the midst for brevi∣ties cause, as Num. 6, 4, from the kernell to the huske, here the Scripture omitteth the wine which is the midst betwixt the kernell and the huske. Another example, Exod. 11.5. And all the first borne of the land of Egypt shall dye, from the first borne of Pharoah that sitteth upon the throne, unto the first borne of the maidservant that sitteth behind the Mill. The Scripture omitteth the midst here, the rest of the people for shortnesse, and expresseth one∣ly the two extreames, the highest and the lowest. A third example, Iob 24.20. The wombe shall forget him, and the wormes shall feede sweetly upon him, the birth, and the grave, the two extreames include the whole life. So Psal. 121.8. The Lord shall keepe thy going in, and going out, that is, all thy wayes: So Salomon writing of the two extreames, the tallest and the least, includeth all the rest. Now if Salomon had such knowledge of these na∣turall things, much more had Adam.
Adam gave fit names to the creatures, know∣ing their qualities and nature.Adam had such knowledge of the creatures that he gave them fit names in the Hebrew expressing their na∣tures, he was a good nomenclator to give every thing the right name. Plato in Cratillo sheweth that he who giveth the right name to a thing, must know the nature of it very well; but since the fall men impose wrong names to things, as they call light darknesse, and dark∣nesse light. To what things Adam gave names and to what he gave no names.When hee gave names to the creatures, hee gave not names to these creatures in particular that had not principium individuationis in se, and which differed not something in subsistence from others, as all hearbes of the same kind, and trees and stones of the same kind; he gave not a name to every one of them in particular, but gave one name to them all of the same kind: but these who differed not in essence but in the manner of their subsisting, to these he gave diverse names, as hee called himselfe Adam and his wife Eve.Adam gave names to many things which are not found now in the Scripture. And wee are to observe that there are many names which Adam gave to the creatures in the first imposition, which are not found in the Scriptures now: the Elephant the greatest beast upon the earth, yet it hath no proper name given to it, dens eboris compositum ex  dens &  ebur. in the Scripture it is called Behemoth, Iob 40.15. and the teeth of the Elephant are called Shenhab∣bim, the teeth of Ivorie, but not the teeth of the Ele∣phant; and usually the Scripture expresseth onely the word teeth, as 1 King. 10.18. he made a Throne of teeth, but not of the teeth of the Elephant, because the Ele∣phant was not so knowne to the Iewes; cornua dentis. Ezek. 27. therefore the Scripture doth onely circumscribe this beast and the hornes of it; but Adam gave the greatest beast a pro∣per name when he imposed names to the beasts. Adam gave proper namer to the creatures.When Adam imposed names to the beasts, he im∣posed proper names to them, not circumscribing them as the Scripture doth now for our capacity; example,
Shemamith with the hands of it takes hold on kings houses, Seemeth to be Simia, and Solomon sent for such, 1 King. 10.22. . because this word is a hard word to be understood, and may signifie eyther a Spyder weaving with her hands; or else  a Monkie with a long tayle (for kings are delighted in their palaces with such when they see them hung by the hands) because wee cannot take up the nature of this beast by the name alone, therefore the Scriptures by the effects and properties of it, de∣scribeth it more at large for our capacity; but Adam at the first imposed the simple name.Names which Adam gave were perfect names. These names which Adam gave to the beasts at the first were most perfect names, therefore yee shall see other languages to keepe some footesteppe still of the first imposition, as 1 King. 10.22. Tukkijm are called Peacoks, the Talmud calleth it Tabhas, the Arabick cal∣led it Taus, and the Latine Pavo. David came nearest to Adam in prudencie,A comparison betwixt David and Adam. for al∣though he was not so wise as Salomon, yet erat prudentior Salomone he was more prudent than Salomon; therefore the woman of Tekoah sayd to him, Thou art wise as an Angell of God, 2 Sam. 14.20. The Lord asked the king of Tyrus if he could march Daniel in wisedome, Ezek. 28.3.A comparison betwixt Adam and Daniel. Behold thou art wiser than Daniel, there is no secret that they can hide from thee. Daniel exceeded all the Chaldeans in wisedome, and the Chaldeans exceeded the Tyrians, therefore Daniel farre exceeded all the Tyrians: but yet if we will compare Daniels wisedome with the wisedome of Salomon, it will come farre short; for Salomon exceeded all the children of the East in wisedome, and came nearest to Adams knowledge, no sort of wisedome was hid from Salo∣mon, Daniel onely exceeded in interpreting of secrets and heavenly visions. Ioseph came nearest to him in oeconomie, Psal. 105.22.A comparison betwixt Ioseph and Adam. he exceeded the Princes of Egypt in wisedome, & taught their senators.
A companion betwixt the first Adam, and the second Adam Christ.Iesus Christ the second Adam, the personall wise∣dome of God his Father, farre excelled Salomon; here is a greater than Salomon. Iesus Christ the second Adam as he excelled Salomon farre; so did he the first Adam in wisedome, Psal. 45.2. Thou art fairer than the Children of men, in the originall it is Iophjaphitha, which the Hebrews doubling, expresse the great beauty that was in him; and sometimes it is put in two words, as Ier. 46. gnegla jephe pija, that is, very faire. Christ the second Adam in out∣ward beauty exceeded not, Non erat decor in facie ejus, He had no forme nor comelinesse: and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him. Esay. 53.2. but in inward wisedome and grace he was fairer than the Sonnes of men, and excelled the first Adam. The conclusion of this is, Adam having such measure of knowledge before his fall, what great presumption was it in him to presume above that which was revealed unto him. Let us be content not to be wise above that which is written, 1 Cor. 4.6. and let us remember that saying of Augustine, Multi propter arborem scientiae amit∣tunt arborem vitae. EXERCITAT. V. How the Law is said to be written in the heart of man after the fall. Rom 2.15. Which shew the worke of the Law writ∣ten in the hearts. FIrst, let us enquire how these first Principles which are called primo-prima, are made up in the hearts of man. Secondly, how these secundo-prima principia are
deduced out of these. And thirdly, how these principia make up this which wee call Conscience: and lastly, we shall shew that man by this naturall knowledge ingraft in his heart, cannot come to the true and saving know∣ledge of God. These first Principles are made up after this manner: The Lord hath put two faculties into the Soule, one which we call speculative in the understanding, and another which we call a practik facultie in the will, to prosecute these things which the understanding sheweth to her. God hath placed first the speculative in the un∣derstanding, that it might follow that eternall reason that is in Gods Law; for as it is the perfection of Art to imitate nature, so it is the perfection of nature to imitate this eternall reason, which is Gods Law; Then he hath placed the will into the soule of man to prosecute those things, which the understanding the speculative facultie sheweth unto it. There are some primo-prima principia,Some principles in the speculative, and some in the practicke faculty. in the specu∣lative faculty, and some in the practick facultie; this is a principle in the speculative facultie; Omne totum est majus sua parte, and this is the first principle in the pra∣ctike faculty, the will, Matth. 7.12. Whatsoever yee would that men should doe to you, doe yee even so to them. These primo-prima principia are not naturally knowne quoad actum perfectum,How the first principles are knowne. but they are in potentia propin∣qua, that is, they may be most easily knowne; for that which is actually perfect in the first degree, is alwayes knowne, and as soone as the creature existeth, so soone they are knowne; as the knowledge of an Angel is not potentiall but ever actuall: but these first principles are made up without any reasoning discourse or foraigne helpe. And as it is naturall for a stone to move downe∣ward, although it be not alwayes moving downeward, yet because it hath that weight within it selfe, and nee∣deth
no other helpe to make it move downeward, as it needeth of a foraigne helpe to cause it to ascend; there∣fore this motion is said to be naturall to it.How the first principles are naturall to the mind. So because the mind can make up these principles without any dis∣course; therefore they are sayd to be naturall to it: but when we make up a conclusion in a syllogisme, the knowledge of this conclusion is not so easily knowne to me: but we must borrow some midsts, which are more knowne to us, to make up this conclusion. These first principles are naturally knowne, but the conclu∣sion in the syllogisme is ratíonaliter knowne onely, by way of discourse.First principles are naturally knowne, but the conclusions are knowne by discourse. These first principles the Divines call rationes eternas, dignitates, immobiiia principia, and the Greekes call them . If the judgement be sound and well disposed, then it agreeth to those first principles; but if it be corrupt it declineth them. It is not necessary that all agree in these first principles, for although some be found who deny them, yet they stand as principles to those who are of sound judge∣ments; children and mad men understand not these first principles, yet those who are of sound judgement, doe acknowledge them. The first principles are not actually, but poten∣tially written in the minde.These first principles are not actually written in the heart of man, but potentially: the mind of man is not like a seminarie, which containeth in it diverse sorts of seedes: neyther is it like the Flintstone which hath the fire lurking within the veynes of it, and being struc∣ken upon the steele, casteth out the sparkels of fire which lurked in the veynes of it before: but it is like unto the eye, which being inlightened by the Sunne, hath that naturall facultie in it to discerne colours: So the mind frameth these principles when the objects are laid before it. A difference betweene the first inbred princi∣ples, and the second in∣bred principles.And out of these primo-prima principia, the minde frameth, and maketh up secundo-prima principia: the
difference betwixt these primo-prima principia, and se∣cundo-prima is this: these primo-prima principia, first inbred principles are contained in the conclusions; but these secundo-prima principia, these second inbred principles, are as conclusions contained in the princi∣ples: now to cleare this by example; this is a first in∣bred principle in the mind; whatsoever yee would that men should doe to you, doe yee even so to them: this is a se∣cond imbred principle drawne from the first, yee shall not murther; this conclusion drawne from the first principle, containeth in it this first principle, whatsoever yee would men, &c. So that any man may inferre thus; I may not kill my neighbour, because I will that no man should kill me; here this principle is contained in the conclusion. There are other conclusions drawne from these secundo-prima principia,Difference betweene the conclusions drawne from the first principles, and the conclusions drawne from the second inbred principles. which may be cal∣led tertiae conclusiones, and these are not so easily made up as the first; here the conclusions are contained in the principles, and not the principles in the conclusions as before; example, honour thy father, and thy mother; this is a second principle; and this; thou shalt rise up be∣fore the hoare head, Livit. 19.23. is a conclusion of the third sort: for this followeth not so clearely as the former conclusion, Yee shall rise up before the hoare head; therefore yee shall honour your father and your mother: but rather this wayes, yee shall honour your father and your mother; therefore yee shall rise up before the hoare head: heare the conclusion is contained in the principle and not contra. This law written in the heart of man,Conscience, what. maketh up this which we call conscience, which is an inbred light in the mind of man, teaching him to follow that which is good, and to eschew that which is evill: and it is called conscientia, quasi concludens scientia; and it hath a two∣fold Act; the first is to give testimony to things,A twofold act of the conscience. whe∣ther
we have done them well or ill; if wee have done them well, then it giveth testimony for us, Rom. 9.1. my conscience also bearing me witnesse; and if we have done evill,Greg. Nazain. then it testifieth against us. Gregory Nazianzen used to call the conscience paedagogum animae; for as a Pedagogue waiteth upon a child, and commendeth him when he doth well, and whippeth him when he doth evill; so the conscience when a man sinneth, it stingeth him like Hornets, Deut. 7.20. but when hee doth well, it alloweth him: and that which wee call conscience, the Syriack calleth it Tira, Conscientiaa  formavit, pin∣xit. Rom. 2.15. Which signifieth a paynted thing, for the conscience now is like a table, in which sundry things are paynted; and this sort of writing in the consciences, hath not beene unfitly com∣pared to that writing, which we write with the juice of an Onion;Simile. here the letters at the first are not legi∣ble, but hold the paper to the fire, and that maketh the letters legible: So these evill deeds, which sinke first into the conscience, and are not legible, yet when the conscience is put to the fire of Gods wrath, then they begin to appeare legible, and then the Lord set∣teth their sinnes in order before them, Psal. 50.21. The se∣cond act of the conscience is to binde or loose; for even as a man, when he is bound hand and foote, he can∣not stirre out of the place; so the light which is in the conscience, bindeth the will of man, so to doe a thing; that he cannot doe any other thing unlesse he sinne a∣gainst it. Rom. 14.23. Whatsoever is not of faith is sinne, that is, whatsoever he doth against his conscience, in that, he sinneth. Conscientia recta. Conscientia erronea. Conscientia dubia. Conscientia probabilis. Conscientia scrupulosa. This conscience is eyther a good conscience, a bad conscience; a doubting conscience, a probable consci∣ence, or a scrupulous conscience. A good conscience is that, which is well informed, and concludeth rightly.
A bad conscience is that, which is wrongly informed, and concludeth falsly. A doubtfull conscience is that, which neyther doth assent nor dissent, and therefore concludeth nothing. A probable conscience is that, which concludeth as it thinketh, upon probable and good reasons. And a scrupulous conscience is that, which conclu∣deth, but with some feare or doubting, which troubleth the minde. Let us take but this one example for all in the case of eating of meate:A difference betweene these sorts of conscience. The good conscience saith, To the pure all things are pure, and therefore I may eate of this meate: the bad conscience of the Iew saith, Touch not, taste not, handle not; therefore I will eate none of this, because it is uncleane. The doubt∣full conscience doubteth whether hee may eate of it, Rom. 14.23. but doth not fully conclude with the Iew, that he may not eate of it. The probable conscience is this, which upon probable grounds, concludeth to eate of it. In Corinth some doubted whether they might eate of flesh sold in the Shambles, 1 Cor. 10. because perhaps they might light upon that in the Market, whereof the other part was sacrificed to Idols; but the probable conscience concludeth to eate of it, be∣cause in the Shambles it hath no relation to the Idoll, and it knoweth, by all probability, that the rest of it was not sacrificed to Idols, but that the Priest got the rest for his portion; he seeth others who are men of a good conscience, eate of such; and upon these probable grounds he eateth of it. The scrupulous conscience is this which inclineth to eate, but with feare and greefe to his minde, when he eateth it. The light in the conscience since the fall maketh not up this good conscience,The light of nature since the fall maketh not up a good conscience. but it maketh this ill consci∣ence, and it troubleth the scrupulous conscience, and this doubtfull conscience.
When the bad consci∣ence excuseth or accu∣seth falsely.This bad conscience it excuseth or accuseth: it ex∣cuseth an unregenerat man falsly, when he heareth the curses of the Law, and blesseth himselfe in the meanetime, Deut. 29.19. Ioh. 16.2. Secondly, it ex∣cuseth him falsely, when he assenteth to the principles in generall; but when he commeth to the particular ap∣plication; he concludeth not rightly. When the Hus∣bandmen killed the Lord of the Vineyard, Christ asked of the Iewes, what should become of these Husband∣men? Matth. 21.41. they answered, he will destroy these wicked men: but Luk. 20.16. when they consider this, that the matter touched them more nearely, then they sayd God forebid. The thing which they assented to in the generall, they shune it in particular, as if they should say, we are no such men, and wee hope that God will not so deale with us. So when it accuseth for the breach of any superstitious ceremonie, as it did the superstitious Philistims; if they did but tread upon the Threshold of the Doore, where Dagon breake his necke, 1 Sam. 4.5. So a bad conscience accuseth a man truly sometimes, as Eccles. 7.22. for oftentimes also, thine owne heart knoweth that thou thy selfe hast cursed o∣thers. The conscience is Gods herauld.The conscience bindeth as the Lords deputie; the conscience may be compared to the Kings Herauld. The Herauld intimateth to the Subjects the Kings lawes; When they are intimated, the Subjects are bound to obedience: but if the Herauld should make intimation, of that which were not the Kings Law, un∣to the Subjects; yet they are to give obedience to it, untill they know the contrary: so a man is bound to obey his conscience, that is, to doe nothing con∣trary to it, although it intimate a falsehood unto him. How can an evill conscience binde a man to that
which is evill; it being Gods Deputie, and God can binde no man to doe evill? It bindeth him not simply to doe the evill,  but it bin∣deth him to doe nothing against it: God cannot bind a man so, but he simply bindeth him alwayes, to doe right because he cannot erre; judging that to be done which is not to be done, as the conscience doth. When a good conscience doth bind a man,  and when an evill conscience doth binde a man, what is the difference betweene these two sorts of binding? A good conscience bindeth a man for ever,  but a bad conscience bindeth not for ever, but onely so long as he taketh it to be a good conscience: he is bound to doe nothing against his conscience, albeit it be errone∣ous: but he is bound to search the truth, and then to lay aside this erroneous conscience. So out of these principles naturally bred in the heart,A difference betweene the law of nature and the lawes of nations. arise all these lawes which are written in the heart; and they differ from the lawes of nations, or municipall lawes of countries. Esay 24.5. saith, they have transgres∣sed the lawes, changed the ordinances and broken the ever∣lasting covenant: they have transgressed the Lawes, that is, the municipall Lawes of the common-wealth: they have changed the ordinances: that is, these things where∣in all nations agree; as not to doe wrong to strangers, to embassadours and such:A greater sinne to breake the law of na∣ture than the law of na∣tions. and then he commeth to the greatest of all; they have broken the everlasting cove∣nant; that is, the law of nature: it is lesse to breake a municipall law, than the law of nations; or it is lesse to transgresse the law of nations, than to violate the Law of nature; for this Law is that: light which lightneth eve∣ry man, that commeth into the world, Ioh. 1.9. A man by this naturall knowledge,Naturall light cannot bring a man to the knowledge of his owne salvation. cannot be brought to the knowledge of his salvattion; therefore the Law must be written anew againe in his heart. It is a strange
position of Clemens Alexandrinus, who holdeth that there was alia justitia secundùm legem naturae, alia secun∣dùm legem Mosis,Strom. cap. 6. 7. et alia secundùm Christum; and hee calleth these two first , or degrees to leade to Christ; and as the Law led the Iewes to Christ, so did philosophy leade the Greekes; and hence he con∣cludeth, that the good men amongst the Heathen were saved, or at least had some steps to salvation. The conclusion of this is, seeing the conscience is so obscured, and corrupted through the fall, we must la∣bour to reduce it to the first estate againe. When a compasse is out of frame, we touch the needle of the compasse with a Loadstone, that the stone may draw it right to the pole againe: So the mind must be tou∣ched with the Loadstone of the Spirit of grace, that it may come backe againe to the Lord, as to the pole. EXERCITAT. VI. Of the seven Precepts given to Noah. Act. 15.20. We write unto them that they abstaine from things strangled, and from blood. BEfore the Law was written, the Hebrewes say, that the Lord gave to Noah seven Precepts, which were delivered of Noah by tradition to his posterity after him; these the Iewes call pirke abhoth, capitula patrum, the traditions of the fathers. The most ancient & first tradition that we reade of, was that, Gen. 32.32. because Iacob halted upon his thigh, therefore the children of Isra∣el eate not of the sinew which shranke, which is upon the hol∣low
of the thigh unto this day; So were these seven pre∣cepts delivered by tradition. The first was against strange worship or idolatry,1  2  3  4  5  6  7  that they should not worship false gods; and this they called gnabhuda zar, strange worship. The second they called it gnal birkath hashem, that is, they should blesse the name of God. The third was gnal shepukoth dam∣mim, that is, he was forbidden to shed innocent blood. The fourth was gnalui gniria, that is, he should not defile himselfe with filthy lusts. The fift was gnad hagazael, de rapina; that he should take nothing by violence or theft. The sixt was, gnal hadinim de judiciis. The se∣venth was, abhar min achai, ne menbrum de vivo; that he should not pull a member from a living creature, and eate of it. This precept they say, was given last to Noah, Gen. 9.4. but the flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof, shall yee not eate: that is,How this precept of Noah not to eate blood is to be understood. (as the Iewes interpret it) yee shall not pull a member from a living creature, & eate of it, as the wild beast doth; but to stay untill the beast be killed, and then eate the flesh thereof: neyther shall ye eate the blood while it is hot, as if it were yet in the body: this is cruelty, & against a morall precept; to eate hot blood while the life is in it;Where the reason of the Law is perpetuall, the Law is perpetuall. for where the reason of the Law is perpetuall, the Law must be perpetuall. The reason of the Law is; ye shall not eate blood because the life is in it; so long as the life is in it, yee must not eate it: and see how this sinne, Ezek. 33.35. is matched with other great sinnes. Yee eate with the blood, and lift up your eyes towards your Idols, and shed blood, and shall yee possesse the land? The morall trans∣gressions of the Law joyned with it here, sheweth that it is cruelty to eate hot blood. But Levit. 7.27. was the ceremoniall part of the Law: and the Apostles in the councill, Act. 15. forbiddeth them to eate any thing that was strangled; whereby they meant the ceremoniall part of the Law.
Whether are we to take these precepts as ceremo∣niall or as morrall? The most of these are morrall precepts, and the same which are set downe againe in the Law: For when the Apostles biddeth them abstaine from fornication, Act. 15.See Beza, Act. 15. It is the same that is forbidden in the fourth precept given to Noah, not revelare turpitudinem, and to interpret here, fornication, for eating of things sa∣crificed to Idols, seemeth to be a strained sense: for that is forbidden already by the first precept, to Noah. And to uncover the nakednesse according to the phrase of the Scripture, is meant of bodily pollution and not of spirituall fornication. Of eating of blood, see more in the appendix of Command. 6.Now besides these morrall precepts set downe by the councill, they interlace this ceremoniall precept de suffocato, forbidding to eate things strangled; and they give the reason wherefore the Gentiles should ab∣staine from these, Act. 15.21. For Moyses is read in their Synagogues every Sabbath,Why the Apostles for∣bid to eate blood or things strangled. as if Iames should say, they professe not onely the morrall Law, but also the cere∣moniall Law yet; therefore yee Gentiles shall doe well to abstaine, from these things which may give them offence. The Iewes respected these precepts most, because they were kept in the Church even from Noahs dayes. The Hebrewes adde further; that there was no other precept given untill Abrahams dayes; then God added the precept of circumcision, and afterwards taught them to separate tithes. God at the beginning taught his Church by tradition and not by write.The Lord taught his Church in her infancie this wayes by traditions, and not be write: and even as parents teach their children the first elements by word,Simile. and afterwards by write; so the Lord taught his Church first by word, and then by write. The conclusion of this is. The Lord never left his
Church without his word to direct her: before the fall, he spake immediatly to Adam and Eve, & taught them. In the second period, he taught them by these seven pre∣cepts. In the third period, by the Law written, and in the fourth period by the Gospel. EXERCITAT. VII. Of the diverse wayes how God revealed himselfe extraordinarily to his Church. Heb. 1.1. God who at sundry times, and in divers manners spake in times past unto the Fathers by the Prophets. GOd manifested himselfe to his Church;God revealed himselfe to his Church foure wayes. first by prophesie, secondly, by the holy Spirit, thirdly by Vrim and Thummim, and fourthly by the poole Bethes∣da. First by prophesie.Sundry sorts of pro∣phecie.  There were sundry sorts of pro∣phecie: the first was lepi face to face, to Moyses one∣ly. This sort of prophesie was the highest degree of re∣velation; and it drew nearest to that sort of vision, which we shall get of God in the heavens. He mani∣fested himselfe to Moyses face to face,How the Lord mani∣fested himselfe to Moses. and hee knew him by his name, that is, not onely by the face, as Prin∣ces know many of their Subjects; but he knew him inwardly, and liked him: this was notitia approbationis. Moyses saw God face to face, yet he saw not the es∣sence of God, for hee dwelleth in a light inaccessable.Iohn saw Christ . Iohn saw God three manner of wayes. First, in his incar∣nation, he saw God dwelling amongst men in the flesh
here. Secondly, in his transfiguration upon the Mount. Thirdly, in the Spirit upon the Lords day, Rev. 1.10. Although Iohn lay in the bosome of Christ and was his beloved Disciple, yet he saith, No man hath seene God at any time: the onely begotten Sonne, which is in the bosome of the Father he hath declared him. Ioh. 1.18. Differences betwixt the revelations made to Mo∣ses, and to the rest of the Prophets.When God spake to Moyses, he spake to his under∣derstanding immediatly. A man hath a right eare, and a left eare; the understanding is like the right eare and the phantasie is like the left eare: hee spake to Moyses right eare, to his understanding: but when he spake to the rest of the Prophets, by some shapes and visible formes; he spake first to their left eare. Moyses saw no visible shapes nor formes, except onely in the entry of his calling, when he saw the bush burning, Exod. 3.6. and the Angell comming to kill him in the Inne, Exod. 4.24. and when he saw the paterne of the Tabernacle in the Mount, Heb. 9. but usually God manifested him∣selfe to his understanding. Secondly, the other Prophets were astonished and weakned at the sight of God. Dan. 8.27. and I Daniel fainted and was sicke certaine dayes, and I was astonished at the visions. So Ezekiel fell upon his face when the Lord revealed himselfe unto him. Chap. 3.27. But Moy∣ses was never affrayd at the sight of God but thrice. First when he was to enter in his calling when he saw the bush burning. Exod. 3.2. Secondly, at the giving of the Law, Heb. 12.21. Thirdly, in the Inne. Thirdly, Moyses needed not such preparations before he prophesied, as some of the other Prophets did. Elisha before he prophesied, called for a Minstrell to settle his passions; that he might be the more fit to receive his prophesie. 2 King. 3.15. But Moyses needed not such a preperation. So Paul when he was ravished to the third heaven, this knowledge which he got, was in∣tellectuall,
and it was neyther by the sight, nor by the phantasie: and whether the soule was in the body here tanquam in organo, vel tanquam in sede onely,See Iunius de purgatorie. it may be doubted. The second sort of prophesie, was by vision; as when Moyses saw the bush burning, this was presented to him when he awas awake; this was the meanest sort of revelation, . The third sort was , Visio . Visio when something was presented to their phantasie in a dreame. These visions which he shew to the Prophets, some∣times they were of things which really existed; as Zacha∣rie saw Iosuah the high Priest, and Sathan standing at his right hand. Zach. 3. Sometimes of things that might be and was not: as Zacharie saw two women carrying an Ephath, Zach. 5.5. and sometimes of things that were not, nor never could be: as the monstrous beasts showne to Daniel, and to Iohn in the revelation. When the Lord revealed himselfe to the Prophets in these visions:The Lord appeared to his Prophets, sometimes immediately, and some∣times by an Angell. sometimes he spake mediatly to them by an Angel. As Exod. 3.2. God is sayd there to ap∣peare to Moses; but Act. 7.30. an Angel is sayd to ap∣peare in the burning bush. Sometimes againe in these apparitions, he immediatly appeared to the Prophets. Ioh. 12.40. Hee blinded their eyes, &c. these things hee sayd when hee saw his glorie, that is, when he saw Christs glory. When the Angels did appeare to the Prophets in these visions, they appeared in the shapes of men,The Angels ever appea∣red in the likenesse of men, but not in the like∣nesse of women or beasts but they never appeared in the likenesse of women, farre lesse in the likenesse of beasts, as the Divell doth: there∣fore Levit. 17.7. they shall no more offer their sacrifices un∣to Divels, in the Hebrew it is, leshegnirem, to the hoarie ones; because the Divell appeared in these shapes. When the Cherubims appeared they carie the face of a man,
the crest of a Lyon, the feete of the Oxe, and the wings of an Eagle; they had not foure faces (as some thinke) but in something they represented man, in someting the Lyon, in something the Oxe, and in something the Eagle: panim here should be translated, . When the Angels ap∣peared in the likenesse of man, they were more glorious than any man.When the Angels appeared to the Prophets, there was more glory in them, then in other men; although sometimes they concealed this glory for a while, as may be seene Gen. 18. comparing it with Heb. 13.2. When Paul saw an Angell standing by him in the like∣nesse of a man of Mecadonia; there was more glory in him, than in all the men of Mecadonia, Act. 6.9, Be∣cause the glory of an Angell did shine in him: and in this sense it is sayd, Act. 6.15. that they saw the face of Steven as it had beene the face of an Angell, that is, his face did shine above the face of mortall men, as when the Angels appeared in humane shape. But when the Lord appeared in the likenesse of a man, then his glo∣ry farre exceeded the glory of an Angell,When the Lord ap∣peared in the likenesse of man, he exceeded the glory of an Angel. Esa. 6.1. I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne. First, he was set upon a high throne. Secondly, his cloathes reached downe to the ground, which signifieth his glory: the hemme of his garment touched the ground, which signyfied the humanity of Christ: and the Seraphims covering their faces, because they could not behold the glory of God. And when the Lord appeared in these visions, he appeared in the likenesse of an old man: as Daniel saw the Ancient of dayes sitting upon a throne, Dan. 7.9. and Reve. 1.14. when the Sonne of God appeared, his haire was white as wooll, and white as Snow: but the Angels of the Lord appeared in the likenesse of young men, Mark. 16.5. and the Cherubims were made like young men. Which of the Prophets saw the most excellent vi∣sions.
Exekiel saw the most excellent visions.Ezekiels visions for the most part were of Christ: and the spiri∣tuall Temple. Answ. Esay saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, Esa. 6.1. but this was a visi∣on of judgement, to make fat the hearts of the people: but the visions of Ezekiel for the most part were of Christ and the building of the spirituall Temple. These visions were so high, that the Iewes forbad any to reade them ante annum sacerdotalem, that is, before they were thirty yeares of age. Whether were the revelations by visions,  or by dreams, or that which was intellectuall more perfect? Thomas answereth;  that the vision which was to the phantasie, was more agreeable to the nature of man, and to his estate here: But that which was immediatly to the understanding, commeth nearer to our estate in glory. It is generally to be observed here;The Prophets under∣stood these things which they phophecied. that in all these sorts of visions, and apparitions, they understood that which they prophesied: and therefore the Prophets were called videntes, Seers, Iob. 13.1. mine eyes hath seene all these things, mine eares hath heard them, and I understand them all. Pharoah did not understand these things which he saw; therefore he was not a Prophet: So Belthasser when he saw fingers writing upon the wall, he under- not that which he saw, and therefore he was not a Pro∣phet: and so Caiphas understood not what he prophe∣sied. Ioh. 11. They were like unto men who are purblind and see not a thing distinctly: and therefore desires o∣thers to tell them more distinctly what it is. The Iewes say of these, that they were  non , that is, they were stirred up by God, but they sought not the Lord. And of Balaam they say, prophetavit ex voluntate Dei, sed non cepit quod prophetavit. Daniel at the first un∣derstood not the prophesie, but the Angel revealed it unto him, Dan. 8.17. So the Lord appeared to them in Dreames as he did
before to them when they were awake, and sometimes these dreames were , dreames in which they saw some shapes and visions; as Iacob saw a ladder in his dreame: so Abraham in his dreame, saw the Car∣kases, and foules lighting upon them. Gen. 15.8. Da∣niel saw the foure monarchies, represented be foure vi∣sible shapes, Dan. 4. and sometimes he revealed him∣selfe sine symbolo, without any visible shape; as to Ioseph, Matt. 2. and to the wise men, Mat. 2.12. The Lord was onely author of these dreames, there∣fore. Gen. 37.7. when Ioseph is called bagnal chalamoth, it is not well translated Lord of dreames, for God him∣selfe is onely Lord of dreames. The Seventie translate it ,. infomniator, and it signifieth not simple a dreamer but him who dreameth often, therefore chalamoth is in the plurall number. If the Lord revea∣led himselfe in the forepart of the night as hee did to Abraham, then it was called Tardema, a dead sleepe, 1 Sam. 26. cecidit sopor domini super eos id est magnus. But if in the latter part of the night, then it was called cha∣lam, a dreame. To some hee revealed himselfe in a dreame, but he gave then not the interpretation of it, as to the Butler and Baker. Some had the interpretati∣on of the dreame, but not the dreame, as Ioseph. Nebu∣chodnezzer had the dreame, but Daniel the interpretati∣on of it, but the Prophets of God: had both the dreame and the interpretation of it, as Daniel. The heathen sometimes had both the dreame and the interpretation,The Prophets had the dreames with the inter∣pretations of them. as the Midianites had of the Barly cake. Iud. 7. but this was for their destruction: but the comfortable dreames and visions, with their interpretations; were onely revealed to the Prophets, for the good of the Church. Whether was the revelations by dreames, or by vi∣sions the more perfect revelation?
Intensive the revelation by vision was the more ex∣cellent, Revelatio intensiva. Revelatio extensiva. but extensive the revelation by dreames was the more excellent, and that by vision came nearest to that which was intellectuall, for they had no use of their senses in it, & the visions were presented to their under∣standing only. When we take up a thing by sense;Somethings are presen∣ted to the sense, some∣things to the phantasie, and some things to the understanding. first the sense transmiteth it to the phantasie, and then the phantasie sendeth it to the understanding; this is the most imperfect sort of knowledge. Secondly, when the vision is presented to the phantasie onely, and the phantasie sendeth it to the understanding, this is more perfect then the former. And thirdly, when the visi∣on is presented to the understanding onely, this is a higher degree. In the Knowledge which they got by dreames, first, they had the dreame, and when they were awake they got the understanding of it: but in a vision they pre∣sently understood the thing presented unto them. Be∣cause the revelation by vision was the more perfect sort of knowledge, therefore Ioel saith your young men shall see visions, and then he added, your old men shall dreame dreames, as the more imperfect sort of revelati∣on, Ioel. 2.28. It may be asked why God revealed himselfe this way by dreames? The reasons were these.The reasons why God revealed himselfe by dreames. First these things which we begin to thinke upon when we are awake we begin to try them by reason, and if reason approve them not then we reject them, but in a dreame the mind recei∣veththings not examining them by reason. In mat∣ters Divine the lesse that reason have a hand in admit∣ting of them the better it is, and here it was better for the Prophets to be ruled by God, and fitter for them to be schollers then judges. The second reason why he taught his Prophets by
dreames was this, to let them see how farre his power exceeded the power of man; for masters cannot teach schollers; but when they are awake and giving heed: but God can teach his Prophets in a deepe sleepe and in a dreame: which gave the Prophets to understand what great commandement, the Lord had over all the faculties of their mindes. Hee revealed himselfe in dreames to them, to let them understand, that death tooke not away all know∣ledge from man, and that there was another way to get knowledge, than by discourse or reason. How the Lord revealed himselfe to his Prophets by the holy Spirit.The third way, how the Lord revealed himselfe to his Prophets; was by ruah hakkodesh, by the holy spi∣rit: then the Prophets had all the use of their senses; hearing one speaking to them, as we doe every one ano∣ther, and seeing, &c. and the more use that they have of their senses,Drusius in Pen∣tateuchum. the more unperfect was their revelation. Others distinguish this sort of revelation which was by the holy Spirit, from that which was properly cal∣led prophecie: they say these who spake by the holy spirit, & were Prophets in that sense, they were not cal∣led to attend still as Prophets; such as was David a King; & Daniel a Courtiour: But Esay and Ieremy were Pro∣phets properly so called: because they waited still, and attended in the schoole of the Prophets. The fourth way, how God revealed himselfe, was by vrim & thummim, and they are alwayes joyned toge∣ther except in two places of the Scripture,What sort of revelation was by Vrim and Thummim. Exod. 17.21. and 1 Sam. 28.8. This was a different kind of revela∣tion from the former: for by this the Priest did not pro∣phesie, neyther made songues to the prayse of God: but having put on this breastplate, it was a signe to him that God would answer these doubts, which he asked of him, & it is called the Brestplate of judgement, mishpat signifieth, eyther the administration of publike judge∣ments,
Esa. 41.3. or private affaires, Pro. 13.23. est qui absumitur absqe judicio, that is: because his family is not rightly administrat. It is called then the breastplate of judgement: because the Lord taught his people in their doubtfull cases; what to doe,The breastplate and the Vrim and Thumim are distinguished. by this vrim and thummim. Exod. 28.30. Thou shalt put in the breastplate Vrim and Thummim. Some hold that the twelve pretious stones set in the brestplate, were called vrim and thummim: as Kimchi; but the Text maketh against that: for the breastplate, and the vrim and the thummim are distin∣guished vers. 30. Some of the Iewes againe incline most to this sense; that these two words vrim and Thummim were set in the breastplate as holinesse to the Lord was written in great letters upon a plate of Gold,What this Vrim and Thummim were. and set in the forehead of the highpriest. But it see∣meth rather that they were two pretious stones given by the Lord himselfe, to be set in the brestplate: and an Ancient Iew called Rabbi Bechai marketh,ה demonstrativum. that these two are set downe cum he demonstrativo for their excel∣lencie. Neyther saith the Lord thou shalt make vrim and thummim as hee sayd of the rest of the orna∣ments of the Highpriests, thou shalt make this or that.The letters did not make up the answer. It is commonly holden that the letters did shine out of the breastplate of Aaron, when the Lord gave his answers to him, that he might read the answer by the letters: but this could not be, as may appeare by the forme of the brestplate following.
The forme of the Breast-plate. When David asked of the Lord, 1 Sam. 23.12. will the men of Keila deliver me and my men into the hands of Saul? the Lord sayd ysgiru, they will deliver thee: here the letters in the brestplate would have made up this whole answer; Iod from Iehuda, Samech from Ioseph, Gimel from Gad, Iod from Levi, Resh from Reuben, and Vau from Reuben, but Iudges 20.8. when the Israelites
asked counsell of the Lord, who shall goe up first to battell against Benjaman? it was answered, Iehuda Batte∣chilla, Iuda shall goe up first, now there was not so ma∣ny letters in the brestplate to expresse this answer, for there wanted foure letters of the Alphabet in the brest∣plate . 2 Sam. 5.23.There wanted foure letters in the Breast∣plate. when David enquired of the Lord, shall I goe up against the Philistimes? the Lord answered, Thou shalt not goe up but fetch a compasse behind them and come upon them over against the Mulberry trees. The letters in the brestplate could not expresse all this, therefore it was not by the letters that the Lord answe∣red the Priest: but when hee had on this brestplate,How the Lord taught the Priest by Vrim and Thummim. , or rationale upon him, then the Lord taught him what to answer; and this brestplate was but a signe unto him, that the Lord would answer him, as Sampsons hayre was a signe unto him, that the Lord would continue his strength with him as long as hee kept his haire; how was the strength in Sampsons haire? not as in the cause, or in the subject, but onely as in the signe, so in the Apostles garments and shaddow;The Vrim and Thum∣mim were a signe onely that the Lord would answer the Priest. they were but a signe of their power which they had in hea∣ling miraculously; and so was vrim and thummim but a signe of this, that the Lord would answer the Priest. The vrim and thummim were not alwayes with the Arke;The Vrim and Thum∣mim were not ever with the Arke. for all the time of Saul they asked not counsell of the Arke, 1 Chron. 13.3. Let us bring againe the Arke of our God unto us: for we enquired not at it, in the dayes of Saul; they went usually to aske counsell in the Taber∣nacle and Sanctuarie of the Lord, Iud. 20. they went up to Silo, where the Tabernacle was, to aske the Lord then the Arke was in the Tabernacle: but when the Arke was separated from the Tabernacle, they might sacrifice in the Tabernacle. So they might aske the Lord here by vrim and thummim although the Arke
was not there. When the Highpriest asked counsell for David, at Nob: the Arke was not there nor the Taberna∣cle; but onely vrim and thummim: but when the Arke and the vrim and thummim were together, they al∣wayes enquired the Lord before the Arke; and when they were separated; they turned their faces towards the Arke, wheresoever it was, when they asked coun∣sell by the judgement of vrim and thummim. When David was in Ziglag, 1 Sam. 30. he asked counsell of the Lord by the Priest: but neyther the Arke nor the Tabernacle was ever in Ziglag a towne of the Phili∣stims. They asked counsell of the Lord at the Arke by the High Priest.When any are sayd, to aske counsell of the Lord, who were not Highpriests; as the Israelites are sayd thrice to aske the Lord. Iud. 20.18. 1 Sam. 14.37. & 23.2. 1 Chron. 14. they are understood to have done this by the Highpriest, for Num. 27.21. Ioshua is commanded to aske counsell at the Lord, by Eleazer the High∣priest. How he stood who as∣ked counsell by Vrim and Thummim.The manner how he stood who asked counsell of the Lord by the Highpriest, He shall stand before Eleazar the Priest, who shall aske counsell for him after the judgment of Vrim before the Lord. Num. 27.21. he stood not direct∣ly before the Highpriest, for then he should have stood betwixt him and the Arke: therefore liphne should be translated juxta, a latere, or beside the Priest. Hee stood by the Highpriest when he asked counsell, and hee heard not what tht Lord sayd to the Priest; but the Priest gave him his answer. The Lord by Vrim and Thummim answered distinctly to every que∣stion.When two things are demanded of the Lord, he an∣swered in order to them. As 1 Sam. 23.9. will they come up? The Lord answered, they will come up. So he an∣swered to the second question, will they deliver me? They will deliver thee. They asked not counsell of the Lord by Vrim and
Thummim but in great and weighty matters;They asked counsell by Vrim and Thummim onely in matters of weight. as David after the death of Saul, 1 Sam. 2. So 2 Sam. 5. they asked the Lord, for the King, for the common wealth or for a tribe, or for making of warres, but in matters of lesse moment they asked not the Lord, by Vrim and Thum∣mim: as if any thing had beene committed to ones cu∣stodie, and it was lost; they did not aske the Lord for it by Vrim and Thummim, but the oath of the Lord was betwixt them, Exod. 22.11. When they got their answers by Vrim and Thummim,God confirmed his an∣swers sometimes by lot. the Lord confirmed their answers sometimes by lot. As 1 Sam. 10.8. he asked first by Vrim and Thummim, who should bee King? and then it was confirmed by lot. So when Ioshua divided the Land. First, he got his answer by Vrim and Thummim, and then hee bid∣deth them cast lots, & as their lots ascended, he distribu∣ted unto them, Num. 26.55. When the Highpriest con∣sulted, he stretched out his hands unto the Arke of the Lord. 1 Sam. 14.19. collige manum tuam, draw in thine hand. The difference betwixt the predictions of the Pro∣phets and the Priest, by Vrim and Thummim was this.A difference betweene the predictions of the Priests by Vrim and Thumim, and the pre∣dictions of the Pro∣phets. The Prophets when they foretold things, vt futura in seipsis, as to fall out in themselves; then they alwayes fell out: but when they foretold things as they were in their causes, then they might fall out, or not fall out. Example, Esay saith to Ezekias, set thy house in order for thou shalt dye, and not live, Esay. 38.1.Prophesies as the re∣spect the second causes and events. looking to the se∣cond causes, and to Ezekias, he shall dye. But looking to the event, he shall not dye. So 1 King. 21.20. The Lord threatned to bring a judgement upon Achab, and yet upon his humiliation spared him. So the Lord threatned Ninive, forty dayes and Ninive shall be destroy∣ed, Ionah. 3.4. and yet when they humbled themselves they were not destroyed. But that which was revealed
by the Highpriest, when he tooke on Vrim and Thum∣mim, tooke alwayes effect. But it may be sayd, Iud. 20.23. shall I goe up to the battell against the children of Beniamin our brother? The Lord answered, goe up against him. And yet they were killed. In this first answer the Lord sheweth, that they had just cause to make warre against Benjamin; but he an¦swered not to the successe of the battell, because they were not as yet humbled; and they trusted too much to their owne strength. But when Phineas demanded what they should doe▪ vers. 28. when they were hum∣bled: they got a direct and more distinct answer: goe up, for to morrow I will deliver them into thine hand. De pont. Rom. lib. 4. 3.Bellermine the Iesuite, that he may prove the infalli∣bility of the Pope in judgeing in matters of faith; al∣ledgeth the Vrim and the Thummim, which were upon the brestplate of the Highpriest; a radice,  a false derivation. which directed him that he could not erre in judgement. But this reason is faultie many wayes. First, in the derivation of the names; a radice,  a false derivation to exclude the radicall letter, for there is duplex Mem, here and Aleph is excluded. . for he deriveth Vrim from the root jara which signifieth, to teach; whereas it is derived from or to give light. So he deriveth thummim from the root Aman, which signifieth to beleeve; whereas it com∣meth from tamam, to make a thing perfect. The se∣ventie translate thse words, , as yee would say, manifestatio & veritas. And so doth Hie∣rome. But this they doe , and they respect more the end here, wherefore they were put into the brestplate, than their proper significations. For as Vrim properly signifieth brightnesse, and figuratively , because that which maketh all things manifest is the light, Ephes. 5.13. and this Thummim properly signifieth perfection; so figuratively in things spiritu∣all,
it signifieth verity. The Seventy looking to the fi∣gurative signification, translate them this wayes. Secondly, put the case that Vrim and Thummim sig∣nified doctrine and verity, yet it will not follow that the Highpriest might not erre: for by these were sig∣nified not what sort of men they were, but what sort of men they ought to be. Prov. 16.10. A divine sentence is in the lippes of the King, and his mouth transgresseth not in judgement. Here is a clearer place that the King of Spaine cannot erre in judgement, than that the Pope cannot erre in judgement; if yee will take words as they stand. But the meaning of the words is, a divine sentance ought to be in the lippes of the King; and then his mouth will not transgresse in judgement. So these two are set in the brestplate of Aaron, to teach him his dutie: but they were not notes of his infallibility. And if by Vrim, they would inferre his infallibility in judge∣ment: so by Thimmim, they may inferre his holinesse of life: and so none of the Popes were profane and wicked men. Thirdly, this brestplate served not for a triall of his doctrine, but onely for foretelling of the doubtfull events of things; for their doctrine was to be tryed by the law and by the testimony, Esa. 8. Fourthly,The Highpriests might erre. if Vrim and Thummim signified verity and judgement, then it should follow, that none of the Highpriests could erre: but wee know that Vrijah the Highpriest in the time of Achaz, brought the paterne of the Altar of Damascus, and placed it in Ierusalem. 2 King. 16.6. And Caaiphas erred, when he condemned Christ to death. Lastly, let this be granted, that the Highpriest under the law could not erre; therefore that eyther Peter or the Pope his successor (as they alledge) could not erre, it will not follow. For this priviledge, not to erre, be∣longeth
to none, but to Iesus Christ, of whom the Highpriest was a type; who had both Vrim and Thum∣mim, purity of doctrine and perfection of life. How long did the gift of prophesie endure in the se∣cond Temple. How long the gift of prophesie indured un∣der the old Testament.The gift of prophesie endured under the old Testa∣ment untill the time of the Macedonian Empire. When Alexander the great did raigne, Nehemiah maketh men∣tion of one Iaddus the Highpriest, Neh. 12.7. who met Alexander,See Shinlerusin  when he came against Ierusalem. Now if there had beene none, who were infallibly directed by the Spirit of God at this time; who could have put this into the canonicall Scripture it being histo∣ricall? therefore there behoved to be one at this time, who had the spirit of prophesie, and was one of the masters of the great Synagogue, who did this: and then the Sunne went downe upon the Prophets. Micah. 3. and the gift of prophecie ceased. The gift of Prophesie given under the new Testament.Thse gift of prophesie was bestowed anew againe, in the second Temple, under the new Testament. Ioel. 2. I will powre out my spirit upon all flesh, and your young men shall see visions, &c. This gift lasted in the Church, till the second Tem∣ple was destroyed. The Iewes by a certaine kind of Kabbala called gematrja, a  observe upon Hagg. 1.8. it is written there ekkabhda, I will be glorified, because the word wanteth the letter ה in the end of it, which let∣ter standeth for five; they say that the want of this ה, sheweth the want of five things in the second Temple, which were in the first. The Arke, the mercy seate, and Cherubims. Secondly, the fire from Heaven. Thirdly, the majesty of Divine presence called shekena. Fourthly, the holy Ghost. And fiftly, Vrim and Thummim. But this rabbinicall observation is most impious,The Iewes cabbalisticall observation blasphe∣mous. and ser∣veth to overthrow all the whole New Testament, to
deny Iesus Christ, and to condemne his Apostles and Evangelists; as though they had not the gift of the holy Spirit when they wrote, during the time of the second Temple: and this is contrary to the very scope of the Prophet, Hagg. 1.8. Goe up into the mountaine, and bring wood to build this house, and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified saith the Lord, and Hagg. 2.9. The glory of the latter house shall be greater then the former, and in this place will I give peace saith the Lord. Whether were the Arke, the Vrim and Thummim,  and the holy fire in the second Temple or not? Although there was greater spirituall beauty in the second Temple, than in the first;The Arke was not in the second Temple. yet the second Tem∣ple wanted this typicall Arke, the Vrim and Thummim, and the fire; therefore it is but a fable of theirs,Iosephus ant. lib. 14. who say, that Titus after he had destroyed the second Tem∣ple, brought the Arke to Rome in his triumphes; but the Arke was never seene in the second Temple; and Iosephus, who was an eye witnesse of Titus triumphes sheweth, that it was onely but the table of the shew∣bread which Titus carried away in his triumphes, and is seene yet pictured there. The Vrim and Thummim were not in the second Tem∣ple, but the graces signified by them. But it may be sayd. Nehem. 7.65. and Ezra. 2.63. That they should not eate of the most holy things, untill there stood up a Priest with Vrim and with Thummim. It is the manner of the Scriptures to expresse the na∣ture of the Church under the New Testament;The new Testament expresseth things some∣times under types of the old Testament. by fi∣gures and types which were under the Old Testament: so by Vrim and Thummim which were in the first Tem∣ple; to expresse the perfection of the Priests, which should be in the second Temple. The last way,How the Lord revea∣led himselfe by the poole Bethesda. how God revealed himselfe in the se∣cond Temple, was by the poole Bethesda: when the
Angel came downe at certaine times to stirre the poole, then whosoever after the first troubling of the water stepped in, he was cured of whatsoever disease. Ioh. 5.4. It was not the Angell that cured them here: for it is a true Axiome of the Schoolemen,An Angell cannot worke a Miracle. pars naturae non potest superare na∣turam, an Angell is but a part of nature, therefore hee cannot worke a miracle,What Angell wrought this Miracle.  which is above nature. It was Christ himselfe who wrought the miracle, it was hee who loosed the prisoners, Psal. 146. Mattir, is so to loose the bound, that they have use both of their hands and feete, to leape as freely as the Grashopper doth, which hath legges to leape upon the earth, Levit. 11.21. So the di∣seased were loosed, that they might leape and goe streight upon their owne feete. By Angell here some understand the power of God, who useth his Angels, as his ministers to worke many things below here; and therefore the Seventy put God in place of the Angell, as Eccles. 5.6. Say not before the Angell, that it was an er∣rour. But the Seventy translate it , for the Chaldes use to ascribe the worke of God to his ministers, the Angels. But it is better to ascribe this miracle here, to the Angell of the covenant Iesus Christ. Tertullian saith, that the operation of the fish-poole being now to cease and to loose the vertue of it, our Saviour curing him who had beene long diseased, being at the poole, gave thereby an entrance to all sicke persons to come unto him: as if he should have sayd, he that desires to be whole; let him not come to the poole, or expect the comming downe of the Angell: for when he commeth, he healeth but one; but come unto me, and I shall heale you all. The conclusion of this is, seeing wee have a more cleare manifestation of the will of God by Christ, than they had under the Law; let us beware to offend him now. He that despised Moyses law, Heb. 10.28. dyed with∣out
mercy, under two or three witnesses, of how much sorer punishment shall we be thought worthy of, if we treade under foot the Sonne of God. EXERCITAT. VIII. Of the necessity of the Word written. Ioh. 20.31. But these are written that yee might beleeve. GOd thought it necessary, after that he had taught his Church by Word; next to teach her by write. There is a twofold necessity. The first is called an ab∣solute necessity: the second, of expedience. Againe, Necessitas absoluta Necessitas expedientia Gods revealed will was necessary to all men, as a cause; but his written word was necessary as an instrumentall cause; and this word is considered eyther essentially,Scriptura est necessaria  verbum . The word considered essentially or acci∣dentally. Simile. or accidentally. Essentially for the written word: this written, and unwritten word, differ onely as a man na∣ked, and cloathed; for there is no change in the nature and substance here. And that we may the better under∣derstand the necessity of the writing of the word, wee must distinguish here the states of the Church. First,The estate of the Church considered three wayes. shee was in a family or oeconomike. Secondly, she was Nationall, dispersed through the countrey of the Iewes. Thirdly, she was Ecomenicall or Catholicke, dispersed through the whole world. So long as shee was in a fa∣mily, and the Patriarches lived long, to record to the posterity, the word and the workes of God; then God taught his Church by his word unwritten. But when his Church began to be enlarged, first through Iudea, & then through the whole world, then he would have his
word set downe in write;Why God would have his word written. because then the Fathers were not of so long a life, to record to the posterity, the word and the workes of God. Againe he did this to obviat the craft of the Divell, and the counterfeite writings of the false Apostles. God revealeth himselfe most surely to us by his word.It was necessary then, that the word should be writ∣ten, that the Church might have a greater certainety of their salvation. See how farre the Lord commen∣deth unto us, the certainety which wee have by the Scriptures; above all other sort of revelation. 2 Pet. 1.19.. We have also a more sure word of prophesie: here the certainety of the Scriptures, is preferred to the trans∣figuration in the mount. Secondly, the Apostle Gal. 1.8. preferreth it to the revelation made by Angels, If an Angell should come from heaven and teach any other Gospel, let him be accursed. Thirdly, Christ himselfe pre∣ferred the certainety of it to Moyses and the Prophets. If one should come from the dead and teach us. Luk. 16.31. The Church is not the last resolution of our faith.The Church of Rome then doth great wrong to Chri∣stians; when they would make the last ground and stay of Christian faith, to be the Church onely; But wee are built upon the foundation of the Prophets, and Apostles, Ephe. 2.20. the Lord when he dwelt betweene the Che∣rubims, he set the Candlesticke upon his right hand, and the table with the shewbread upon his left hand: to teach us, that the Scriptures are to be preferred still to the testimony of the Church; and that wee must rest upon their testimony primariò. Whether is it an Article of our faith, to beleeve that the Scriptures are the Word of God or not? Somethings de fide & de verbo fidej, somethings de verbo fidej, but not de fide primario, some∣things neither de fide neither de verbo fidej.Some things are both de fide, & de verbo fidei; as Christ is Emmanuel. Secondly, somethings are de ver∣bo fidei but not de fide primariò; as Paul left his cloake at Troas. Thirdly, somethings are de fide, but non de verbo
fidei, which are the conclusions drawne from the cano∣nicall word by consequence. And these are eyther drawne from the word generally; as this, that the Scrip∣tures are the word of God. for this is evident from the whole word generally, and although this be a princi∣ple in it selfe, which ought first to be beleeved; yet in my conception, and manner of taking up, it is a con∣clusion arising from that majesty and Divine character which is in the word it selfe, or the particular conclu∣sions drawne from the word. They are de fide, non de verbo fidei, as when a man concludeth, his owne parti∣cular justification from the word; as I Iames am justi∣fied, est de fide mea, and not a part of the canonicall word, but an application arising from it. Fourthly, something are neyther de fides nor de verbo fidei. Secondly, we may answer to this: whether the word written be an article of our faith or not.Articles of our faith, taken generally or spe∣cially. The articles of our faith are eyther taken generally, or specially: ge∣nerally, for all that is contained in the Scriptures, or may be deduced by way of consequence from the Scrip∣tures: then it is not an article of our faith, to beleeve the canon of the Scriptures. Secondly, specially for that which is contained in the Creede; for the Creede is the substance of that which is contained in the Scrip∣tures; and then it is an article of our faith to be∣leeve the Cannon of the Scriptures. The Scriptures of God, are considered essentially,The Scriptures conside∣red essentially or acci∣dentally. or accidentally. Essentially, as they proceede from God; accidentally againe, as they were written by such and such men. As they proceede from God, we must beleeve them to be true, and to be the meanes of our salvation; for saving truth is onely from God. But if we consider them but accidentally, as they are written by such and such men, then it is not an article of our faith to beleeve them; for it maketh not to our
salvation primariò, to know that they were written by such and such men. When the books in holy Scripture, carry the names of those who wrote them; as the bookes of Moyses carrie his name; if a man should deny these bookes to be writ∣ten by Moses, & then be ignorant altogether of the mat∣ter contained in them; then his ignorance were damnable,Ignorantia damnabilis negatio haeretical. and the denyall of them hereticall; they have Moses and the Prophets, Luk. 16. But if the writer of the booke be not set downe in the Scripture; if a man should deny such a man to write it, he should not be reputed as an hereticke for that;Negatia est haerètica per accidens sed ignoratio non est damnabilis. and to be ignorant that such a man wrote it, this were not damnable ignorance. Example, it is holden that Paul wrote the Epistle to the Hebrews; now if a man should deny that Paul wrote this Epistle, he were not to be holden a hereticke for that, neyther were his ignorance damnable. A man may be ignorant of this or that booke, and yet be saved, and many were saved before the bookes were written, and now many are saved who cannot reade the Scriptures. Ignorantia hic est infir∣mitatis & negatio est hae∣ritica per accidens.But when a man doubteth of the order and number of the bookes in the Canon, this argueth but his un∣skilfulnesse and infirmity, and the denyall of the num∣ber and order of these bookes, is but hereticall by acci∣dent, and the ignorance is not damnable. When we beleeve such a booke to be written by such a man, whether beleeve we this by a justifying faith, or by an historicall faith? When we beleeve that such a man wrote this booke, this is but an historicall faith, and this we have by the Church: but that which is dogmaticall in this booke, that we must beleeve out of the word it selfe; we being illuminate by the Spirit. Conclusi.The conclusion of this is. Seeing God hath revealed
his will in his word written to us, and remitted us al∣wayes to the law and to the testimony, Esay 10.8. Ioh. 5.49. search the Scriptures: therefore these who leave the Scriptures, and make choyse of traditions; they for∣sake the fountaine of living water, and digge Cisternes to themselves that cannot hold no water, Ier. 2.13. EXERCITAT. IX. Of the singular prerogatives which the secretaries of the holy Ghost had, who wrote the Scriptures. 2 Pet. 1.21. And the holy men of God spake as they were mooved by the holy Ghost. THe holy men of God, who were inspired by the holy Spirit to write the Scriptures: First they were immediatly called by God. Gal. 1.12. for the Gospel which I preached, I received it not of man, neyther was I taught but by the revelation of Iesus Christ, they had not their calling from man, but immediatly from God. They had their calling intuitu Ecclesiae,Voca∣tio vel est intuitu ecclesiae. intervetu eccles. 1 Cor. 3.2. sed non interventu Ecclesiae: that is, God ordained these offices for the good of the Church, and it was for the Church cause that he appointed them; but they had not their calling from the Church. But Preachers now have their calling both intuitu Ecclesiae, & interventu Ecclesiae.Immediata suppositi virtutis. There is immedietas ratione suppositi & immedietas ratione vir∣tutis: the first is, when the person is immediatly sepa∣rated by God to such a calling; the second is, when the graces and calling, are immediatly given by God When Ministers are called, they have their gifts imme∣diatly
from God, and so they have their calling; there interveneth no suppositum, or midst betweene God and them: but for the appointing and designing of them to such places; that they have from the Church. But the Apostles were called immediatly, both ratione suppositi & vírtutis; they had their gifts immediatly from God, neyther were they designed to such and such plaees as the Ministers are now. The Prophets and Apostles were immediatly called by God, and therefore Matthias was chosen by lot to be an Apostle, because the lot is immediatly directed by the hand of God; but Preachers now should not be chosen by lot. Zeno the Emperor tempted God in this case, laying a paper upon the Altar, that God might write in the paper the name of him, who should be Bi∣shop of Constantinople:Nicepherus, Lib. 2. but Flavitius corrupting the Sexton of the Church, caused him to write in his name, and so was made Bishop of Constantinople. But Moyses learned from the Egyptians, and Daniel from the Chaldeans: therefore it may seeme that they had not their calling immediatly from God. The Apostles and Pro∣phets learned their hu∣mane Sciences and Artes from men but not their divine knowledge.They had the learning of humane sciences and trades from men; as Paul learned from men to be a Tent ma∣ker: so Moyses learned these humane sciences from the Egyptians, & Daniel from the Chaldeans; but their know∣ledge, as Prophets & Apostles imediatly was frō God. Although they had their divine knowledge immediate∣ly from God,Simile. The Prophets know∣ledge was kept by rea∣ding. Dan. 2.9. and 1 Tim. 4.13. yet they were to entertaine it by reading, As the fyre, that came from heaven upon the Altar was miraculous; yet when it was once kindled, they kept it in with wood, as wee doe our fire: So the Prophets knowledge was preserved by reading, as ours is. Their second prerogative, was the measure of know∣ledge they had in matters Divine.The measure of the Pro∣phets and Apostles knowledge. Their knowledge far differed frō the knowledge of Christ; this was visio vni∣onis, & this excelled the knowledge of all creatures, even
of the Angels: this was not called prophesie, as he was comprehensor; but as he was viator here upon the earth, this his illumination is called Prophesie; he is called the great Prophet, Deut. 18.15. and in this sort of knowledge hee excelled both men and Angels. Secondly, their knowledge differed from the knowledge of Angels, and the glorified Spirits: for prophesie as Peter saith,Visio vnionis gloria raptus prophetiae 2 Pet. 1.19. is like a light shining in a darke place, but in Heaven there is no darkenesse. Thirdly, their knowledge differed from the know∣ledge that Paul had, when he was taken up to the third heaven; and this was called visio raptus: their knowledge was farre inferiour to all these sorts of knowledge; but it farre exceeded all the knowledge that we have. Whether had the Prophets of God, and the Secreta∣ries of the holy Ghost; this their Prophesie, and divine knowledge, by way of habit or no?The Prophets had not the gift of prophesie by habite. They had not this gift of prophesie by way of habit, as the children of God have their faith: and as Bezaliell and Aholiab, although they had their knowledge im∣mediatly from God, to worke all curious workes in the Tabernacle; yet they kept still this their know∣ledge as an ordinary habit; but this gift of prophesie, the Prophets had it not as a habit, but they had neede still of new illumination when they prophesied. Peter compareth prophesie to a light shining in a darke place, 2 Pet. 1.19. how long continueth light in a darke house? no longer then a candle is there: so this coruscation,Simile. or glimpse of the Spirit, continued no longer with them; but when the Spirit was illuminating them, and teaching them: they had the gift of prophesie even as they had the gift of healing; but they could not heale when and where they pleased. Paul saith, I have left Trophimus sicke at Miletum, 2 Tim 4 20. So they could not prophesie when and where they pleased,
2 King. 4.27. The Lord hath hid it from me and hath not told it me, they had not this prophesie as a permanent habit; but as that, which was now and then revealed unto them. Ier. 42.7. And it came to passe after ten dayes; here the Prophets behoved to attend, untill he got a new revelation from the Lord; and sometimes they waited longer, and sometimes shorter for this revela∣tion. How differed the Prophets then from other men, when they prophesied not? First, yee shall see a difference betweene them and others who prophesied. Num. 17. It is sayd of those Prophets,Prophetia momentanea. prophetarunt & non addiderunt, that is, they prophesied but that day onely, that the Spirit came upon them, but never after; as the Hebrews expound it: but the Prophets of the Lord, prophesied often. So 2 King. 2.3. The children of the Prophets came forth: they prophesied, but this gift of the prophesie continu∣ed not with them: but these Prophets of the Lord, often prophesied: And although they had not the habit of prophecie, yet they were separate by God for that purpose, to expect still for new illumination. The third prerogative, which the holy men of God had,. was this, that they could not erre in their writing, 2 Pet. 1.21. The holy men of God spake as they were inspi∣red by the holy Ghost,The Peophets erred not in writing the Scrip∣tures. Matth. 10:2. Luk. 21.15. Luk. 1.17. therefore the Prophets were called, the mouth of God, Luk. 1.18. Ier. 15.19. thou shalt be as my mouth. Hee spake not onely by their mouthes,The Prophets are called the mouth of God. but also they were his mouth. And contrary to this is that lieing Spirit in the mouth of the false Prophets. 1 King. 22.22. The secretaries of the holy Ghost, erred sometimes in some of their purposes,Wherein the Prophets and Apostles erred. and in some circumstances of their calling; but in the doctrine it selfe they never erred. Peter in the transfiguration, knew not what hee
sayd, Luk. 9.33. David was minded to build an house to God, he asked of Nathan if he should doe so, 1 Chro. 17.2. Nathan sayd to him; doe what is in thine heart. So when Eliab stood before Samuel, 1 Sam. 16.6. Samuel sayd: surely the Lords annointed i before me. So the Di∣sciples erred in their counsell, which they gave to Paul, forbidding him to goe up to Ierusalem, Act. 21.4. But the spirit of God, taught the contrary by Agabus, vers. 17. David Psal. 116. sayd in his hast, that all men are lyars: he meant, that Samuel the man of God had made a lye to him; because hee thought the promise too long differred in getting of the kingdome. So when he wrote a letter to Ioab with vriah, in this he was not Gods secretary, but the Divels. But as they were the secretaries of God, and spake by divine inspiration, they could not erre. But it may seeme,  that all which they wrote in holy Scriptures, was not done by divine inspiration: for Paul wrote that he would come to Spaine, Rom. 15.24. and yet he never came to Spaine. We must distinguish betweene their purposes exter∣nall, and their doctrine:  they might erre in these ex∣ternall purposes, and resolutions; but all which they wrote of Christ, and matters of salvation, was yea and Amen, 2 Cor. 1.20. He wrote that he was purposed to come to Spaine, and so he was; but he was let, that he could not come. But Paul repented that he wrote the Epistle to the Corinthians to grieve them,  2 Cor. 7.8. If this was writ∣ten by the inspiration of the holy Ghost, why did he repent of it? Paul wrote this Epistle to humble them,  and when he saw them excessively sorrowfull, that was the thing that greeved him; but it greeved him not simply that he wrote to them to humble them. When a Chyrur∣gian
commeth to cure a wounded man,Simile. he putteth the poore patient to great paine, and maketh him to cry out, that grieveth him; but it greeveth him not when he cureth him: So it repented not Paul, that he had writ∣ten to the Corinthians; but it repented him to see them so swallowed up with greefe. But if the Scriptures be Divinely inspired, how say they, Iud. 16.17. there were about three thousand upon the roofe of the house. So Act. 2.40. and that day there were added to the Church, about three thousand soules. Is not the number of all things, certainely knowne to God? The Scriptures set downe the number that way: be∣cause it is little matter, whether we know the number or not. And secondly, the Lord speaketh to us this way in the Scripture after the manner of men. Peter erred in a matter of faith, Gal. 2.14. Wherein Peter erred.The error was not in the substance, but in the cir∣cumstance of the fact: and where it is sayd, Gal. 2.14. That Peter walked not uprightly, according to the Gospel; it is to be understood onely of his conversation; hee erred here onely, in this principle of Christian Religi∣on; not walking according to his knowledge, but hee erred not in his writing. All men are subject to error, the Prophets and Apo∣stles are men, therefore subject to error. The Prophets and Apostles are considered as members of the Church,The Apostles conside∣red two manner of wayes. and so they might erre; and they pray as other men, Lord forgive us our sinnes. Secondly, they are considered according to their functions and immediate calling; and then they were above the Church, and could not erre. What needed Nathan to be sent to David to attend him continually, one Prophet to another? Although one Prophet stood not in need of another; yet he who was both a King and a Prophet had neede
of a Prophet to admonish him: for Kings stand in slip∣pery places, and have neede of others to advertise them. The Prophets, as they were Prophets, could not erre; therefore, that collection of the Iewes, is most impious: they say that David wished to the sonnes of Ioab foure things, 2 Sam. 3.29. First that some of them might dye by the sword. Secondly, that some of them might dye of the bloody flixe. Thirdly, that some of them might leane upon a staffe. And fourthly, that some of them might begge their bread. And so they say, it befell Davids posterity, for his sinfull wish. One of them leaned upon a staffe, Asa was goutish. One of his posterity was killed by the sword, as Iosias. One of them dyed of the flixe, as Rehoboam. And one of them beg'd his bread, as Iehojachim. But this collection is most impious; for David spake not here by a private spirit of revenge, but as a Prophet of God: and there∣fore when they assigne these to be the causes, why these judgements befell Davids posterity; they assigne that for a cause, which was not a cause. The fourth prerogative, they were holy men. Holi∣nesse distinguished them from those Prophets which were profane and unsanctified; who had the gift of illumination, but not of sanctification:The pen-men of the holy Ghost, were holy men. the Lord made choyse of none such to be his secretaries, who were not sanctified. The Lords Prophet is called vir spiritus, the man of the Spirit, Hos. 9.7. because he is ruled, and guided by the holy Spirit, that he become not profaine. If the very women, who spun the curtaines to the Ta∣bernacle were wise hearted, Exod. 35.25. Much more will the Lord have those, who are to build his house; wise and holy men. Those who translated the Bible into Greeke, yee shall see how often they changed their faith, and were turne-coates: Aquila of a Christian
he became a Iew. Symmachus was first a Samaritane, and then he became halfe Iew, halfe Christian. Then Theodoton, first he was a fllower of Tatianus the here∣ticke, and then he became a Marcionite, and thirdly he became a Iew. But the Prophets of God, after they were called, continued holy men, and never fell backe againe. See more of Salomon in the Politiks.God will have no man, but holy men to be his secreta∣ries, Luk. 1.70. As he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets. Therefore Salomon being a Prophet, and one of Gods secretaries, behoved to be a holy man; and being holy he could not be a reprobate: hence he is called Iedidiah, The beloved of God, 2 Sam. 12.25. and whom God loveth, he loveth to the end. The holy men of God wrote as they were , inspired by God,. the Spirit inlightned them, and di∣rected them when they wrote: they were inspired three manner of wayes,Illu∣mi∣nati antecedenter. per concomitantiā subsequenter. first, antecedenter. Secondly, per con∣comitantiam; and thirdly, subsequenter. First, they were illuminate antecedenter: when the Lord revealed things to come to his Prophets, and made them to write his prophesies; then their tongue, was the pen of a swift writer, Psal. 45.1. That is, he not onely indited these prophesies unto them; but also ruled them so, and guided them in writing; even as a master guideth the hand of a young child, when he is learning to write. Secondly, he inspired them in writing the Histories and Actes, after another manner per concomitantiam: for that which was done already, hee assisted them so in writing it downe; that they were able to discerne the re∣lations which they had from others, to be true: as Luke knew ,How Luke differed frō Tertius and Baruch. accurately the truth of these things, which he had from those, who had heard and seene Christ: and he made , a perfect declaration of them.
there was a great difference betwixt him and Tertius, who was Pauls Scribe, and wrote out his Epistles, Rom. 16.22. or betwixt him and Baruch, who was Ieremies Scribe, Ier. 38. they were not  the secretaries of the holy Ghost, but  discribebant ab alio, they wrote onely these things which Ieremiah and Paul indi∣ted to them; neyther was sanctification required in them, as they were their Scribes. But the Evangelists who saw not Christ, yet they were the Secretaries of the holy Ghost, and holy men; as they were his Se∣cretaries, and directed by him to write. Thirdly, he assisted them in writing subsequenter; the holy Ghost revealed things to the Prophets long be∣fore; but when they were to write these things, the spirit of the Lord brought the same things to their me∣morie againe; and indited these things unto them which they had seene before in vision. Ier. 36.2. Take thee a roule, and write therein all the words that I have spo∣ken to thee, against Israel and against Iuda, and against all the Nations; from the day that I spake to thee, even from the dayes of Iosias, unto this day. So Ioh. 14.26. the comfor∣ter which is the holy Ghost whom the Father will fend in my name, he shall teach you all thing, and bring all things to your memory which I have told you. These Secretaries of the holy Ghost, when they wrote, habebant libertatam exercitij, sed non specificationis,Libertas exercitij specificationis as they say in the Schooles, they were not like Blockes or Stones, but the Lord inclined their wills freely to write: which putteth a difference betwixt them,A difference betwixt the Prophets of God and the Sybiles, or Pro∣phets of the devill. and the Sybils, and other Prophets of the Divell, who were blasted, and distracted in their wits, when they prophesied. When Elisha sent one of the children of the Prophets, to annoynt Iehu; one sayd to him, where∣fore commeth this madde fellow, 2 King. 9.11? they tooke the Prophets to be madde, like unto the Heathish Pro∣phets,
but they were inlightened by the Spirit when they prophesied, and the Lord rectified their under∣standing, and tooke not away from them the right use of their will. It is sayd of Saul, when he prophesied, that the evill spirit of Lord came upon him, 1 Sam. 18.10. And the Chaldie Paraphrast paraphraseth it, caepit furere, he began to be mad: the Divell stopping the pas∣sages of his body, he wrought upon his melancholious humor, which is called Esca diaboli, the Divels baite; and then it is sayd, ijthnabbe, impulit se ad prophetandum, which is never spoken of the true Prophets in this Con∣jugation. Although the Lords Secretaries had libertatem ex∣ercitij, yet they had not libertatem specificationis; that is, they might not leave that subject which they were called to write, and write any other thing, as they plea∣sed; they were necessitated onely to write that, al∣though they wrote it freely. Againe, these men when they wrote as the holy Ghost enspired them,The Prophts did not write with paine and studie. they did it not with paine and study, as we doe; but it came freely from them with∣out any paine or vexation of their spirit. The Princes when they heard Baruch read the prophesie of Ieremiah, after that it was endited, they asked how did he write all these words at his mouth? and Baruch answered them, He pro∣nounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with inke into the Booke, Iere. 36.17.18. Salomon saith, Eccles. 12.12. In making many bookes and in reading there is much wearinesse of the flesh, but this was no wea∣rinesse to them; for they wrote this without any paine or labour: and hence it followeth, that those to whom their writing hath beene troublesome and painfull, have not beene the Secretaries of the holy Ghost; as Mac. 2.26. He that assayed to abbridge the five Bookes of Iason sayd, that it was not an easie thing, to make this abridge∣ment;
but it required both sweate and labcu. Seeing all that wrote the holy Scriptures were en∣spired by the holy Ghost;Quest. Why was Iohn called a Divine. . why was this Epithete ap∣propriate to Iohn, to be called a Divine, Revela. 1.1. For they were all Divines who wrote the holy Scrip∣tures? The Greeke Fathers, when they spake of Christ, Quomodo differunt  & . and specially Chrysostome, they distinguish betweene , & , and they say, Apud caeteros aeco∣nomiae fulmen, sed apud Iohannem theologiae tonitrua ex∣tare. The rest when they discribe the humanity of Christ, they doe it ; but when Iohn discribeth the Divinity of Christ, hee doth it ; and they say Mattheus  & Iohannes , incipit Observe a difference betwixt these speeches.The Lord came to the wicked, but the word of the Lord came to his Prophets. The Word of the Lord came to Esay, to Ieremiah; and this phrase: The Lord came to Balaam, to Abimelech, to Laban. The first signifieth, that the Lord put these holy men in trust with his Word to be his Prophets; but he never concredited his word to these prophaine wretches: therefore it is sayd onely, He came to them, but never the Word of the Lord came to them. Hee concredited his Word to his Prophets, as to Esay, and Ieremiah , that is, as a pupill is concredited to the trust of his Tutor; but he never concredited his Word to these wretches. The Lord spake in his Prophets, Notat internam revelationem. Hosea 1.1. The Spirit of the Lord spake in me, that is, inwardly revealed his se∣crets to me. Marke a difference betwixt these two phrases, Loqui in aliquo, & Loqui in aeliquem. Loqui in aliquo, is when the Spirit of the Lord spea∣keth inwardly to the Prophets;Loqui in aliquo & loqui in aliquem vt differunt. sed Loqui in aliquem est maledicere, to raile against him: thus Num. 12. Miriam loquuta est in Mosem, id est, maledixit Mosi.
The conclusion of this is, Matth. 10.20. It is not yee that speake, but the Spirit of our Father which speaketh in you. So it was not they who wrote, but the Spirit of the Lord in them. 2 King. 13. When Ioash the King of Israel tooke a Bow in his hand, Elisha laid his hands upon the Kings hands, and Elisha bad him shoote; and he sayd, the Arrow of the Lords deliverance and the Arrow of the deliverance from Syria; it was not the Kings hand that directed the Arrow here, but it was the hand of the Prophet laid upon the Kings hand which gave this mighty blow: so it was the hand of the Lord laid upon the hands of his Secretaries, which directed them to write the holy Word of God. EXERCITAT. IX. Arguments proving the Scriptures to bee Divine. 1 Thess. 2.13. Yee received it not as the Word of man, but as it is in truth the Word of God. THe Testimonies which prove the Scriptures to be Divine, are first, the Testimonie of God himselfe when he approved them by his Spirit, and when they were laid before him, by Vrim and Thummim. Se∣condly, arguments drawne out of the Scriptures them∣selves. Thirdly, the Testimonie of the Church. Fourth∣ly, the Testimonie of those who were without the Church, Deus testatur, Scriptura contestatur, & Ecclesia subtestatur. Deus testatur.God beareth witnesse to the Scriptures two wayes, First, by the internall Testimony of his Spirit. Second∣ly, by his externall Testimony.
When the Spirit testifieth unto us such Bookes to be his Word,  whether is this a publike or a private Te∣stimony? This is a publike Testimony,  which the Spirit Testi∣fieth to the whole Church, and to the severall mem∣bers of it, that these Bookes are holy Scripture: for the same Spirit which endited the Scriptures to the Church, testifieth still to the Church, and to the par∣ticular members thereof; that the Scriptures are the Word of God. The second Testimony which God gave to the Scrip∣tures, was his externall testimony given by Vrim and Thummim, testifying these Bookes of Moyses and the Prophets, to be the holy Scriptures. What are we to thinke of these Bookes,  written and set in order after the captivitie, seeing they had not the approbation of the Lord by Vrim and Thum∣mim? These Bookes were called Ketubhim, written Bookes, to put a difference betweene them, and these Bookes which were confirmed by Vrim and Thummim: they who wrote these Bookes were inspired by the holy Ghost as well as these who wrote the former; and they were confirmed by the masters of the great Synagogue, aradice such as were Esdras Zacharie and Malachie. The Greekes called these Bookes : abscondere. and the Iewes distinguish them still,. frō the Apocryphall Bookes cal∣led Gannazim abscinditi, and the Greekes called them , Bookes of whose authority it was still doubted. Reasons taken out of the Scriptures themselves pro∣ving them to be Divine; the first reason is taken from the antiquity of the Scriptures:Scriptura contesta∣tur. all this time was tempus  to the heathen, that is, it was an hid or an un∣knowne time to them. After the flood, the Scriptures
goe on, and they set downe to us the history of the Church:Tempus Historicum. but the Heathen history is Tempus , or fabulosum; as that which we reade of Hercules, and Prometheus: and nothing is set downe in the Heathen history before the Olympiads of the Graecians, which was but in the dayes of Vzziah. See how farre Gods Word exceedeth humane history, in antiquity; It beginneth with the world and endeth with it, Luk. 1.70. as he spake by the mouth of his holy Prophets, which have beene since the world began. Secondly, the matter contained in the Scriptures shew∣eth them to be Divine. Many histories shew us the hea∣vy wrath of God upon man for sinne; yet the Scriptures only shew us morbum, medicinam, & medicum, it sheweth us both the sicknesse, the physicke, and the Physitian to cure it. The Scriptures not written to satisfie mens curiosity.Thirdly, the Scripture setteth downe things necessa∣ry onely for our salvation, and nothing for our curio∣sity. It is often repeated in the Bookes of the Kings and Chronicles. The rest are they not written in the Bookes of the Chronicles, of the Kings of Iuda and Israel, So Ester. 10.2. The rest are they not written in the Bookes of the Kings of Persia. The holy Ghost would meete here with the curious desires of men, who desire still to know more and more, and to reade pleasant discour∣ses, to satisfie their humours: as if the Spirit of God should say; I have sufficiently told you here of the Kings of Iuda and Israel, and of Persia, and so farre as concerneth the Church, and may serve for your edifi∣cation: it is not my manner to satisfie your curiositie, if ye would know more, go to your owne Scrowles and Registers; where yee shall finde matter enough to passe the time with. To bee short, the Scriptures are not given to passe the time with, but to redeeme the time.
Fourthly, the prophesies set downe in the holy Scriptures shew them to be Divine, for they distinguish the Lord from all the Idols of the Gentiles, and the Divels themselves, Esa. 41.22. Let them shew the former things what they be, that we may consider them and set our hearts upon them:Renunciare proeterita anunciare presentia p. anunciare futura. and shew us the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that yee are Gods. Here the Prophet distinguisheth the true God from the false Gods, and true prophesies from false: If they could tell of things by-past, and relate them from the begin∣ning and joyne them with the things to come; then he would confesse that they were Gods, and that their pro∣phesies were true. To tell of things past is not in respect of time; for the Angels and Divels can tell things fal∣len out from the beginning of time: but it is in respect of the things themselves, when they tooke beginning, & this is onely proper to God, Psal. 139.16. In thy Booke all my members were written, which in continuance were fashioned, when as yet there were none of them. Hee can joyne things by-past with things that are to follow; and can tell certainely of things to come. There is a twofold beginning of things. The first is, exordium rei: The second is, exordium temporis.Exordium temporis rei. The Angels know ex∣ordium temporis, but not exordium rei; for the Lord one∣ly knoweth things before the foundation of the world was laid, Ephe. 1.4. He who knoweth certainely the be∣ginning of things, can onely certainely fortell the event of things, as though they were present, Hos. 12.4. hee wept and made supplication to him: he found him in Bethel, and there he spake with us. Here the thing past, he apply∣eth to the generation which was present, because hee knew exordium rei. The plaine, and cleare manner of setting downe the Scriptures, sheweth them to be Divine, Esa. 8.1. Take a great roule, and write in it with a mans pen, Behheret enosh.
That is cleerely, that the simplest amongst the children of men may understand it, Deut. 30.11. This commande∣ment which I command thee this day, is not hidden from thee, neyther is it farre off: In the Hebrew it is, Lo niphleeth, non separatum a te, that is, it is not separated from thy know∣ledge, that thou cannot understand it: and it is not farre from thee, for these things which are obscure and doubtfull which we cannot take up, are sayd to be farre from us; these things which wee understand againe are sayd to be neare us, Rom. 10.8. But it may be sayd that there are many things hard in the Scriptures, and cannot well be taken up. We must distinguish these three, the obscurity in the things themselves,Obscu∣ritas est veln rebus ipsis. modo tradendi. conceptione. the perspicuity in the midsts as they are set downe, and thirdly, the dulnesse of our conception to take them up. There are many matters handled in the Scripture, which are hard to be under∣stood, and we are dull in conception to take up these things; yet they are clearely and plainely set downe in the word. Christ sheweth all these three, Ioh. 3.12. If I have told you earthly things, and yee beleeve not: how shall yee beleeve if I tell you of heavenly things. If I have told you earthly things, that is, illustrated heavenly things to you by earthly comparisons; here is Christs plaine manner in setting downe his word. And yee beleeve not; here is our dulnesse in taking up these things which are plainely set downe. How shall yee beleeve if I shall tell you of heavenly things, here is the obscurity of the heavenly matters contained in the Scriptures. The Church of Rome confoundeth still these three, Obscuritas rei, & no∣stri conceptus, cum perspicuo modo tradendi, the obscurity in the matter the dulnesse of our conception, with the cleare manner of manifestation of these things in the Scriptures. The Heavenly consent and agreement, amongst the
writers of the holy Scriptures, sheweth them to be Di∣vine.The agreement of the writers of the holy Scriptures. There were in the Church Patriarches Prophets and Apostles: Amongst the Patriarches, Abraham was the cheefe; therefore the revelations made to the rest of the Patriarches, as to Isaack and to Iacob, had al∣wayes relation, to the promises made to Abraham. Amongst the Prophets Moyses was the cheefe, and therefore all the Prophets grounded themselves upon Moyses. And upon the revelations made to the Apo∣stles, the faith of the Church is grounded, under the New Testament: and yee shall never finde any contra∣dictions amongst these holy writers; there may seeme some contradiction amongst them, but indeed there is none. Epiphanius useth a good comparison to this purpose: when a man, saith he,Simile. is drawing water out of a deepe Well with two Vessels of a different metall; the water at the first seemeth to be of a different colour; but when he draweth up the Vessels nearer to him,Although there seeme some contradiction in the Scriptures, we should labour to reconcile them. this diversity of colours vanisheth, and the waters appeare both of one colour, and when we taste them, they have but one relish. So saith he, although at the first, there seeme some contradiction in the holy Scrip∣tures, yet when we looke nearer and nearer unto them, wee shall finde no contrarietie in them, but a perfect harmonie. When we see the Heathen history, or Apo∣cryphall Bookes contradicting the holy History, wee should stand for the holy Scriptures against them: but when wee see any appearance of contradiction in the Scriptures, we should labour to reconcile them: when Moyses saw an Aegyptian and an Israelite striving toge∣ther; he killed the Aegyptian, and saved the Israelite, Exod. 2.12. But when be saw two Israelits striving to∣gether, he laboured to reconcile them, saying, yee are brethren why doe yee strive. So when we see the Apo∣cryphall Bookes, or heathen History, to contradict the
Scriptures, we should kill the Aegyptian and save the Israelite. Example, Iacob cursed Simeon and Levi, for murthering of the Sichemites, Gen. 49.7. but Iudith bles∣sed Simeon for killing of them, Iudith 9. So Ieremiah saith, they shall returne in the third generation, Ier. 27.7. but Baruch saith, they shall returne in the seventh ge∣neration Baruch, 6. here let us kill the Aegyptian but save the Israelite: but when wee see any appearance of contradiction in the holy Scriptures, wee should labour to reconcile them, because they are breth∣ren. The heavenly order set downe in the Scriptures showeth them to be divine; there is in the Scriptures, Ordo naturae,Ordo naturae. conjugalis thori. historiae. dignitatis. Ordo conjugalis thori, Ordo historiae, & Ordo dignitatis; all these the Scriptures marke, and for sundry reasons setteth one before another: and although there be not prius & posterius in Scriptura (as the Iewes say) in respect of the particular occasions, yet there is still prius & posterius in respect of the generall end of the history. First, in setting downe the Patriarches, it ob∣serveth ordinem naturae, as they were borne; as Ruben in the first place, because he was the first borne; and then Simeon, thirdly Levi, and fourthly Iudah, &c. Se∣condly,The Tribes are set downe sometimes ac∣cording to their nativi∣ty, and sometimes as they were borne of free women. there is Ordo conjugalis thori, according to their birthes, and so the free womens sonnes, are set first in the Brestplace of Aaron, Exod. 28. Thirdly, there is Ordo dignitatis, as Sem is placed before Iaphet for dignitie, although he was younger. So the Scripture else where observeth this order, Matth. 13. He bringeth fourth new and old, & Ephe. 2. Apostles and Prophets. So the Scripture observeth the order of history, Matth. 1.1. The Booke of the generation of Iesus Christ, the Sonne of David the Sonne of Abraham. why is Abraham put last after Da∣vid? because the history is to begin at him. So 1 Chro. 3.5. Salomon is placed last amongst his brethren, because
the history was to begin at him: and if we shall marke the heavenly order that is amongst the Evangelists,The heavenly order a∣mongst the Evange∣lists hew the Scrip∣tures to be Divine. they will show us that the Scriptures are divine. Marke be∣ginneth at the workes of Christ. Matthew ascendeth higher, to the birth of Christ. Luke goeth higher, to the conception of Christ, and Iohn goeth highest of all, to the divinity of Christ and his eternall generation. Who would not admire here, the steps of Iacobs hea∣venly ladder, ascended from Ioseph to Adam, and from Adam to God. The matter contained in the Scriptures, shewes them to be divine, and to make a wonderfull change in man, which no other booke can doe, Iam. 4.6. The spirit in us lusteth after envie, yet the Scriptures offer more grace,The Scriptures offer grace to resist sinne. that is, the Scriptures offer grace and ability to doe more, then nature can doe: Nature cannot heale a Spirit, that lusteth after envie, or after money or after uncleanesse; but the Scriptures offer more grace to overcome any of these sinnes, be they never so strong. The Law of the Lord is perfect converting the soule, Psal. 19.17. when it is dead in sinne, it quickneth and reviveth it againe; and when it is decayed in grace,The Word of God is a restorer of the spi∣rituall life. it restoreth it againe, even as Boaz is sayd to be a resto∣rer of the life of Naomi, and a nurisher of her old age, Ruth 4.15. The rebukes and threatnings of the holy Ghost in the Scriptures, fall never to the ground in vaine, but take alwayes effect, when people stand out against them. And as Ionathans bow did never turne backe, and the Sword of Saul never returned empty, 2 Sam. 1.22. So the Arrowes of the King are sharpe to pierce his ene∣mies, Psal 45.5. Ioh. 10.35. The Scriptures cannot be broken, the argu∣ments set downe in the Scripture, are so strong; that all the heretickes in the world could never breake them,
and they stand like a brasen wall against all oppositions; therefore the Lord challengeth men to bring forth their strongest reasons. Esa. 41.21. produce your cause saith the Lord, bring forth your strong reasons saith the King of Iacob. Ecclesia subtestatur.The Church is the Pillar of Truth, shee holdeth out the Truth to be seene, shee expoundeth and interpret∣eth the Scriptures; yet her testimony in but an inducing testimony, and not a perswading testimony: shee can teach the Truth, but shee cannot seale up the truth in our hearts, and make us to beleeve the Truth of the Scripture.Actus exercitus. signatus. Her testimony is but in actu exercito, but non signato. Her testimony is informativum, sen directivum, it informeth and directeth us, sed non certificativum & terminativum fidei; that is, shee cannot perswade us of the Truth by her Testimony. Testimonies of these also, who are without the Church prove the Scriptures to be Divine, and these are of two sorts; eyther Heretickes, or Infi∣dels. Hereticks prove the Scripture to be Divine, ex accidente.First, the testimonies of Heretickes prove the Scrip∣tures to be Divine; for Heretickes labour alwayes to ground themselves upon the Scriptures. The habite goeth alwayes before the privation, & omne falsum in∣nititur vero, every falshood laboureth to cover it selfe under the Truth. When the Husbandman had sowne his good seede, then came the evill one and did sow his Tares: when Heretickes labour to ground themselves upon the Scriptures; it is, as when a theefe goeth to cover himselfe under the pretence of Law. This argu∣eth the Law to be just and equall. The testimonies also of the Heathen history proveth the Scriptures to be Divine. Observe the discent of the Babylonian and Assyrian Kings, and looke backe againe to the holy Scriptures: yee shall see clearely, how they jumpe with
the Scriptures: and as those who sayle along the Coast, have a pleasant view of the Land;Simile. but those who stand upon the Land, and behold the Shippes sayling along the Coast,Succession of Heathen Kings proved out of the Scripture. have a more setled and pleasant sight of the Shippes: so when we looke from the Heathen history, and marke the discent of the Heathen Kings, wee shall see a pleasant sight: but a farre more delectable and sure sight, when we looke from the Scriptures, to the Heathen history. Marke the discent; Belochus the third called Pul King of Assyria came against Menahem, and tooke his sonne, 2 King. 15. Then Pileser called Tiglath, came against Hoshea, King of Samaria, and tooke him in the sixt yeare of the reigne of King Ezekias▪ and then Shalmanefer, who caried away the ten Tribes into cap∣tivity, in the ninth yeare of Hoshea, 2 King. 17. and his sonne Sennacherib, 2 King. 18. came against Iuda, in the foureteenth yeare of Zedekias, and Esarhaddon succee∣ded his father Sennacherib, and his sonne Berodach-bala∣don, sent letters and a present to Hezekias, then Be∣rodach, 2 Chro. 33. caried away Iechonias, and then Nebu∣chadnezzer caried away Zedekias; then Nabuchadnezzer the great, burnt Ierusalem, and caried away the people captive. Then Evil Merodach, who succeeded him had three sonnes, Ragasar, Babasar and Belshassar, of whom we reade Dan. 5. and in Belshassers time, the kingdome was translated to the Medes and Persians. Here we see the descent of the Heathen history, agreeing with the holy Scriptures. There are other testimonies of the Heathen,How the Heathen testimonies prove the Scriptures to be divine. to prove the Scripture to be Scripture, but not so clearely; when we finde the rubbish of some old monuments, wee ga∣ther that there hath beene some great building there: So when we finde some darke footesteps of holy Scrip∣ture amongst the Heathen, we may gather, that once the holy Scriptures have beene read amongst them,
although they have depraved and corrupted them. Mntan. in his Essayes.Example 1. They of the East Indians have this fa∣ble amongst them, that the Gods drowned the world for sinne, and that they tooke some just men, and put them up in the clifts of Rockes, to save them: those men to try whether the waters were abated or not; sent forth some mastive Dogges, and the Dogges returning as cleane as they went out; they gathered by this, that the waters were not yet abated: they sent them forth the second time, then they returned full of mudde, by this they gathered that the waters were abated: then they sent them forth the third time and they returned no more. Here we see how this fable is taken out of the history of the deluge, and from Noahs sending forth the Dove out of the Arke; and that this history was knowne of old amongst the Heathen, we may per∣ceive because the Dove and the Raven are called the messengers of the Gods, by the Heathen Po∣ets. Example 2. Gen. 36.24. This is Anah who found out Hajemim mules, in the Wildernesse, others reade it Iamin waters: now because it was hard to finde out the right translation of the word, some translating it Mules, and some translating it Water: the Heathen made up a no∣table lye on the Iewes, saying; when Anah was feeding his Asses in the Wildernesse, because the Mules and Asses found out water in the Wildernesse for them to drinke,Tacitus. lib. 5. Plutarch. in symposiasis. 4. cap. 5. therefore the Iewes worshipped the golden head of an Asse: see how some shaddow of holy histo∣ry was still amongst the Heathen. Example 3. When the destroying Angell destroyed the first borne of their children, & beasts in Aegypt, the Lord caused to sprinkle the blood of the paschall Lamb, upon the Lintels of the doores, that so their first borne might be saved,Epipha. contra haerefes. lib. 18. Exod. 12.13. Epiphanius re∣cordeth
that the Egyptians afterwards, although they had forgotten the history of the worke of God, yet they rub'd over their Cattell with a red sort of Keill, to save them that no evill should befall them that yeare, ignorantly counterfeitting that blood, which saved the Israelites once in Egypt: which fable letteth us to under∣stand, that this Scripture was once taught amongst them. Example 4. Plato did hold that in the revolution of so many yeares, men should be just in the same estate, wherein they were before; which is drawne obscurely from the resurrection, when we shall be in , as we were in  Matth. 19.28. Example 5. Clemens Alexandrinus and Basill note,The Heathen grounded many of their fables up∣on the Scriptures. that the Heathen Philosophers did make their fables, counterfeitting the Scriptures; and founded their false∣hoods upon the truth of God, that men might give cre∣dit to their lies: as upon this, Ionas was swallowed up by the Whale; they made up this fable of Arion, sit∣ting upon a Delphin, and playing upon an harpe, and a thousand such. The Conclusion of this is.  Seeing the Scriptures are Divine, we must pray with David, Psal. 119.18. open thou mine eyes, that I may behold the wondrous things out of thy Law in the originall it is, Devolue ab oculis meis velamen, scilicet, caliginis, and let us be diligent sear∣chers and dwell in them, as Paul biddeth Timothy,  Panormitan writeth of Alphonsus King of Arragon, that in the midst of all his princely affayres, hee read over the Bible fourteene times, with the glosse and commentaries upon it. The Iewes say, let a man divide his life in three parts; a third part for the Scriptures, a third part for mishneth, and a third part for gemara, that is, two for the Talmud, and one for the Scriptures, see how well they were exercised in reading of the Law.
EXERCITAT. X. Jn what languages the Scriptures were written ori∣ginally. Gen. 11.1. And the whole earth was of one language and of one speech. THe Old Testament was written originally in He∣brew, and the New Testament in Greeke. In what character the Scriptures were writ∣ten at the first.The Character, in which the Old Testament was written first, was the Samaritane Character; It was cal∣led the Samaritane Character, not because the Samari∣tans used it first, but because it was left to the Samari∣tans after the Iewes refused it. This Samaritane Character was the first Character as may be seene by the inscriptions upon their shekels set downe by Arius Montanus,Why called the Sama∣ritane character. Beza, and Willet upon Ezekiel. And sundry of the Iewes ancient monuments have these letters upon them. The Character at the first was the Iewes and not the Samaritans,The inscriptions upon the Shekels, shew the Sa∣maritane character to be the first. as is proved by the inscriptions of the she∣kels. The inscription is this, Ierusalem hakkodesh; but no Samaritan would have put this inscription upon it: for they hated Ierusalem and the Iewes, therefore this in∣scription must bee the Iewes, and not the Samari∣tans. Secondly, most of these ancient shekels are found about Ierusalem,The Iewes kept the Samaritane character in the captivitie. therefore the shekel and letters upon it, was at the first the Iewes, and not the Samaritans. This Samaritane Character the Iewes kept still, in the time of the captivity, when Belshasser saw fingers wri∣ting upon the wall, Mene mene tekel, &c. Dan. 5.25. These
Characters were the Samaritan Characters: therefore the Babylonians could not reade them; because they knew not that Character neyther; could the Iewes un∣derstand the matter although they knew the letters: to the Babylonians, it was like a sealed booke; and to the Iewes it was like an open booke, to an unlearned man; because they understood it not, Esa. 29.11. But Daniel read it and understood it, both because he knew the let∣ters, and also understood the Chaldee tongue. Esdras changed this Character after the captivity,Hieron. in Perfat. lib. regum. and left it Idiotis, to the Samaritans: and he set downe this new Character, which before was the Chaldee, Character. The reason why he changed it, was this, because be∣ing long in the captivitie, they forgot their owne lan∣guage, that they could neyther reade it rightly, nor write it rightly: and therefore he changed the Chara∣cters, in these which we have now. But the ancient Samaritan Character seemeth to bee kept still in Lamina sacerdotali,Why Esdras changed the Character. in the plate of Gold which was upon the forehead of the Highpriest, after the captivity; for they might change noen of the or∣naments of the Highpriest. So neyther that which was written upon the plate of Gold, Kokesh Laihova, ho∣linesse to the Lord: because the Lord commanded these cloathes and ornaments, to be made for him, and his seede after him, Exod. 28.43.
The Inscription which was upon the Plate of Gold in the forehead of the Highpriest. The New Testament was written originally in the Greeke Character; and there were two translations of it, Syriacke and Arabicke; the Syriacke was written in the Syriacke Character, which differed much from that, which is called Alphabetum Salomonis, or the Character which Salomon found out. This Character Pineda setteth downe in his booke De rebus Salomonis. These diverse Characters may be seene set downe here, as followeth.
Character Antiquir Mo∣si sive Sama∣ritanorum. Recentior Sa∣maritanorum Hebraeorum sive Merubha Ezaerecen∣tior. Chaldaeorum antiquorum nunc Rabbino∣rum. Antiquorum Arabum, seu Alphabetum Salomonis. Arabum Recentior. Syrorum. Gracorum.
The Old Testament was originally written in the Hebrew tongue, and some of it in the tongues derived from the Hebrew, as Chaldee. We may know the Hebrew was the first originall tongue; because it hath fewest Radicall letters: what∣soever tongue is derived from thence, it addeth some letters to the first originall; as from the Hebrew word Galal, commeth Golgotha the Syriacke word. So Gabba∣tha Bethsaida, from Gabha and Chased. Secondly, that language which the Lord spake, to Adam, Abraham and Moyses, and they to him, must be the originall language. But God spake to them in the Hebrew, and he wrote the two Tables with his owne hand in this language. And thirdly, that language which expres∣seth the nature, of things, and their affections most clearely, and in fewest words; that must be the ori∣ginall language: but the Hebrew doth this; therefore it is the first language. The Iewes understood these tongues which had affinity with the Hebrew.These tongues which were Propagines and Dialects of the Hebrew, the Iewes understood them, when they heard them spoken, and when they read them, but they understood not the strange tongues, which had but small affinity with the Hebrew. When Laban and Iacob made a covenant; Laban called the heape of stones jegar Sagadutha in the Aramean tongue, which had small affinitie with the Hebrew; but Iacob called it Ga∣leed, Gen. 31.47. But if there was little affinity betwixt the Aramean language and the Hebrew, how is it that they say, 2. King. 18.26. Speake to thy servants in the Syrian language, for we understand it? The Hebrewes under∣stood not the Syrian language but by learning.They might understand it, for they were Courtiours and States men, and so learned it, as we learne now the Italians and French language. And Abrahams servant spake to Nachor in the Aramean language, hee being
borne in Damascus, which was in Cylo-Syria: and wee may thinke that Nachor and his house, understood the Hebrew tongue, being of the posterity of Heber, and keepe that tongue as Abraham did, who came out of Vr of the Chaldees. Assyria or Syria hebraice, Aram,The large extent of the Syrian language comprehended all Pa∣leslina, Damascus, the Kingdome of Assyria, Chaldea, baby∣lon, Arabia, Cylo-Lyria and Antiochia, Zoba, Adiabena, therefore all the languages which were spoken in these parts, tooke their generall denomination from Syria, as Syro-aramaea the language which Laban spake in Mesopo∣tania: Syro-Chaldaea or Babylonica was that which they spake in Babylon, Syro-Antiochena which they spake in Antioch or Phoenicia: although they were Propagines or Dialects of the Hebrew, yet they understood them not while they were taught: therefore Nabuchadnezzer cau∣sed to instruct the children of the Iewes in the Chaldee tongue, Dan. 1.4. but the Syro-Arabean and the Palestine or Cananitish language they might understand it; be∣cause it came nearer to their owne language. The Aegyptian tongue differed much from the He∣brew, Psal. 81.5. Ioseph heard a language in Aegypt,The Iewes understood not the Egyptian tongue. which he understood not. Ioseph here is put for the whole peo∣ple of the Iewes, because there was no affinity betwixt the Hebrew and the Aegyptian tongue, therefore they understood not this tongue. So Psal. 114.1. they depar∣ted from a people of a strange language, or a barbarous people: they called them all barbarous whom they understood not: and because the Iewes understood not the Aegyptian tongue, therefore Ioseph made him to speake to his brethren by an Interpreter, Genesis. 42.23. The Cananitish language,The Cananites lan∣guage a diolect of the Hebrew. was a daughter of the He∣brew tongue, or rather one, with the Hebrew tongue: and this we may perceive by the names of the townes;
men and places which were imposed to them by the Cananites; as Iericho, Salem, Kiriath-arba, Kiriath-Sepher, Beth-dagon▪ so the names of men, Melchizedeck, Adoni∣bezek, Abimelech. And if the Cananitish tongue, had not beene all one with the Hebrew, how could the Patri∣arches have kept conference with those in Canaan, and made their Bargaines and Contracts with them? this is cleare also by the example of Rahab, who could speake to the Spyes, and they understood her; and so Ioshua to the Gibionites. The Lord would have this tongue continued amongst the Cananites, because the Hebrewes were shortly to inhabite that land, and to converse with the Cananites for a while, untill they had rooted them out. Some of the Old Te∣stament written in the Chaldee tongue.There is some of the Old Testament written in the Chaldee tongue, which hath great affiance with the Hebrew: and some of it written in the Syrian dialect, as Iob, which the Idumeans used, and it differed little from the Hebrew tongue; but it differed much from the Syrian language now, but more from Arabia Ismae∣litica, which the Turkes speake now, in Asia and Africa. There are some words found in the Old Testament which are Egyptian, Gen. 41.43. Some Phaenitian, as Chabbul, 1 King. 9.13. Some Persian words as Pur, Esth. 9.24. and some moabitish. One Verse in Ieremie. originally written in the Chaldee tongue.There is one verse in Ieremy originally written in the Chaldee tongue, Ier. 10.11. whereas all the rest of that prophesie, is written in the Hebrew tongue. The gods that have not made the heaven and earth, even they shall pe∣rish from the earth, and from under these heavens. The rea∣son why this verse was written in the Chaldee tongue, was this; because the Iewes now, were to be carried to Babylon, and when they should be sollicitated there to worship their gods, they should answer them in their
owne language; cursed be your gods, for they made neyther heaven nor earth. That of Daniel and Ezra which is written in the Chal∣dee tongue, was transcribed out of the roules,Somethings taken of the registers of the Chaldeans, and in∣sert in the Scriptures. and re∣gisters of the Chaldeans; and insert in the bookes of God: but that which the holy Ghost indited originally to Daniel and Ezra, was written in the Hebrew tongue; the rest was borrowed but out of their registers, as first, Nebuchad-nezzers dreames, Dan. 2. So Nebuchad-nezzer setteth up a golden image, Cap. 3. So Nebuchad-nezzers dreame, Cap. 4. and Belshassers visions Cap. 5. all these were written in the Chaldee tongue: the se∣venth Chapter is onely excepted; it is written also in the Chaldee tongue although it was originally endited to Daniel: because it is a more cleare exposition of the monarchies revealed before to Nebuchad-neZZer, and Belshasser; and set downe in their owne Registers in the Chaldee tongue, but the eight Chapter and the rest, are wholly written in the Hebrew tongue, which were indited immediatly by God to Daniel, and not transcribed out of their registers as the rest were: So that part of Ezra which is written in the Chaldee tongue, is but transcribed and written out of the decrees, and let∣ters, of the Kings of Media, and Persia; from the eleventh verse of the fourth Chapter, to the seventh Chapter. The Chaldeans and Persians used to register, and keepe a Chronicle of all their memorable deedes, and what befell them: and so of their visions and dreames; and they caused to write them, and inter∣pret them; so did the Persians, Esth. 9.32. and Daniel wrote these visions in the Chaldee tongue, and he set them downe for the good of the Church; that they might understand, that their conditions should be un∣der the Heathish Kings.
Somethings in the Scriptures borrowed from the Heathen History.The holy Ghost borrowed somethings first from the Poets, and secondly, from the history of the Hea∣then; and the Secretaries of the holy Ghost insert them in the Booke of God. From the Poets; as Paul borrowed from Aratus, Menander, Epimenides or Callima∣chus, some verses; and inserted them in his Epistles. So the Scriptures borrow from the history, which were eyther Heathenish, or Iewish. Heathenish againe, were of two sorts; eyther Chaldean or Persian. Daniel borroweth from the Chaldeans: So from the history of the Persians, as that memorable history of the de∣liverance of the Iewes under Haman; was first written in the Persian language, Esth. 9.32. and he who wrote the Booke of Esther, borrowed the history out of that booke.Somethings in the Scripture borrowed from the Iewish History. These things which are borrowed from the Iewish history; as the facts of those registrate in the Bookes of the Maccabees, Heb. 11. So Iude out of the prophesie of Enoch, borrowed the history of the strife, betweene Michael and the Divell about the body of Moyses. So the Apostle Heb. 11. out of the traditions of the Iewes, borroweth, that Esay was cut with a saw under Menasse. So there are sundry proverbiall spee∣ches in the Talmud, as, Cast out the beame which is in thine owne eye, and then thou shalt see chearely to cast out the mote that is in they neighbours eye, Matth. 7.5. So it is easi∣er for a Camell to goe thorow the eye of a Needle, Matth. 19.24. So it is hard to kicke against prickes, Act. 9.5. Some of our Divines, to prove that the Apocryphall Bookes are not Canonicall Scripture, use this midst; because they are not cited by the Apostles, in the New Testa∣ment: but this is false, for the Apostle citeth them, Heb. 11. And Scaliger in his Eusebianis,See Scaliger Euseb. Pag. 245. proveth out of Geor∣gius Cyncellus that the Apostle citeth many testimonies out of the Apocryphall Bookes, and out of the traditi∣ons of the Iewes. As Matthew, that Salmon maried Ra∣hab.
Salmon, his genealogie is set downe, 1 Chro. 2. but not whom he maried, this Matthew had by traditi∣on, Matth. 1.5. Things in the Heathen history, which are not neces∣sary to be knowne to the Church: the Scripture pas∣seth by them, and remitteth us to Heathen History, and saith still; The rest are they not written in the bookes of the Chronicles of Iuda and Israel? and when the knowledge of them is necessary to the Church; it borroweth them out of the Heathen history, and inserteth them in the booke of God. These things which were written out of the Iewish,Heathen sentences were sanctified by the Apo∣stles when they cited them. or Heathenish history were not sanctified; untill they were insert in the booke of God: therefore Tertullian writing to his Wife, and citing that verse, Evill speeches corrupt good manners, 1 Cor. 15.33. saith, Memor illius versiculi sanctificati per Apostolum, the Apostle sanctified this verse when hee borrowed it from the Heathen. And as a woman that was Heathenish, when she became a Proselyte, shee might enter into the con∣gregation, and a Iew might marry her: so these Iewish and Heathenish histories, God sanctified them, that they might enter into the Congregation and become holy Scriptures, and so the holy Spirit sweetned the salt waters of Iericho, that the children of the Prophets might drinke of them, 2 Kings. 2.21. There are many proper names set downe in the Scriptures which are not Hebrew names,Many names in the Scriptures which are not Hebrew names. but some of them are Chaldee, some Assyrian and some Per∣sicke names, Ier. 39.3. And all the princes of the King of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle-gate, even Nergal-Sharezer, Samger Nebo, Sersechim, Rabsaris, Nergal Sharezer, Rabmag, with all the residue of the Princes of the King of Babylon. And that wee may know
what names are Chaldee names, what Syriacke and what Persicke. Marke this Table following, concer∣ning these names, and the composition of them, taken out of Scaliger.   Nomina propria Chaldaeorum. 1 Nebo vel lebo 2 Nego 3 Mero 4 Schech chach. 5 Meschach 6 Sadrach 7 Letzar, retzar net∣zar 8 Shetzar 9 Metzar 10 Nergal 11 Belti 12 Adan 13 Hevil 14 Ochri 15 Chen 16 Bel 17 Shech 18 Phil 19 Mit 20 Dach 21 Zar 22 Phal 23 Pad 24 Chad   Exempla   Nebuchad nezzar ex 1. 24. 7.   Hevil-mero-dach ex 13 3. 20.   Nebo-zir-adan ex 1 21. 12.   Nomina propria Assyriorum. 1 Shadran 2 Shalman 3 Teglath 4 Horib 5 Haddon 6 Neschroth 7 Adar 8 Etzer vel atzer 9 Asar 10 Ballat 11 Osen, the vel Osu 12 Chuschan 13 Sen 14 Phul 15 Phar 16 Shar   Exempla   Salman-asser ex 2. 9.   Assar-haddon ex 9. 5.   Sen-ballat ex 13. 10.   Sen-cherib ex. 13. 4.   Teglath-phul-asor ex 3. 14. 9.   Nomina propria Persarum. 1 Ari 2 Thir 3 Thiri 4 Mithri 5 Pharsam 6 Phar 7 Esther 8 Zero 9 Datha 10 Sai 11 Manai 12 Stha the 13 Dai 14 Ham 15 Wai 16 Va 17 Zata 18 Arth atha 19 Achos ochos 20 This 21 Thena 22 Sethra 23 Thra 24 Ku, vel Kau 25 Ros, vel rus 26 Kana   Exempla   Mithri-dates ex 4. 9.   Achos-va-rosh. ex 19. 16. 25.
How shall we discerne in what language a booke was written? There be two speciall notes whereby wee may di∣scerne this; the first is Interpretation,  and the second is Allusion. First is Interpretation, when the Spirit of God inter∣preteth a strange word, into another tongue;To know in what language a booke was written.  then the booke was written in that language, in which the word is interpreted. Example, Esth. 9. Pur this Persicke word is interpreted by the Hebrew goral, therefore the booke was written in the Hebrew, and not in the Per∣sicke tongue by Mordecai, or by him who else wrote the booke. Example 2. Abba Pater, Rom. 8.15. Abba is the Syriack word, and Pater the Greeke word, because Abba is interpreted by Pater, therefore the Apostle hath written this Epistle in Greeke, and not in Syriack. And so Thomas is called Didymus; Ioh. 11.16. therefore the Gospel of Iohn was written originally in Greeke, Contracte and not in Hebrew. gemelli. So Heb. 7.2. Melchisedeck the King of Salem, first, by interpretation King of righteousnesse, gemi us . and after that King of peace. The word Melchesedick which is one word, for the understanding of the Graecising Iewes he divideth it in two, and showeth in Greeke,Act. 1.8. Elimas by interpretation Magus, this word Magus is degenerate in a Greeke word, therefore this booke was written in Greeke. that Salem signifieth peace, and Zedek Iustitia, righteous∣nesse; as if hee would say, frugifer, qui fert fructum, cor∣nifer, qui fert cornua: here because the interpretation is in Greeke; we may know that this Epistle hath beene written originally in Greeke. The second note, to know in what language bookes have beene written, is by the Allusion of words in the Scriptures. for there are many allusions in the He∣brew, and in the Chaldee tongue, when they are tran∣slated in the Greeke or any other language they loose that grace, as Cabhal is ▪ and Cbhel is ▪ Cobal apud Targumislos est caligare,E egans Paranomasia apud Thargumslos inter hal & Cebhe. but Ioh. 1.5.
. And the light shined in darkenesse, and the darkenesse comprehended it not; Here the sweet allusion which is in the Chaldee, perisheth in the Greeke. So Ioh. 10.1. . the Syriacke expresseth it by a sweet allusion Min tirghna letira, which is not in the Greeke,Eegans paranomasia apud Syro inter tirghna & tira. where the words fall alike which will not fall out in other languages. There was a question betwixt Origen and Africanus, whether the history of Susanna was written in Hebrew or in Greeke. Africanus de∣nyed that it was written in Hebrew, but in Greeke, and he proved it thus. When Daniel examined the Witnesses who testified against Susanna, he tooke the witnesses a part and enquired at one of them, under what tree hee saw her commit that villanie? he said it was , the Lentish tree; then Daniel alluding to this sayd, , The Angel of God hath received sentence of God to cut thee in peeces.. Divido seco findo So he inquired at the other, under what tree he saw her;. Serra divido seco. he answered, , Vnder a Prime tree. Then Daniel sayd , The Angel of the Lord waited with the sword to cut thee in two. Africanus by this allusion of words gathered, that this history was not originally written in Hebrew, but in Greeke. The Conclusion of this is, the Old Testament was first written in Hebrew. This was the first language by which the Lord spake to the Patriarches, and in which the Angels spake to men, and it was the lan∣guage which all the world spake before the confusion of Babylon, and it is the mother tongue from whence ma∣ny other tongues are derived, and it is holden by some, to be that tongue, in which we shall speake one to ano∣ther in the life to come. Therefore we should be de∣syrous to understand this holy language.
EXERCITAT. XI. Of the Stile of the Scriptures. Ioh. 7.46. Never man spake like this man. VVHen we describe a mans speech, first we de∣scribe it by that which is naturall, as whe∣ther he be , of a weake voyce,. or  of a slow tongue. Secondly, in what language hee speaketh. Thirdly, in what Dialect he speaketh. Fourth∣ly, whether it be Soluta oratio or . Fiftly, the Pro∣perty of the speech. Sixtly, the Evidence of the speech. Seventhly, the Fulnesse of the speech. Eighthly, the Shortnesse of the speech. Ninthly, the Coherence, and lastly the Efficacie of the speech. First, we describe that which is naturall, and procee∣deth from some defect of the organs, as if he spake with a weake voyce, or be of a stammering tongue, or thicke lippes, which Exod. 6.12, are called Vncircum∣cised lippes: Contrary to this is a thinne lippe which is a signe of Eloquence, Iob. 12.20. for these who have thinne lippes, commonly are Eloquent. Moses the Penman of the holy Ghost, although he was defective in speech; yet read his writings, and yee shall see such eloquence in him, that no Heathen could ever match it,The writers of the Scriptures although weake in person yet powerfull in words. and as it is sayd of Paul, when he was present in person he was weake, 2 Cor. 10.10. and his speech base and con∣temptible yet his letters were weighty and powerfull: so whatsoever want or infirmity was in Moyses per∣son, yet there was no want or defect in his wri∣tings.
Secondly, in what language hee speaketh. The holy Ghost spake and wrote in Hebrew in the Old Testa∣ment,The Old Testament was written in He∣brew, and the New in Greeke. and in the New in Greeke. Hee wrote the Old Testament in Hebrew, a language which had this bles∣sing spoken of in the Law, Deut. 28.12. Thou shalt lend and not borrow, so this language lendeth to many Nations, but borroweth of none. Hee wrote the New Testa∣ment in Greeke,The Hebrew tongue lendeth to many, but borroweth of none. a most copious and fertile tongue, which was then Lingua communis to the Iewes although not vulgaris. Thirdly, in what Dialect he speaketh. The Dialects of the Hebrew tongue were sundry, first, Dialectus Hie∣rosolymitana, that Dialect which was spoken in Ierusa∣lem and about it, Ast. 1.19. . In their owne Dialect, or proper tongue. So the Dialect of the Ephra∣mites, who sayd, Sibboleth & not Shibboleth, Iudg. 12.6. and the Dialect of the Galileans, as Peter spake in the Gali∣lean Dialect, Matth. 26.73. So in the new Testament there are sundry Dialects as Ionick, Dorick Attick, &c. Fourthly, whether it be in prose or in verse. The Iewes divide the Old Testament according to the style into Charuz; rithmum; Shir carmen, & Halatza, Oratio∣nem solutam, that is prose. Rithmus.CharuZ is Soluta oratio, but in fiue Rithmo colligata; that is, it beginneth in prose, but endeth as it were in mee∣ter, such is Iob. Carmen.Shir, canticum; writen in meeter, as the Psalmes and Canticles. Oratio solutaHallatza, written in prose; such are the Histories and the most of the prophets. Fiftly, the property of the speech. The phrase in Hebrew is much to be observed, for in the Hebrew it will signifie one thing, and in other languages, ano∣ther thing.
Example, Num. 19.20. Dies numeri,Dies numeri quid apud Hebraeos. signifieth A few dayes, so Homines numeri, Gen. 34 30. A few men, Deut. 4.27. Ezek. 12.16. So Esay 10.19. The rest of the Trees of his Forrest shall be number, that a child may write them, that is, They shall be few. In other languages this phrase would signifie many men, and many trees, &c. So some phrases of the Scripture have a contrary signification with the Hebrews,Some phrases with the Hebrewes have a con∣trary signification. as Zack. 11.24. Ascendit visio a me, that is, It perished. So Ier. 47.15. Moab is spoyled and gone up out of her Cities, that is, Shee is destroyed. Sometimes againe it signifieth to waxe and increase, as 1 King. 22.35. Bellum ascendit, The battell increased. So Psal. 74.23. The tumult that arise up against thee ascendeth, that is, Increaseth continually. So Levare peccatum is to take off the burden of sinne, Exod. 10.17. and Iohn alludeth to this, 1.29. Behold the Lambe of God that taketh away the sinnes of the world. Lapidare. Elapidare And Levare peccatum, Is to take up the burden of sinne, Levit. 5.1. So Sakal, Lapidare & Elapidare, signifieth ey∣ther to cast stones upon a thing, as Deut. 22.24. or to take away the stones out of a place, as Esa. 62.10. Another example, I am like a drunken man whom the wine hath gone over, Ier. 23.9. that is, whom the wine hath overcome, but Matth. 26.39. Let this cuppe passe over me, that is, let it not touch me; in a contrary significa∣tion. So Gen. 25.18. Cecidit coram fratribus suis, He dyed in presence of his brethren,The New Testament useth often times the Hebraismes of the Old but the Seventi translated it , He dwelt before his brethren. The New Testament usually followeth these He∣braismes of the Old Testament as Hos. 8.8. A vessel in which there is no pleasure, Rom. 9.21. A vessell of dishonour. So 1 Sam. 21.5. The vessels of the young men are holy, 1 Thess. 4.4. That yee may know to possesse your vessels in holinesse. So Exod. 1.8. there arose a new King in Aegypt who knew not Ioseph, Matth. 11, 11. there arose not a grea∣ter then Iohn the baptist.
So in the New Testament there are many peculiar phrases which are found in no other Greeke writers, and here we must distinguish inter Hellenisimum & Grae∣cismum.Difference betwixt Hellenismum & Graecismum. Hellenismus quid. Hellenismus is that sort of phrase which the Se∣venty use, for they translating the Scriptures for the use of the grecizing Iewes, followed the Hebrew Chaldee and Syriacke in many things:The Seventy follow the Hebrew, Chaldee and Syriacke in many things. so that they have a pecu∣liar stile which is not to be found in other Greeke wri∣ters, example  in the New Testament signifieth wrath and poyson Reve. 18.3. Ex vino veneni, that is, poysoned wine. ira. venenum. So Iob 4.6. The reason of this is, be∣cause Hhema in the Hebrew, signifieth both wrath and poyson. Another example, 1 Cor. 5.45. Death is swallow∣ed up into victory: the Seventy hath it  In perpetuum, but  doth not signifie perpetuum amongst the Hea∣then,Amos 8.7. and 2 Sam. 2.26. Lament 5.20. why doe they then translate it, For ever? because the word Netzahh, Victoria. & Aeternitas. signifieth both Victory and Eternitie. A third example, Gen. 8.21. Dixit ad eor suum dominus; but the Chaldee saith, Bemeria  which phrase the Evangelist Iohn followeth; but this is not a phrase used amongst the Greekes. A fourth example, Give us this day, our daily bread, Matth. 6.11. The Greeks say,  Panem quotidianum, but the Syriacke hath it , Crastinum panem, that bread which may feede us to day and to morrow. So Iam. 4.6. The Lord exalteth the humble, but according to the Hebrew and Syriacke phrase, to Exalt, is to lift up on the Crosse, Ioh. 8.28. When yee have lift up the Sonne of man, or exalted the Sonne of man, that is, lifted him up on the Crosse. These parti∣cular phrases used by the Seventy would be marked. And besides these,The simplicity of the stile of the Scripture is admirable. if we shall looke more nearely to the stile of the Scripture, as to the simplicity of it, then we shall much more admire it, 1 Cor. 2.4. My preaching was not with inticing words of mans wisedome, but in de∣monstration of the Spirit, and of power.
Againe the Evidence of the stile, oculata fides cum quis ipse videt. the judgements of God are set downe, so wisely in the Scripture, as if a man were looking on with his eyes, this is called  by the Greekes, as we may see in the deludge, the overthrow of Sodome, and the miracles in the Wilder∣dernesse, set downe so clearely before us, as if we had beene eye witnesses of them. See a notable example, Psal. 7.12.13. By a borrowed kind of speech he setteth forth the judgements of God which were to over take the wicked, as if we were looking on. If he turne not he will whet his Sword, he hath bent his bow, and made it rea∣dy, he hath also prepared for him the instruments of death: he hath ordained his arrowes against the persecutors. Eightly, the Fulnesse of the speech.. The Greekes call this  wherein nothing is wanting, neyther in the enumeration of the parts,The holy Ghost setteth downe all circumstan∣ces belonging to the purpose whereof hee intreateth. or explication of the causes, or reciting of the circumstances: for the holy Ghost setteth downe all the circumstances belonging to the purpose. So the Apostle Rom. 1. describeth at large the vanity and impiety of the Gentiles. And Rom. 2. the hypocrisie of the Iewes, and Cap. 3. he ma∣keth a full description of the corruptions of man, recko∣ning up the parts. There is none righteous, no not one, vers. 10. There is none that understandeth, there is none that seeketh after God, vers. 11. They are all gone out of the way, they are altogether become unprofitable, there is none that doth good, no not one, Vers. 12. Their throate is an open Sepulcher, with their tongues have they used deceit, the poyson of Aspes is under their lippes, Vers. 13. Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitternesse, Vers. 14. Their feete is swift to shed blood, Vers. 15. Destruction and misery are in their wayes, Vers. 16. And the way of peace they have not knowne, Vers. 17. And there is no feare of the Lord before their eyes, Vers. 18. Ninthly, the Shortnesse of the speech: and here we
cannot enough admire the fulnesse of the stile and the shortnesse of it,Every word of the Scripture carrieth a weight. & that which Cicero sayd of Thucycides may here be applyed fitly, Eum esse adeo plenum refer∣tum{que} rebus, ut prope verborum numerum, numero rerum exaquet, That every word carried a weight with it, and therefore we may call it Laconica Scriptura. All things in the Scrip- are fitly joyned.Tenthly, the Coherence: all things in the Scriptures are fitly joyned and coupled together. The Heathen sayd that there were three things unpossible, Eripere, Iovi fulmen, Herculi clavam & Homero versum; to pull Iupiters Thunder-bolt out of his hand, Hercules Club out of his hand, and a verse from Homer: for they thought, that there was such a connexion betweene Homers verses, that not one verse could be taken away without a great breach in the whole worke: but this may bee much more sayd of the Scriptures of God which have such a dependance and connexion, that if yee take away but one verse, the whole shall be mar∣red. But it may be sayd that there are sentences which seeme not to cohere or agree fitly together, Gen. 48.7. And as for me when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the Land of Canaan in the way, when there was but yet a little way to come to Ephrath, and I buried her there in the way of Ephrath, the same is Bethlehem, Vers. 8. And Israel beheld Iosephs sonnes. How doth this cohere with that which goeth before; it would seeme that there is no dependance here. They cohere well enough with the words going be∣fore;How sentences in the Scripture seeming to disagree cohere very well. for Iacob had adopted two of Iosephs children, then hee giveth the reason of this adoption in these words; as if he should say, whereas I might have had moe children by my first wife Rachel, if shee had lived; it is great reason that I supply this defect in her, by placing some in sted of these children, which she might
have borne to me; and I adopt those thy sonnes since she is dead. The second place which seemeth to have no cohe∣rence with things going before, Esa. 39.21. Take a lumpe of sigges, and lay it for a plaister unto the boyle and he shall recover, vers. 22. Ezekias also had sayd what is the signe, that I shall goe up into the house of the Lord. What coherence is betwixt these words, and the words going before? There is a right coherence here, and hee setteth downe that last, which was first for brevities cause; which is more at large set downe in the booke of the Kings; and therefore Iunius translateth it well, Vajo ner, In plusquam perfecto, Esay had sayd. Ier. 40.1.  The word which came to Ieremiah from the Lord, &c.  The words following seeme not to cohere with the former. The beginning of the fortieth Chapter, with the se∣venth Verse of the fortiesecond Chapter, and these things which are insert betweene them, doe containe but the occasion of the prophesie, to wit; when Godo∣liah was killed, the rest of the Iewes would have gone into Aegypt, which Ieremiah forbiddeth them to doe. And it came to passe ten dayes after, Chap. 42. 7, &c. This should be joyned with the first Verse of the fortieth Chapter, and all the rest should be included in a paren∣thesis. As we have spoken of the stile of the Scripture in generall, so let us observe the stile of some of the writers in particular. Esayes stile differed much from the stile of Amos, he being a Courtiour, and he but a Neat-herd. So the stile of Ezekiel differed from the stile of the rest of the Prophets: he calleth himselfe The Sonne of man, not because it is a Chaldee phrase, but because of the excellent visions which he saw, therefore
he is called the Sonne of man, that is, an excellent man; as Iesus Christ in the New Testament is called The Son of man, that is, an excellent man. So this is peculiar to Iohn the Evangelist, to call Christ the Sonne of God , for the Chaldees and the Talmud usually call him so: Iohn opposed himselfe to Ebion and Cerinthus two Iewes who denyed the divinity of Christ, wherefore he hath usually the word , 1 Ioh. 7.5. which was frequent in the Chaldee paraphrast, and read often by the Iewes. So there are some things peculiar to Paul; for hee useth some words according to the manner of the speech in Tarshish and Cilicia, as Collos. 2.18.  in their language, signifieth insidiose alteri praeripere pal∣mam. So 1 Cor. 4.3. Mans day according to the phrase of Tarshish, is put for the time of judgement; because they had some appointed times for judgement. The Conclusion of this is, here we may admire the wisedome of God, who gave most excellent gifts to his Secretaries for the edification of his Church. Moses was a man of a slow speech,God gave excellent gifts to his Secretaries, for the good of his Church and of a slow tongue, and Aaron must be his spokesman, Exod. 4. Yet Moyses was mighty in words and deeds, Act. 7.22. It is sayd of Paul that his bo∣dily presence was weake, but his letters were weighty, 2 Cor. 10.11. By his preaching he converted many, from Ie∣rusalem to Illiricum, Rom. 15.19. but by his letters hee converted moe,Paul converted moe by his writing, than by his preaching. both in Europe Africa and Asia; such was the majesty and grace in his writing, that they ac∣knowledged it to be from the Lord.
EXERCITAT. XII. That the Hebrew Text is not corrupted. Psal. 119.140. Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it. THe Church of Rome,The Church of Rome maketh the vulgar Latin translation to be cano∣nicall. that they may advance the au∣thority of the vulgar Latine translation, which they have made canonicall; doe labour to disgrace the ori∣ginall Text, the Hebrew and Greeke,Controvers. 1. Gordonij. cap. 9. holding that they are corrupt in many things. Master Iames Gordon our Country man, observeth foure distinct periods of time. The first period, he maketh to bee the Iewes Synagogue before Christ came in the flesh; he granteth that all this time, the Hebrew Text was not corrupted by the Iewes. The second period of time he maketh to be from the ascen∣sion of Christ untill the dayes of Hierome and Augu∣stine, and he saith, that in this second period, the Iewes went about to corrupt the translation of the Se∣venty: because the Christians then began to use argu∣ments taken out of that translation against them, as Iustine Martyr testifieth, writing against Tripho. The third period he maketh to be after the death of Saint Hierome, untill the time that the Talmud was compo∣sed and set together, and then he saith, there arose great contention betwixt the Orientall and Occidentall Iewes: (the Orientall Iewes were those who dwelt upon the East side of Euphrates in Babylon Media & Persia,What Iewes were called orientall, and what oc∣cidentall. those Peter called the Church at Babylon, 1 Pet. 5.13. The Occi∣dentall Iewes were those to whom he wrote, Scattered abroad in Pontus Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, 1
Pet. 1.1.) because of the diversity of their reading, and corruptions in the Text. He saith that the Iewes met at Tiberias, Anno 508. and there set downe the Points; and made their Masora; to obviat this, that no more corruption should enter into the Text. The fourth pe∣riod he maketh to be after the Iewes had met at Tibe∣rias; they decreed that none should use any copy, but such as were corrected by the Masoreth: and so from this time he freeth the Text from corruption: but hee laboureth much to prove that the Hebrew Text was corrupt before, and that the vulgar Latine is sound and free from corruption, which was translated by Saint Hierome under Pope Damasus; and so continued in the Church of Rome.The Iewes kept faith∣full the booke of God without corruption. The Iewes to whom The Oracles of God were committed, Rom. 3.2. (therefore it was called Their Law, Ioh. 8.17.) would they have corrupted their owne Evidents? Au∣gustine calleth the Iewes Capsarios nostros, who faithful∣ly kept the booke of God, and reserved it unto us without corruption, & he saith, Dispersos esse Iudaeos, infi∣delesut testarentur Scripturas esse veras. The unbeleeving Iewes were scattered through the world, that they might testifie the Scriptures to be true:The Iewes numbred the Verses, Words and Letters of the Bible. and shall wee thinke that the Iewes would have corrupted the Text, who have numbred the words, letters, and verses of the Bible: and R. Zaddias hath numbred the letters words and verses, and summed up all the verses at the end of every booke, and they have observed that all the let∣ters are found in one verse, Zeph. 3.8. as also foure of the finall letters: they carry such respect to the Law, that if it but fall to the ground, they institute a fast for it.They would write no language but in He∣brew letters. The superstitious Iewes at this day, are so carefull to keepe the letters and words of the Law, that they will have neither Chaldee, Syriacke, nor Hebrew
words wrirten; but in Hebrew letters: and it greeved them when they saw in Origens Hexupla,Vide Guiliel. Schiekardum de jure regio. Hebrew words written in Greeke Characters, when they saw the co∣pie which was presented to Alexander the Great, having the name Iehova still written in Golden letters, they were much greeved at it, and when they see any thing changed in our copies now, in disdaine they call it, Hhomesh pesul shel gelahhim, that is, Pentateuchus rasorum Monachorum, the Pentateuch of the shaven Monkes. The Iewes after the death of Christ were dispersed among many Nations and they never met together againe: and albeit they would have corrupted the Scrip∣ture, how could they have falsified all the Co∣pies? Bellarmin maketh this objection to himselfe.Bellarm. lib. 2. Cap. 2. De verbo dei. Some men will say, that the Hebrew Text was corrupted after the dayes of Saint Hierome and Augustine. Hee answe∣reth, that Augustins reasons serve for all times against the corruption of the Hebrew Text:Serrarius in prolegom. Bibliacs. And Serrarius acknowledgeth, that there is but small or no corrupti∣on in the Hebrew Text,Corruptio Physica Mathemati∣ca Moralis. & he maketh a threefold cor∣ruption. The first Physicall, the second Mathematicall, and the third Morall. Physicall corruption he maketh to be this, when it wanteth any member which it should have. Mathematicall corruption hee maketh to bee this, when there are some faults in the print which we call . And a morall corruption he maketh to be this, when one of purpose goeth about to corrupt the Text, and in effect he commeth to this, that the errours which are found in the Text, are but errours in the print, and not in the matter. But now lately there is one risen up, called Morinus, who hath set himselfe to improve the originall Hebrew Text, and to preferre the Samaritan to it as the origi∣nall.
Difference betwixt hebraeo-samaritana, and hebraeo-samaritano-samaritana, in their Copies.We must put a difference betwixt Hebraeo-Samaritana and Hebraeo-samaritano-samaritana. Hebraeo-samaritana is that which Moyses wrote from the Lord and delive∣red to the Iewes, it is called Hebraeo-samaritana; because the Hebrew was written in the Samaritan Character at the first and so kept still till after the captivity; and this wee grant to be the first and originall writing by which the Church should be ruled. But that this Hebraeo-samaritano-samaritana should be the first originall; that in no way must we grant, and the reasons are these. Reasons to prove that the Samaritan copy is not the originall.First, the Samaritans were Idolaters they were brought out of Assyria by Salmanasses, and they erected a false worship in Iudea, for the which they were hated by the people of God, Ioh. 4. They branded them alwayes with these two letters, Gnaijn Zain, that is, pro  cultus alienus. strange worship. The Lord concredited his oracles to his owne people, Deut. 33.4. The Law is the inheri∣tance of the congregation of Iacob. Therefore the Law was not committed to their custodie, who were not Gods people, they had no right to his inheritance. Secondly, if the Samaritan copie were the originall, then it should follow that the Church hath wanted the true originall Text untill the yeare of God, 1626. when Petrus de Valle brought it from Damascus. The Samaritan Copie differed as much from the ori∣ginall,The Samaritan diffe∣reth as much from the originall, as the Seventy doe. as the Seventy doe, but none of them hold that the translation of the Seventy is the originall by which all others should be tryed, why then should they give this prerogative to the Samaritan Copie, to be the ori∣ginall? this Samaritan Copie addeth to the originall Text which was The inheritance of the Iewes, Deut. 33.4. and diminisheth also from it. It addeth to the originall Text, Iosh. 21. two Verses, 36.37. Verses. So Gen. 4. it addeth a long speech or conference betwixt Cain
and Abel which is not in the originall Text. So Targum Hierosolymitanum supplyeth the same 28. verses here, which are not in the originall Hebrew Text, a con∣ference betwixt Cain and Abel, whether there be any providence of God or not? or whether there be any reward for the just, or punishment for the wicked? Abel holdeth the affirmative, and Cain the negative part. But this note of the Masoreth in the margent should not be read this wayes, Pesu pesuki bimtzegno pesuk. Viginti octo versus desiderantur in medio hujus ver∣sus, There are twenty eight Verses wanting in the midst of this verse. But it should be read this wayes, Pesukim pasekin bimtzeghnoth pasuk, that is, There are twenty eight verses whose sense endeth in the midst of the verse: therefore when the Scripture saith that Cain talked with his brother, it was to perswade him to goe out to the field, and not that he had a long conference with him. Both the Samaritan Copie then, and the Targum of Ierusalem wrong the Text as defective, put∣ting in these 28. verses which the Spirit of God never indited. As it addeth to the originall Hebrew Text, so it di∣minisheth somethings from it, Hos. 4.11. I have called my Sonne out of Egypt. These words are not in the Samaritan Copie. So these words, Zach. 12.10. They shall behold him whom they pierced. If this Samaritan Copie were the originall Copie, what is the reason that Origen setteth it not downe in his Octupla, as hee hath done other translations? and what is the reason that Hierome never citeth it, nor followeth it in his translation, if it be the originall? Fiftly, the manner of the Samaritans writing sheweth that this was not the originall, wch Moses received from the Lord, and delivered to the people of God after∣wards, as you may perceive in the page following, out of Exod. 31. from vers. 12. to 18.
Exemplar Samari∣tanum.  Hebraiè sic.
Et dixit Iehova Mosi dicendo,Latinè sic. & tu al loquere filios Israel dicendo, nunc il la Sabbatha mea serua tote: quia signum est in terme & inter vos per generationes vestras ad cognoscēdū quod ego Iehova sanctificans vos. et observate Sabbathum quia sanc tum erit illis profanātes illud morte morietur, quia omnis faciens in illa opus utique excinde turanima il la emedio populorum suorum:s ex di ebus opera beris opus, & in die septimo Sabbathū sabbatulū sanctum Ie hovae: omnis faciens o-pus in die illo sabbathi morte morietur: & observanto filij Israel ipsum sabbathum, celebrando sabbathum per generationes suas faedere aeter no interme & inter filios Israel signum erit in aeternum: quia sex diebus fecit Iehoua caelum et terram & in die septimo quievit et respiravit Exod. 31.12.In English thus. And the Lord spake vnto Moses saying 13. Speake thou also unto the Children of Israel, saying, ve∣rily my Sabbaths shall ye keepe: for it is a Signe betweene me & you, throughout your generations, that yee may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctifie you. 14. Ye shall keepe the Sabbath therefore: for it is holy unto you: every one that defileth it, shall surely be put to death, for whosoever doth any worke therein, that Soule shall be cut off from amongst his people, 15. Sixe dayes may worke bee done, but in the Se∣venth is the Sabbath of rest, holinesse to the Lord, whosoever doth any worke in the Sabbath day hee shall surely bee put to death. 16. Wherefore the Children of Israel shall keepe the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their genera∣tions, for a perpetuall Covenant. 17. It is a signe betweene me and the children of Israel for ever: for in sixe dayes the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he re∣sted and was refreshed.
Observe the forme of this writing of the Samaritans and yee shall finde it to be meere Cabbalisticall, by which they would finde out the diverse readings, in framing the lines, words and letters, and setting them downe after such a curious forme, as the Cabbalists doe, by their Gematrija, notaricon, and temura: that is, by the number of letters, the diverse significations of them, and the diverse situation and placing of them, they make diverse senses in the Scriptures, as by elbham, and ethbhash; sometimes putting the last letters for the first, and the first for the last; sometimes reading up and downe; sometimes crosswayes, and sometimes from the left hand to the right: this we may see in this example of the Samaritan Copie, where they summe up the observation, the breach, and punishment of the Sabbath in a round circle; which curiosity the Spirit of God never used in writing the holy Scriptures. Christ speaking of the originall Text, and the per∣petuity of the Law which we have, he saith, One jote, or one title of the Law shall not passe, in the originall it is,  answerable to the Hebrew Iod; and , which is not properly translated, A tittle, as if it made a diffe∣rence betwixt some letters, as the top of Daleth from Resh: for the Syriacke calleth it Sharat, incisura vel incisio, the small lines which are in ones hand. The meaning is then, that not one part of a letter, neyther the least letter, nor any part of the least letter shall pe∣rish, hence we may reason from Christs words. In that copie whereof the Lord speaketh,  or Iod must be the least letter; but in the Samaritan copie Iod is not the least, but the biggest of all the Letters: therefore the Samaritan copie, is not that copie which Christ spake of,י Hebrae. but the Hebrew as we may see by the difference of the Letters in the margent here: Samarit. hence we may gather that this Samaritan letter was abolished in Christs
time, and therefore wee ought neyther to imbrace the copie nor the Characters, as authenticke or ori∣ginall. The Conclusion of this is,  If the light that is in the body be darkenesse, how great is that darkenesse, Matth. 6.23. The Scriptures are the light of the Church, and if the originall Text were corrupted,Instru∣menta gratiae. conjuncta. remota. how great were the darkenesse of the body; God hath Conjuncta instru∣menta, & remota instrumenta gratiae. Remota instrumen∣ta gratiae are the Preachers and their writings, and they may be corrupted. But Conjuncta instrumenta gratiae are the Prophets and Apostles and their writings, these the Lord kept from errour and corruption for the good of his Church. EXERCITAT. XIII. That no Canonicall booke is perished. Matth. 5.18. Heaven and earth shall passe, one jote, or one tittle shall no wayes passe from the Law till all be ful∣filled. WHen a thing wanteth an essentiall part, this is the greatest want. Secondly, when it wanteth an integrall part, this is likewise a great defect.Defe∣ctus Partis essentialis partis integratis ornamenti ac∣cidentalis. And thirdly, when it wanteth accidentall ornaments. When the soule is separated from the body, here is a separati∣on of the essentiall parts. When a man wanteth a hand or a foote, then he wanteth an integrall part. And when hee wanteth his cloathes, hee wanteth some orna∣ments.
No booke in the Scrip∣ture wanteth any essen∣tiall part.There is no booke in the Scripture that wanteth any essentiall part; for the Law and the Gospel which are essentiall parts,Vide Iunium in Iudam, and Perkins reformed Catholike. are found in every booke. Secondly, the Scripture wanteth no integrall part since the Canon was sealed, before the Canon was sealed they had as much as served for their infancie: but after that it was sealed the whole Canon was compleate, and none of those Bookes perish∣ed.Gods care in preser∣ving the Scriptures. Great was the care which the Lord had to preserve the Scriptures. First, hee commanded the Levites to take the booke of the Law written by Moyses, and to put it in the side of the Arke of the covenant of the Lord, Deut. 31.26. Secondly, the Lord commanded the King, when he should sit upon the Throne of his kingdome to write a Copie of this Law, Deut. 17.18. and the Iewes adde fur∣ther, that he was bound to write out two copies, one which he should keepe in his treasurie, and another which he should carry about with him; and they say moreover, if Printing had beene found out then, yet hee was bound to write them out with his owne hand. Thirdly, the Lord commanded the Prophets to write their visions upon Tables, vocant Graeci. and to make them plaine, Habak. 2.2. Esay 8.1. and the Seventy read it, to be gra∣ven upon the bush tree, which is a sort of wood that corrupteth not, and it will preserve that which is writ∣ten upon it and it were to the worlds end. Bookes necessary for the Church albeit lost, yet they were found againe.Fourthly, when any booke which was necessary for the use of the Church was lost; the Lord had a care that that booke should be found againe, as the booke of the law found by Hilkiah, 2 King 22.8. Or the Lord endited it anew againe, when it was lost; as when Iehojakim cut the roule of the lamentations of Iere∣mie,
yet the Lord inspired him a new againe to indite this booke to his Scribe Baruch, Iere. 36.32. because he thought it necessary still for the Church: therefore he would not have it to perish. Fiftly, in that generall destruction which the Babylo∣nians made at Ierusalem, burning their houses, and rob∣bing them of their goods;The Israelites kept the musicall instruments in the captivity, to put them in minde of the worship of God. yet as Hierome and Basil ob∣serve well, it was a speciall providence of God that they should leave to those captives, their instruments of Musicke, wherewith they used to serve God in the Temple: that they might preserve some memorie of their former worship, they brought these instruments to Babel with them, Psal. 137.2. we hung our harpes on willowes. If the Lord had such a care of these instru∣ments to have them preserved for his praise, much more care had he to have the Scriptures preserved; which taught them to worship: and he who had a par∣ticular care of the parts of the Scripture, before it was compleate, and numbreth the haires of our heads, Matth. 10.30. and the starres of the heavens, Psal. 147.4. will he not have a speciall care that none of these Bookes should perish which are canonicall? That fable of Esdras then is to be rejected, lib. 4.The fable of Esdras rejected. cap. 4.23. So cap. 14.21. to the 24. verse, he sheweth how the booke of God was lost in the Captivity, and that Esdras the Scribe, by holy inspiration wrote it all anew againe: but this is false, see we not how Dani∣el read out of the prophesie of Ieremie, how long the captivitie should last, Dan. 2.9. The booke of God then was not lost in the captivity, and written anew againe by Esdras,Esdras wrote nothing of the Scriptures but onely set the bookes in order. but onely he set the bookes in order after the captivity, & nihil ad  fecit sed ad . Hee did nothing in correcting the booke of God, but onely set it downe in order. But we reade often times in the Scriptures of many
Bookes wanting now, which were extant before; as the Bookes of the battels of the Lord,  Num. 21.14. By this it cannot bee inferred that any canonicall booke is perished; for this word Sepher, signifieth a relation, as well by word, as by write. Secondly, although wee grant that it was a written booke, yet it will not follow that it was a holy Booke. Thirdly, although we grant that it was an holy booke, yet it will not follow that it was a canonicall booke. The bookes of the Chronicles of the Kings of Iuda and Israel were but civill records,Some things written by the Prophets not as they were Prophets. and belonged nothing to the canon of the Scriptures. Secondly, some bookes that were written by the Pro∣phets, were not written by them as they were Prophets. Salomon wrote of Hearbes, Trees and Plants, 1 King. 4.33. But what bookes were these? They were but bookes of things which were under the Moone and of things corruptible, and because they served not for the edification of the Church afterwards,Hezekiah buried Salo∣mons bookes of physick. therefore the Lord suffered them to perish. Suidas saith, that the booke which Salomon wrote of Physicke, was affixed upon the gate in the entrie of the Temple; and because the people trusted too much in it, neglecting the Lord (as Asa put his trust in the Physitians, 2 Chro. 13.) therefore Hezekiah caused to pull away this booke, and bury it. And the Talmud saith, that Hezekiah did two memorable things. First, Ganaz Sepher rephuoth. Abscon∣dit librum medicinarum, He hid the bookes of Physicke which Salomon had written. And secondly, Cathath nahhash hannehhushoth shegnashe Moshe, Comminuit aeneum serpentem quem fecerat Moses, He brake the brasen Ser∣pent which Moyses made. Salomon spake three thousand Proverbes, 1 King. 4.32. yet of all these Proverbes scarce eyght hundred are put in the Canon. Some of these Proverbes the servants
of Hezekiah King of Iuda copied out, Prov. 25.1. And as they saw the King their master bury Salomons booke, which he knew was hurtfull to the Church:Salomoni Proverbs and Songs, which were not profitable to the Church perished. so those servants copied out these Proverbes which were pro∣fitable for the Church, whereas the rest perished. So Salomon wrote a thousand and five Songes; of all which Songes, est utriusque numeri quae vel quod. the Lord made choyse but of one to be insert in the Canon, which is called the Song of Songes, or can∣ticum canticorum quae Salomonis rather then canticum can∣ticorum quod Salomonis, it was the most excellent Song of all Salomons Songs, rather then the excellentest Song compared with other Songes. But all bookes written by thē for the whole Church none of them are perished: as the Prophesies of Nathan Ahija, and Iddo. For Burgensis observeth well upon, 1 Chro. 29. That the first booke of Samuel is holden to be written by Samuel himselfe. So the second Booke of Samuel, and the second booke of the Kings were written by Nathan and Gad, who lived with David and Salomon, and wrote untill the death of Salomon, then Iddo and Ahija wrote the historie following of Ieroboam interlacing somethings of Salomon and Rehoboam. 1 Chron. 29.29. Now the acts of David the King, first and last behold they are written in the booke of Samuel the Seer, and in the booke of Nathan the Prophet; and in the booke of Gad the Seer, with all his reigne and his might and the times that went over him, and over Israel and all the Kingdomes of the Countries. But these words cannot be understood of the bookes of Samuel; for wee reade not in these bookes, what David did abroad in these Countries: therefore some other bookes must be un∣derstood here, written by Gad and Nathan, which are not extant. Not onely the things, which David did in Israel, are set downe in the booke; of Samuels but also the things
which he did abroad in other Countries, as against Zoba King of Hadadezzar,Hierom. in Esa. 13. against the Moabites, and a∣gainst Tobh King of Hemath. And where it is sayd over all the kingdomes of the countries, it is the manner of the Scripture (as Hierome marketh) by the whole Countries, to understand the next adjacent countries whereof it speaketh; and therefore in the originall it is, Haaratzoth, Of that carth. 2 Chro. 33 19. The prayer of Manasseh and how God was intreated of him, and all his sinne, and his trespasse and the places wherein he built high places, and set up groves and graven images before he was humbled: behold they are written among the saying of the Seers, or Hosai. But in the whole booke of the Kings there is no mention made of his affliction, or of the cause which mooved him to repent or of his prayers which he made to God in time of his affliction: then this booke of the prophet is not now extant. So the acts of Baasha, Zimri, and Omri are they not written in the Bookes of the Chronicles of Israel, 1 Kings 16.5. & 27. But nothing concerning their actes are found in the bookes of the Kings, or in the Chroni∣cles: therefore those bookes are perished, when the Scriptures remit us to those bookes, it giveth us to un∣derstand that these bookes are worthy to be trusted, as written by the Seers of God: neyther doth the Scrip∣ture cite them, as it doth some short sentences out of the Heathen Poets. The Apostle saith of those Poets, that they sayd the truth, Tit. 1.13. But the Spirit of God remitteth us to these bookes, that we may be fully in∣structed by them in the whole truth of the Acts of those Kings. First we must know that there were many Prophets who prophesied, whose prophesies were never written; as the prophesies of the children of the Prophets,Some prophesies of the Prophets were not written. and the prophesies of those, who prophesied from the
dayes of Eli, to David, as some of Asaph Heman and Ieduthun. Secondly, all the things which were written by the Seers, were not written by them as Seers: Salo∣mon wrote many things, which he wrote not as a Pro∣phet, and so did David. Thirdly,Somethings written by the Prophets profitable for the Church then, but not profitable now. many things which they wrote then as Seers, and were profitable to the Church for that time, were not profitable for the Church now: and the Spirit of God remitted them then to the civill records and to some prophesies which were then extant, but are perished now; because now they were not necessary for the Church: but all these things which the Lord endited to them by his Spirit and which he thought to be necessary for his Church, to be the Canon and rule of our faith, all those the Lords watchfull eye hath kept and preserved, that none of them are perished. The Conclusion of this is:  The bookes of Emperours and Kings are lost, yet the Lord hath kept the regi∣ster of the little Kings of Iuda and Israel, both in whole and in parts, although they were but Shepherds, and banished men. And the Church would rather spend her best blood, then shee would part with that pretious Iewell or any part of it: therefore they called those who delivered the booke of God to the persecuting Tyrants, Traditores.
EXERCITAT. XIIII. That the points were not originally with the Letters from the beginning. Neh. 8.8. So they read in the Booke, the Law of God distinctly, and gave the sense, and caused them to un∣derstand the reading of the Law. WE have showne that the Scriptures are not cor∣rupt, and that no essentiall or integrall part is wanting in the holy Scriptures: Now it resteth to show that the Points, the accidentall ornaments were not from the beginning. The Iewes who are faithfull keepers, but bad inter∣preters of the Scriptures, interpret these words, Nehe. 8.8. after this manner, vaijkren bassepher betorath, They read in the booke of the Law, this they expound, to be the litterall sense, which Ezra gave. Mephorash, distinctly that is, adding the Points and distinctions. Veshom Shcel, Appenentes intellectum, and gave the sense, that is, he ad∣ded the Targum or paraphrase to it. Vajabhinu bammikra and caused them to understand the reading of the Law, that is, he added the Kabbala. But this is a false Glosse, Ezra read the Law to them, & gave them not onely the grammaticall sense, but also the spirituall and true mea∣ning of the words; he neither added points nor Targum, or Kabbala to it. The points were not then from the be∣ginning, as may be seene by these reasons following. The first reason is taken from the Samaritan Chara∣cter. The Iewes acknowledge that the letters of the law which they have now, are not the ancient Characters in which Moyses wrote the Law. But to these ancient
Characters there is no vowell subjoyned as we may see in the forme of the Shekell set downe by Arias Mon∣tanus, Beza, and Villalpand upon Ezekiel. The second reason is taken from the first exemplar of the Iewes, which they kept in their Synagogues; and they have most exactly written and rouled up this booke, which is the cheefe booke in their estimation, and whereof they account more then of any other He∣brew Bible; yet there is neyther Poynt nor Accent in this booke, but onely Consonants. This may be seene also in their ancient billes of divorce wherein are ney∣ther Points nor Accents: Therefore the Points were not from the beginning. The third reason is taken from the names of the Points, and Accents, which are Chaldee names, therefore they were imposed after the captivity. But they who maintaine that the Poynts were from the beginning, say, that this reason holdeth not; for the names of the Moneths are Chaldee names, imposed after the captivity; and yet the Moneths were from the beginning: So the Points may be from the begin∣ning, although the Chaldee names were given to them after the captivitie. As the Moneths were from the beginning, and had Chaldee names given unto them, after the captivity: so the value of the Points were from the beginning; but the figures and the names of the Points, were set downe a long time afterwards. The fourth reason is taken from the translation of the Seventy: for when the Seventy read the Hebrew Text wanting the Points, they differed very farre from the Hebrew in many things. baculus.  lectus▪ The difference of their rea∣ding arose from this; because the Hebrew Text wan∣ted the Poynts. Example, Gen. 47.31. and Israel bowed himselfe, gnal rosh hamitta, upon his beds head. But the
Apostle followeth the translation of the Seventy tran∣slating it, Ʋolumen. He bowed upon the top of his rod, Heb. 11.21. So Psal. 40.7. caput, cranium. for Megilla the Seventy read gilgoleth, in ca∣pite libri, for in volumine libri: because they wanted the Points, and the Apostle followed this reading. The fift reason is taken from, Ketibh volo keri, when the words are written one way, and read another. This diversity of reading and writing arose because the let∣ters wanted the Points from the beginning: this made them to reade one way and write another way. The Chaldee, Arabian, and Assyrian language, which are but daughters proceeding from the Hebrew tongue, have no Points: therefore it is not probable that the Hebrew Text had Points from the begin∣ning. The seventh reason is taken out of the Talmud. They write, masculus that Ioab killed his master, because he taught him to read Zacar Masculus, memoria. for Zecer Memoria, and so made him to spare the females of the Amalekites, whereas hee should have blotted out their memorie and killed them all. Now if the points had beene from the begin∣ning, then Ioabs master could not have taught him, to have read Zacar for Zecer. The Points were not from the beginning then, but found our afterwards by the Masorath. There were three sorts of teachers, amongst the Iewes. The first was , who gathered the traditions of the Fathers together; vel such were the Pha∣risees. The second were the Sopherim afterwards cal∣led the Masoreth: these observed the letters and words in the reading. The third sort were the Midroseth, the Cabbalists, who expounded the Scriptures allegorically. The Scribes were from Moyses time, who taught the people to reade the Law, because the Law wanted the
Points: and Christ calleth these The learned Scribes, and saith to one of them; How readest thou? Luk. 10.26.Shammai and Hillel the first of the Sects of the Scribes and Pharisees. But afterwards Shammai and Hellel were the first of the Scribes and Pharisees, who were the originall of these sects. Shammai was the first of these Scribes who drew out the Cabbalisticall readings, and Hillel was the first who gathered their traditions toge∣ther. Because the Text wanted the Vowels before the Ma∣sorets time, hence arose these diverse readings margi∣nall and Textuall; here wee must take heed of two errores. The first is of those who hold,Two errors to be shun∣ned concerning the Marginall and Text reading. that both the Textuall and Marginall reading were from the begin∣ning, and both authenticke and originall from Moses. The second error which we must shunne, is this, that the marginall reading implyeth some corruption, where as it serveth for illustration of the Text. There is but small difference betwixt the Marginall and the line reading. There are three sorts of reading. The first is ,. when there is no difference at all in the words.. The second is  when there is some small difference in the reading.. And the third is , when there is a contrarie reading. Now for , we may see it in the originall Text it selfe, as 2 Sam. 22. and Psal. 18. the same argument is handled almost word by word in both these places, there is some diversitie of words onely: for 2 Sam. 22.43. Evacuare. It is Adikem, I did stampe them as the myre of the streetes, but Psal. 18.42. it is Arikem, Comminuere. I did cast them out as the myre in the streets. Here is but small difference, Daleth is onely changed into Resh, the sense is all one.ר mutatur in ר So 2 Sam. 22.11. and Psal. 18.11. So 2 Sam. 22.27. and Psal. 18.26. So 2 Sam. 22.8. and Psal. 18.9. here is ,The Marginall and the Text reading make not a contrary but a diverse reading. but not . So the Marginall reading, and the Text reading makes not a contrary reading, but a diverse rea∣ding:
therefore ye shall see that the Translaters follow sometimes the Marginall reading in their first transla∣tions, illi as Iunius 2 King 8.10. in his first translation, he saith abi; non. dic ei, but in this second translation he saith, abi, dic non, So Ezr. 4.2. In his first edition, sacrificabimus eidem which is the marginall reading, fecit. but in his second translation, decem. non sacrificabimus alteri which is in the Text. Example, 3. 1 King 22.49. Iehosaphat prepared shipes,Translaters sometime joyne both the margi∣nall and text reading together. Gnasha fecit; but in his second translation Iehosaphat made decem naves which is in the Text. So Prov. 31.4. Eccles. 3.4. Ier. 2.20. and 5.8. He fol∣loweth Ketibh in his last Edition, that is, as it is written and not read in all these places. And sometimes ye shall see them, joyne both the Marginall and Text rea∣ding together. Psal. 22.17. They Lyon like digged. So the Chaldee Paraphrast and the Seventie readeth it. So Iunius. (Exod. 21.8. If she please not her Master who hath not betrothed her unto himselfe, non sibi. non sibi) joyneth lo, lo, both together, both the Text and Margi∣nall reading. voluit est ketibh So Iosh. 8.12. The line reading hath gnir, custodivit est keri vrbs, and the Marginall reading hath Hai, and hee joyneth them both together vrbs Hai. So Prov. 23.26. Let thine eyes observe my wayes. Ratza, and Natzar, he joyneth them both together, studiose custodivit. So Eze. 22.16. They joyne them both together. So 1 King. 22.18. the Tigurin joyneth them both toge∣ther.The Masoreth put the vowels some times in the text, and the conso∣nants in the margent. and the English joyne them both together, Prov. 19.7. They are wanting to him. In these diverse readings set downe by the Masoreth, sometimes the Points are put in the Text and the Con∣sonants in the Margent, as Ier. 31.39. Behold the day saith the Lord. Here is a blanke in the Text, the vowels are onely set downe and the word Baim, is understood by the Points of it, which are in the Text, and so it is Baim, although it be not expresly written in the Text.
The reason why they set the consonants in the Margent and the vowels in the Text, was to signifie, that they enclined rather, to follow the Marginall reading than the Text, and yet not to exclude the Text reading: therefore they set the vowels in the Text.The Masoreth put not points to a word which they thinke doth re∣dound. Againe, when the Masoreth thinke that some words abound, they set downe the Consonants of the word in the Text, but they point not the word, which they would have to be be omitted, Example, Ier. 51.3. A∣gainst him that bended, let the Archer bend his bow. El ijddroch ijddroch hadderech. And thus the Masoreth keepe us that we goe not amisse, and their observations are a hedge to the Law: therefore the Iewes say, Se∣jag lahhochma shethea, Silence is the hedge of wisedome, for when a man holdeth his peace he is then thought to be wise. So they say Megnasheroth sejag legnosher, Tythes are the hedge of our riches, and therefore pay thy Tythes and bee rich. So Nedarim sejag liphrishoth, vowes are the hedge of the first fruites. Lastly, they say, Masoreth sejag latora, that the Masoreth is the hedge to the Law. By great paines and wonderfull care those Masoreth, numbred the letters and words of the Scrip∣ture, that none of them might perish: and as in a well constituted family, the master of the family taketh a note of all the things in his house from the greatest to the least: So did these Masoreth of the whole Law: therefore the Hebrewes say, Gnim shimmureth hatorah, that is, the studie of the Masoreth was Cum con∣servationelegis, for the preserving of the Law from cor∣ruption. These diverse readings make not up diverse senses but helpe us better to come by the right sense of the Scripture.Diverse reading, make not up diverse sense in the Scripture. When it is objected to us by the Church of Rome that we have not the true meaning of the Scrip∣tures, because of our diverse translations: Our Divines
answer, that these diverse translations make not diverse senses in the Scriptures; for the sense is still one and the same: but these diverse translations helpe us one∣ly, to come to the true meaning of the Scriptures, and so we must use these marginall and line readings, as we use these interpretations. When we see a blanke left in the the Text, and supplyed in the Margent; this ad∣deth nothing to the Text, as a word added sometime by a translatour, addeth nothing to the Text: So when the Masoreth put another word in the Margent,A word set downe for explanation addeth nothing to the text. which is not in the Text; that word is set downe onely for explanation,The meaning of the text is knowne by the antecedent and conse∣quent. and it addeth nothing to the Text. We take up the meaning of the Text, by the antecedent, and consequent, Example, Prov. 4.3. Tender and young was I, Liphni, before my Mother; but in the Margent it is, Tender and young was I, Libhni, amongst the Sonnes of my Mother: for Salomon had moe brethren 1 Chron. 3.6. But these readings may stand, he was tender and young before his Mother, and best beloved of all his Mo∣thers Sonnes. The Conclusion of this is. A certaine Iew gave God thankes for foure things.  First, that hee was a Iew and not a Samaritane. Secondly, that he was bred at Ieru∣salem and not at Pambiditha.ex Tilmideni. cap. 7 Thirdly, that he said Shib∣beth and not Sibboleth. Fourthly, that hee needed not the helps of Tiberias, meaning the Points and Accents. But we who are not naturall Iewes should bee thanke∣full to God; because wee have these helpes to further us in the reading.
EXERCITAT. XV. Of the meanes which God useth to make the Scrip∣ture plaine unto us. 1 Cor. 14.11. If I know not the meaning of the voyce, I shall be to him that speaketh a Barbarian, &c. THere are three speciall meanes by which God maketh the Scriptures plaine unto us.Three speciall meanes for making the Scrip∣tures plaine. The first is translation of the Scripture. The second is parapra∣sing of the Scripture, and the third is the interpretati∣on of the Scripture.What things are neces∣sary for translation. In the Translation of the Scripture consider, first, what is a Translation. Secondly, the necessitie of tran∣slation. Thirdly, what things a Translator should ob∣serve, and what things he should shunne. Fourthly, who they were who translated the Scriptures. Fiftly, the authority of the translation of the Seventy. Sixt∣ly, the authority of the vulgar Latine translati∣on. First, what is a translation.What is translation. We translate when we change out of one language into another, and it is called  or . If the Translator consider the words a part, then it is called  or : there is great force in the words, and therefore the Translator must observe them; Plato was wont to call Socrates, , seu obstetricem; because when he sought out the words, then he brought forth the truth.The necessitie of tran∣slation proved by sun∣dry reasons. Secondly, let us consider the necessity of Translation without a Translation wee can not understand a strange language, but it is barbarous to us. Reasons proving the necessitie of translation. First, when the old testament hath words altogether
unknowne to the Iewes,Words in the old Te∣stament, unknowne to the Iewes, are interpre∣ted. it useth to interpret them. Ex∣ample, Purim was a Persicke word unknowne to the Iewes; therefore the Holy Ghost interpreteth it, cal∣ling it a Lot. So the Evangelists writing, in Greeke, and having sundrie Hebrew and Chaldee words, they expound them in Greeke as Siloe, that is, sent, Ioh. 9.7. Abba interpreted by Pater, Rom. 8. So Tabitha kumi, by interpretation, Daughter arise, Mark. 5.21. So Thomas called Didymus.. See Mark. 7.34. and Act. 1.27. and Revela. 1.7. amen by nai, So Abaddon be , Reve. 9.11. So Rabboni by Master, Ioh. 20.16. why doth the holy Ghost interpret these names? but to teach us that he would have the Scriptures translated into knowne tongues, that the people might understand them. Why doth the holy Ghost interpret Elymas by Ma∣gus, Act. 13.8. But Elymas the Sorcerer (for so his name is by interpretation) withstood them, Seeing all translations should be in a more knowne tongue, but Magus, is as obscure as Elymas? Magus was first a Persicke word, but afterwards it was well enough knowne to the Iewes,The Persians are called Elamites. Elymas was but a part of Persia, so called from Elam the sonne of Sem: therefore the Persians are called Elamites, Act. 2. and Luke interpreteth Elymas by Magus, as by that which was well enough knowne to the Iewes, magus a  formare vel fingere. and to us now; for we take Magus commonly for a Magitian: the Arabick translateth Magus, by Hhartom, from Hharat, fingere or formare; because the Magitians draw figures and circles when they conjure. Why is the prayer of Christ upon the Crosse set downe in Hebrew by the Evangelists? Eli, Eli, lama sa∣bacthani, Matth. 27.46. Why the prayer of Christ upon the crosse is set downe in He∣brew.The Evangelist doth this, that we may perceive the bitter mocke that the Iewes used against Christ, saying, He calleth upon Elias, for in no other language the mocke will so appeare.
Secondly,Vnknowne tongues were a curse pronoun∣ced against the people of the Iewes. it was a curse pronounced against the peo∣ple of God, when the Lord should send strangers a∣gainst them who should speake unto them in an un∣knowne tongue, Esa. 28.11. So it is a curse to the Church, as the Apostle applyeth it, to speake to the people the misteries of their salvation in an unknowne tongue, 1 Cor. 14.21. The Lord at the Pentecost gave the gift of tongues to the Apostles, that they might speake to the people in a knowne language, Every man heard them speake in his owne language, Act. 2.6. And to some hee gave the tongues, but not the interpretation of them;God gave the gift of tongues to some, and to others he gave the in∣terptetation of them. but lest the people should not understand these languages, he gave to others the gift of interpretation, 1 Cor. 12.10. but the Church of Rome studieth of purpose to keepe the Scrip∣tures in an unknowne tongue, and thinketh, that there∣by the mindes of the people are more affected and stir∣red up to devotion.A Translator must take heed, ex quo, & in quod vertit. The third thing to be considered in a translation is what a Translator should observe and what hee should eschew in his translation. A Translator must observe Ex quo vertit & in quod vertit, or Terminus a quo & ter∣minus ad quem, and he must consider first the sense, and then the words;Simile. He must have the worth of the words in his translation. he must looke first to the sense and see that he carry it with him, and next to the words; and even as Merchants when they sell their wares they looke for the worth of their wares in Money: So should a Translator in his translation see that hee have the worth, or meaning of the sense in his Translation, hee must consider first the aptnesse of the phrase into which he is to translate it,A Translator should consider the aptnesse of the phrase. and hee is not  servilly to follow it. Example, the Hebrew saith, I will multiply thy seede as the sand upon the lippe of the Sea, Gen. 22.17. But our language saith upon the Sea shoare. So the Hebrew saith we must not eate with common hands,
but we say, with unwashen hands: now in this meta∣phrase changing one phrase into another, the Translator must take good heede. A Translatour may adde a word where the sense beareth it.Secondly, where the sense beareth it a Translator may adde a word without any hurt to the Text. The origi∣nall Text it selfe, affecteth sometime more brevity and in other places supplyeth this brevity. As, 2 Sam. 6.6. Vzzia put fourth to the Arke, it is expounded more at large, 1 Chron. 13.9. He put forth his hand to the Arke, So 2 Chron. 10.9. is expounded by 2 Chron. 13.9. At more length. The holy Ghost addeth a word for illustation where the sense beareth it, Deut. 27.26. Cursed be hee that confirmeth not the words of this Law to doe them; But the Apostle Galat. 3.10. Cursed in every one that con∣tinueth not in all things which are written in the booke of the Law to doe them. So a Translator may adde a word for illustration when the sense beareth it, Gen. 3. Hast thou eaten of the tree of which I forbad thee to eate? the Seventy adde, Hast thou eaten of the tree which I (onely) forbad thee to eate? When Christ Mark. 5.4. interpreteth tabitha kumi arise daughter, how addeth hee here,  tibi dico? He doth not this as an interpreter, but to show the power and authority of him who speaketh; and there∣fore ,A Translater must not adde of his owne to the text. should be in a parenthesis. A Translator must adde nothing of his owne in his translation, Exod. 16.15. The vulgar translation addeth something which is not in the originall: when the chil∣dren of Israel saw it, they sayd one to another, what is this? These words (what is this) are not the words of the holy Ghost: interrogat apud Chaldaeos, sed non apud Hebraeos. for Man signifieth, prepared or ready, and there∣fore it should be interpreted, this is ready or prepared meate. So Exod. 12.11. they translate Phase, id est tran∣situs, it should not be translated, id est transitus, but tran∣situs, it is the Lords Passeover.
A Translator must not affect , that is,, is an af∣fecting of new words. new∣nesse of words: those doe contrary to that of Salomon, Prov. 22.28. Remove not the ancient markes which thy fa∣thers have set. This was the fault of Castalio who transla∣ted Sequester, for Mediator, Genius, for Angelus, Insundere, for Baptizare, Histrio, for Hypocrita, Respublica,When the matter re∣quireth, a new word may be used in a tran∣slation. for Eccle∣sia, and such. We are not so bound to words, but when the matter requireth, a new word may be used. Nice∣phorus telleth of Spiridion, when hee heard the word , read for ; he rose and went out of the Church in a chafe: so another could not abide Cucur∣bita, for Hedera, Ionas 4.6. Esa. 45.9. Woe be to him that striveth with his Maker: let the potsheard strive with the potsheards of the earth. Hierome hath it, testa de Samijs, he translated it terra Samiae; there is not such a word in the originall, neyther were these vasa Samiae, in use,, is hee who hunteth for strange words that is not in use. in the dayes of the Prophet; yet because these vessels were in use in his time, hee useth it in his translation: neyther can he be thought to be  a hunter of new words for this. So Nahum 3.8. Art thou better than No. But Hierome translateth it, art thou better than Alexandria: because in his time No was called Alexandria: being built anew by Alexander., pigmenta ora∣toria, the flowing speeches of Orators. A Translatour must not use a great circuite of words, or the floorishing speeches of Rhetoricke in his translation;Simile. for as men pouring wine out of one Ves∣sel into another, take heede that the vent bee not too great; for then the wine would corrupt: So the Transla∣tor if he take too much liberty to himselfe he may cor∣rupt the sense. Words that are transeunt,. passing and received in all languages should not be translated: as Sabbath, Amen, Halleluia, Hosanna. So Iam. 5.4. and the cryes of them which have reaped,Simile. are entred into the eares of the Lord of Sabbath. For as some sort of coine passeth in all countries
so doe some words. Secondly, some words which come not originally from the Hebrew but from the Greeke, yet they should be kept still untranslated, as Phylacterie,Many Latine words made Greeke in the new Testament. Tetrach and such. There are many Latine words which are made Greeke in the New Testament, and these are to bee translated. For as Daniel borrowed some words from the Ionians who dwelt in Asia minor and made Chaldee words of them, as sabucha from sambucha an instrument which they played upon.Latin words which are made Greeke, should be translated. Angaria a Persicke word made Greeke, Matth. 5.41. So Gazophylacium, all these should be translated: So the Latine words which are made Greeke should bee translated, as  Census, Matth. 17.25.  Centurio, quadrans , Matth. 5.26. So Colonia , Act. 16.12. So custodia , Matth. 26. So Legio, linteum, Macellum, membrana, modius, praetorium, , Matth. 27. sudarium, Luk. 19.20. Spiculator, Matth. 6.27. Semicinctum, Act. 19.12. and Sicarius, Act. 21.38. All these should bee transla∣ted. Words appropriate should not be translated to any other use, but unto the use, to which they are appropri∣ated. Example, Rachab received into her house . A Translator cannot translate it Angels (because that word is appropriated to the blessed Angels) but Messen∣gers. Example 2. Phil. 2.25. Epaphroditus, , a Translator cannot translate it your Apostle (for that word is appropriated to the the Apostles) but your Messenger. So Act. 19.23. , a Translator cannot translate it, The Church was confused, because this word Church is appropriated to the meeting of the Saints of God for his worship; but onely, The assembly was confused. Words not appropriate should not be appropri∣ate.So words not appropriat should not bee appropriat as the Church of Rome doe appropriat this word Sy∣nagoga
to the Old Testament, and Ecclesia to the New Testament; but Synagoga is sayd of the Church of the New Testament, and Synagoga & Ecclesia are promis∣cuusly taken. So this word  should not be tran∣slated Gods Cleargie, but Gods inheritance, 1 Pet. 5.3. This word which is common to all Gods people, should not be appropriated to a few. Words that are degenerate,Words degenerate, should not be used in a translation. we cannot use them in a translation. Example, 1 Cor. 14.16. He that occupieth the roome , it cannot be translated Idiot here (un∣lesse we would begge them for fooles,) but Vnlearned. So the word  is a degenerate word in our lan∣guage, and taken in an evill sense, we cannot translate it, the Magitians came from the East,Vide Rainoldum con∣tra Hart. but the Wise men came from the East, Matth. 2.1. So  should not bee translated Priest, for the word Priest now is taken for a sacrifycing Preist: and God himselfe would not be called Baal, but ishi because Baal was a word degene∣rate and given to Idols, Hos. 2. So  at the first was he that had the charge of the corne which the La∣tines called Epulo, but now both are degenerate. So should not a degenerate word be used in a translati∣on. Words that are proper should not be translated as appellatives or contra, 2 Sam. 23.8.Words that are proper, are not to be translated as appellatives. The Tachmonite that sat in the seate cheefe amongst the Captaines, this same was Hadino the Eznite, but 1 Chro. 11.11. Iashobeam an Hach∣monite, the cheefe of the Captaines he lift up his Speare against three hundred. It was a proper name of a man, as we may see, 1 Chro. 27.2. And therefore should not be translated, he sate in judgement. gratum erat huic hastae∣to. So Adino and Eznite are not proper names, but are to be translated thus, His delight was to lift up his speare against three hundred. So Iosh. 14.15. The Vulgar translation hath it thus, This is Adam who was buried amongst foure. Adam here is an
appellative name and not proper; therefore the article He, is put before it. Secondly, he addeth Situs est, which is not in the originall. Thirdly, he translateth Arba, Four, which is a proper name here and hence came that fable, that foure men and their wives are buried there, Adam and Eve, Abraham and Sara, Isaac and Rebekah, and Iacob and Lea. So Act. 19.9. Schola Tyranni, cannot be translated, in the Schoole of a Tyrant, but In the Schoole of Tyrannus, because it is not an appellative but a proper name. .Words that are Mediae significationis, a Translator must take heed how he translateth thē. Example 1. Esa. 3. 2. I will take away your Kosem from you. The Translator cannot translate it here, your Soothsayer but your Prudent. So Ioshu. 13.22. Balaam also the sonne of Beor the Kosem, did the children of Israel slay. It cannot be translated, Balaam the Prudent, but Balaam the Soothsayer. Another example gnarum is called subtile or craftie and also prudent or wise, Gen. 3.1. the Serpent was gna∣rum, it cannot be translated, More wise than any beast of the field; but More craftie and Prov. 1.4. It cannot bee sayd to give Subtiltie, but Wisedome to the simple. So Matth. 10.16. It cannot be sayd, be yee Craftie as Ser∣pents, but Wise as Serpents. Vide Simeon de Muis, in Psal. 9.A third example, Sheol signifieth both the grave and hell; when it is set downe without He locale, then it ever signifieth the grave, locale. but when He locale, is put to it and the godly, et are sayd to goe Lesheolah, then it signifieth the lowest grave, as Psal. 86.13. But when Sheol hath He locale joyned to it, quomodo differuut. and the wicked are sayd to go Lesheo∣lah, then it signifieth the Hell, and it should be translated, They went downe to hell, Num. 16.30. A fourth example, Pethi is taken in an evill sense for Foolishnesse, as Prov. 1.22. and in a good sense for Simpli∣citie, as Psal. 116.6.
Words  (and as the Iewes say Quae nullum habent fratrem) they should be warily taken heede unto, how they be translated, vel . because there is not another word to cleare them by. Example, Num. 24. 3. Hag gebher shethum hagnaijn Vir apertis oculis.The Masoreth put this marke  ubi no∣tant vocem aliquam semel reperiri, & quae bis occurrunt, they call them  that is, gemellj. It is not taken in this sense in all the Scriptures but onely here: in other places of the Scripture it is taken in a contrary signification for Shutting of the eyes. Another example, Mat. 13.25. The enemy came and sowed, , it should not be translated Tares or Fitches, but Evill seede,  is that which we call blasted Corne, or the deafe eares, which grow up with the good Corne, & cannot bee discerned from the good Corne untill the Harvest; and then it proveth naught: quid. for Fitches and Tares may be presently discerned, and pulled up; the one signifieth the Hypocrites and the other Hereticks. And where it is sayd, His enemy came and sowed Tares,Vide Suidam in  & Sculteti Exercitati∣ones. The parable must be understood thus, that the enemy cor∣rupted that seede which seemed to be good seede: In a parable wee must not stretch every word, but onely look to the maine scope; for then we may gather that the wicked in Hell have tongues now, and the glorified have bodies now in the Heavens. quid. A third example. Mark. 14.3. She brought a boxe  Of liquid nard, it should be translated Of up∣right and perfect nard: for according to the phrase of the Seventy, that is  which excelleth in the owne kind of it, and so they call the Temple of Salomon  An excellent Temple. The Syriack hath it Pis from the Greeke word . The fourth thing that is to be considered here, are they who translated the Scriptures.Lib. 1. controvers. cap. 5. contra Bellar. Iunius saith that there are twelve translations of the Bible into the Greeke,There were twelve translations of the Bible into Greeke. the first translation of the Ptolemies was Lagi∣ana which Ptolemaus Lagi caused to be translated. The
next translation, was the translation of the Seventy, which was translated in the dayes of Ptolomeus Phila∣delpus, the third was Herodiana in the time of Ptolo∣mie the last, the fourth that of Aquila, the fifth of Symmachus, the sixt of Theodosion, the seventh Hieri∣chuntina found in Iericho, the eight Nicapolitana found at Nicapolis, the ninth Origenaria, translated by Origen, the tenth Luciana translated by the martyr Lucian, the eleventh Hesychiana, translated by Hesychius, the twelfth Exhieromineana translated out of Ieromes tran∣slation into Greeke. There is such a profunditie in the Scriptures, that it is unpossible for any Interpreter to sownd the depth of them, but as it fareth with the oyle of the widow, 2 King. 4. So long as the children brought vessels, so long there was oyle to fill them: So there is such plen∣ty in the Scriptures, when they have filled the wits and understanding of the best; yet there is sufficient for these who goe about to translate anew againe, to bee drawne out of them. The cause of the dif∣ference in translations.And it is no marvell why they differ so in their tran∣slations, for one roote hath so many significations sometimes, that all the Translators cannot agree in one. Let us take but this one example, Iob. 4.18. Pagninus translateth it, In angelis suis ponit lumen. 2. In angelis suis indidit vesaniam, Tigurin. 3. In Angelis suis ponit lucem exactissimam, vatablus. 4. In angelis suis posuit gloriatio∣nem, laudare. gloriari. fulgere. splendere. insanire, &c. Regia. 5. In angelis suis reperit vanitatem, Symma∣chus. 6. Adversus angelos suos pravum quid advertit, Sep∣tuaginta. The diversity of these translations ariseth from the word Halal, which signifieth Laudare, gloriari, fulgere splendere,Translations which were in estimation insanire. The first translation which was in any account was that which was in in the dayes of Ptolomeus Philadelpus. The second that of Aquila who translated the Old
Testament into Greeke, an hundred and twenty yeares after Christ. The third was that of Symmachus who li∣ved in the time of the Emperor Severus, fifty and sixe yeares after the translation of Aquila. The fourth tran∣slation was that of Theodosion who lived under the Em∣peror Commodus (as Symmachus lived under Severus) and hee and Symmachus lived at one time. These foure were joyned together by Origen, and he called them Tetrapla. And then he added the Hebrew Text and his owne translation, and then he called them Hexapla.How Ori∣gen made up his Teirapla, Hexapla, & Octupla. And lastly he added that translation which was found in Ie∣richo, and at Nicapolis, and then he called them Octupla or , because every Page contained eight Co∣lumnes, as may be seene in this Table following. Col. 1. heb. heb. lit. Col. 2. heb. grae. lit. . Col. 3. Septua. . Col. 4. Aquila. . Col. 5. Theodosiō. . Col. 6. Symma. . Col. 7. Hieric. desiderat Col 8. Nicapol. desiderat. This was Origens last Edition, but as he set them downe first, he set his Tetrapla in the first place, and next his Hexapla,, and last his Octupla, as Scaliger hath set them downe. Pag. 1.

The diligence of Ori∣gen in his edition.Marke Origens farther diligence in this his worke; for by sundry markes and notes, he distinguished that, which was extant in the Hebrew; from that which was added by the Translators. These things which were found in the translations, and not in the Hebrew Text, hee markes them Obelo, thus ⸓  ⸓ These things againe which were in the Hebrew Text, and not found in the translations; hee marked them Asterisco, with a starre this wayes ܍  ܍ Thirdly, the divers readings confirmed by sundry Copies, he mark∣ed them lemnisco this wayes ÷  ÷ And lastly, these things which were found but in few copies, he marked them Hypolemnisco this wayes ܋  ܋ This Edition of Origen was so generally followed afterwards, that Augustine complained that in all the Libraries they could scarcely finde one Copie of the Seventy,The edition of Origen corrected by Lucian. wanting these markes of Origen: and when sundry faults, had crept into this his Edition Lucian an Elder at Antioch and afterwards a Martyr, tooke all these Editions and conferred them together; and hee set out a more axact and correct Edition then Origens was. Of the Translation of the Seventy. Ptolomaeus Philadelpbus procured not this tran∣slation, as some hold.IT is commonly holden, that Ptolomaeus Philadelphus the sonne of Ptolomeus Lagi, King of Egypt gathered a Library, two hundred sixty and seven yeares before the birth of Christ, in the City of Alexandria in Egypt: and having gathered together divers Greeke writers, he gathered also Hebrew, Persian, Syriack, and Romane writers, and caused to translate them into Greeke, and put them in his Library: and when he understood of Demetrius Phalaraus who had the charge of his Library,
that there were bookes in Ierusalem written by the Pro∣phets amongst the Iewes, which intreated of God and of the creation of the world, and much hid wisedome was contained in them; King Ptolomie wrote unto Ie∣rusalem, that they might send these bookes unto him: and when they had read his Letters, they sent these bookes written in Golden letters: which Hebrew bookes when they were delivered unto the King, he un∣derstood them not: therefore he wrote to Eleazar the Highpriest the second time, that he would send men unto him, who would translate these Hebrew bookes into Greeke. And Eleazar sent Seventy two, sixe out of each Tribe, who were very skillfull and expert both in the Hebrew and in the Greeke. These men translated the Scripture in the Ile Pharos,They were called seventy, propter Rotunda∣tionem numori. being put in severall Cels; yet all of them so agreed, that there was not any difference among them, and they were called the Seventy commonly, although there were seventy and two of them. Iosephus writing against Appion, borroweth this histo∣ry or fable rather out of Aristoeas, and afterwards the Christian writers (in whose time this translation of the Seventy was in most request) gave eare willingly to this: for they used most the translation of the Seventy; and they tooke occasion to spread abroad any thing, which might serve for their credit. Iustin Martyr a fa∣mous old writer, with tooth and nayle standeth for the authority of this Translation: he telleth how they were put into severall Cels, and how they were direct∣ed by the holy Spirit, so that they agreed, not onely in the sense; but also in the words. But yet neyther Ari∣staeas, nor Iosephus who borrowed this from him; make mention of these Cels. But Scaliger in his animadversions upon Eusebius at the yeare M.CCXXXIV, judgeth that this booke of
Aristaes (out of which this narration was borrowed) was but fained by some grecizing Iewes,caliger proveth by ma∣ny reasons, that Ptolemeus Philadelphus, did not procure this transla∣tion. that they might conciliat the greater authority to this their tran∣slation which they had procured, and he hath sundry reasons to improve this narration. The first reason, we know saith he out of the history of Hermippus (an antient writer of whom Diogenes Laer∣tius maketh mention) that Dimetrius phalerius whom Aristaeas bringeth in as the procurer of this whole busi∣nesse at the hands of Ptolomeus Philadelphus, was in no favour with him, for Ptolomeus so disliked this Dimetrius altogether, that in the beginning of his reigne hee banished him: and through greefe he tooke himselfe to live in the Wildernesse; and one day being heavy with sleepe, layd himselfe downe upon the ground to sleepe, where a Serpent did sting him to the death.The cause why Dime∣trius was hated by Ptolomeus. The rea∣son wherefore Philadelphus so hated him was this: be∣cause when Ptolomeus Lagi his father had maried a se∣cond wife called Eurice (as he had Bernice the mother of Ptolemeus Philadelphus for his first wife) this Dime∣trius perswaded Ptolomeus Lagi to disinherit the sonne of Bernice, and to give the crowne to the sonne of the second wife Eurice; which when Ptolomeus Philadelphus understood, after his fathers death he presently ba∣nished him. Now seeing Dimetrius was hated so of Ptolomeus Philadelphus,Aristophanes was keeper of the Library of Ptolo∣meus. and dyed in the beginning of his raigne, is there any probability that he had the charge of this Library? and Vitruvius saith, that Ari∣stophanes that noble Grammarian had the keeping of this Library; and not Dimetrius Phalerius. Secondly, Aristaeas and these who follow him say, that there were sixe chosen out of every Tribe and sent to Egypt to translate the Bible; but at that time there dwelt no other Iewes in Iudea, but onely of the Tribe of Iuda and Benjamin, although perhaps some of the other
Tribes were scattered amongst them; yet it is certaine that these had no place amongst them, because the most part of them were caried away captive by the Assyrians. This handfull which were yet left in Iudea, had no authority amongst them, and how came it to passe that they sent the whole Synedrion or the great Councill to Egypt? besides, the Synedrion consisted not of the twelve Tribes after the captivity, but one∣ly of the Tribe of Iuda; and is it probable that they would send these Seventy to Egypt? and if it bee true which they say of these severall Cels in which they were placed, when they translated the Bible; then it behooved every one of them, to have such a sufficient measure of knowledge both in Hebrew and Greeke, that they might have finished the whole Worke alone; which no man will beleeve. Thirdly, Aristaeas reporteth that Ptolomeus sayd, if any man should adde, or take from this booke then hee should be accursed; but this was the curse which God himselfe set downe in the Law, Deut. 4.2. Rev. 22. 18. This Ptolomeus understood not: and whereas Aristaeas goeth about to prove that these curses were usuall a∣mongst the Greekes and Romans; we must understand that they never used these curses but in extreme necessi∣ty; but what necessity was there here for Ptolomeus to adde this curse, who was but desyrous that these bookes might onely be put amongst the rest of the bookes in the Library? Fourthly, if Eleazar the Highpriest and the Synedrin at Ierusalem had approved this translation, why would the Iewes at Ierusalem have so hated this translation?The Iewes kept a fast for this Translation. For yearely in remembrance of this translation they kept a fast the eight day of Tebheth, (which moneth answereth to our December) and the Iewes say, that there was three dayes darkenesse when the Law was translated,
these Angaria or fastings which they call Tagnanejoth were appointed eyther propter  for the great wrath of God which did hang over them, or for some great plague, or for killing some just man, so the Iewes observed these Angaria in remembrance of this translation, as a day of great heavinesse and not as a day of great joy; and they applyed that place of Solomon, Eccles. 3.1. There is a time to rent, and a time to sow, they who made this schisme, say they, rent the Law, when they translated it. Fiftly, If we shall marke what manner of man this Pto∣lomeus King of Aegypt was,Ptolomeus Philadelphus a vitious man. we shall hardly be induced to thinke that he had such a care in translating of the Bible: or that he would be at such charges to send for such a number of learned men to translate it: for hee was a most vile and wicked man, and hee was called Philadelphus as the Parca or weerdsisters are called Eumenides, for he killed his two brethren borne of Eu∣rices and committed incest with his owne sister Ar∣cinoe. Iosep. lib. 11.2.Sixtly, Iosephus writeth that the Law was sent by Eleazer the hie Priest to Aegypt, written in Golden Let∣ters; but this is improbable: for the Hebrew Doctors write, that it was not lawfull for any, no not for the King to write the Law, but onely with Inke; and when they saw the copy that was presented to Alexander the great,Gulil. Shickardus lib. 2. de sure reg. Hebrae. having the name Iehova still written in Golden Letters, the wise men amongst the Iewes would have them rased out, and to bee written with Inke. See how the grecizing Iewes made up this fable of the agreement and consent of the Seventy translating the Bible,The fable of the greci∣zing Iewes concerning the Translation of the Seventie. this fable arose (as Scaliger observeh well) out of the misapplying of that place, Exod. 24.9. And Moses ascended and Aaron, vers. 11. And Seventie of the
Elders of Israel. And there the Septuagints adde (which is not in the originall) , that is, Of the chosen men of Israel none of them did disagree, and hence afterward was this uniformity made up of the Seventy translating the Law in Aegypt, whereas there is no such thing in the originall text; but onely this wayes it standeth in the Text. They saw the Lord, and upon the Nobles of Israel, he layd not his hand, that is, although they saw the Lord yet they dyed not; that which was spoken of the Se∣venty in Moyses time, they applyed it to these Seventy who were sent to Aegypt in the dayes of Ptolemeus: and againe, they misinterpret the word  thus, The chosen of Israel none of them did disagree, but in the originall it is, None of them did die. Wherefore Scali∣ger judgeth (and not without cause) that this Translation of the Seventy was not procured thus,The cause that moved the Iewes to procure this Translation of the Se∣ventie. and the greci∣zing Iewes doe fable; but he saith, the matter fell out after this manner. When the Scattered Iewes lived under Ptolemeus King of Aegypt, then they were enfor∣ced to write their contracts in Greeke, and to reckon their times by the reigne of the Kings of Aegypt; who redacted them to this necessitie, to speake the Greeke tongue: and these Iewes who lived in Alexandria and through out Aegypt, procured this Translation, and that it might be read, not onely in Aegypt amongst the grecizing Iewes there; but also amongst all the gre∣cizing Iewes abroad: but the Iewes who keepe the ori∣ginall text were very loath to admit the Transla∣tion of the Seventie to be read in their Synagogues; and it was for this Translation (as Scaliger holdeth) that there was such hatred betweene the Hebrewes and the Greekes,The cause of the atred betwixt the Hebrewes and Grecizing Iewes. Act. 6.7. The other Iewes who lived still in Iudea hated these grecizing Iewes who fol∣lowed the Translation of the Seventy, they called them
hakkore giphthith, reading after the manner of the Egyptians, Legenes Egyptiae,  Retrorsum. and Lemiphrang, that is, the wrong reading: because they read from the left hand to the right, and not from the right hand to the left, as the Hebrewes doe. By this which hath beene said, wee may perceive that this Translation of the Seventy was not procured by Ptolomeus Philadelphus. This much onely wee must grant,This Translation was procured under Ptolo∣meus, but not by him. first, that this Translation was translated in the dayes of Ptolomeus Philadelpus. Secondly, that it was translated by seventy Iewes; but that Ptolomeus was the cause why it was translated, or that the Seventy were put in severall Cels when they translated it, or were divinely inspired as the Prophets of God were when they translated it;The Seventy were not inspired as Prophets, when they translated the Bible. all these are too bee deny∣ed. This Translation of the Seventy which we have now, is not that which the Seventy wrote, Origen never saw it, as may appeare by his Hexapla, for it was burnt by Dioclesian (as some hold) in the Library of Alexandria, or (as others hold) by Iulius Caesar when he burnt Sera∣pion.Barouius. Tom. 2. Vido Lipsium de Biblio∣theca.The Seventy were not , inspired by the holy Spirit, and therefore we are not to paralell the Hebrew Text and the translation of the Seventy, but where the holy Ghost hath paralelled them. There were other Translations of the Old Testament. First,Diverse translation of the old Testament. the Arabicke translation of the Testament. Se∣condly, the Persicke translation upon the five bookes of Moyses which was translated by Iacobus Ta∣vasus. And thirdly, the Ethiopian translation, transla∣ted by Damianus Agoeis. And lastly, the Armenian tran∣slation. Guido fabratius sent to the King of France the Arabicke, Ethiopian, Persian, and Armenian translations, and all in their owne Characters; which if the King
had caused print in their owne Characters, and dige∣sted them in Columnes, as Origen did his Octupla; it had beene regium opus, a princely worke. The first Latine translation out of the Hebrew was Hieroms translation,The first Translation out of the Hebrew into Latin, was that of Hiero. foure hundred yeares after Christ in the dayes of Pope Damasus, there were other tran∣slations in Latine, of which Augustine maketh mention, but they were translated out of the Greeke. The first translation of the New Testament was into the Syriacke tongue.The first translation of the new Testament, was the Syriack. Marcke is holden to be the Author of this translation, hut he was martyred in the eight yeare of Nero, and the Fathers who lived in Egypt, and Palestina make no men∣tion of this Syriack translation, as Origen, Clemens Alex∣andrinus, and Athanasius: and therefore it seemeth to be latter, and not so soone after the Apostles. The Syriack translation which was heretofore in our Churches was defective,The Syriack translation which was here to fore wanted many things. and wanted many things which were in the originall; as it wanted the last verse of the seventh Chapter of Iohn, and the history of the adulterous woman, Ioh. 8. So the second Epistle of Peter, the second and third Epistle of Iohn, the Epi∣stle of Iude, and the booke of the Revelation; all these were wanting in it. But that Copie which is brought lately from Syria wanteth none of these, as Ludovicus de. Deiu. testifieth in his Syriack translation which hee hath now published, and the Arabicke translation which Erpeneus had by him, hath all these places which the former translation wanted. Wee will subjoyne here the postscripts which are found in the Syriack and Arabick translations, after the Evangelists. The postscript of the Evangelist St. Matthew in the Syriack is this, Scriptum est in terra palestinae Hebraice,The Postscript of Mat∣thew in the Syriack and Arabick translations. this Gospel was written in the Hebrew tongue, in Pale∣stina.
The Postscript in the Arabick is this. Absolu∣tum est Evangelium Matthaei Apostoli, quod scripsit in terra Palestinae Hebraice, auxilio spiritus sancti, octo annis postquam dominus noster Iesus Christus carne in caelos ascendit, primo anno regni Claudij Caesaris Regis Romani. That is, the Gospel of the Apostle Matthew, which he wrote in Hebrew by the assistance of the holy Spirit, in the land of Palestina, was perfected eight yeares af∣ter Iesus Christ ascended to the Heavens, in the first yeare of the reigne of Claudius Caesar, the King of the Romans. The error of this Syrack and Arabiack postscript.Here observe two things, first, that the Syriack and Arabick say that this Gospel was written in He∣brew first, whereas it was written originally in Greeke. Secondly, that the Arabick calleth Matthew an Apo∣stle, whereas he was an Evangelist. The postscript of Marke in the Syriack and Arabiack Transla∣tiones.The Postscript of the Evangelist Marke, in the Sy∣riack is this, Absolutum est Evangelium Sancti Marci qui loquutus est & Evangelizavit Romae, That is, here endeth the Gospel of S. Marke which he spake and preached at Rome. The Arabick hath it thus, Finitum est exemplar Marci, quod scripsit in ditione romana occidentali, in vrbe Romana, anno duodecimo postquā dominus noster Iesus Chri∣stus carne in Caelos ascendit quarto anno Claudij Caesaris, That is, here endeth the exemplar of Marke which hee wrote in the province of westerne Rome in the City of Rome it selfe, twelve yeares after our Lord Iesus Christ ascended into heaven in the flesh, in the fourth yeere of Claudius Caesar. The errour of these two postscripts.But this Postscript is not probable, for Marke lived in the Church of Alexandria in Egypt, therefore it is more probable that he wrote his Gospel there, than at Rome. The postscript of Lu In the Arabiack and Syriack Translation.The Postscript of Luke in the Syriack is this, Scrip∣tum est Alexandriae magnae quindecem annis a Christi as∣censione.
It was written in the great City of Alexandria fifty yeares after Christs ascention. The Arabick is, Scriptum est grace in civitate Macedonia vigesimo secundo anno post ascensionem Domini in caelum, vigesimo quarto anno Claudij Caesaris. This Gospell was written in Greeke in the City of Macedonia twenty two yeares af∣ter the Lords ascension into the heavens, the twenty fourth yeare of Claudius Caesar. Here we may see the difference betwixt these two Postscripts, the Syriack saith,The error of these two postscripts. it was written in Alex∣andria in Egypt, and the Arabick saith, it was written in Macedonia in Greece, what credite then should wee give to these Postscripts? The Postscript of Iohn; the Syriack is,The postscript of Iohn in the Arabiack and Syriak Translation. Iohannes Evan∣gelista hoc Evangelium edidit Grace Ephesi. That is, the Evangelist set forth this Gospel in Greeke at Ephesus, the Arabick is, Iohannes filius Zebedaei vnus ex duodecem Apostolis, scripsit id graece Incolis Ephesi, anno post ascensio∣nem domini in Calos tricesimo, imperante Nero. Iohn the son of Zebedaeus one of the twelve Apostles wrote this in Greeke to the inhabitants of Ephesus, thirty yeares af∣ter Christs ascension, in the reigne of Nero. The Syriack translation is read in Syria, Mesopotamea, Chaldea, and Egypt; and it was sent first in to Europe by Ignatius Patriarch of Antioche. These who translated the Bible in latter times,The latter Translaters of the Bible Popish or Orthodoxe. were eyther Popish, or Orthodoxe. Popish, the Latine translation established by the councill of Trent, Vatablus, Arias Montanus, Pagninus, and Isiodorus Clarius. By the reformed, as by Munster, Ecolampadius by Leo Iuda who dying before the worke was finished, Bib∣liander, and Conradus Pellicanus finished it, and then they are called Biblia Tigurina. And lastly, by Iunius and Tremellius.
Of the Vulgar Latine translation. WHen light arose to them who sate in darkenesse and in the shadow of death, to the Protestants who lived before in Popery, they began to search the originall Text and to looke into the fountaines, the He∣brew and Greeke, and they charged the adversaries to bring their proofes out of the originall Text in their disputations with them. The Church of Rome decreed that the Vulgar Latin translation should be the originall.The Church of Rome to obviat this, made a decree in the Councill of Trent, Anno. 1546. that the vulgar Latine should be holden for the originall; which was as base a change, as when Rehoboam changed the golden Sheilds in the Temple, into Sheilds of brasse, 1 King. 14.27. So have they changed the originall into the Vulgar Latine translation, and made it authenticke; which in many places is corrupted. After that they had inacted, that the Vulgar Latine should be onely the touchstone, to try all controversies and that they should use it in their readings and dispu∣tations, then Sixtus Quintus the Pope tooke great paines about the correcting of this Vulgar Latine. Pius the fourth and Pius Quintus had done something be∣fore in the correcting of this Vulgar translation; but it was Sixtus Quintus that finished it,Forty foure yeeres be∣twixt the act of the Councill, and the fini∣shing of the Latin translation. Anno 1590. So that there were forty foure yeares betwixt the Act made in the Councill, and the finishing of the transla∣tion. Bishop Morton saith, that the Canon Law for∣biddeth, that a child shall be baptized before it bee borne; yet they will make this Vulgar translation to be originall and authenticke before it be finished and perfected by the Popes. And what will they say here? wanted the Church an authenticke translation all this
while untill it was concluded in the Councill of Trent. When Sixtus Quintus had taken all this paines in correcting the vulgar Latine, and had proclamed it as authenticke by his Bull, and cursed them who held otherwise: yet Clemens the eight came afterwards,Clemens the eight cor∣rected the vulgar tran∣slation. and corrected many things which were left uncorrected by Sixtus Quintus, and he set out a more perfect Edition than that of Sixtus Quintus: and there was great diffe∣rence betwixt these two Editions, as Docter Iames the Overseer of the Library of Oxford hath marked, in his booke which is intituled, De Bello antipapali. These were not errors in the Print (as some would salve up the matter) but they are materiall differences, as may bee seene in that booke by conferring their translati∣ons. We may demand of the Catholickes, whether did the Councill make this translation Authenticke which was not Authenticke before,Diverse udgements of the Catholicks concer∣ning the vulgar Latin translation. or did they onely declare it to be Authenticke? Some of them say, that the Councill promulgated it to be Authenticke, and that the Lord so directed the hand of the first Translator, that he er∣red not in these things that the Councill was to approve afterwards. But Bannes the Iesuite saith,Pag. 537. that it is of greater authority that is approved by the Church, than that which was immediatly written by these, who were infallibly directed by the Spirit; but can there be any greater authority than to be infallibly directed by the Spirit?In locis theologicis lib. 2. cap. 14. Canus holdeth that they were immediatly and infallibly directed by the Spirit, who translated the Scripture first into the vulgar Latine. And Gretserus go∣eth further, and sticketh not to say, that Theodosion who translated the Bible into Greeke,Defensione Bllarm. con∣tra. Whittakerum. lib. 2. cap. 2. pag. 537. erred not in his translation, but was assisted by the holy Spirit that hee could not erre; yet hee was a Iew and an enemy to
Christ. Serrarius saith, he who translated the Vulgar Latine had but the generall concurse of the Spirit of God,Serrarius in Prolegom. bibuac. Pag. 110. as the rest of the servants of God had; but was not infallibly directed by the Spirit in his translation. And Iohannes Dreido proposit. 3.4. and Andradius fol. 255. and Be armin, Lib. 2.11. admittimus eum interpre∣tem fuise, sed non vatem, and yet some of them hold that he erred not in the versions which the Church appro∣ved afterward. Againe wee may demande of them, whether will they preferre the Vulgar translation to the Hebrew and Greeke? The grosser of the Papists are not ashamed, to preferre it to them both, and they say, wee have no neede to have recourse to the originall, to try whether it be Authenticke or not, the Vulgar Latine being now established by the Councill.Inagoge ad Scripturam lib. 1. diff. 6 sect. 1. And Ludovicus a Tena saith, although the books in the originall both Hebrew and Greeke were not corrupted, yet seeing they have words of diverse significations, which the Church hath not approved or rejected: therefore wee are to hold that the Vulgar Latine is Authenticke onely; be∣cause the Church hath concluded it to be so. And Osorius saith,Osorius Instit. Moral. Lib. 8. Cap. 3. if we should grant that the Interpreter might have erred in his versions, yet the Church can∣not erre in approving his Version. The Moderne Papists preferre it not simply to the Hebrew and Greeke, as Gretserus saith, Sufficit aequatio, non pralatio: But they say, that they will not have their translation examined and tryed by the Hebrew and Greeke; for how know we (say they) that these Co∣pies which we have now, agree with the first originall Copie? we have the judgement of the Church con∣cerning this translation, but not concerning the Hebrew and Greeke. But if it bee in the Churches power to make a translation or to authorize it, why will they not
authorize the Hebrew and Greeke rather than the Vulgar Latine translation? And if they inact the Vulgar Latine to be Authen∣ticke and the onely rule to decide controversies, what shall become of all the Churches in the East that un∣derstand not the Latine; shall they under the paine of a curse receive this translation? When the Vulgar translation was concluded in the Councill of Trent, onely to be the Authenticke tran∣slation in their Disputations, Sermons, and Conferen∣ces; Some opposed against this, and said, that it was a hard thing for the Church, to judge that onely to bee Authenticke, which one man had done. And Aloysius Caetenaeas sayd, that no man could know what a Version meant, but by the Originall; and he alledged for him∣selfe Cajetans authority in the Councill, who being Legate for the Pope in Germanie, Anno 1523. was wont to say, that the onely remedy to refell Heretickes, was to understand the literall sense out of the originall tongues, and he sayd now, that the Cardinall would spend the rest of his dayes in studying of the tongues, that hee might bee the more fit to convince the Here∣tickes; which he did, and he gave himselfe to this studie eleven yeares before he dyed. Againe there was much contention among them concerning the meaning of this Canon made in the Councill of Trent, whether this translation was the judge in matters of faith or manners onely? or was it so strictly to be taken that it failed not one jote, and that Mathematice it was so perfect and not Moraliter onely? Andreas vega who was present at the Councill of Trent holden under Pope Paul the third, saith; when the Tridentine Fathers call the vulgar Latine translation, the Authenticke translation, they meane no other thing but this, that it was not corrupted with
errours, and that it might bee safely read and used to a mans salvation; and he concludeth, that the authority which the Councill gave to this translation, is not to be taken infinitivè, but definitivè with certaine limitations. But if this was the meaning of the Councill, that the faithfull might safely read it, because there was no dan∣ger of errour; then what authority or prerogative had this version by the Councill, above that translation of Pagnine for the Doctors of Lovan by the approbation of the Pope, put the translation of Pagnine with the He∣brew Text. But the former Catholickes say, that hee who translated the Hebrew into the Vulgar Latine, was not an Interpreter, but a Prophet: but how com∣meth it that others say now, that this Interpreter might erre, although not grossely? that he might erre, not in side & moralibus, but in lesser matters? and so they will have the Councill to be understood; but they of old sayd plainely, that in every thing this translation was Authenticke. Lastly, when wee demand of them whether the Church may make a new Version yet or not? or mend that which is alreadie done? Gretserus who taketh the defence of Bellarmine,Lib. 2. cap. 10. pag. 540. against Whittaker, denyeth that there can be any thing added to this translation,In Prolegom. bible. or be made more perfect. But Serrarius holdeth, that this Version may be yet helped, and that it is not come yet to such a perfection, but that it may grow to a greater; if the Church would condescend. The translation of the Seventy although the Apostles themselves followed it in many things, yet it was never holden to be Originall and Divine, by the Church, ney∣ther were the Churches commanded to receive it un∣der the paine of a curse. Hierome marketh in his Pre∣face upon the first of the Chronicles, that the Churches of Alexandria in Egypt, followed the Translation
of Hesychius (which was a translation set forth after the Seventies translation) rather then the translation of the Seventy: but frō Constantinople to Antioche, they follow∣ed the translation of Lucian the Martyr, but the Chur∣ches of Palestina (which lay betwixt these two) follow∣ed Origens Hexapla: And so he saith, the whole world was divided into thse three; then what great pre∣sumption is it in the Chuch of Rome, to make the Vul∣gar Latine Authenticke and Originall, and to injoyne it to be read in all the Churches? Franciscus Ximenius Car∣dinal of Toledo, in his Preface before the Bible set out at Complutum in Spaine saith, that he set the Vulgar Latine betwixt the Hebrew and the Greeke, as Christ was set betwixt two Theeves, is not this a fine comparison to preferre the Vulgar Latine to the Hebrew and Greeke? The Syriack translation was first translated into La∣tine by Guido Fabricius, and afterwards by Tremellius. Genebrard and Serarius taking occasion upon this tran∣slation, charged Tremellius with great forgerie. First, that he tooke away all the Titles from the Epistles; but this was no forgerie: for neyther the Superscriptions nor the Subscriptions are any part of the Canonicall Scripture, as may be seene before in the postscripts ad∣ded to the Syriacke translation. Secondly, they charge him, that he tooke away the Calender, for the reading of the Gospel upon holy dayes: but neyther the He∣brew Calender, nor the Syriacke Calender, are Divine Scripture; and that use, for which they say this Ca∣lender served, for reading of the Gospel upon holy dayes; was onely used in the westerne Romish Chur∣ches, but not in the Easterne Churches. Thirdly, they say that he committed Plagium in stealing his transla∣tion from Guido Fabricius, and setting it out under his owne name: but what diligence he used in translation of the Syriack, he who wrote his life testifieth. And
will any man thinke that he who was a native Iew, borne and trained up in these tongues, was so ignorant, that he had no skill, but that which he did steall from ano∣ther? and Gretserus addeth, that first he was a Iew, and then he became a Monke, thirdly, a Calvanist or Hu∣gonite, and lastly, that hee returned to his vomite againe, and dyed a Iew. But that yee may perceive what a Railer this was, who spared neyther the living nor the dead, I will set downe a memorable proofe of his death; he who wrote Apophthegmata morientium, (the notable sayings which sundry uttered at the last houre of their death,) relateth this of him. When they demanded of him what confession hee would make of his faith? he sayd, Vivat Christus & pereat Barabbas. Whereas the rest of the Iewes cryed, Vivat Barabbas, & pereat Christus, this he sayd to signifie that he renoun∣ced Iudaisme, and tooke him onely to the merites of Christ. Was this to dye like a Iew? the Name of this worthy man should smell to us as the Wine of Leba∣non. Hos. 14.7. Of a Paraphrase. THe second way how God maketh the Scripture plaine unto us, is by paraphrasing it, which goeth in a larger circuit of words than a translation doth; and this is called tirgam a Paraphrase. An Ecphrasis is an exposition of this Paraphrase. The first Paraphrase, was the Paraphrase of Ionathan the sonne of Vzziel, who paraphrased the great Pro∣phets thirty yeeres before Christ, both plainely and without Allegories: but upon the small Prophets hee runneth out more upon Allegories.
The second Paraphrase, was the Paraphrase of Onke∣tos otherwise called Rabbi Aquila, adding Nun and chan∣ging a into o, as Aquila Onkelos, as Bonarges Banuarges. It was hee who translated the Old Testament into Greeke also, he paraphrased the five bookes of Moyses ninety yeeres after Christ; not long after the destru∣ction of the Temple. The third Paraphrase, was Targum Hierosolymitanum upon the five bookes of Moyses, most fabulous and most impure; but because Targum Ionathan was in great request among the Iewes, and not so fabulous as this Targum; the Printers amongst the Iewes put these two letters Tan Iod before that Paraphrase, to make the Reader beleeve, that it was Targum Ionathan, Ionathans Paraphase: for these two letters stand both for Targum Ionathan, and for Targum Hierosolymitanum. Lastly, Rabbi Ioseph Caecus paraphrased Cetubhim, or the written bookes. All these Paraphrases if yee will respect the lan∣gu ge, were eyther in the Babylonian or Hierosoly∣mitan tongue; three in the Babylonian, and Tar∣gum Hierosolymitanum in the Hierosolymitan tongue. These Paraphrases,Paraphrases when they are blasphemous are to rejected. where they paraphrase against Christ are to be detested. Exam. 1. Gen. 4. Incaeptum est no∣men domini profanari, but Targum Hierosolymitanum pa∣raphraseth it blaspemously, In dibus illis coeperunt Idola colere, & fecerunt fibi Deos erroneos, quos cognominabant de nomine Sermonis domini. And here he implyeth Christ who is called , sermo dei. This paraphrase is blasphemous against the Sonne of God, and therefore to be detested. Example, 2 Can. 4.5. Thy two breasts are like two young Roes. Targum paraphraseth these two Roes to be two Mes∣siases, the one the sonne of Ioseph, the other the sonne of David, the one Poore and the other mighty, that is a
blasphemous Paraphrase, and therefore to bee dete∣sted. Example 2. Iob. 23.9. He paraphraseth it this wayes, Michael is upon his right hand, and Gabriel upon his left hand, Michael is upon his right hand, and he is fire; and Ga∣briel is upon his left hand, and he is water; and the holy crea∣tures are partly fire and partly water. This Paraphrase is blasphemous; because it maketh the Sonne of God but a Creature, and matcheth Gabriel with Mi∣chael. Paraphrases when they are ridiculous are to be rejected.Secondly, where these Paraphrases are fabulous, they are to be rejected. Example 1, Gen. 3.21. The Lord made coates of skin for Adam and Eve. Targum Hierosolymita∣num paraphraseth it this wayes. The Lord made glorious cloathes which he put upon the skin of their flesh, that they might cover themselves. Example 2. Gen. 32.26. Dimitte me quia ascendit aurora. The Paraphrast maketh this to be one of the seven An∣gels who stand before the Lord, singing continually, holy holy Lord of Hoasts, and he maketh this Angell to be cheefe of the Quire. Example 3. Exod. 13.19. And Moyses tooke the bones of Ioseph with him. Targum Hierosolymitanum par phra∣seth it thus, Ascendere fecit Moses vrnam ossium Iosephi, ex intimo Nili; & abduxit secum. Hence the Talmudist make a great question how they could finde this Chest of Ioseph, being sunke so deepe in the flood Nilus, and they flye to their shift of Shem hamphorash; and R, Be∣chai upon this, saith, that Moyses tooke a plate and wrote upon it, and sayd, ascende B (meaning Ioseph who was called Bos Dei, Deut. 33.17.) & did cast this plate into Nilus saying, O Ioseph, thy brethren which are redeemed are waiting for thee, and the cloud of glory is waiting for thee: if thou wilt not goe up with us now, wee are free of our oath.
Example 4. Deut. 28.18. Decaudicabat debiles, Hee cut off the taile or the weake of the hoast, but Targum Hieroso∣lymitanum paraphraseth it this wayes, sed accepit eos Ama∣lek, & amputavit loca virilitatis eorum, projecit{que} sursum versus coelum, dicens, tolle quod elegisti, meaning that part which was commanded by the Lord to be circumcised, they threw it up into the heavens, in contempt and spite against the Lord. Example 5. 1 Sam. 15. And he numbred them Battela∣him, but Targum paraphraseth it thus, He numbred them by the lmbes. For Telahim is called lambes also, and they say that Saul would not number the people for feare of a plague upon him and his people; as it fell out afterwards upon David and his people: therefore he caused every one of them to bring a lambe, and he numbred all the lambes, and so he knew the number of the people; such Iewish fables as these the Apostle willeth us to take heede of Tit. 1.14. But where these Paraphrases cleare the Text,Paraphrases where they cleare the Text are to be used. then we are to mke use of them. Example, Gen. 2.24. He shall leave father and mother, and cleave unto his wife. On∣kelos paraphraseth it thus, he shall leave Donium cubilis, where the Paraphrast alludeth to the ancient custome of the Iewes, fo the children lay in their fathers cham∣ber before they were maried, Luk. 11.7. My children are with me in bed. Example 2. Gen. 12.5. And Abraham tooke all the soules which he had got in Charan, Onkelos paraphraseth it thus, Omnes animas quas subjecerat legi. Example 3. Gen 49. Ruben excellens munere & dignita∣te, Onkelos paraphraseth it thus, Excellens principatu & Sacerdotio; for hee that was the first borne, at the first, was both the Prince and the Priest in the Fami∣ly. Example 4. Gen. 49, 27. Beniamin a ravening woolfe,
he shall cate the prey in the morning, and shall divide the spoyle at night. The Paraphrast paraphraseth it thus, In his possession shall the Sanctuary bee built, morning and evening shall the Priests offer their offerings; and in the eve∣ning shall they divide the rest of the portion which is left of the sanctified things. Of interpretation of Scripture. THe third outward meane whereby the Lord ma∣keth the Scripture cleare to his Church, is Interpre∣tation, and this is called . ,This Interpretation of the Scriptures maketh the people to understand them, for when the Scriptures are not interpreted,The Scriptures not being interpreted to the people, are like a Nut not broken. they are like a Nut not broken. When Gideon heard the dreame and the interpretation of of it, Iud. 7.15. In the Hebrew it is Veshibhro, the brea∣king of it: a speech borrowed from the breaking of a Nut; for as we breake the shell that wee may get the Kernell: So the Scriptures must bee broken for the people, and cut up for their understanding. It was the manner of the Iewes in their Synagogues, after that the Law and the Prophets were read, to In∣terpret the scriptures, Act. 13.15. And after the reading of the Law and Prophets, the rulers of the Synagogue sent un∣to them saying, ye men and brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people; say on. And therefore the Synagogue was called Beth midresh, Domus expositionis, & we see the practise of this, Nehem. 8.8. Legerunt cum appositione intellectus: They read the Law clearely to the peo∣ple, and caused them to understand those things which were read; this was the fruite of their interpretation. So they did  Act. 16.10. Conferre places
with places. The giving of the sense here, is more than to give the grammaticall interpretation of the words: they gave the sense and the spirituall meaning of them when they preached, Noah was a Preacher of righteous∣nesse, 2 Pet 2.5. The Church is not onely the keeper of the Scriptures, but also an Interpreter of them. This word Kara signifieth both to Reade and to Promulgate, Legit Proclamavit Esar. 29.12. & 61.12. Zach. 7, 7. Act. 10.20. So Mikra which signifieth Reading, signifieth also an Assem∣bly or Convocation, to teach us that the holy Scriptures ought to bee read in the congregation, and holy assem∣blies, and ought likewise to be expounded. The conclusion of this is; The Lord useth so many meanes to make the Scripture cleare to the people, and yet the Church of Rome goeth about to stoppe these Fountaines of living waters, that the people may not drinke of them. As the Spies raised a slander upon the Land of Canaan, saying that it was unpossible to be won: so doe they slander the Scriptures of God with obscurities, and say, that it is impossible for the people to understand them. EXERCITAT. XVI. Of the division of the Scriptures. They have Moses and the Prophets. Luc. 16.29. THe scriptures are divided into the old and New Testament. The old Testament againe is divided into Moses and the Prophets, and sometimes the Law is put for the whole old Testament, Rom. 3. So Iob. 7.49. Esay. 2.3.
And sometimes the Psalmes are called the Law. Ioh. 15.25. That the word might be fulfilled which is written in their Law, they hated me without a cause. So the Prophets are called the Law. 1 Cor. 14.21 In the Law it is writ∣ten. pent chus inMoses is divided into Hammitzua, Commandements, Chukkim, statutes, and Mishpatim, judgements; that is, in Morall Precepts, Ceremoniall, and Iudi∣ciall. The Iewes againe divide the old Testament into the Law, priores,  posteriores.  prophetae the Prophets and Cetubhim, which the Greekes call , holy writings, all the Scriptures are holy writings; but usually these that were not confirmed by Vrim and Thummim are called . The Prophets are divided in Rishonim & Acharonim, the former and the Latter: the former Prophets are Ioshua, Iudges, 1 Samuel, 2 Samuel. 1 Kings and 2 Kings, They are called the former Prophets because they in∣treat of the historie past, and present. Act. 3.24. Yea and all the Prophets from Samuel and those that follow after. Samuel is sayd to be the first of the Prophets; therefore, Iere. 15.1. Though Moses and Samuel stood before me, Sa∣muel is the first of the Prophets; then it is most proba∣ble that he wrote the bookes of Ioshua and Iudges. Ioshua is the first in order of the Prophets, therefore the Hap∣torath which is set upon it, is called Haphtorah laetitiae legis, They were glad when they ended the Law, and began the Prophets. But Samuel seemeth to bee the writer of this booke. Others call them the first Prophets, because they saw the first Temple; and they call them the latter Prophets, because they prophesied in the time of the second Temple, as Haggai, Malachi, Zacharie. But they are all rather to bee called Acharonim latter Pro∣phets, because they foretell things to come: and they
are divided into the great Prophets and into the small. The great Prophets are Isaiah, Ieremiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel. The latter Prophets are called Teresar pro Tere gnasar that is, two and ten, pro,  duodecem. and the Greekes called them . There is a Testimonie cited by Matthew, cap. 2.23. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophets. This Testimonie is found but in one of the Small prophets:. yet it is said to bee spo∣ken by the Prophets, and they gave this to be the rea∣son, because all these Twelve small Prophets were joyned in one booke. The Conclusion of this is.  First the Lord hath sum∣med up all that he requireth of us in one word, Love. Rom. 13, 10. Love is the fulfilling of the Law. Then hee hath enlarged this word in two Mat. 22.37. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart: and thou shalt love thy Neighbour as thy selfe. Thirdly hee hath enlar∣ged these two into ten words Deut. 10.4. And hee wrote on the Tables the ten words. Fourthly hee hath enlarged them into Moses and the Prophets. Mat. 22.40. On these two Commandements hang all the Law and the Pro∣phets,  pendent, even as wee hang a thing upon a Naile, Esay 22.23. So the Law and the Prophets hang upon these two.
EXERCITAT. XVII Of the Division of the Psalmes. Act. 13.33. As it is also written in the second Psalme. Thou art my Sonne this day have I begotten thee. THe Psalmes are divided in five bookes, as the five Bookes of Moses; and the five Bookes joyned to∣gether called Quinque volumina, as Canticles. Ruth. Lamen∣tations. Ecclesiastes and Esther. The first booke of the Psalmes endeth with the, 41. Psalme. The second endeth with the 72 Psalme. The third with the 89. The fourth with the 106. The fift with the 150. Psalme, and these bookes end with the same words, Baruch Iehova Elohe Iisrael mehagnolam vegnad hagnolam, Amen veamen. Blessed bee the Lord God of Israel from Everlasting to Everlasting, Amen, Amen. Psal. 41.13. so the rest of the bookes, for the most part end thus. And hence wee may gather, that this verse was added by him who set the Psalmes in order, and not by those who wrote the rest of the Psalmes. This may appeare by the conclusion of Davids Psalme of thankesgiving 1 Chro. 16.36. That they have bor∣rowed their conclusion at the end of every booke from the conclusion of this Psalme. David wrote the first two bookes of the Psalmes and set them in order.The first two bookes were written by David, and they end thus, So end the Prayers of David the Sonne of Iffe, Psal. 27.30. That is, here end the Psalmes which were both written and set in order by David. The other three bookes were written by diverse Authors as by David, Asaph, the sonnes of Korah, Ieduthun, Moses, Heman the Ezrite, and when the wri∣ter
of the Psalme is not set downe, the Iewes hold, that hee who wrote the former, wrote that Psalme also. Asaph wrote thirteene Psalmes, Leasaph, Lamed is somtimes a note of the genitive case, and sometimes of the Dative case,ל Aliquando est nota Genitivs aliquando Dativi. and therefore some have interpre∣ted the word Mizmor leasaph, a Psalme dedicat to Asaph to be sung be him; but it should be Translated a Psalme of Asaph: for Asaph was a Prophet, 2 Chron. 39.30. More∣over Hezekiah and the Princes commanded the Levites to sing praises unto the Lord, with the words of David and Asaph the Seer. And the style of Asaph is harder then the Style of David. The second who wrote these Psalmes were the Sonnes of Korah, and they wrote ten in number;The sonne of Korah wrote some of the Psalmes. the posteritie of Korah died not in the rebellion with their Father, Num. 26.11. Some of his posteritie wrote be∣fore the captivitie, and foretold of the captivitie, as the Psal. 73 74. And some of them when they were in the captivitie. So some when they were returning from the captivi∣tie, as 66. Some after they were returned, as 85. and 147. So Moses wrote a Psalme of the shortnesse of the life of man,Moyses wrote a Psalme. this Psalme was written when they were in the Wildernesse, and yet it was not registred in the Canon till after the captivitie. Thus we see the watch∣full eye of God, that had a care to preserve these bookes which were to bee insert in the Canon, that none of them should perish. So these Psalmes which were written by Ieduthun and by Ethan the Ezrite who were of the posterity of the Levites.Ieduthun and Ethan wrote some of the Psalmes. The Levites dutie was to teach the Peo∣ple, and so the Lord made those Levites teachers of the people by their songs.
Of the inscriptions of the Psalmes. THe Psalmes generally are intituled Tehilim, praises, because the most of them are songes of prayse;The generall inscription of the Psalmes is Tehilim therefore the whole are so called. The particular Inscriptions of them are eyther easily understood, or hardly to be understood at all. The inscriptions easie to bee understood are these. First, Lamnatzeahh,  to the chiefe Musitian. The singers were divided into so many orders, and every one sang according to their courses, and when it befell the chiefe Musitian to sing, then he caused to sing this Psalme committed to him. The next title is Maschil a Psalme for instruction. These were Psalmes which David made out of his owne experience. Peter, when thou art converted streng∣then thy brethren,Luk. 22.32 these were called Psalmi didasalici. The third was Michtam, Aurei Psalmi, golden Psalmes: all the Word of God is like fine gold, Psal. 119. And yet these Psalmes are called Golden Psalmes, because there is some speciall and choyse matter in them: so all the word of God is faithfull, all to bee trusted, yet Paul saith; Fidus est hic sermo, This is a faith∣full saying, 2 Tim. 1.15. Having some notable things in it, and as all the Ring is Gold, yet the Diamond is the most excellent: So although all the Word of God be excellent, yet these are most excellent. So some are intituled lehazcir, Ad recordandū to bring to remem∣brance, as 38. 70. because they were made in remēbrance of some notable deliverance or of some great benefit. Fourthly, some are called Psalmes of degrees. Psalme wich they sang wh n they carried the Arke out of the house of David to the Temple.When they brought the Arke from Davids house into the Temple, they sang, Psal. 119. by the way, it be∣ginneth with these words, Beati immaculati in via,
and intreateth especially of the Law of the Lord,In omnibus versibus Psal∣mi 119. dempto versu 122. vna harum vnde∣cem vocum invenitur.  and there is not a verse in it, except onely the 122. verse, which hath not some epithet of the Law of God in it, as his Iudgements, his Word, his Statutes, his Lawes, his Testimonies, his Commandements, his Precepts, his Cove∣nant &c, And when they entred into the Court of the Gentiles with the Arke, they sang the last part of this, Psal. 119. When they went further to the Court of the people,When and where they sung the Psalmes of de∣grees. when they stood upon the first degree, they sung Psal. 120. which containeth the history of the deliverance of the people out of Egypt. And when they stood upon the second degree, they sung Psal. 121. My helpe commeth from the Lord. When they were upon the third step they sung Psal. 122. I was glad when they sayd unto mee, let us goe into the house of the Lord. So they sung a Psalme upon every step as they ascended, and upon the eight step when they beheld the excellent buildings of the Courts of the Levites, they sung Psal. 127. Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vaine that build it. When they entred into the Court of the Priests, they sung Psal. 128.Vide Villalpand in Ezek. 40.28. And upon the last step they sung Psal. 134. Blesse yee the Lord all his servants which watch by night in the house of the Lord. The people might goe no further; then the Priests went forward with the Arke into the Temple, and when they entred into the porch of the Temple, they sung Psal. 118. vers. 19. Open to me the gates of righteousnesse. When they were stan∣ding in the porch they sung these verses following,The Psalmes which the Priests sung when the Arke entered into the Temple and into the holiest of all. This is the gate of the Lord into which the righteous shall enter. When they were in the midst of the Temple they sung the 22. verse, I will praise thee, for thou hast heard mee and art become my salvation, and when the Arke entred into the holiest of all, they sung Psal. 24. The inscription of the Psalmes which we understand
not; are eyther Notes of Musicke, or Instruments of Musicke. Some inscriptions are Notes or tunes of Mu∣sicke.Notes of Musicke or common Tunes with which the Psalmes were sung are these, Gnal muth-labben, Psal. 9. gnal sheminith, Psal. 6.12. gnal aijeleth Shahar, Psal. 22. gnal Ionath Elem Rechokim, 56. Altaschith 57. 59. 75. gnal shushan Eduth, 60. gnal shoshannim 45. 69 gnal shoshannim Eduth, 80. gnal Mahalath Leannoth, 88. Some inscriptions are instruments of Musicke.Instruments of Musicke are these, Neginoth. 4. 6. 41. 54. 67. 76. Nehiloth, 5. gittith, 8. 81. & Mahalath 53. The Iewes who live now understand not the musicke nor musi∣sicall instruments which were of old.The Instruments of musicke set downe Psal. 150. none of the Iewes themselves can distinguish them, and they are ignorant of all these sorts of Musicke now: but wee are to blesse God, that the matter contained in these Psalmes may be understood by the Church. Psalmes are divided ac∣cording to the time.The Psalmes againe were divided according to the time when they were sung, some were sung every mor∣ning, as Psal. 22. at the morning sacrifice. So Psal. 92. was sung upon the Sabbath: So at the passeover they sung from Psal. 112. to vers. 19. of Psal. 118. and this was that hymne which Christ and his Apostles sang at the passeover, Matth, 26.30. And when they had sung an Hymne; they went out into the mount of Olives. Psalmes divided accor∣ding to their subject.The Psalmes were divided also according to their subject. The first booke of the Psalmes intreateth of sad matters, the second of glad, the third of sad, the fourth of glad, the fift of glad and sad mat∣ters. Psalmes which concerne Christ.There are some Psalmes, which concerne Christ in his Natures and Offices. His Natures, as Psal. 110. The Lord sayd to my Lord &c. His kingly authority, as Psal. 2. His priestly office. Psal. 110. Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchizedek. So his passion, Psal. 22. So his buriall and resurrection, Psal. 16. and his ascension and glory, Psal. 118.25.26. when David was
crowned King, the people cryed, Anna Iehova hoshignah na anna, Iehova hatzlihhah na. Save now I beseech thee O Lord, O Lord I beseech thee send now prosperity, that is, we beseech thee O Lord to save the King, and to pro∣sper him. And the Priest sayd, Blessed bee bee that com∣meth in the name of the Lord: we have blessed you out of the house of the Lord. This prayer is applyed to Christ, Matth. 21.9. Hosanna filio David, they contract these three words Hoshignah na anna in one word Hosanna, contracte  and they say Hosanna to the Sonne of David, id est, contingat salus filio David in altissimis, they wished not onely pro∣sperity and safety in the earth here,Vetum hosanna, pacem & gloriam comprehendit. but all happinesse to him in the highest heavens, Luk. 19.28. There are some Psalmes which concerned Davids particular estate, in his persecution by Saul, by Absolon; &c. In his sickenesse, in his adversity.Psalmes which concer∣ned David. In his prosperi∣ty how he fell in adulterie, and repented, Psal. 51. how he dedicated his house to the Lord, Psal. 30. how he purged his house of wicked men, Psal. 101. when hee entred to his kingdome, 144. So a Psalme to his Sonne Salomon when hee was to succeed into the kingdome Psal. 72. Lastly,Psalmi alphabetici. some Psalmes are divided according to the Letters of the Alphabet, as Psal. 25.134.111.112.119.145. These Psalmes were distinguished by the Let∣ters that they might keepe them the better in their me∣mories, and as Matthew summeth up the genealogie of Christ into three foureteene generations for the me∣mories cause: So these Psalmes are set downe after the order of the Alphabet to helpe the memory. Psal. 25, wanteth three Letters . Psal. 111. every verse hath two letters of the Alphabet, and the two last verses have three letters to make up the Alphabet: So Psal. 112. hath the letters after the same manner. The 119. is distinguished by the letters of the Alphabet, and here
yee shall see, that every Section as it beginneth with the letter, so all the verses of that section began with that same letter, as the first Section beginneth with א, there∣fore all the eight verses in the first Section begin with א, &c. So Psal. 145. Is set downe after the order of the Alphabet,The Syriak Arabick, Seventy, and vulgar La¦tin, adde this verse to Psalme 145. and make it the 4. verse. but it wanteth the Letter נ. Here some goe about to prove by this, that the originall Copie is defective, and therefore the Arabicke translation ad∣deth a verse, Fideiis dominus in omni∣nus verbis suis, & benig∣butin omnibus operibus suis. so doe the Seventy and the Vulgar Latine; but if it be defective here, why doe they not supply a verse likewise in Psal. 34. where ו is defective in the Alphabet? we are not to thinke that there is any de∣fect in the matter because these letters of the Alphabet are wanting: for the Lord fitted these letters to the matter onely, and not the matter to the letters; and because the holy Ghost hath not set downe the matter here, therefore the Letter נ is left out; but not this wayes, because the Letter נ is wanting here; therefore the letter is wanting. The five last Psalmes begin with Halleluia, and end with it, because they are the conclusion and summe of the whole praises of God. So the Church in the reve∣lation concludeth after the victory with the same words, Reve. 19.1. Alleluia, salvation and glory and ho∣nour and power unto the Lord our God. The Conclusion of this is, the Psalmes are generally intituled Tehilim praises, from the most excellent part of them: Therefore our chiefe care should bee to praise God here in this life, and then in the life to come we shall sing the song of Moyses the servant of God, and the song of the Lambe, Reve. 15.3.
EXERCITAT. Of the division of the Law and the Prophets, in parashoth and haphtaroth. Act. 15.21. For Moyses of old time had in every City them that preach him, being read in their Synagogues every Sabbath day. THe Scriptures were not divided into Chapters, as we have them now divided, therefore the Iewes say, that the whole Law is Instar vnius pesuk, that is, but as one verse. The Old Testament was divided into parashoth and Haphtaroth; this division into parashoth was most ancient, Act. 8.32. The place of Scripture which he read was this, in the Greeke it is  the Section, and the Sy∣riacke calleth it pasuka. They distinguished not these parashoth and haphtaroth by numbers, as we doe our Chapters; they sayd not the first parashah, the second parashah, but they distin∣guish them by the first words of the Section; as the first parashah is called Bereshith, the second Elle toledoth Noah, &c. They used to divide and distinguish these great para∣shoth and haphtaroth three wayes. First, they distinguish∣ed them with three great P P P. Secondly, they di∣stinguished them with three great Samechs, as Gen. 20.10. these Samechs or Semucheth make not so great a di∣stinction as when they are distinguished by three great P P P: for there is some coherence (whch they are di∣stinguished by Samech) with that which goeth before. So in the particular parashoth when yee see them distin∣guished
by parashah or by Semuchah; but onely with great letters, as Gen. 32.2. this word vaijshlahh begin∣neth the parashah in great letters. Ioh. 7.37. In the last day, that great day of the feast, Iesus stood and cryed saying, &c. This was the eight day of the feast of the Tabernacles,They read three secti∣ons upon the eight day of the feast of taberna∣cles when the Law was ended. and it is called the great Sabbath. This day they kept Festum laetitiae legis, The feast of joy, because they ended the reading of the Law that day; and the next Sabbath they called it Sabbath be∣reshith, because they began to reade the booke of Genesis againe. And yee shall see that this day they read three Haphtaroth or Sections,. the first was haphtaroth elle pe∣kudi lejom sheni shel Succoth, and it began, 1 King. 7.51. So was ended all the words which King Salomon made, &c. And that day Salomon stood up and blessed the people; So the true Salomon Iesus Christ blessed the people In that great and last day of the feast. The second haphtarah which was read this day, was Iosh. 1. haphtaroth shim∣hhath torah. Sectio laetitiae legis, because the Law was ended, and Ioshua began the Prophets. The third parashah which they read was, Malac. 3. Haphtaroth sabbath hagadol, and it ended thus, Behold I will send you Eliah the Prophet, and so they joyned the last Secti∣on of the Law, and the last Section of the Prophets both together, and it was in this day that Iesus Christ stood up and spake to them; the true Salomon, the true Ioshua, the end of the Law and the Prophets. And whereas the Iewes on this day delighted themselves much with banqueting, and drinke; Iesus Christ cal∣leth all those to him who thirst, and he promiseth to re∣fresh them; If any man thirst let him come unto me and drinke. Scaliger holdeth, that the Apostle, Coloss. 2.16. Let no man Iudge you  in parte Sabbathi,In Elencho trihares. cap. 21. pag. 217. signi∣fieth that, which the Hebrewes call Parashah, and which
the Talmud calleth Perek or Chelek, or which the Greekes call  but the Apostle meaneth onely here, that he would not have the Iewes to condemne the Colossians, for not observing their Iewish Sab∣baths; as he would have the Gentiles to abstaine from things strangled, and blood, Act. 15.29. That they might not give offence to the weake Iewes. The Iewes say, that this division in Parashoth was most ancient, but the division into Haphtaroth was later, and they give this to be the reason why they reade these Haphtaroth, they say, when, Antiochus Epiphanes forbad them under paine of death to reade the Law of Moses 1 Macch. 2. then they made choise of some parts of the Prophets answerable to these parts of the Law. Example, because they durst not reade Petorah beresith. They read Esay. 42. So saith the Lord Creator of heaven and earth. Example, 2. the second Parasha is Elle tole∣doth Noah, now because they durst not read this they read Esay. besiman, that is,The reading of Moyses and the Prophets more ancient than Antiochus. at the signe 54. (for that which we call a Chapter they call a signe) Sing yee bar∣ren, &c. But is it likely that Antiochus that great Ty∣rant,. forbad them onely the reading of the five bookes of Moses? wherefore the reading of Moses and the Pro∣phets hath beene much more ancient than the time of Antiochus: therefore Act. 15.21. Moses is read of old. A Phrase which signifieth a great antiquitie. When they read Moses Law,They read the whole Law in their Syna∣gogues once in the yeere. they divided it in fifty and two Sections, and they finished it once in the yeere: They had two sorts of yeeres, there was Annus impraegnatus or Embolimaeus, and Annus Aequabilis. An∣nus Impragnatus was that, which wee call Leape yeare, and it had fifty three weekes;Annus impragnatus. embolimaeus. in this yeere they divided one Parashah in two parts, and so they ended the rea∣ding of the Law within the yeare. When it was Annus Aequabilis then it had but fifty two weeks, then they read
one Parashah for every Sabbath, and in the last Sabbath of the yeare, which was the twentie third of Tishri, they read that Parashah called Latitia legis, which begin∣neth Ioshu. 1. And the next Sabbath they began bere∣sith againe at the first of Genesis. These Parashoth were subdivided into so many parts, and there were sundrie who read these parts upon the Sabbath, hee that read the first, was called Cohen the Preist, hee repeated the first part of the Section; and then rose up Catzan, or Cantor, who did sing the same part which the Priests had read; then there rose up in the third place a Levite, and he read his part; Fourthly, there rose up an Israelite, and hee read his part, and at last it came to Maphtir, a  cessare in hiphil dimittere. and hee read the last part of the Haphtorah; he was called Maphtir, because when that part was read, the people were dismissed, and so the Latine Church said Ite missa est. In the weeke dayes, they read upon the second and the fift day of the weeke, some part of those Parashoth, but not the whole: and the Pharisee meant of these two dayes when he said, I fast twise in the weeke Luk. 18.12. The Greeke and Latine Fathers never cite Chap∣ters as we doe now; Augustine in his booke of retracta∣tions, Cap. 24. saith not, I have written to Genesis 3. but this wayes, I have written to the casting out of our parents out of paradise. And Gregorie in his Prologue upon the first of the Kings, saith; I have expounded to you from the beginning of the booke, unto the victory of David. Who divided the Scriptures first into Chapters it is not certaine; they were divided of old two manner of wayes; first they divided them into  titles, (for so they called the greater parts) and then into Chapters as into lesser parts: others againe divided them into Chap∣ters as into greater parts. It is holden, that Musaeus
presbiter Ecclesiae Massiliensis divided them first into ti∣tles, and subdivided them into Chapters.Genebrard, Chronologia. According to this first division Matthew had sixty three titles, and three hundreth and fifty five Chapters. So Luke ac∣cording to the ancient division had forty eight titles, and three hundreth and forty eight chapters. He who began this latter division into Chapters, is holden to be Hugo Cardinalis: according to this divisi∣on Matthew hath twenty and eight Chapters, and Luke twenty and foure, &c. Lastly, it was divided into verses: this division into Pe∣suchim or verses, the Masoreth found out first amongst the Iewes: The Greekes called them . Scaliger cal∣leth them Commata, and Robertus Stephanus calleth them Sectiunculas, and some hold that it was hee that found them out first amongst us. EXERCITAT. XIX. Of the sense of the Scriptures. THere is but one literall sense in the Scriptures, which is profitable for doctrine, for reproofe, for cor∣rection, for instruction in righteousnesse, 2 Tim. 3.16. To make divers senses in the Scripture, is to make it like that  which Anaxagoras dreamed of, making Quidlibet ex quolibet.August. Epist. 48. Augustine writing to Vincentius, justly derideth the Donatists who constru∣cting these words, Cant. 1.7. Tell me (o thou whom my soule loveth) where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flocks to rest at noone; They gathered out of them that
the Church of Christ was onely in Africa by their allegoricall application. Origen was too much given to these allegories, and therefore he missed often the true sense of the Scriptures. These who gathered divers senses out of the Scripture, doe little better with them, than Esope did with an inscription written in a pillar of Marble, in which were written these seven letters . Esope first read them thus, , id est, abscedens gradus quatuor fodiens inve∣nies thesaurum auri. But Xanthus his master finding, as he had spoken, a great treasure of Gold, and giving no∣thing to Esope for his conjecture, kept all to himselfe, therefore Esope read them another way thus, , id est, qui tollitis dum abitis, dividite quem invenistis thesaurum auri. But when Esope got nothing, in a rage he read it thus, . id est, redde Regi Dionysio quem invenisti thesaurum auri. The Iewes hold that there is a literall sense in every Scripture, and a mysticall sense; the literall sense they call Dabhar keton, rem parvam, and the mysticall sense they call it Dabhar gadol, rem magnam, the literall sense they call it peshath, sensum nudum, and the mysti∣call sense they call it darash; and most of the Schoole∣men hold that there is a double sense in the Scriptures. Latomus the Papist saith, Theologiam crassam versari circa literalem sensum, theologiam subtiliorem versari circa mysticum & allegoricum sensum, and they call the literall sense panperem & grammaticum, and the allegori∣call Divitem & theologicum, the rich and theologi∣call sense. But we must strive to finde out the literall sense of the Scriptures, or else we shall never come by the true meaning. The literall sense is that which the words beare ey∣ther
properly or figuratively, therefore he sayd well who sayd, bonus grammaticus, bonus theologus: for we can never come to the true meaning and sense, unlesse the words be unfolded. A figurative literall sense is eyther in verbis vel in rebus, eyther in the words or in the matter. In verbis, in the words, as Luk. 13.32. Herod is a Foxe Psal. 22.12. The princes of Israel are Buls of Basan, in these words there is but one sense. So Let the dead bury the dead, Luk 9.50. Dead in soule bury the dead in bo∣dy, here is but one sense; but where the words in one sentence have diverse significations, then they make up divers senses, as judge not that yee be not judged,Iudicium libertatis. Iudicium potestais. Mat. 7.1. the first is, judicium libertatis, the second is, judici∣um potestatis. When we search to finde out the literall sense of the Scripture, that cannot be the literall sense of it which is contrary to the analogie of faith, which is eyther in credendis or in faciendis. If it be contrary to the arti∣cles of our faith or any of the commandements, then that cannot be the literall sens, as Rom. 12.20. If thine enemy be hungry give him meate, if he thirst give him drinke: for in so doing, thou shalt heape coales of fire upon his head. Here to feede the enemy, and to give him drinke, are to be taken literally, because they are commanded in the sixt Commandement: but to heape coales of fire upon his head, must be taken figuratively, because ac∣cording to the letter, it is contrary to the sixt Comman∣dement. Example, 2. Matth. 5.29. If thy right eye offend thee, plucke it out, and cast it from thee, Here the words are not to be taken literally, for this were contrary to the sixt Commandement, but figuratively. So this is my body, is not to be taken literally, for it is contrary to the analogie of faith: because the heavens must containe the bodie of Christ untill he come againe, Act. 3.21.
The second is figurative in rebus, as in the Sacra∣ment of the Supper, when he sate with his Disciples he sayd, This is my body; he pointeth at the thing present, and understandeth the thing that is not present; he had the bread and cup in his hand, and he sayd, This is my body, This is my blood, In these propositions there is the subject and the attribute; the subject is the bread and wine which he doth demonstrate; the attribute is that which is signified by the bread and wine, and these two make up but one sense, propius & remotius; when Peter had made a confession that Christ was the Sonne of the living God, Matth. 16. Christ to confirme this unto him, and to the rest of the Disciples, saith, Tu es Pe∣trus,Similie. & super hanc petram, &c. he pointeth at Peter, but he understandeth himselfe, upon whom the Church is built and not Peter. When a man looketh upon a picture, he saith, this picture is my father, here he un∣derstandeth two things, propius & remetius, to wit the picture it selfe, and his father represented by the picture; this picture at which hee pointeth is not his father properly, but onely it representeth his fa∣ther. But some will object, when it is sayd, Hic est sanguis meus, that the article hic agreeth with Sanguis, and not with Vinum, therefore it may seeme that it is his blood indeed, and not wine that he pointeth at. This cannot be, for in the former proposition when he sayd, hoc est corpus meum, he should have sayd, hic est corpus meum; because it repeateth the word panis as it is more cleare in the Greeke, therefore the article hic hath relation to some other thing, than to the bread at which he pointeth, for the article  repeateth not  or , the bread or the wine, but  and , his body and his blood. When Moyses sayd, Exod. 24.8 Behold the blood of the Covenant, here the word blood
is properly to be understood: because their covenants were confirmed with blood, and there was no sacrifice without blood. But when Christ sayd, This is my blood of the New Testament, there was no blood in the Cup here, but he had relation to his owne blood, which was signified by the wine in the Cup. When Christ saith, This is my body, This is my blood, how was he present with the bread and the wine there? A thing is sayd to be present foure manner of wayes,  first, , secondly, , thirdly, , and fourthly, . First,  when a man is bodily present. Se∣condly, , as when a man is present by his pi∣cture. Thirdly, , as the sunne is present by ope∣ration in heating and nourishing things below here. Fourthly, , when we apprehend a thing in our mind. Christ when he sayd, this is my body, and this is my blood, he was present there , but he was not in the bread and the wine , for then his blood should have beene there before it was shed; then hee should have had two bodies, one visible and another in∣visible: but he was present there in the bread and the wine , because the bread and the wine repre∣sented his body, and his blood. So hee was present there , by his Spirit working in their hearts and he was present to them by faith , when they did spiritually eate his body and drinke his blood, and this is the true and literall sense of the words. Which is the literall sense in those words,  Hoc fa∣cite in mei recordationem, doe this in remembrance of me? Although there bee many things implyed in these words,  both upon the part of the Minister and upon the part of the People, yet they make up but one sense; as
upon the part of the Minister; Take this bread, blesse this bread, breake it and give it to the people. And up∣on the part of the people; take this bread, eate this bread, &c. yet all these looke but to one thing, that is, to the remembrance of Christs death: and therefore the externall action bringeth to minde the internall action, the remembrance of Christs death: so that in these words there is but one sense. Testimonies of the old Testament cited in the New, make but one sense.When the testimonies of the old Testament are cited in the new, the Spirit of God intendeth propinquius & remotius, something nearer and something farther off; yet these two make not up two divers senses, but one full and intire sense. When Ionathan shot three Ar∣rowes to advertise David, 1 Sam. 20.20. hee had not two meanings in his minde, but one: his meaning was to shew David how Saul his father was minded to∣wards him, and whether he might abide or flye: So the meaning of the holy Ghost is but one in these places. Example, 2 Sam. 7.12. The Lord maketh a promise to David, I will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceede out of thy bowels. This promise looked both ad propius & remotius, a radice  & non a  lex.  significat formam. 2 Chron. 17.17. yet it made up but one sense, propius to Salo∣mon, and remotius to Christ: therefore when he looketh to the farthest, to Christ, 2 Sam. 7.19. he saith, Zoth torath, Haec est delineatio hominis Dei, it should not bee read, is this the Law of the man O Lord God? as if David should say, this is not all that thou hast promised to me O Lord, that I should have a sonne proceeding out of my owne loynes, but in him thou dost prefigure to me a sonne, who shall be both God and man: and hee addeth For a great while to come, thou doest promise to me a sonne presently to succeede in my kingdome, but I see besides him a farre off the blessed Messias. And he applyeth this promise literally to his sonne Salomon, and figuratively to Christ his Sonne; taking the pro∣mise
in a larger extent; and the matter may be cleared by this comparison. A father hath a sonne who is farre from him, he biddeth the Tailor shape a coate to him, and to take the measure by another child who is there present, but withall hee biddeth the Taylor make it larger; because his child will waxe taller: So this pro∣mise made to David was first cut out (as it were) for Sa∣lomon his sonne, but yet it had a larger extent: for it is applyed to Christ who is greater than Salomon: and as by a sphere of wood wee take up the celestiall spheres: So by the promises made to David concer∣ning Salomon, we take up him who is greater than Salo∣mon; and these two make but up one sense. When a man fixeth his eye upon one to behold him, another man accidentally commeth in, in the meane time; hee casteth his eyes upon that man also: So the Lords eye was principally upon the Messias, but hee did cast a looke, as it were, also to Salomon. When these testimonies are applyed in the New Te∣stament,A Scripture diversely applyed, doth make up but one literall sense. the literall sense is made up sometimes of the type and the thing typed. Example, Ioh. 19.36. A bone of him shall not be broken. This is spoken both of the bones of the Paschall Lambe, and of the bones of Christ; and both of them make up but one literall sense. Sometimes the literall sense is made up ex historico & allegorico, as Sara and Hagar, the bond woman and the free, signifie the children of the promise begotten by grace, and the bond servants under the Law; and these two make up but one sense. Sometimes ex tropologico & literali, as, Ye shall not mussle the mouth of the Oxe that treadeth out the corne, 1 Cor. 8.9. Fourthly, the literall sense is made up ex historico, my∣stico & prophetico. Example, Ier. 31.15. A voyce was
heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter weeping, Rachel weeping for children, refusing to bee comforted for her chil∣dren because they were not. There was a voyce heard in Ramah for Ephraims captivity, that is, for the ten Tribes who came of Ioseph the sonne of Rahel, this mourning was because the ten Tribes should not be brought backe againe from the captivity, this was mysticall and not propheticall, that shee mourned for the ten Tribes who were led away into captivity; but it was propheticall foretelling the cruell murther which Herod commit∣ted in killing the infants not farre from Rahels grave; all these are comprehended in this prophesie, and make up one full sense. When a testimony is cited out of the Old Testa∣ment in the new, the Spirit of God intendeth, that this is the proper meaning in both the places, and that they make not up two divers senses. Example, the Lord saith, make fat the hearts of this people, Esa. 6.9. and Christ saith, Matth. 13.14. In them is fulfilled this prophesie. This judgement to make fat the hearts, was denounced against the Iewes in Esaias time at the first, Act. 23.16. Well spake the holy Ghost by Isaiah the Prophet, it was fulfilled upon the Iewes who lived both in Christs time and in Pauls time. Esay when he denounced this threatning, he meant not onely of the Iewes who lived then, but also of the Iewes who were to come after; and it was lite∣rally fulfilled upon them all. Example, 2. Esa. 61.7. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, be∣cause he hath annointed me to preach the Gospel, this prophe∣sie is cited by Christ, Luk. 4.18. and it is onely meant of Christ, and literally to be applyed to him. Example 3. Esay. 49.6. I will give thee for a light to the Gentiles, Christ went not in proper person to preach to the Gentiles himselfe, but he went to them by his A∣postles, therefore Act. 31.47. Paul saith, the Lord hath
commanded me to goe and be a light to the Gentiles, this is the proper sense and meaning of the Prophet Esay in this place. When the testimonies of the Old Testament are ci∣ted in the new, they are not cited by way of Accom∣modation, but because they are the proper meaning of the places; if they were cited by Christ and his Apo∣stles onely by way of accommodation; then the Iewes might have taken exception, and sayd, that these testi∣monies made nothing against them: because it was not the meaning of the holy Ghost who indited these Scrip∣tures to speake against them. But Christ and his Apostles bring out these testimonies, as properly meant of them, and not by way of accommodation onely. We must make a distinction betwixt these two,Applicatio destinata Applicatio per accom∣modatione Desti∣natam applicationem, & per accommodationem, Destinata is this, when the spirit of God intendeth that to bee the meaning of the place. Applicatio per accommadationem is this, when a preacher applieth the Testimonies of the scriptures for comfort or rebuke to his hearers, this is not destinata applicatio; sed per accomodationem. A man maketh a sute of apparrell for one,Simile. that is Destinatum to him, yet this suite will serve for another; and this is Per accommodationem. When Nathan said to David, the Lord also hath put away thy sinne, thou shalt not die, 2 Sam. 12.13. this was destinata applicatio, but when a preacher now applieth this to one of his hearers, this is, but per accommodationem, the scriptures are written for our Admonition, upon whom the ends of the world are come. 1 Cor. 10.11. And they are profitable for doctrine, for reproofe, for correction, for instruction in righteousnesse, 2 Tim. 3.16. They serve to rebuke all obstinate sinners, and to comfort all penitent when they are applied right∣ly: but when the Apostles applied their comforts and threatnings, they had a more particular insight to whom
they belonged, than Preachers have now, and knew particularly what Scriptures were directed to such and such men. When Esay prophesied, make fat the hearts of this people. Esay. 6.9. And when Paul applyed it to the Iewes in his time, it was destinata applicatio: but when a Preacher applieth it to his hearers now, it is per accommodationem onely, for hee cannot so par∣ticularly apply it to his hearers, as Paul did to his. Where there are two severall testimonies found in the old Testament, and joyned together in the new Testa∣ment, these two make but one literall sense, as Esay 62.11. Say to the daughter of Sion, behold thy Salvation cometh. So Zach. 9.9. O Daughter of Sion, O Daughter of Ierusalem, behold thy King commeth riding upon an Asse, and upon an Asse Coalt: Matthew citing these places cap. 23. joyneth them both together, and sheweth that both Esay and Zacharie meant of Christ comming in humilitie and not in glorie, and these two make up but one literall sense. This is a speciall note to know the literall sense of the Scripture,A Note to know the literall sense of the Scripture: when this phrase is added; That the Scripture might be fulfilled: As Ioh. 13.18. But that the Scripture may be fulfilled, hee that eateth bread with me, hath lift up his heele against me. This place was spoken first by Da∣vid of Achitophel Psal. 41.10. But it was fulfilled li∣terally in Iudas who betrayed Christ. Example 2. Ioh. 17.12. Those that thou gavest mee I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the sonne of Perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled. This place was first spoken of Doeg, Psal. 109.7. and this Scripture is ful∣filled in Iudas, therefore this is the literall sense of it; the figure was in Doeg, and the thing figured in Iudas. Example 3. Ioh. 19.24. Let us not rent it, but cast lots whose it shall be, that the Scriptures might bee fulfilled which
said; They parted my rayment amongst them, and for my Ve∣sture they did cast Lots. Sauls Courtiers rent Davids dignities and honours amongst them, but the Scripture was fulfilled literally here by the Souldiers. Example 4. Ioh. 19.36. For these things were done that the Scripture might be fulfilled, a bone of him shall not be broken. The type was observed in the Paschall Lambe, but the Scripture is fulfilled here literally in Christ. But it may be said. 1 Cor. 10.6.11. All these things happened to them in figures, then they signified some other thing to us than to them. They were types to us, that is, examples,  they were not types properly taken, for that is properly called a type, which the Spirit of God specially proposeth to sig∣nifie some future thing; as a bone of the Paschall Lambe should not bee broken, was instituted to signifie some future thing, that a bone of Christ should not be broken, here is properly a type, but an example is not a repre∣sentation of any thing to come, but goodnesse or splen∣dor in the men which maketh them to bee followed, as the mildnesse of Moses, the patience of Iob; These were not types properly but examples. So these things which befell the Iewes in the wildernesse for their murmuring and committing whoredome are set downe for exam∣ples to the Corinthians and posteritie to come, they were ad  they serve to admonish and instruct us, that we fall not into the like sinnes, 2 Tim. 3.16. It may be alleaged that there are more literall senses in one Scripture then one. Example;  Caiaphas prophesied that one should die for the people, Ioh. 11.49. In Christs meaning they had one sense, and in Caiaphas meaning they had another sense. This Prophesie must not be considered as one,  but as
two; the Spirit of God had one meaning and Caiaphas had another, but the Scriptures which were inspired by the holy Spirit had but one sense. Where the holy Ghost maketh a mysticall application of the old Testament to the new, that is Destinata appli∣catio; And arguments taken from thence hold firmely. Example, Exod. 16.18. He that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered lesse had no lake, the Apostle 2 Cor. 8.15. applyeth this morally to all the faithfull, and reduceth things to a certaine equalitie; that those who are rich in temporarie things, should bestow their almes upon the poorer sort, & the poore, being richer in Spiri∣tuall things, might communicat to the richer, their pray∣ers and Spirituall helpes. When we apply the testimonies of the old Testament and borrow comparisons from them, it is not destinata applicatio sed per accommodationem. The conclusion of this is. There is but one literall sense and meaning of every scripture: So should men have but one sense and meaning in their minds, and not a dowble meaning, as the equivocating Iesuites have. August. de trin. lib. 1. cap. 3.Quisquis haec legit, vbi pariter certus est, pergat mecum; vbi pariter haesitat, quarat mecum; ubi errorem suum cog∣noscit, redeat ad me; ubi meum, revocet me. FINIS.

The attributes of God, are called the wayes of God.Hascuini. Pag. 41. To eat blood while the life is in it, is forbidden by a morall precept; but to eate cold blood was that which was forbidden by the ceremoniall precept. Pag. 46. l. 16. And he measured the wall thereof according to the mea∣sure of a man, that is, of an Angell. Reuel. 21.17. Because he appeared in the likenesse of a man. Pag. 48. 18. R. Dauid Kimchi in Psal. 60. Pag. 58. 15. Although Esdras who wrote the booke of Nehemiah, could not be living at that time, when Iaddus met Alex∣ander, yet some of the masters of the great Synagogue have beene alive then who had the gift of prophesie, and insert the Genealogie of the Priests here, untill the Macedonian Empire. Pag. 58. l. 18. It may seeme that the gift of Prophesie ceased long before the Macedonian Empire, Psal. 74.9.  We see not our signes, there is no more any Prophet, neither is there any a∣mongst us that knoweth how long. We must distinguish betwixt ceasing of Prophesie,  and intermission of Prophesie; Prophesie was intermit∣ted
in the time of the Captivitie, which this Psalme speaketh of, but it ceased not, it was intermitted for a time, as Amos threatned Amos, 8.11. pag. 60. 23. This was a great miracle, the man being old, and ha∣ving the disease thirtie eight yeares. The Angell came downe at certaine times .

And marke here a great difference be∣twixt the comming downe of the Angell into the poole, and the comming downe of the holy Ghost in tongues, of fire at the Pentecost; the Angell healed but one, but then many were cured of all diseases. pag. 81. l. 2. The agreement of the holy writers; Moses, Elias, and Christ were together in the mount. Mat. 17.3. So Rev. 15.3.

And laid open the booke of the Law, wherein the heathen had sought to paint the likenesse of their Images. The heathen sought if they could get any warrant for their images out of the Scriptures to paint their Images by it. pag. 110. l. 22. The place in the hebrew text which seemeth to bee corrupted is Psal. 22.18. When they read Caari for Caaru, In calce bibliorum Rabbinorum. Caari, sicut leo, for Caaru foderunt; but R. Iacob Ben Chaijm, sheweth that this reading is but late, for there was no such difference betwixt the orientall and
occidentall Iewes in their reading, neither was this place one of the places in which they differed. pag. 137. 23. Words that are proper cannot bee translated as ap∣pellatives, nor appellatives as proper, Mat. 16.18. Thou art Peter and upon this rocke, &c.
