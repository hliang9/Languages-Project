A BRIEF DISCOVERY OF God's Eternal Truth; AND, A Way opened to the simple hearted, whereby they may come to know CHRIST and his Ministers, from ANTICHRIST and his Ministers. With a WARNING from the Lord, to all people, that do name the Name of Christ, to depart from Iniquity. Written in the Inquisition of Malta, by a Servant of the Most High, called KATHERINE EVANS. London, Printed for R. Wilson, 1663.
A brief DISCOVERY of Gods Eternal Truth. THus saith the Lord, Let every one that nameth the Name of Christ, depart from Iniquity: for the day cometh, and now is, that the Name of Christ will be dreadful and ter∣rible to all workers of iniquity; and God the Father hath committed all Power in Heaven and in Earth, and Seas also, to his Son Jesus Christ, and hath raised him in Power and great Glory in thousands of his Saints, to convince the world of Sin, of Righteousness, and of Judgment, that the Prince of this World may be judged, and cast out; for he shall never have any part or portion with the Heir of Eternal Life and Salvation; who hath Power to judge and to justifie; and to condemn, or to save; to scatter, and to gather; to break to pieces, and to bind up that which is broken to pieces: and he will establish his own Spiritual Government, Righteous Rule, and Pure, Holy Worship, to the
ends of the Earth; and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it: for whatso∣ever he hath purposed, shall surely come to pass, and his Decree shal stand; and Wo, wo, wo to every one that doth lift up a hand against any of those that the Lord God doth send forth in his Name, in this the Day of his Power, to preach Glad-tydings to the meek; or do form any carnal weapon against him in his Anoint∣ed, thinking to disinherite him, who is pos∣sessed Heir of all: But the time doth hasten that the Lord God of Power will exalt his Princely Scepter, over all Scep∣ters, Thrones and Dominions, Kingdoms and Countries, and none shall be able to prevent him, or resist his mighty Power. Hear ye this, O all ye People upon the face of the Earth, who are called Christians, or do call your selves by Christ's Name, both Kings and Princes, Emperors, No∣bles, and mighty men of the Earth, by what name or title soever ye are called, high or low, rich or poor; for our God is no re∣specter of persons; but every one that feareth his Name, and worketh Righteous∣ness, is accepted of him: Wherefore it chiefly behoveth every one of you to turn your minds within to the Light in your Consciences that convinceth of all Sin, and
makes manifest every evil deed, be it done never so secret, the Light will discover it; It is a measure of God's free Grace given to every one to profit themselves withal; and search, examine, and duely consider how you come to have right or title to Christ's Name; or, what it is that maketh a Christian; for every true Christian is an Heir of God, and Joynt-heir with Christ: For as in Adam all die, so in Christ shall all be made alive. Now you know that God created Adam at the first in a pure, perfect state of Innocency, his mind and soul in his own Image and likeness, which was Light and Life, and placed him in the Garden of Paradise, a place of eternal blessedness to all that do obey the Light; and God gave Adam dominion over all the crea∣tures that God created for the use of man, and blessed them unto him in that state of Innocency, and bid him eat of the fruit of every tree of the Garden; but the tree of knowledge of good and evil, that was good too, but not for food: And the Lord said unto Adam, Thou shalt not eat of the fruit of that tree; for in the day thou eatest thereof, thou shalt surely dye. Adam did not stand in the Counsel of the Lord, but turned from the Light, and hearkened
to the Woman whom the Serpent beguiled, and did eat of the forbidden Fruit, and so disobeyed the Commandment of the Lord God, and fell from that state of Blessed∣ness, into that state wherein all things are an utter curse unto him, and unto all in that state of disobedience eternally: but the just, and wise, and holy Lord God, whose mercies are above all his works, did promise that the Seed of the Woman should bruise the Serpents head. There are but two seeds, the Seed of the Woman, and the seed of the Serpent. Now this was the way which the pure and wise and perfect Lord God did find out in himself to reco∣ver Man out of the Fall again, through the everlasting Covenant of the promised Seed of all blessedness. The Promise of God was not unto seeds, as to many; but unto [the] Seed, as unto one; In Isaac shall all the Kindreds of the Earth be blessed. The Pro∣mise of God, which cannot fail, was only to the Seed of faithful Abraham. And Paul saith, If ye are Christs, then are ye A∣brahams seed, and heirs to the Promise: Wherefore every one of you in Christen∣dom may do well to turn in your minds to the Light of God in your own Conscien∣ces, and try your selves, and see whether
you have received the true righteous Seed, or are born of the pure and perfect Spirit of Christ Iesus, yea or nay; the Light will not deceive you, but deal plainly with you, and make manifest unto you all that ever was, or is within you; And he that is in Christ, hath the witness in himself, so that he need not go forth to seek after him, or to ask the way to Sion: for, I am the Way, the Truth, and the Light, saith Christ, and he that followeth me, shall not abide in dark∣ness, but have the Light of Life; and, He that hath not the Witness in himself, is in darkness, and hath not received the Light of Life, the Spirit of Christ; and, He that hath not the Spirit of Christ, is none of his. Then what profit hath anyone to have the Name of Christ, and out of his Nature? The Nature of Christ is altogether pure, perfect, holy, and upright; meek, humble, sober, loving, merciful, tender-hearted, li∣beral in all good; long-suffering, and rea∣dy to forgive, and willing to bear the contra∣dictions of sinners and the rebukes of the vile sons of men; and did lay down his Life for to save them that hated him, and were and are Enemies to his Cross: And all that are in Christ, ought themselves to walk as he walked, or else how should they be known
to be born of the true Seed of God; for where the Seed of the Kingdom is sown, and received into good ground, in an ho∣nest heart, it taketh deep root, and bringeth forth fruit answerable to the Seed, in some thirty, in some sixty, and in some an hun∣dred fold, that God may be glorified: for herein is my Father glorified, that ye bring forth much fruit, saith Christ, speaking to them that were called by his Name, and were his Disciples indeed, and did hear∣ken to his Teaching, did hear his Voice, and follow him, and a stranger they would not hear; but Christ alone was their Head, Guide, Teacher, Leader, and they did believe in his Name, and obeyed his Will: For it is not every one that saith, Lord, Lord, shall be saved; but he that doth the Will of the Father is accepted. And this is the Will of God, that ye should believe in Him whom he hath sent, and be sanctified: for Christ is the same that ever he was to all that believe in his Name; He is their King, to rule; and Prophet, to teach; and Priest, to offer up the spiritual Sacrifices that are accep∣ted with the Father, who saith, Let every one that nameth the Name of Christ depart from iniquity▪ for, I have given him a Name, above every name, that at the Name
of IESUS every knee shall bow. He that doth depart from iniquity, doth bow at the Name of Jesus: but those that do bow their knees when they hear Jesus named, and do not depart from iniquity, do not bow at the Name of Jesus, but are Hypo∣crites, and do bow to the Beast, and do not believe in Christ Jesus, neither doth their faith stand in the power of God, but their faith is vain. Paul the Apostle of Jesus Christ, saith, He that believes in the Lord Iesus in his heart, and confesseth with his mouth that God hath raised him from the dead, shall be saved: for with the heart man believeth unto Righteousness, and with the mouth Confession is made unto Salvation: but Paul did not say, that every one that con∣fesseth that Christ was crucified at Jerusalem, and God raised him up again, should be saved: No, that would contradict the Scriptures; for, as I live, saith the Lord, if Israel were as the sands upon the Sea-shoar for multitude, but a remnant shall be saved: For they are not all Israel, that are of Israel; [but he is an Israelite indeed, in whose mouth there is no guile] but every one that confesseth the same Christ near them which was crucified at Jerusalem: For know ye not that Christ is in you, unless you are Rebrobates: And let
them know, that do not witness the Life of Christ raised within them, that sin and wickedness is alive in them; and where sin and wickedness liveth, there Christ lieth crucified in the streets, that are spiri∣tually called Sodom and Egypt; and it is the faith of the Drunkard, Swearer, Lyar, Murderer, Adulterer and covetous persons, and them that work all manner of Abomi∣nations, which shall never enter into the Kingdom of God, as saith the Scriptures; yet those will confess that Christ dyed at Jerusalem to their own condemnation, because they do not walk in obedience to him. John saith, Try the spirits whether they be of God, yea or nay. Every one that confesseth that Christ is come in the flesh, is born of God; but he that denieth Christ to be come in the flesh, is not born of God, but is of Antichrist, and denieth the Lord that bought him: He that professeth Christ, and doth not possess Christ, neither is possest of Christ, it is he that is Antichrist, and is not of Christ; but where Christ is manifested in the flesh, he destroyes the work of the Devil, and giveth power over Sin, Death, Hell and the Grave, and over Antichrist, and all the dark powers that do corrupt the Earth. Where sin is destroyed, death hath
no power: The wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal Life: And, he that hath the Son, hath Life; and he that hath not the Son, hath not Life, but is in Death, and the Wrath of God abideth upon him. He is the best Christian that is most like Christ. In him was no nature of cruelty at all, but full of love, mercy, and tender compassion, ready to forgive, and willing to receive all that come unto him, having nothing of their own, he will in no wise cast out: and he doth exhort all men to do to others, as they would have others do unto them; and commanded his Disciples to love one another, and to love enemies; and to do good to them that hate them, and despite∣fully use them. God is Love; and he that is born of God, doth love every one, and cannot use cruelty to any: but he that is not born of God, committeth sin; and he that committeth, is of the Devil, and dwelleth in the dark, where all sin is com∣mitted; but he that dwelleth in the Light, dwelleth in the habitation of God, where no sin is committed, nor transgression found; and he that doth not know the Light in the Conscience, that convinceth of all sin, doth not know God: for God is Light, and Jesus Christ is the express Image
of his Fathers Brightness, and eternal Glo∣ry in the Light, Life and Power; who is immortal, invisible, incomprehensible, al∣together pure, and perfectly holy and wise, and is throughly glorious beyond all that ever can be thought or spoken of him by all mankind; and he is risen with healing in his wings, and is not vailed, as in times past but is clearly seen, heard, and under∣stood of all them that have received him, and lovingly imbraced him in the Truth; they in whom the eye of Innocency is opened by the mighty Power of God, they do see him, and enjoy him, and can and do bear witness of him, as Paul did; Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and no other∣wise, for ever. Paul did not know him till he was risen from the dead, and ascended to the Father, as the Scriptures bear wit∣ness. Paul was a Persecutor after Christ was crucified, and he held the clothes of the witnesses that stoned Stephen, a man full of the holy Ghost, because he said, The Most High dwelleth not in Temples made with hands, neither was he worshipped with mens hands. No, Stephen did know that his body was the Temple of the living God: and God is a Spirit, & he is worship∣ped no otherwise acceptably,  Spirit
and in Truth; and Paul was consenting to his death; and after he was journeying from Jerusalem to Damascus, with Letters from the high Priests and Scribes, to hale men and women out of the Synagogues that did speak in the Name of Jesus, and to bring them bound to Jerusalem: But in the mid way there was a Light met Paul and smote him, so that he fell to the ground, and Paul saw a Light shine round about him, but he saw no man; and he heard a Voice, saying, Saul, Saul, why per∣secutest thou me? Who art thou, Lord, said Saul? I am Iesus, whom thou persecutest, said Christ the Light; it is hard for thee to kick against the pricks: and then Paul cryed out saying, Lord, what wilt thou have me to do? And as soon as the Lord revealed his Son Christ Jesus in him by his own immediate Spirit, he did not confer with flesh and blood, but went and preach'd him: Paul did profess Christ before, and did profit more in the Jewish Religion than many of his equals, but he did not know him, and so he persecuted him in his Saints, as thousands do at this day, and yet they will be called Christians. When Paul had received Christ Jesus the Spirit of Truth, he denyed himself, and
became a true Christian, through the San∣ctification of the Spirit of Christ and be∣lief of the Truth, and took up the Cross to his own will daily, and followed Christ the Light, through great tribulations, in newness of life; for as he did partake of the fellowship of his Death and Sufferings, so likewise he did partake of the fellow∣ship of his powerful Resurrection and his Glory. I am the Resurrection, and the Life, saith Christ. And not only Paul, but eve∣ry one also in whom Christ is risen, do par∣take of the same Sufferings, and the same Joy, according to the measure and pro∣portion of Faith of God's free Grace dis∣pensed to each one, by his own Eternal Spirit. And this is the way, and the alone way which God hath ordained and ap∣pointed to make Christians; or, as I may safely say, to recover lost men out of the fall, and to redeem their souls and minds from all inward pollution and defilement, and wholly to ransom them out of the in∣ward invisible transgression and corrupti∣on, and so to raise up the blessed Seed of his own tender bowels, and restore his pure Image, that hath been so long defaced through the subtilty of the Serpent, and regain his Glory, Honour and Renown
among the sons and daughters of men, and will have the preheminency over all peo∣ple upon the face of the Earth, in the measure of himself, in the Consciences of all, either in their eternal Salvation, or their just and everlasting Condemnation: for God hath not left himself without a Witness in every ones Conscience, and a measure of the free Grace of him, who is the Fulness: For the natural man cannot receive the gift of the Spirit, but as the Apostle said, And we saw his Glory, as the Glory of the only begotten of the Father, full of Grace and Might. And of his Fulness have we all received, and Grace for Grace. Hence it is that the True and Living God, who respecteth no mans person, hath given to every one a Talent to improve, and a measure of Light, and also hath com∣manded that this Everlasting Gospel of Peace and Reconciliation, should be preached to every Creature, that they may receive grace for grace, that do believe in his Name: And they that do not beleive nor receive him, who doth tender salvation to them, the Light of God, which God gave them, com∣ing into the world, will eternally con∣demn them, and leave them without any excuse in the presence of the Lord God,
because of their disobedience and resisting the gift of the holy Ghost. There is something of God in every one, that would receive Gods truth if it should; but all that is not of God in every one doth strive and fight against it, and doth perse∣cute and imprison till death Gods Messen∣gers, which he hath endued with power from on high, and hath given them gifts and graces, and spiritual mercies of divine vertue, to preach to the Poor and to the captives, to the exiled and banished, and to sow the seed of Righteousness, that God might receive the fruits of holiness among his People. They that sow to the flesh, do of the flesh reap corruption; but they that sow to the Spirit, do of the Spirit reap Life everlast∣ing. They that have not received the Spirit, they cannot sow to the Spirit; but they that have rceived, they sow to the Spirit, and do profit the people, where they come to be received, and they do bring forth fruits of God-like lives, and righteous conver∣sations, and heavenly behaviour, and their fruits do manifest what ministry they are under; as St. Paul said, You are our Epistles written in our hearts, seen and read of all men. A pure life and a holy conversation
is a sure evidence of a true Christian, and a perfect witness that they have received the Spirit of Christ, which maketh a Christian, and generateth into his body; Christ the Head, and Christians the Members; and he will not have any deformed member in his body, but they must be all compleat in Christ, Pure, as he is Pure; Holy, as he is Ho∣ly; Undefiled, as he is Undefiled: even so as he is, so must his be in this present world; He that sanctifieth, and they that are sanctifi∣ed, are all one, as saith the Scriptures: But I say, in the Name and Power of the pure and perfect Lord God, That whosoever, or whatsoever he is in this world that taketh upon himself, or goeth about to make Christians, or convert Souls any other way, than by prea∣ching the immediate Word of God as he doth receive it by the Inspiration of the eternal Spi∣rit of Life and Power, he is in the highest de∣gree of Presumption, and guilty of the great Transgression, and shall assuredly receive the greatest Condemnation from the Lord God of Power, if they or he do not speedily repent and forsake those great Abominations. Me thinks, that every rational and sober∣minded Man, must needs rightly under∣stand, that God Almighty, who created all them, at the beginning, in Heaven
Earth, and Sea, without the help or advice of any, and doth uphold the Works of his own Creation by the Word of his Power; and as he created the Souls and Minds of men in a pure State of Innocency, from whence man fell through Disobedience. So he it is alone, that can, and will, and doth quicken the Souls of men and women again, and create them anew, in Christ Je∣sus, the Lord from heaven, the second A∣dam, a quickening Spirit, the Immanuel of Eternal Life, of the Word of his Power; and need not the Assistance or Counsel of any besides himself, to raise up Souls to life and immortality; for our God is an invisible, eternal, and immortal Spirit, perfect, holy, wise and powerful: and every reasonable man must needs know, and believe, That there is not any thing, but on∣ly a Spirit, that can so much as touch a Soul as to cleanse it, or to defile it; so it is the unrighteous spirit of Darkness, the Prince of the Power of the Air, that doth rule in the Children of Disobedience, and pol∣luteth the Souls, and defileth the whole Minds, and causeth them to yield up the fleshly Members, to commit sins of all kinds, in Thought, Word and Action; and so the Springs of Life and Salvation are
dammed up, and the pure Spirit of the Lord is covered, and the Eye of Innocency blin∣ded, so that man cannot behold his Ma∣ker, because Sin hath made a separation, as saith the Prophet, Behold the Lord's hand is not shortned, that it cannot save; neither is his eare heavy, that he cannot hear; but it is your iniquities that have separated between you and your God, and your sins have caused his face to be hid from you: And as it is the un∣clean Spirit that doth defile and pollute the Mind and Soul, and corrupt the Heart of man; hence it is that nothing but the clean and pure Spirit of the Lord God, that can in any wise cleanse and sanctifie the Soul and Mind, or purge, or purifie the Heart again: and it seems to be a very vain thing for any man or woman to think otherwise. Now let every one that is called a Minister of Jesus Christ, see that he be so indeed and in truth; for they must come a great way before they can administer Christ: Wherefore it is safe to consider, that Death reigned, or reigneth, from Adam to Mo∣ses, and from Moses till the Prophet John; and John was a burning & a shining Light, the greatest that was born among women; but the least in the Kingdom of God is greater than he: and John cried in the Wilderness,
saying, Prepare ye the Way of the Lord, make his Paths streight; for he, whose shooe he was not worthy to unloose, was coming af∣ter him, whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his Floor, and gather the Wheat into the Garner; but the Chaff he will burn with Fire unquenchable. And John denied not, and said, He was not that Light, but he came to bear witness of the Light, saying, This is the true Light, that lighteth every one that cometh into the world. Now it behoveth all that are called Mini∣sters of Christ, to call themselves to mind how they travelled through all these Admi∣nistrations, spiritually, from Adam till Mo∣ses, ye are all in death; and when you have received the just and holy Law of Moses up∣on Mount Sinai, then you must journey through all the Prophesies, till you come to Mount Sion, the heavenly Jerusalem, the City of the living God, before you can be a noble Minister of Jesus Christ: And this I am bold to declare in the Name of the Lord Jesus, whose Servant I am through mercy. Be ye not deceived, the Lord God will not be mocked any longer; there is a great Mystery in Godliness, in∣somuch, that all the earthly Wisdom, and Learning, and Languages, Studies or Pru∣dency
is never able to fathom or compre∣hend the least Motion of the Life of it; but as the Mind is joyned to the Light, the Word of Life, the Word that was before the World was, the Word by which the World was made, the Word that is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged Sword, even to the piercing and dividing between soul and spirit, joynts and mar∣row, and is a searcher and discerner of the Thoughts and Intents of every ones heart; and this is he, whose Vesture is dipt in Blood; his Name is called the Word of God, and he is come according to the, de∣terminate Counsel of the Father, to make a separation between the Pretious and the Vile, and to divide the Sheep from the Goats, and to gather in the Flock of his Inheritance, the People of his own Pa∣sture, the Sheep of his hands, to fill up his own Fold, out of every Kindred, Tongue and Nation, Jew and Gentile, Bond or Free, of his Israelites indeed, in whose mouths there is no guile; and he will place his Name amongst them again, and work his Fear in their hearts, and write his Laws in their inward-parts, that they may never depart from it; and they shall be his Peo∣ple for ever, and he will be their God e∣ternally,
and he will be merciful to their Transgressions; their Sins and Iniquities he will remember no more; for our God cannot deny himself, nor forget his holy Promises, who hath said, I have given Him for a Covenant of Light, to enlighten the Gentiles, and a Leader, and Commander to the people: and the day is come, that all the Children of the Lord shall be taught of the Lord, and be established in Righte∣ousness. And as for those Ministers that say, Men and women can never be freed from Sin, while they are here, nor made perfect while they are in the body; I say, such Ministers do not know Christ Jesus the Light, nor his Ministry, which saith, When he ascended up on High, he led Capti∣vity captive, & gave gifts unto men; some Pro∣phets, some Apostles, some Ministers, for the perfecting of the Saints, and for the Work of the Ministry, and for the edifying of the whole body of the Church. And again it is said, All Scripture given by the Inspiration of the Holy Ghost, is wholsome for Doctrine, for In∣struction, for Reproof, and Correction in Righte∣ousness, that the man of God may be made perfect, and thorowly furnished to every good Work. Now let all sober-minded men, consider
where men and women should be made perfect, if not here, while they are in this body; If not in this Body, where then? Solomon saith, As the tree falleth so it lieth; & the Spirit of the Lord doth not once men∣tion any other place to be purged in, in all the Scriptures of truth. And the Prophet spake to the Church, and said, The Lord would purely purge away the dross, and take away the tin, and rebrobate silver and gold. And this I know, when Souls come to be quickned by the powerful Word of Life and Truth, they come to know the Purgings of the Father, and the Washing in the Fountain of E∣ternal Cleansings, in the sweet Streams of Light and living Refreshment; the ever∣lasting Refining in the Sanctifying-Fur∣nace of the Spirit of the Lord God; and so they do come to be cleansed, purified, and sanctified throughout souls, bodies and Spirits, and are made Vessels of Ho∣nour, and fitted for Glory, without the help of any Man, or any outward Observation whatsoever. What is to be known of God is manifested within; and He that giveth pow∣er over any ones sin, is sufficient to give power over all sins; and will, and doth, to all that be obedient: The willing and obe∣dient shall eat the Good of the Land; but they
that refuse and rebel, the Sword shall devour them; the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it, and his zeal will perform it. There is none can forgive Sins but God only; against whom all sin is committed; for whatsoever just offence is given to any, he that giveth the offence, sinneth against the Commandment of God, which saith, Do by all men▪ as you would have them do unto you, and love thy neighbour as thy self. He never commanded any to do contrary to his own nature, which is, Love, Mercy, and Long suffering, waiting to be gracious; not willing the death of any, but that all should return and forsake the Evil of their Wayes, and deny the Evil of their Doings, and then he would have mercy upon them, and abun∣dantly pardon all such as come to him in the Name of the Lord Jesus, bringing no∣thing with them but a penitent heart, and an humble spirit, confessing their sins, being weary of the burthen and weight of them; and he will forgive and take away the Guilt from the Conscience: while there is guilt within, the sin is not pardoned; when the Sin and the Guilt of Sin is taken away, then there is no Condemnation, but man is at unity with his Maker, & all Fear of Death and Torment is taken away; for the Sting
of Death is Sin, and the Strength of Sin is the Law; but thanks be to God, who hath gi∣ven us the victory, through our Lord Iesus Christ, over Sin, Death, Hell and the Grave, together with all the dark Powers of the Earth▪ That as we, who are called Quakers, do continue in the Light, none can overcome us; for Truth is stronger than all; and the Lord our God will exalt his Truth over all Falshood and deceivable Shews: Everla∣sting Praises, eternal Glory, and heavenly Renown to his pure, holy and perfect Name for ever, world without end, Amen, Amen. There is none can forgive Sins but God only, neither will he give his Honour to another; though Christ said to his Apo∣stles, Whose Sins ye remit on Earth, shall be remitted in Heaven; he spake to them that were filled with his own eternal Spirit, and were able to discern an innocent penitent Heart, from a Hypocrite, in the Light and Life of Righteousness: and they did not say, they could forgive any their Sins, but they were sent to direct their Minds to God, who was, and is ready to forgive e∣very one that cometh to him by Faith, and throughly purged and cleansed from all Ini∣quity. But as for those that have taken
upon them to pardon Creatures for their Money, or if they will receive their Cor∣rection, and so deceive the poor People; and so he or they that doth pardon, and they that are pardoned of them, do, and will perish together eternally, unless they repent of their Blasphemies and Sorce∣ries, Divinations, Inchantments, where∣by the poor People are blinded and kept in ignorance, and in all manner of Unclean∣ness, and are corrupted for want of Know∣ledge: My People perish for want of Know∣ledge (saith God) and the Kingdom is shut up from the Simple-hearted; and the Key of Knowledge is hid away by them that will not enter in themselves, nor suffer any to enter that would; neither will they permit, that any of the Lord's Anointed, that have re∣ceived the Key of Knowledge, should speak among the People; but they say, None ought to speak in the Name of Jesus, but the divine Doctors that have received their Ordinations from them. The People are blind indeed that do think the Spirit of the Lord can be limitted, tyed, confined, or dispenced by any mortal Man; No, they that do make the people believe any such thing, are absolutely the Messengers of Sa∣tan, and not the Ministers of Christ; they
are out of his Doctrine: such are Doctors of Divinity that dwell in the Divine Light of God, and grow into his Divine Nature, and do receive their Ministry by the Inspiration of his divine Spirit of Life and Power, and do speak as they are mo∣ved, and as the Spirit giveth them utte∣rance in the Will of God; they are no Men-pleasers, nor Time-servers, nor Will∣worshippers; for such cannot please God that seek to please man: and they are Hy∣pocrites, that walk in the Imitations and Likenesses without the Life and Power, ob∣serving this thing, and observing the o∣ther. Christ saith, The Kingdom of Heaven cometh not with Observations; but the King∣dom of God is within you; speaking to the unbelieving Jews, the Scribes and Pharisees, Wise and Learned, that were gone out from the Kingdom, the Measure of God in them, in which is Power to destroy the Works of the Devil in the Observations; and Christ reproved them, and said to them, The Kingdom of Heaven consists in Righte∣ousness, Peace and Ioy in the holy Ghost. Now that is the kingdom of Antichrist, in which kingdom is the City that Cain built, that is in the Observations: and Ba∣bel
that Nimrod the Heretick begun to build, which is full of confused Noises, and Bloodshed, and all manner of Cruelty: It is Babel that is built with blood; but Sion is redeemed through judgment, and her converts with righteousness. O! blessed be the pure, holy, and powerful Lord God, the Day of his Power, according to his determinate Counsel, is come, that Antichrists King∣dom shall be destroyed; and Babels Buil∣ding must fall: for the Mystery of Baby∣lon the Great, the Mother of Harlots, and Abominations of the Earth, is made ma∣nifest by the bright Appearing of the Lord Jesus; and the Children of Light are able to fathom and comprehend her and all her Lovers, and to see the Foundation they stand on, and the Ground they act from, which is but as Water, (as John saith in his Revelations, he saw Nations Waters, Peoples Waters, and Tongues Waters, yea, Men Waters; Peoples and Nations all unstabled like the Waves of the Sea, tossed to and fro with every Wind of Do∣ctrine in the changable; gone out from that which changeth not, into the many Ways, and have heaped to themselves Teachers having itching eares, and cannot endure sound Doctrine, but saith, Preach unto us
smooth things; so they do preach Peace where the Lord proclaimeth War; and bless themselves in that nature, that is everlastingly shut out of the Kingdom of God, and excluded from his living Pre∣sence: But the Lord God of Life and Pow∣er will, & hath discovered the Spirit of the Barren woman, that hath made all Nations drunken with the Wine of her Fornication, and the Inhabitants of the Earth were sur∣feited and overcome with her Abominati∣on: She shall soon be cast into a Bed of Torment with all her Lovers, where she shall have Torment without Ease; Judg∣ment without Mercy; a full Cup without Mixture, and the Dregs wrung out unto her, and she shallbe rewarded double for all her Iniqiuties; the Lord will mar her beau∣ty and stain her glory, and strip off her cost∣ly robes, and lay her honour in the dust, and turn her songs into howling, and her mirth into mourning, and her musick into lamen∣tation; and she shall receive a Cup of trembling at the Lord's hand, and all her glory, pomp and pride shall perish as the untimely figs, and fade as the flower of the field, and wither as the grass upon the house top; and the Smoak of her torment shall ascend in the sight of all people, and
it shall go forth in the audience of all Na∣tions; and she shall be a by-word, and a scorn, a taunt, hissing, and derision, and off∣scouring to as many as have heard of her Name; and a day of lamentation shall be heard in the midst of her great Tribulati∣on, Wrath and Anguish, upon every Soul that doth Evil, because she repented not of her Uncleanness, Fornication, Cruelty, Hardheartedness and Mercilesness, and all her Uncharitableness, and Blasphemy, and Sorceries, and the like Wickedness. And this I give in my Testimony for the Lord in the living Word of Truth, against Her and all her Lovers, and every one that uphold Her, as I have received it by the Revelation of the Son of God, and not from, or of any Flesh or Blood, but have seen, handled and tasted deeply of the Cup of the Indignation of the Lords Judg∣ment. If Iudgment first begin at the house of God, what will become of them that obey not the Gospel of God? for if the Righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the Wicked and Ungodly appear? Now for some help and light for the understanding of them that do not know the Mystery of Iniquity, and that spirit that doth generate it here, as aforesaid▪
the spirit of Antichrist is that spirit in every one that doth profess Christ Jesus in words, but doth not possess him in life and power; and such are they that are making Images, and forms, and likenesses without, and call it by Christ's Name, and say it doth represent Christ; when none can make his Likeness, nor bear his Image, but those that are created anew in Christ Jesus, and born of the same Spirit. The righteous Image or Form of Christ, is the perfect Life of Innocency, and the pure Spirit of Meekness, and an upright heart of true Humility, as it is written, Upon whomsoever you shall see the Spirit of the Lord descend like a Dove, and abide upon him; this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. You all know a Dove is an inno∣cent harmless creature, and so are all God's Children which are sanctified in the undefiled womb of God's second creation, where the first Heaven and the first Earth is passed away, and new Heavens and a new Earth are witnessed, wherein dwelleth Righteousness for evermore; and he that is called the Son of Perdition, is the Man of Sin in every particular, that steals away the heart, and draws out the mind from the true invisible God, and sets it upon earth∣ly
objects, and visible appearances: The glory of the world that doth fade and va∣nish away, as the smoak in the eye, and the painted harlot, is the fallen wisdom that is comprehended in the earthly mind, carnal understanding, and airy spirit, inventing and devising how to deck and beautifie her self with the glory of this world and outside shews, to get her self a name over all the Earth, and calls her self holy, pure and spiritual, that all people may fall down and worship her painted image, and so the wind of her spirit goeth forth, and overchargeth the hearts of the people, and corrupts them; and when the heart is corrupted it conceiveth lust, and when lust is conceived it bringeth forth sin, and when sin is finished it bringeth forth death; The wages of sin is death; and the Scarlet-coloured Beast that doth up∣hold the adulterous woman, with all her al∣lurements upon whom she sits, is that beast∣like will of or in man, that is not subject to the Will of God, but hath received power to exalt his horn, even to the Host of Heaven, for the cleansing of the Sanctu∣ary, and purifying of the Temple, and for the tryal of the Faith of God's Elect, that the power of God may rest upon them, and
so they come to be approved in the sight of all: and herein our God is glorified, honoured and renowned, over all, in pur∣chasing to himself a holy Kingdom, through the blood of the everlasting Covenant in the faithful-hearted, that do follow the Lamb through great tribulations, according to the Scriptures. Every man out of the Co∣venant of God is bruitish, and that spirit which doth exalt it self over the conscien∣ces of any people, to compel them by a ty∣mnnous Law, to worship according to his will, and in his way, without any Com∣mandment or Precept from the Lord, that is Lucifer, which the Lord God will cast down to the bottom of Infamy, and will do unto him, as he did to proud and lofty Haman, as the Spirit of the Lord hath ma∣nifested: for God and his Word are one, and his way to the Kingdom is but one, and he never compelled any with camal weapons, or any visible thing, to worship him. And whereas it is said, he sent forth his servants to compel them that were in the streets, and in the high-wayes, to come in by the powerful preaching of his Word of Life and Truth, that did limit and bind that in them that did rebel against him,
and so he drawed them after him in love; and so he doth at this day; Praises, praises to his holy and blessed Name for ever∣more, Amen. And the false Prophet is he that cryeth, Lo here is Christ, and Lo there; but Christ foretold of them, saying, Many false Christs would come, saying, Lo here, and Lo there; but believe them not; go not forth: by their fruits you shall know them. And these are they that for advantage will cry, Peace, peace, while ye are unsaved from your sins; and so, with good words, and fair speeches deceive the hearts of the simple, and smoothly draws them after him, in the broad way, that leads to the chambers of death and destruction; and in their high places they will tell you, you must not be drunk, nor lust, nor envy, nor covet, nor live in pride, nor any such evil things, when they them∣selves are wholly guided and led by that same spirit, which is the very rise & author, yea, as I may safely say, the father of all manner of uncleanness and evil concupi∣scence; and so, though they do speak good words, it is but in imitation, because it was the practice of the Servants of the li∣ving God so to do, yet being out of their Life, they can never convert any into the Truth, but their spirit doth beget the
same form in the Hearers as is in the Teach∣ers; for such Seed as they sow, such Fruits they do reap, of all manner of unrighte∣ousness: and these be they that will go a∣bout to limit the Spirit of God, and make the people believe, none ought to speak in the Name of Christ, but the Wise and the Learned, and them that have received Gifts of Men to Preach; but Christ doth ordain his Ministers, and gives them Gifts both Male and Female; yet they say Paul would not permit of a Woman to speak in the Church: it is true▪ Paul would not permit of a woman to speak in the Church; no more do not the Quakers; neither do they permit a Woman to speak in the Church, nor a Man that is born of a woman; but he that is born of God, whe∣ther in Male or in Female, let him speak freely as his Father giveth him Utterance: Let him that doth not understand come into Christ's School and learn: Paul said, That if a Woman did pray or prophesie with her Head uncovered, she did disho∣nour her Head: if a woman might pray or prophesie with her head covered, it's very like she might do it in the Church assoon as in another place: But Paul nor John neither would not permit that Jeza∣bel,
that painted Harlot, should speak in the Church, who hath painted her self with the Saints Words, but out of their life, she must keep silence in the Church; yea ve∣rily, the Power is made manifest in this the Lord's present day, that will shortly stop her mouth, and all her Lovers for ever∣more, world without end, Amen. The Glory is the Lord God's, who is risen in his mighty Power to raise up Sion, and to build up the walls of Jerusalem, and to raze down Babel to the ground, and to de∣stroy the Kingdom of Antichrist, and to bring down all the Powers of Darkness un∣der his feet. This was written in the Inquisition of Malta, by the Lord's Servant, Katherine Evans; who am a Sufferer for God's eter∣nal Truth, which is my Ioy, my Glory, and my Crown: Magnified be the Name of the Lord God of Life and Power, who hath counted me worthy, not only to believe unto Salvation, but also, to suffer for the Sake of my blessed Saviour and perfect Re∣deemer, the Lord Iesus Christ; to whom be Glory for ever, world without end, A∣men, Amen. Oh Friends and People in all places, who are called Christians, fear the Lord
God that gave you Life, and obey his holy Gospel, the Light in the Conscience, that con∣vinceth of all Sin, and judgeth the Secrets of every ones Heart. O hearken to the heavenly Voice of the true invisible God; he is near to every one to save or to con∣demn: Yea, of a truth, he is risen in great Power to correct the Wayes of men throughout all Nations; whose Wayes have been their own Wayes for many Genera∣tions past: but this is the Day in which the Lord God will restore Judges as at the first, and Counsellors as at the beginning: Wherefore let every one that hath recei∣ved Power and Authority from the Lord to rule and regulate amongst the People, take heed that they do not abuse the Power, the Lord hath committed into their hands as a Stewardship, whereof they must give an account before the High and Mighty Judge of Heaven and Earth, that sits up∣on the Throne to Judge the Nations in Righteousness, and the People with Equi∣ty; and he will smite the Earth with the Rod of his mouth, and consume the Wic∣ked with the Breath of his lips; and the Lord God will remove, and overturn, and cut down, till he hath exalted men like to faithful Moses and righteous Samuel, to
do the work of Justice, Mercy and Equi∣ty to every one, without respect to Persons, in the Fear and Dread of the Lord, not seeking their own honour, and glory, but the Honour and Glory of the Lord God. And thus he will make you honourable in the sight of all men: for of a truth, they that exalt themselves shall be brought low; but they which the Lord doth exalt, none can cast down: and likewise see that you do nor judge others for that which your selves stand guilty of, or the like sin in the self-same nature; if so, wherein ye judge others, you condemn your selves, and your own Condemnation will stand over your own heads for ever. Wherefore take heed how you do mount in the Seat of Tribunal; and let every Thought, Word and Action, in your Sentences of Judgment of others, be ac∣cording to the Light of God in your own Consciences; which otherwise will be your eternal Condemnation without any ex∣cuse, in the Presence of the Lord God Almighty; whose Voice doth shake terri∣bly the Earth, and makes the Hearts of the Heathen to tremble; and doth, and will remove Mountains, and over-turn Hills; and take all that lets and stands in
opposition against his pure Truth; and the little Hill of Sion shall trample over all the Mountains to the Ends of the Earth: And who shall be able to resist it? no, no, not one: the Lord will rip up every false Covering, & strip off every deceitful Gar∣ment, and make manifest every seducing Spirit, and blind Guide, and false Teach∣er, that doth work by signs and lying won∣ders, with all manner of Deceivableness; and doth deceive the hearts of the Simple, and stealeth away their hearts, and draweth out their minds from the true invisible Lord God that made them, and doth set them upon earthly Objects, and visible Ap∣pearances, and the Glory of this life that will perish for ever, and vanish away like the smoak in the aire; and the invisible God they have no more knowledge of, than the beast that perisheth: and these be them that run, and the Lord never sent them, and saith, Thus saith the Lord; and the Lord hath not spoken unto them, neither did they ever see his face, nor hear his voice at any time; neither do they profit the people at all, but build them up in the Mystery of Iniquity, and teach them to wonder after the monstrous Beast, which hath many Heads, and many Horns, and
Mouths full of Blasphemy, and Eyes full of Adultery, walking in the broad way that leads to the chambers of death and destru∣ction, and to the Pit of everlasting Per∣dition; and shuts up the Kingdom from the Simple-hearted; and hides the Key of Knowledge from the innocent Ones; and will not enter in themselves, nor suffer them to enter that would: and these are them that feed of the Fat, and go on their Bellies all their life long; the Ser∣pents of the earth that suck the sweet up, the spirit of the earth; and they make the poor people believe it doth belong to them in Christ, because they must pray for them, to the saving of their Souls. O these be Hypocrites, and they do not know the Price of the redemption of a Soul out of death; neither have they the Knowledge of God, nor his Way to Salvation; for if they did know the Lord, they would fear and dread his holy Name, and teach the People the Way to Life eternal, which is the Light in the Conscience in every one; and he that comes not to the Light, comes not into the Way of God which leads to the King∣dom of God: The Kingdom of God is one, his Way is one, his Light is one, his Life is one, and his Spirit of Truth is one,
and his Word is one; and what he speaks once, he speaks still; and what he once condemns, he never justifies; and what he once justifies, he never condemns: He is God, and changeth not, but the same, yester∣day, and to day, and so likewise for ever. Now they that are in the changeable, and in the many wayes, are out of the Way of God, which is Light, and are in the dark, and do not see the way they walk in, neither do they know the Lord, nor his Word, that is quick and powerful, sharper than a two-edged Sword; for did they know that Word, they would not dare to mock and scorn at them that tremble at the Word, and meet together to wait upon the Lord in silence, and do hearken diligently to know the Mind of God, that they may not sin against him, nor act contrary to him; but those men or women cannot dis∣scern the Mind of God that are not cruci∣fied with Christ Jesus, and the Body of sin & death destroyed, which is a mystery to all the Wisdom & Learning in the world, that do not own the Light in the Conscience to be their alone Teacher, but live in the dis∣obedient nature out from God and his Truth, in the earthly mind and carnal will, comprehending this thing and that
in the fallen wisdom, inventing, devi∣sing, and imagining things that never were, nor is, nor never will be: So your Prophets, they prophesie lies, and the Priests bear rule by their means, and the People love to have it so; but what will they do in the end thereof, in the day when the Lord shall require the Talent that he gave to every one to profit withal? Now, where is the Talent with the Im∣provement? is it not lost? is it not hid in the barren wilderness, and in the desolate places of the earth? Oh, try and examine search and consider, where is that good and faithful Servant, and just Steward, that hath improved his Talent for his Masters use, and is ready to give up his Ac∣counts with joy before the Tribunal of the Majesty of the Most High, having his Garment washed in the Blood of the Lamb, and his heart sprinkled from an evil Conscience, and the Body washed with pure water; I do not say nor mean ex∣ternal water, to wash the out-side of the body, but I do mean the spiritual Water, that streams from the Fountain or Rock; Christ Jesus, to wash the inside, and to cleanse the Soul and Spirit from all Pollu∣tion and Defilement: Ye wash the outside
while the inside is not cleansed; the inside will defile the outside again; but if the inside be cleansed and purged from all dross, and tin, and reprobate silver and gold, then it would cleanse the outside also, and keep it clean: it is the corrupted Beast that is full of Lust and all manner of Deceivableness, that defileth the whole body within and with∣out: So the man or woman, whose heart is without Deceit, & whose mouth is with∣out guile, and whose tongue doth not utter falshood, nor hath no flattering lips, nor polluted hands, nor feet swift to shed blood; such are known to be cleansed every whit, and they see God: The pure in heart do see God, but they whose hearts are daubed and slimy, through deceit and hypocrisie, hard∣heartedness and cruelty, and the like, such cannot see God; nor they that take honour and seek honour of one another, do not be∣lieve: How can you believe (saith the Apo∣stle) while you take Honour one of another? And all that Honour or take Honour of earthly men, do rob God, to whom all Honour, Worship, Praise and Glory doth belong; and all that do honour God, and obey his Voice in the Truth, the Lord will make them honourable in the sight of all men; but all that live in Pride and Cove∣tousness,
Lust and Drunkenness, are out of the Truth; and all who live in Swearing, Lying, Deceit, or Hypocrisie, or Envy, Ha∣tred, Malice, Bloodshed, Hardheartedness or Cruelty, are out of the Truth; or they which live in Thieving, or Cozening, Chea∣ting, Dissembling, Flattering, Whispering, Backbiting, Bragging or Boasting, speaking great swelling Words, having mens Per∣sons in admiration because of advantage; these are all out of the Truth, and are He∣reticks, and are carried out of the Way of God with Nimrod and Judas, King Herod and Pharoah, and the rest of that untoward Generation, not knowing the Scriptures, neither the Power of God; and because they do not believe them nor understand them, therefore they hide them from o∣thers, and do corrupt them, and add to them, and diminish from them, not fear∣ing the Lord God that gave them forth by his own free Spirit, and for the edificati∣on of every one. But I am bold to de∣clare in the Name of the true and living God, that all the Plagues which are writ∣ten in them, will soon come upon the back of such a People or Souls, that have wrought this Wickedness in the sight of the Lord God of Power, who is risen, and will ren∣der
Vengeance in Flames of Fire upon them that know him not, and do not obey his Gospel, but live in the earthly Mind and carnal Will, fallen from God, and compelling the People to follow their de∣vised Wayes, building of them up in Sin and Wickedness, yet making them believe they may go to Heaven at the last, though they live in Sin till they die: Oh! that ever any People or Souls should ever be so blind and ignorant, to think that though they spend all their appointed Time in Sin and Iniquity, and run out the whole course of natures race in pleasure, negligence and carelesness; and when they cannot retain it any longer, then do they offer up their sinful Souls as a Sacrifice acceptable to God, who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity; though it be in his beloved Ja∣cob, it shall not go unpunished: Oh! me∣thinks that no rational or sober-minded Man or Woman should once credit or be∣lieve, that do know the Scriptures, that there is any place appointed of God for any Creatures to be purged or cleansed af∣ter they are dead; seeing the Holy Men of God, as they were moved of the holy Ghost, have so evidently and clearly set forth in the Scriptures of Truth, That
those which are Heirs of Eternal Salvation, must come to be converted, and to live the Life of Christ while they are here in the body. Though God delighted in Mercy, and that the Thief was saved upon the Cross, because it was given him of the Lord, to believe at last, because that none should despaire; yet, Woe, Woe from the Lord God to every one that puts off the Day of Repentance, saying in their hearts, The evil day is afar off: In the day of ignorance the Lord winked, but now he calleth every one to repent. And as for such as do talk of a Purgatory, it doth manifest their Ig∣norance of the Knowledge of God: for I witness in the Life of God's Spirit, such know not Heaven nor Hell, God nor De∣vil, and so they call Light Darkness, and Darkness Light, Good Evil, and Evil Good, and teach the People so to do: but God is not well pleased with any of those, nor with them that do boast themselves, saying, How great the Kingdom is, and how many Countries, and innumerable sight of People belongeth to their Church, in all places! but them that trust in the Arm of Flesh, yea, in the strength of Pharoah, and in the Shadow of Egypt; but the strength of Pharoah will be her shame, and their
trusting in the shadow of Egypt their con∣fusion: God's Kingdom is the least, as to the visible strength; but the greatest in the invisible power: Fear not little Flock (saith Christ) it is your Fathers good pleasure to give you the Kingdom: The Kingdom of God consists not in the arm of Flesh, but it stands in his own Power and Almightiness: That is Antichrists Kingdom whose power stands in outward weapons, which is carnal, as Locks and Bolts, and Iron-bars & Chains, and Whips, and Racks, and the like: Our Weapons are not carnal, but spiritual, (saith the Apostle) o the pulling down Strong∣holds, Principalities and Powers, and high and lofty Looks, with spiritual Wickedness in High Places: So one of them that stands in the Power of God, out of the Power of the Prince of the Air, is able to chase ten, and ten a thousand, according to the righteous Prophesie of the Holy Man of God; Those that dwell in the Fear of the Lord, and truly dread his pure Name at all times, every word that proceedeth out of their mouths, is as the Words of God's own mouth, which cannot be altered nor changed to all eternity; for such are the Vessels that hold the heavenly Trea∣sures, Gods free Gifts and eternal Graces,
and everlasting Mercies, and divine Ver∣tues, spiritual Blessings, which God doth not reveale in any earthly-minded Man, whose mind is wandring after earthly Glo∣ry, Honour, Riches and Treasures; but he reveals his eternal Riches in the Earthen∣vessel; whose mind and soul is quickned, raised, and changed, by the Power of the Almighty God, and joyned to the Light, the measure of his own Spirit, to convert them, and bear them up into the same state and image wherein God created the soul and mind of man at the first: In the begin∣ning of his Creation, God did not create the outward Form of mankind in his own Similitude and Likeness: No, for then all men would bear the similitude and likeness of God throughout all Generations; which thing could never be for wicked and un∣godly men, whose thoughts and imaginati∣ons are evil continually, and are of their father the Devil, and his works they do, and his image and likeness they bear. God is a perfect Spirit of divine Light, and im∣mortal Glory; and his Son Jesus Christ, is the express Image of his everlasting Fa∣thers eternal Brightness; and none can ever liken nor fashion any thing like him:
And them that bear the image of the De∣vil, they live in spiritual pride, and are haughty minded, and will not be reformed, nor hearken to the Counsel of God, nor imbrace his gracious Invitations, nor re∣ceive his tender Mercies, nor be warned by his favourable Judgements, nor gentle Corrections; but in obstinacy and per∣verse rashness, alwayes resist it, and cast it behind their backs, and trample it under their feet, till the Lord is even forced to be a swift Witness against them, and to sweep them away with the beesom of de∣struction; and so here their end is woful, and their torment is eternal, and the Lord is clear of their blood, and they must con∣fess their destruction is of themselves. They that are of the Image and Like∣ness of Christ, are created anew in Christ Jesus to every good work, and have re∣ceived, and do live in, and are guided by the pure Spirit of perfect Peace and Pati∣ence, perfect Love, and bowels of ten∣derness, mercy and pitty towards every one, without respect of persons; and they have alwayes a holy fear, true humility, and a heart of uprightness; and such persons do bear the true image and similitude of God the Father, and the form and likeness
of his Son Jesus Christ, after the inward man; and they are patterns of good works, and good examples to all whereever they come, and it is their meat and drink to do the will of God, wheresoever he shall call them, or command them to follow the Lamb, from Sea to Sea, and from Island to Island, and from Country to Country, to bear his holy Name, and to witness forth his eternal Truth to all people that live in darkness and blindness, according to the righteous examples of his Saints and Ser∣vants, that were guided by the same Spirit, and walked in the perfect way of God in the antient dayes, and are as willing, and do suffer for our honourable Testimony, that our pure, holy and just God, whose right it is, may have the Glory, Praise and Renown to the ends of the Earth, through∣out all Generations. Amen, Amen, saith the Spirit. 19th of the 8th month, 1662. Written at Malta, by me the Lord's Servant, Katherine Evans.
ALthough that they my Bible keep from me, That I the holy Scriptnres cannot see, The Precepts pure, which are upon record, That were giv'n forth by'th Spirit of the Lord; Yet, a small Book hid in a secret place Have I, where I can reade the words of grace: And in the same I can discern The bastard from the perfect born. For unto us a Child is born, Who'l break to pieces that great Horn, Which hath lift up himself on hie, Upon the Throne of Majestie; He shall be brought down under all, Where he shall lie, and cry, and call To's Idol-gods, which alwayes he Hath worshipped with heart and knee. But no Salvation he shall find Among his gods, that are so blind, Both dumb and deaf, like unto he, They cannot speak, nor hear, nor see His Pictures, and his painted walls, His Altars and his Temple-Vails; His golden Images every one Shall soon be brought to destruction.
All Praises to the God of might, Which hath preserv'd us day and night Mongst Lions Wolves, that are so strong, Although they make us suffer long; Yet the Diviners do run mad, And lying Prophets they are sad. Th'exalted Beast in his renown Triumphs that he shall gain the Crown: Because that Pharoah's on his side, And lofty Haman in his pride, And bloody Herod with his Sword; All fighters are against the Lord. But th'God of Pow'r, which is so strong, Will soon reward them every one; According unto Heavens decree, For their Rebellion, Blasphemy. Then some shall howl, and some shall mourn, The rest shall wish they'd ne're been born, For pain and torment day and night: Because they have despis'd the Light.
WHen dear Daniel Baker was at Malta, I had a very small Token to present him in a Paper, with these lines. The thing is little, receive my love, It cometh from a harmless dove; Within whose breast doth still remain God's perfect praises to maintain. I have not time nor place to show The love that from my soul doth flow, The Cristal streams so pure and bright, That do arise both day and night. My love to Truth, doth me constrain In Prison ever to remain; If it be so, I cannot be In Truth and Righteousness set free. My dear Redeemers face so bright Doth shine upon me day and night; His Countenance doth exceed all Captivity and bondage thrall.
Though my mortal body be bolted fast, yet my immortal soul hath room▪ to pass by Sea and Land, and cannot be prevented by an Enemy. Lord, teach me in thy Wayes, that I may walk therein, And lead me in thy Paths, and cleanse me from all sin. Before I knew the Lord my God to be so near to me, I walked in the way so broad, thinking he did not see. But when my wayes directed were, and paths the Lord did guide, I walked alwayes in his fear, and did not go aside. HEavens Glory is appearing, And his Brightness shineth forth O're all▪ Nations, for the clearing Of the Lord's Eternal Truth. Now ev'ry one that sits in darkness, Under the shade of Death doth lye, May come forth unto the Brightness, Out of gross obscurity.
For now a Fountain is set open, He that will may freely come in, Unto the everlasting Ocean, And be cleansed from his sin; And ev'ry one that is in bondage, And in deep Captivity, Under Pharoah and his Army, Shall be set at liberty. If that they will seek their Freedom At the hand of God alone, They shall be Heirs of his Kingdom, And wear the victorious Crown. It is not all the pain and labour That ever mortal men can take, Which can bring them into favour With the Lord that did them make. But they that stand in self-denial, Taking up their Cross daily, Thorow many a fiery tryal, For God's Truth most valiantly: 'Tis them alone shall be preserved, By the Pow'r of God most hie; And none but them shall be received Into glorious Liberty. The Candles of the Lord are lighted, For to search Jerusalem,
And all Nations are invited To the Marr'age of the Lamb. Blessed are they that keep their Armour, And in their Wedding-Garments drest, Ready to enter the Brides Chamber, They are counted with the Guests. Now the Lord will purge all Nations Out of gross obscurity, Destroying all the deeds of Darkness, Deceit and Hypocrisy. Th'Trumpets are struck up in Sion, And do give a dreadful sound, For the razing down of Babel, With her glory to the ground. And Antichrist, with all his Fashions, And Delusions, which are strong, Shall suddenly be dash'd to pieces: Christ alone shall wear the Crown. Katherine Evans. THE END.
