MASTER HOLLIS HIS SPEECH IN PARLIAMENT, Concerning the Ar∣ticles of high Treason against himselfe, the Lord Kymbolton, Sir Arthur Haslerigg, Mast. Pym, Master Hampden, Master Strowd, Ex∣hibited by his Majesty, on Wednes∣day the fift of Iannary 1641. LONDON printed for Francis Coules and Thomas Banks, 1641.
Master Hollis his Speech. Master Speaker, THat Man is no true Christian, nor legall Subject that cannot willingly submit himselfe, to undergoe either the displea∣sure of his Soveraigne, or any other trou∣ble or affliction imposed upon him in the defence of true Religion and the Lawes of this Countrey. Master Speaker, My selfe with the rest of those Gentlemen accused, desires under favour of this Honourable House, to speake something concerning these Articles of our accusation; Master Speaker, Treason is the heynousest crime, that can bee alled∣ged against any Subject; The name of a Traitor must needs be odious to all true Protestants and obedient Subjects; you know the sentence Master Speaker, of sacred writ Rebellion is as the sinne of Witchcraft, and obedience is better then sacrifice, what can be more acceptable to God then reall per∣formance of his Precepts and Commandements, What can be a truer signe of faithfull and willing subjection to a Prince then cheerfull submitting to His royall commands; Ever by suffering punish∣ment for refusing the same, if against our Religion and Countrey, or performance of the same, al∣though
to the hazarding of our lives and fortunes, Give me leave, I beseech you, to adde something in my defence in cleering of my selfe touching those Articles exhibited against mee, to those learned Speeches of the other Gentlemen already made concerning the same, which I hope is sufficient to cleere us all; yet notwithstanding I desire to speak something onely touching my selfe. I hope this Honourable House hath taken suffi∣cient notice of the manner of my carriage in all businesses whatsoever the which I have had the ho∣nour to be one imployed in the same. It is a strange thing as I conceive under favour that any member elected and admitted in a free Parliament, and in the same altogether agreeing, both in debates and votes with the whole Councels of State should be ac∣cused, not onely as an ill-affected person to his King and Countrey, but as a Traitor to the same. If Members of a Parliament freely called by His Majesties royall power and Authority, freely cho∣sen by the severall Counties, Cities and Boroughes of His Majesties Kingdome; and met together onely to consult, and consider of such things that have beene disordered in the Common-wealth, as well in Church as State, to rectifie and set in a right frame the distempers of the same; To re∣dresse and releeve the manifold pressions and tyran∣nies exercised in this Kingdom, by wicked and per∣nitious persons, To bring to deserved punishment, such Miscreants and Caitiffes, troublers of the Is∣rael of God, procurers of discontent and dis-affecti∣on betweene a King and His Liege-people, innova∣tors
of true Religion. If these Members, Master Speaker, may be reputed and taken, nay charged and affirmed to be the betrayers of their King and na∣tive Countrey, Then can I not discerne that there can be any safety or security in Parliamentary pro∣ceedings, which concerne Master Speaker, is not a∣greeable to the tenent and rules of Divine Scrip∣ture which possitively concludeth, that in the mul∣titude of Counsellors there is peace, If peace may be expected from a multitude of Senators, wise and learned men; Then I must conclude peace and security is to bee hoped for, from the proceeding Counsels and Consultations of this great and Numerous Assembly of judicious and learned per∣sons, contracted from all parts of His Majesties Kingdome into one intire body. Master Speaker, Can treachery or disloyalty bee once thought or conceived to be in the hearts of any of these, who are intrusted by their whole Coun∣trey, who have put themselves and all theirs, their judgements and wisdome, who are resolved even with the losse of their lives and fortunes, to defend and maintaine such Statutes and Lawes, as by them shall be enacted and made, with the royall assent and confirmation of their Soveraigne; for their good & tranquility in the common affaires of the State, for the defence and maintemance of the true Religion; and their just rights and priviledges; can these I say Master Speaker, be suspected to be the betrayers and destroyers of the Lawes of the Kingdome, of the liberties of the Subjects, of Religion and the true doctrine and discipline thereof.
Master Speaker, I do verily beleeve that his sa∣cred Majesty of himselfe hath no thought or any way conceves any such opinion of any of the Mem∣bers of this house, I rather thinke it is onely through the informations of ill minded persons, buzzing in his Majesties eares our secret aymes and evill intentions against his Majesty, and his King∣dome; but rather (as it hath bin made apparent to all men, (to prevent dangers, and the malitious designes, of the adversaries, enemies of the State, that have set themselves withall the force and pow∣er that might be, to bring to confusion and utter destruction his Majesty and all his Realms, on which he hath right full dominions to place them∣selves in power and authority, in the same to make such Constitutions and Ordinances, as to them∣selves shall seeme meete; to establish and set up such false and erroneous worshipping of Almighty God in his Church, as they according to theire owne inventions, thinke most sutables to their owne fan∣cies and desires, because wee endeavour Master Speaker, to nullifie and bring to naught these their malignant and unlawfull practices against God and his Christ, against his sacred Majesty and the whole State, against all the wholesome lawes made by the same for the government thereof in righteousnesse and holy obedience to God their Prince and their Countrey, therefore do they worke and endeavour what in them lyes to cast aspersions upon our good proceedings against themselves and other evill and perverse spirits leaning on them, and altogether de∣voted to their cause, to insence and provoke as much
as they can his royall Majesty against us & our inde∣vours, so that I confidently beleeve unlesse we pro∣ceed with speed unannimously with one consent as well of the Lords as our selves, to bring to triall, and judgement, these evill doers, these molesters, troublers, and hinderours of our happy prosecuti∣on in finishing and bringing to a blessed end our good designes, we must not expect any conclusion or confirmation of any law or Act, tending to the perpetuall settlement of true Religion, or of this Kingdome in that blessed State of peace and unity amongst our selves; traffique and society with for∣raigne Princes and States; that fame honour and glory of the King of this land, and all those domi∣nions under his Jurisdiction and royall subjection, as formerly we have enjoyed. And thus much Master Speaker, of that which I had to say concerning these Articles, humbly desi∣ring I may have speedy triall upon the same, and as I shall be found guilty or innocent, I willingly shall submit my selfe and Actions to the sentence and judgement of this great and High Court of Parli∣ament. FINIS.
