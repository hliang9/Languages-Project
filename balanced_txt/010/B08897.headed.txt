THE SEA-MENS REMONSTRANCE; CONCERNING The present Engagement between England, and Holland, &c. WHen We look upon the Records of the Ages past, to find out the great∣est blessings that God hath bestow∣ed on our Native Countrey, the Isle of Eng∣land, we cannot but acknowledge, that next to the Christian Faith, the Union of the Na∣tion, under the immediate Power and Go∣vernment, doth exceed all former Presidents:
What apprehension the enemies of our Re∣ligion have had at our peaceable conjunction, and with what eye of jealousie the neighbour states did look upon us and envy our happi∣ness, these latter dayes can bear record. For they have not only attempted to violate our freedom and birth-rights, and to offer for a sacrifice our Religion and Liberties in a cru∣el and bloudy War, but have also endeavou∣red to make us a broken reed, a rock of offence and a shipwrack unto those who formerly sought unto Us for shelter from the storms: Now against this high & extream insolency of our adversaries, which swelleth every day to a greater bigness and exulceration, and is to break out imperiously at their pleasure, we do unanimously declare, in the presence of God, Angels, and Men, to live and die to∣gether, in this present engagement, according to our Oath and protestation: And as We seek earnestly to the Lord for a blessing in the behalf of our selves and the whole Nation; so
we desire not to go forth in our own strength but in the power of the most high God; By which we hope the Gospel of Christ shall be inlarged, the Nation freed from danger, and the Commonwealth made more great and glorious then any; which, as it is the end, so shal it be the faithful endeavors, and unfeign∣ed prayers of us all.
