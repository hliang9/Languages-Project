oole that I was, who had so faire a State Power or five thousant by the yeare at least. And was it so as I have done of late. On Whores and Bawdes and like a filthie beast Caught fowle diseases, which consume mee sore. And all proceedes from loving everie whore. As manie as I ere have laine withall▪ See heere their faces how they face my gowne Of all sortes▪ little middle sizd and tall Some Lovelie faire▪ some black and some are browne Some Wiwes▪ some Maidens some rich and others poore me old, some young vel overie one a whore. With all these sometime I have beene acquainted Which were they in their livelie cullors limn'd, Some should you see how they themselves have painted▪ How others with their borrowed haire are trimmd How like this Monkey sick themselves they faine When in their bones▪ indeede, lies all the paine But since these daie are done all warning take How with their wealth they do their bodies wast And then themselves to Hospitalls betake Or Scorned Beggars do become at last Vice▪ then by my example learne to flie But most of all (the basest) LETCHERIE.
