Warm cloaths, good fare, prepare ye must, But use ye not excesse in lust. GOD give us all a merrie CHRISTMAS, and a happy NEVV-YEAR. But indeed No News this New-Year dare I sing, Lest News foretold should Dangers bring: Old Sinners, New Saints, GOD grant we be, And that will work Felicitie. ENter the following Table, with the 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30. day of your Moneth, finding your dayes aforesaid on the Top, and Months on the Margent; and in the common angle you will find (by inspection) the exact time that the Sun rises the saids dayes: and by the rule of proportion for any interme∣diate dayes. Example. I desire to know the time of the Suns rising the 15 day of April: I look in the Table, and I find that the Sun rises the saids day, 36 min. past 4 in the morning. In like manner, the 15 day of May, the Sun rises 39 min. past 3. The 15 of June, 18 min. past 3. The 15 of July, 50 min. past 3. in the morning, &c.
A table shewing the exact time of the Suns rising every fifth day, exact∣ly calculated for the Latitude of 56 degrees, 20 minuts. Names of the Months The dayes of each Moneth. 5 day 10 day 15 day 20 day 25 day 30 day Ianuary 8 21 8 12 8 3 7 53 7 42 7 29 February 7 18 7 6 6 55 6 43 6 31     March 6 12 6 0 5 48 5 36 5 24 5 10 April 4 58 4 48 4 36 4 26 4 15 4 5 May 3 55 3 47 3 39 3 32 3 26 3 21 Iune 3 18 3 17 3 18 3 23 3 23 3 28 Iuly 3 35 3 42 3 50 3 59 4 9 4 19 August 4 33 4 42 4 54 5 5 5 17 5 28 September 5 42 5 54 6 3 6 17 6 29 6 41 October 6 52 7 4 7 16 7 27 7 38 7 49 November 8 1 8 11 8 20 8 27 8 34 8 39 December. 8 42 8 43 8 42 8 40 8 36 8 31   Time of the Suns rising in hours and minuts. But if ye would know the time of the Suns rising from any other immediate dayes, take difference and work by the Golden rule, and you shall find the proportionall part to be added if the dayes be increasing: and to be substracted if the dayes be decreasing in length. The day increases in length from the time that the Sun passeth the Tropick of Capricorn, untill he come to the Tropick of Cancer: But decreaseth in length from Cancer to Capri∣corn, &c. If you desire to know the time of the time of the Sun-letting, Substract the time of his rising from 12 hours, the remainder is the time of the Sun-setting, which having so found, double the same and you have the whole length of the day, whose comple∣ment to 24 hours is the length of the night.
Those that desire to see practicall examples upon these things, will see it amply performed in the 22 Chapter of Mr. Corss his Uranoscopia, lately emitted, to which I refer you. Strange Prophesies. In the beginning of this new year, Strange wonders in Brittain shall appear: Four Crowned Kings into a place, Shall make great melody for a space: The dead bones shall tumbled be, From place to place which men will see. The Bowels of the dead shall cry, Vnto quick men for melody: A Herauld shall lift on hie his back, Whose voice shall make wilde Lions quake: His Beard's of Flesh, his mouth's of Horn, The like of him was never born. This Herauld's tane, his Garment's riven, All shall be done 'gainst Fasterns-Even. FINIS.
