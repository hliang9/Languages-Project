WHereas Sir Richard Cave hath been accused to His Majesty for the betraying of the Towne of Hereford, when Sir William Waller came before that Towne: and that Accusation was transmitted to the Councell of Warre, whereupon Witnesses were examined upon Oath, and the Court of Warre at severall Dayes heard the Depositions and the whole Cause at large; Æ²pon the full hearing whereof, the Court was fully satisfied, that Sir Richard Cave was absolutely free from any Imputation of any Crime to be objected against him in any thing touching the delivery up of that Towne, or sending away the Horses under his Command from the Towne at the time when Sir William Waller was before it, and that what he did therein was both by sufficient and full Warrant, and by the advice and consent of the Commissioners of Array for that County who were then present. And this Court hath thought it Iust and honourable in them to Declare thus much under their hands, That as farre as in them lyeth they might repare the Reputation of Sir Richard Cave, who hath very unjustly suffered by this Accusation.
