TOrnyng & trauersynge hystoryes vnstedfaste In Ouydes bokes of transformacyon It was my fortune and chaunce at the laste In ouertornyng of ye leues to se in what fncyō Phebus was inflamyd by inspyracyon Of cruell cupyde to hym immercyable Whiche of hym was worthy no commendacyon Shewynge hymselfe alwayes deceyuable Therfore I wolde gladly yf I were able The maner playnly and in fewe wordes dysclose How phebus and cupyd togyer were compenable Fyrst it to shewe I wyll me dyspose ¶ Phebus set on pryde and hault in corage Spake these wordes of grete audacyte Cupyde thou boy of yonge and tender aege How mayst thou be o bolde to compare with me These arowes becomes me as thou mayst clerely se Wherwith I maye wounde bothe man and beste And for that at all creatures be subgect to the So moche is thy power lesse than myn at eche feste Well well sayd cupyde it lyketh you to geste This sayd / he assended to the mount pernassus On the hyght his armes shortly abrode he keste And sayd I trust I shall this in haste dyscusse. For a profe he toke forth of his arowy quyuer A golden darte with loue ryght penytrable Made sharpe at the poynt that it myght enter With it he stroke phebus with a stroke ryght lamentable It to resyste he was weyke and vnable The stroke of his power who can or may resyste

The nyght drewe nye the daye was at a syde My herte was heuy I moche desyred rest Whan without confort alone I dyd abyde Seynge the shadowes fall frome the hylles in the west Eche byrde vnder boughe drewe nye to theyr nest The chymneys frome ferre began to smoke Eche housholder went about to lodge his gest The storke ferynge stormes toke the chymney for a cloke Eche chambre and chyst were soone put vnder locke Curfew was ronge lyghtes were set vp in haste They that were without for lodgynge soone dyd knocke Which were playne p̄cedentes ye daye was clerely paste
¶ Thus a slepe I fell by a sodayne chaunce Whan I lacked lyght alone without conforte My sore study with slouthe dyde me enhaunce Myn eyes were heuy my tonge without dysporte Caused many fantasyes to me to resorte My herte was moche musynge my mynde was varyaūt So I was troubled with this vngracyous sorte That my herte & mynde to slouthe shortely dyde graunt Aboute the whiche whyles I was attendaunt Sodaynly came Morpheus & at a brayde Not affrayd but lyke a man ryght valyaunt Couragyously to me these wordes he sayde. ¶ Morpheus. ¶ Well knowen it is and noysed for a trothe Thoughe {per}chaūce it hath not attayned yet to your audy∣ence How Desyre in mynde hath made a solempne othe Beaute to serue without resistence So to contynue he doeth ryght well prepence Durynge his lyfe with loue stedfast and sure In parfyte loue to kepe one contynuaunce It is his mynde to do her suche pleasure. ¶ On faruent loue he set holy his mynde Loue is his pleasure yet loue putteth hym to payne Moche rule I ensure you hath nature and kynde In hym as is possyble in one to remayne He wolde fayne haue release and dare not yet complayne Howbeit to suche a poynte he is now brought That eyther to shewe his mynde he must shortly be fayne Or elles his Ioye is clerely solde and bought. ¶ For the whiche it is done me to vnderstande
That he wyll shortly now expresse his entent And this they saye he wyll take on hande To go to her presence wherfore be dylygent And walke with me and be obedyent And I shall soone knowe how he shall spede I must of duety holde me content So ye supporte me alwaye whan I haue nede ¶ The mountayne of courage ¶ This sayd sodaynly by a chaunce repentyne I was ascendynge a goodly mountayne About the whiche ye sonne ouer eche syde dyd shyne Wherof the coulour made my herte ryght fayne To se the golden valeyes bothe fayre and playne But whan I to the toppe was nye auaunced None of my Ioyntes coude togyder contayne For Ioye my herte leped and my body daunced. ¶ What call ye this hyll I pray you tell This is the mountayne of lusty courage This hath ben inhabyted of many a rebell As vnkyndnes / enmyte / dysdayne / and dotage But now they be dystroyed by marcy all apparage So that now adayes here dwelleth none yet dysdayne hath goten a more stately auauntage For in the castell of pleasure she troubles many one. ¶ Now goodly Iustes here on they excersyse By thactyfnes of many a champyon And these well gargaled galeryes they dyd deuyse To thentente that ladyes myght haue prospeccyon And to suche as were worthy graunte loue & affeccyon And also whan theyr lust were theyr courage to vse
To daunce amonges them they toke a dyreccyon As they myght well and not them selfe abuse ¶ Whan I aduerted of these galeryes y• quadrāt facyon The meruaylous mountayne so well made playne Me thought that syth the incarnacyon Was neuer seen a more goodly mountayne For Ioye my herte leped I was so fayne Of it I was so ioyous and so well appade I coude in no wyse my mynde refrayne To suche tyme this as prayse of it I made O puyssaunt courage chefe cause of conforte Thou mayst well be nye the castell of pleasure O hyll thupholder of all doughty dysporte Of marcyall manhode thou arte the treasure Out of thy bankes is goten the bre That causeth the pastymes of parfyte prowes O mountayne god graunt the longe to endure Syth thou arte lanterne of lastynge lustynes. ¶ So forth we walked on that goodly hyll To that we came to the bankes syde To se the fayre castell than we stode styll And to se the rennynge ryuer there we dyde abyde To haue a lowe water we taryed the tyde The name of this water then thus he dyd expresse To dystroye chaungeable & peple oppressed wt pryde They call this water the lauer of lowlynes On the stones of stedfastnes rennes this water clere To ouercome folkes chaūgeable & proude of herte & mȳde
Suche men shall be put in ryght grete daunger For than swelleth the water contrary to his kynde So that they can not the steppynge stone fynde By the meane wherof they be troubled so sore With the wylde wawes wauerynge with the wynde That for lacke of helpe they are ryght soone forlore. ¶ But blessed be god we came in good season Well passe this same I trust we shall in haste Be not flowyshe but arme you with reason How ye shall gete ouer in mynde afore well caste To be to forwarde ye may soone make waste So forth we wente in pacyent humylyte And whan I this water was well past I loked backe and sayd this in breuyte. O lowly lauer slydynge ouer the stones of stedfastnes O ryall ryuer whiche proueth perfytely All proude people that delytes in doublenes Thou drownest them in thy stremys ryght shortly Thou hast a more praysable proprety Then euer had the well of helycon The mother of mekenes conserue the perpetually Syth thou arte the mother water of vertues many one ¶ So whan I towarde the castell dyrected my loke Whiche then was not from me a full stones caste I remembred that I had redde in many a boke That in this place of plesure were many a stormy blast Notwithstondynge I thought all perylles had be past Whan I sawe of this castell the royall gates Yet afore I knewe that pleasour coude not last
There as dysdayne is in fauour with estates ¶ This royall castell was on eche syde quadraunt Gargaled with goodly grehoundes & beestes many one The tyrannous tygre the stronge & myghty elephaunt With a castell on his backe whiche he bare alone The lyons syry eyes with rubyes there shone The golden grephyn with clees of asure The vnycorne alowe with a rufull mone Stode there as desolate of lyuely creature. ¶ The walles were allectynge of adamantes The wyndowes of crystall were well fortyfyed And as I was lokynge on these elyphauntes On the gates two scryptures I aspyed Them for to rede my mynde than I applyed Wryten in golde and yndye blewe for folkes furtheraūce They betoken two wayes as after well I tryed These scryptures as I remembre th{us} sowned i substaūce ¶ Who as in to this place wyll take his entrynge Must of these wayes haue fre eleccyon yf he lyst be lusty lepe daunce and synge Or yf in worldly welthe he set his affeccyon In honour ryches or prosperous inuencyon He shall be conueyed yf he wyll so ensewe Elles to the scrypture vnderneth let hym gyue intencyon whiche is set out in letters of yndye blewe. ¶ Who so doeth sette his pleasure and delyte His faruent herte to conioyne stedfastly On the loue of Beaute a blossom ryght wyte
Or on ony of her ladyes let hym ententyfely Be content his mynde and courage to apply To suche as to conduyt all folkes lyeth in wayte For none can without theyr leue passe them by Nor yet attayne to beautes hygh estate This sayd my mynde mused gretely Whiche of these wayes I was best to take Wherby I called to remembraunce shortly How Hercules of aege but tendre and wake New at yeres of dyscresyon his mynde sore brake whā he sawe two wayes ye one of vtue ye other of pleasure And of the nyght it caused hym ryght ofte to wake By cause he knewe not the waye of pefyte measure. Yet suche was his fortune ryght happy was his chaūce Whiche toke the waye so moche praysable This to pleasure and welthe doeth men auaunce This other doeth enduce one to be amyable I am hereby moche troubled my mynde is vnstable what remedy shall I fynde to make my mynde stedfast I wyll endeuer me to reason to be conformable All my wyttes serched I trust it so to caste ¶ This golden scrypture is ryght moche pleasaunte And hath dampned the eyes of men many one I am sore troubled to whiche waye sholde I graunte Syth I am now here in maner as man alone This loue lasteth whan all ryches is gone Therfore I thynke it best with it to be content Consyderynge that fewe theyr mysfortune wyll mone That haue mo faces than hertes as dayly is euydent.

And but yf ye fynde some other cause then this I am sure For this my lady wyll not hym out of her fauoure caste ¶ Dysdayne. ¶ Forther he hath made a grete exclamacyon Complaynynge on cupyde callynge hym cause of his wo Saynge in this wyse or moche after this facyon The golden darte of Cupyde constreyneth melo I can not se by what meane it sholde be so Sayenge he desyreth my lady it to redresse For than he sholde haue sought to Uen{us} as many one do And haue made his complaynt to that excellent goddesse ¶ Pyte. ¶ And yf ye well consyder he is worthy more prayse That he to my lady made his supplycacyon Than yf he had compassed her by more crafty wayes It cometh of a good courage & he is worthy {con}mendacyon That he dare speke and trust to haue no replycacyon Agayne his mynde feruent loue was cause of this The whiche in hym had so grete operacyon To make hym tell the trouth were it well or amysse. ¶ Dysdayne.

Iupyter whiche had subdued many to his empyre As sodaynly with loue Cupyde dyd hym retayne And whan he to danaes in a golden shoure dyde cōplayne His grefe consydered and well knowen for a trothe She graunted hym loue and caused hym to remayne What wyll ye haue forther than sure promyse and othe ¶ Dysdayne. ¶ As for promyse and othe I lytell them regarde For as it is sayd wordes is nothynge but wynde Was not parys false of promyse and harde Whan to Enone he was so vnkynde Whiche by a solempne othe to her dyd hym bynde That he wolde mary her in all goodly haste But whan the golden apple. iij. goddesses dyd fynde His Iugement fulfylled his wordes proued but waste ¶ Pyte. ¶ He was enflamed but by aduenture His pouerte made hym content his mynde to expresse yet whan of his Iugement he had theffect & pleasure None of his dedes accorded shortly nor in processe But the dedes of Desyre folowed doubtles For accordynge to his wordes he made grete labour Hertely requyrynge my lady hym to redresse Promysynge her the vtterest of his lytle power. ¶ Dysdayne. ¶ Perchaunce that was more for ryches than for loue Or bycause of her grete parentage he dyd to her sewe So many one hath done as by experyence I can proue Whiche appereth so euedently yt I nede no exēples shewe Mo laboreth for lucre whan a thynge is fallen newe Than by feruent loue to attayne hault noblenes Whiche causeth oft ladyes in heuy case to rewe
And be more ware to whome they theyr myndes expresse ¶ Pyte. Thoughe many one haue so done can ye thynke in your reason That desyre so entendyd whan he hyther came Consyder it well and ye wyll thynke at this season It was faruent courage that brought hym to his blame Whiche had suche power in hym yt he lesse fered shame Where as yf he had sued for ryches he wolde not so haue done As ye may vnderstande & yf ye regarde his name Ye wyll saye that pure loue was cause of it alone. Dysdayne. Admytte it was for loue yet many are chaungeable Thoughe longe it hath contynued in approued kyndenes Was not Iason to Medea longe agreable yet after it chaunged he refused her in proces What cruell herte had he whiche for her gentylnes In none other wyse dyd her recompence He regarded neyther kynred nor noblenes This well consydered who wolde to theym gyue credence ¶ Pyte. ¶ ye may not blame all thoughe some be chaungeable I can tell you hystoryes of louers ryght stedfast Pyramus and Thysbe contynued very stable As longe as lyfe dyd in theyr bodyes last Whan thone was deed thoder to deth dyd haste Loue surely conioyned is a grete pleasure Than why sholde ye all louers out of fauour cast Syth Thysbe of Pyramus had so grete a treasure ¶ Dysdayne. ¶ All these hystoryes are not profe suffycyent Syth hystoryes of bothe partes are ryght notable Therfore with these reasons I wyll not be content
But I wyll you put a questyon good and reportable Whether loue comynge by effeccyon be more durable Or loue comȳge by {con}dicyons heron shall be our argument Me thynke loue comynge by {con}dycyons is lesse varyable How thynke ye now speke shewe your mynde & entent ¶ Pyte. ¶ Me thynke contrary and for this reason That loue comynge by effeccyō shold endure a lēger space Loue is a comoynynge of two hertes for a season Thoughe perauenture they cōtynue not longe in a place Yet in theyr absence suche loue encreaseth a pace where as yf it came by condycyous it coude not reuyue But yf so were they myght be in suche case That they myght contynue togyder all theyr lyue. ¶ Dysdayne ¶ yes the remembraūce therof remayneth in memory And contynueth longe to theyr grete conforte In what frendely maner and how gentylly His loue to hym dyd at sondry tymes resorte Fyndyge with hym goodly pastymes and dysporte Hauynge no lust frome hym to dysseuer Me thynke of suche as are of this sorte Loue sholde contynue and last for euer. ¶ Pyte ¶ More surely enprynted is and conioyned stedfastly The loue by effeccyon entreth the herte more depe Than of the other for they rest quyetly where thoder oftymes breketh many a slepe It is so penytrable and so subtylly doeth crepe Upon a man whiche maketh it so stable Where in thoder yf one suche corne dyd repe He wolde to her be aswell agreable.
¶ Dysdayne. ¶ Perauenture he thynkes suche condycyons be in none As in his loue so substancy all and stedfast He weneth she be incomperable a lone So yt all worldly stormes can not blowe downe his mast Not Eolus yf he came with his moost stormy blast Nor thesyphone coude cause betwene theym dyscorde So durably he trustes that loue wyll last He weneth that Cupyde be so contynuall a lorde ¶ Pyte. ¶ Consyder the grounde and than it dyscus Where the grounde fayleth can be no suraunce Cessante causa cessat et effectus Take awaye the condycyons where is the remēbraunce All is clene gone but where affeccyon doeth enhaunce There is no chaunge but loue perpetuall No dyspleasure can dyspoynt theyr desyred dalyaunce But be entred in the boke of fame to be memoryall ¶ Thauctour. Dysdayne to speke was very desyrous Had not credence interrupted his language Whiche made suche haste to her lady amerrous That somthynge she poynted because of her vyage For the whiche she lyke a woman ryght sage Made a pause and spake in wordes compendyous And tellynge she was comen accordynge to her message And in this wyse she spake in wordes effectuous ¶ Credence. ¶ It pleaseth your grace of your beneuolence To dyrect to me by fantasy your letters myssyue Wherby I consydered and ryght well dyd prepence That I without contradyccyon excuse or stryfe
