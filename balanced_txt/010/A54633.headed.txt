THE ANTIENT RIGHT OF THE Commons of England ASSERTED; OR, A DISCOURSE Proving by Records and the best Historians, that the Commons of England were ever an Essential part of Parliament. By WILLIAM PETYT of the Inner-Temple. Esq. Non nulli taedio investigandae veritatis cullibet opini potius ignai succambunt, quàm explorandâ veritati pertinaci diligentiâ perseve∣rare volunt. Min. Foelix. Inter ericula veritatis & libertatis  . LONDON, Printed for F. Smith, T. Bassett, J. Wright, R. Chiswell, and S. Heyrick, 1680.
To the Right Honourable Arthur Earl of ESSEX, Viscount MALDON, Ba∣ron Capell of HADHAM, Lord Lieutenant of the County of HERTFORD, one of his Majesties most Honourable Privy-Coun∣cil, and First Lord Com∣missioner of his Majesties Treasury. MY LORD, THere have been Au∣thors of modern times, who have in their Writings, concerning the Government of this Kingdom, published
to the World, That the Commons of England (as now phrased) were no part of the antient Commune Conci∣lium, or Parliament of this Nation, before the forty ninth Year of H. 3. and then in∣troduced by Rebellion. A Position when seriously weighed, equally wounds the Peerage of England, since the same Authors say, that there is no formal Summons of the Lords to Parliament, found upon Record before that time. After I had often consi∣dered so great a point, and having often read of the
freedom of this Nation, that no Englishman could lose his right or property but by Law, the Life and Soul of this so famous and so excel∣lently constituted Govern∣ment, the best polity upon Earth (which when united in all its parts by prudent Coun∣cils, made always the people happy at home in Peace, and the Crown ever Victorious abroad in War) I did re∣solve to take pains to search, if matters thus represented to the highest disadvantage and prejudice of the people of Eng∣land, were true or false; which I have industriously and
impartially endeavoured, and hope with that clearness, that will evidence to all unbiassed judgments, the unsoundness of those Opinions. When I had so done, be∣ing unwilling my labour should be to my self alone, and not to those who search after knowledge in these mat∣ters, to disabuse and pre∣vent others from building upon such mistaken and dangerous Foundations, I thought it not unseasonable to publish this Discourse, wherein there is no Record cited, but (in my opinion) equally asserts the right of
the Peers of this Kingdom, as well as of the Commons, and therefore have taken the boldness to send it in∣to the World under your Lordships Protection, whom I know to be a great Lover of Truth, To which all man∣kind ought to pay Allegiance. I should have had great satis∣faction, if before it had been put to the Press, it might have received your Lord∣ships judicious corrections and approbation, whose knowledge and industry in venerable Antiquity, and all other useful Learning, is well known unto the World.
But this happiness I could not reasonably expect, your Lordships time being so much taken up in the service of the Crown, whereof your Lordship is so eminent, and so great a Pillar, as your Honourable Imployments both at home and abroad, do sufficiently demonstrate. I most humbly beg your Lordships Pardon for my presumption in this Dedi∣cation, which fault I hope may be extenuated by the relation I have to your Lordship in my Profession, and being deprived of other means, publickly to shew
my humble gratitude for the many favours your Lord∣ship has been pleased to con∣fer upon, My Lord, Your Lordships most humble, most faithful, and most obedient Servant, W. Petyt.
THE PREFACE. MY principal design in this following Dis∣course, is impartially to vin∣dicate the just honour of our English Parliament from the calumnies and reproches of some late Authors who have asserted, 1. That an essential part of that Great Council, viz. the Commons of England, represented by the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses in Parlia∣ment,
were introduced and began An. 49 H. 3. by Rebellion. 2. That before that time the Commons were ne∣ver admitted to have any Votes, or share in the making of Laws for the Government of the Kingdom, nor to any Communication in affairs of State. To discover and refute the unsoundness of the second Po∣sition, and that the contrary may appear to be true, I shall before I come to answer the first, consider the second, and endeavour to prove, that du∣ring
the Brittish, Saxon, and Norman Governments, the Freemen or Commons of England, as now called and distinguished from the great Lords, were pars essentialis & constituens, an essential and constituent part of the Wittena Gemot, Commune Concilium, Baronagium An∣gliae, or Parliament, in those Ages. 1. Under the Brittish Go∣vernment. THE Brittons called their Commune Con∣cilium, or Parliament, Kyfr-y∣then Spelm. Concil. Tom. 1. p. 34.
then, because their Laws were therein ordained; and upon K. Lucius his Letter to Pope Elu∣therius, to send him the Roman Laws, the Pope who could not be ignorant of the consti∣tution and frame of the Brit∣tish Polity, writes back to him, Habetis penes vos in Regno Erac Beltaunia viginti & octo Civitatibus quondam no∣biliimis in∣signita praeter Casteila innu∣mera quae  ipsa muris, tur∣ribus, portis ac seris eraut in∣structa rm∣simis.  Erl. Ht. .  C . utram{que} paginam, ex illis Dei gratia per Concilium Regni vestri sume legem, & per il∣lam Dei potentia vestrum rege Britanniae Regnum But what their Laws and parti∣cular Government were, is very uncertain, by reason that Scripta Patriae (as Gildas sayes) Scriptorumve Monu∣menta
(si quae fuerint) aut ignibus hostium exusta aut Civium exulum classe longi∣us deportata non comparent. The Histories of our Country (if there were any) are not to be found, being either burnt by the Enemy, or carried be∣yond the Seas by the banished Brittons. Yet this is certain, and not to be denied, that  their elder time, the People or Freemen, had a great share in their publick Council and Government. For Dion Cas∣sius, Xiphilin. è Di∣one Cassio p. 601. impress. Basiliae. or Xipniline out of him in the Life of Severus assures us, Apud hos i. e. Britannos populus magna ex parte prin∣cipatum tenet.
2. Under the Saxon Go∣vernment. IT cannot be doubted but that the Saxons who made themselves Masters of the Brittish Nation, brought with them their Country Laws, and Government; and that the Commons were an essential and constituent part of their Commune Concilium, Taci∣tus tells us, De minoribus rebus Principes consultant, de majoribus omnes, ita tamen ut ea quo{que} quorum penes ple∣bem arbitrium est, apud Prin∣cipes praetractentur.
After the Saxon Govern∣ment became united and fixed under a sole Christian Mo∣narch, they still continued and kept their antient Wittena Gemots, or Parliaments, as now phrased, wherein they made Laws and managed the great affairs of the King and Kingdom, according to the Plat-form of their Ancestors. Many Authorities might be given to evidence this, I will instance in three or four. 1. then, We have that fa∣mous Spm. Con. To. 1. p. 126. Parliament summoned by King Ethelbert, An. 605. which my Author calls, Com∣mune Concilium tam Cleri quam populi.
2. About the Year 712. Idem Tom. 1. pag. 219. King Ina assembled a great Council or Parliament, where∣in he made Ecclesiastical Laws concerning Marriages, &c. and did other things, ad concordiam publicam pro∣movendam per Commune Concilium & assensum omni∣um Episcoporum, & Princi∣pum, Procerum, Comitum & omnium sapientum seniorum & populorum totius Regni. 3. And we read elsewhere, ed. Eccles. Histor. lib. 1. that the grand League and Union between the Brittons, Saxons, and Picts, was con∣cluded and confirmed, Per Commune Concilium & assen∣sum
omnium Episcoporum, Procerum, Comitum & om∣nium Sapientum seniorum & populorum & per praeceptum Regis Inae. 4. Anno Dom. 905. Pleg∣mundus Antiquit. Bri∣tanniae, p. 75. Cantuar. Archiepi∣scopus unacum Rege magni∣fico cognominato Edwardo Seniore Concilium magnum Episcoporum, Abbatum, Fi∣delium, Procerum & Populo∣rum in Provincia Gewisorum (in illa parte Angliae quae in plaga australi sita est Flumi∣nis Thamesis) convocant, &c. unde salubriter constitu∣tum est in hac Synodo ut Parliamentum Synodus mag∣na nuncupatur. Somni . pro duobus Episcopis quo∣rum
unus Wintoniae, alter Si∣reburniae sedem habuit, quin{que} crearentur antistites, ne grex Domini pastorum cura orba∣tus luporum lanienae & vora∣citati subjicerentur; and there were several other Laws then made. William of Malmsbury Malmeb. lib. 3 p. 56. l. 24. expresseth the Saxon Witte∣na Gemott thus, Generalis Senatus & Populi Conven∣tus & Edictum. Sir Henry Spelman: Con∣venere m. Gloss. . Gemotum, ol. 261. Regni Principes tam Episcopi quam Magistratus liberi{que} homines, consulitur de communi salute, de pace & bello & de utilitate publica promovenda.
Camden thus: Quod Sax∣ones Camd. Britan. in 8o. impress. 1586. fol. 63. olim Wittena Gemot, nos Parliamentum, & Pan∣anglicum recte dici possit, summam{que} & sacrosanctam authoritatem habet in Legi∣bus ferendis, confirmandis, an∣tiquandis, interpretandis & in omnibus quae ad Reipubli∣cae salutem spectant. And so we find Edward the Confes∣sor reforming and confirming the antient Saxon Laws, and making new ones, and that done à Rege, Baronibus & Lambard de priseis Anglor. Legibus Cap. 8. sol. 139. Populo, as particularly in the Law de Apibus, how Tythes ought to be paid of them, and other things.
Hence it is apparent and past all contradiction, that the Commons in those Ages were an essential part of the Legislative power, in making and ordaining Laws, by which themselves and their posterity were to be governed, and that Bracton . 134. Coke 12. Rep. sol. 65. Plou∣den. Commen. sol. 236, 237. the Law was then the golden metwand and rule which measured out and allowed the Prerogative of the Prince and Liberty of the Subject, (and when obstructed or denied to either, made the Kingdom de∣formed and leprous.) That great Monarch Aethelstan, in his Prologue to his Laws, made per Commune Concilium
Regni, thus declared and ad∣mitted; Ea mihi vos tan∣tummodo  Con∣ilia pag. 39. 397. Chron. oan∣nis Brpton, Col. 841. comparatis velim quae juste ac legitime parare possitis. Ne{que} enim mihi ad vitae usum quicquam injuste acquiri cupiverim, Etenim cum ea ego vobis lege vestra omnia benigne largitus sim, ut mea mihi vos itidem con∣cedatis. I have past over the Da∣nish Government, because I do not find that there was any great mutation, either of the Council or Laws of the Eng∣lish Nation. It is true, King Knute obtained the Diadem or Dominion of England; but
'tis as true he did not govern more Victoris, as may evi∣dently be proved, 1. From Ier Commu∣ de Term. Sae  . 7 . 2. p R Domini The∣saur. in S∣caio rema. Chaa Regis . the form of penning his Laws, they being ordained and con∣firmed, Cum consilio & De∣creto Archiepiscoporum, E∣piscoporum, Abbatum, Co∣mitum, aliorum{que} omnium fi∣delium, words of a large com∣prehension. 2. From his ge∣neral Law, or Declaration of Right to the English thus delivered to us by a faith∣ful Historian, William of will. Malmb. de Gestis Reg. Anglor. l. 2. pag. 4. b. . 16. Malmesbury, who lived near those times. Obtestor & praecipio meis Consiliariis quibus Regni Consilia credi∣di,
ne ullo modo aut propter meum timorem aut alicujus potentis personae favorem, aliquam injustitiam, amodò consentiant vel faciant pul∣lulare in omni Regno meo. Praecipio etiam omni∣bus Vicecomitibus & Prae∣positis universis Regni mei sicut meam volunt habere amicitiam aut suam salutem, ut nulli homini nec diviti vel pauperi vim injustam infe∣rant, sed omnibus tam Nobi∣libus quam ignobilibus sit fas justa lege potiundi, à qua nec propter favorem Regi∣um nec propter alicujus po∣tentis personam, nec prop∣ter
mihi congerendam pecu∣niam ullo modo deviant; quia nulla mihi necessitas est, ut iniqua exactione pecunia mihi congeratur. After which the Historian sayes: Omnes g. 42. l. 21. enim leges ab antiquis Regi∣bus & maxime ab Anteces∣sore suo Ethelredo latas sub interminatione Regiae mul∣ctae perpetuis temporibus observari praecepit, in quarum custodia etiam nunc tempore bonorum sub nomine Regis Edwardi juratur, non quod ille statuerit sed quod obser∣vaverit.
3. Under the Normans. King William the First. THough William the Conqueror got the Im∣perial Crown of England, and introduced several Arbitrary Laws, as new tenures, &c. yet did he never make such an absolute Conquest, nor did the Kingdom receive so universal a change, as our English mo∣dern Authors (as it were by a general Consederacy, without examination of truth) have published to the World, who father upon this revolu∣tion all the alterations which
their conceits or fancies can imagine and suppose. Thucy∣dides Lib. 1. saith, Men receive the report of things, though of their own Country, if done before their time, all alike, from one as from another, without any examination; In like manner have those our Historians been mistaken, by transcribing and patching out their Histories one from ano∣ther, so that in conclusion, with their own additions or comments, truth in many things is utterly lost. 1. The word Conquestor or Conqueror, did not in that Age import or signifie what
our late Authors by flattery have since made it; nor did it carry with it the enslaving of the Nation, after that William had obtained the Vi∣ctory against Harold, there being no more in the Denomi∣nation of Conqueror, than that after William had made claim to the Crown from King Ed∣ward the Confessor, and Harold opposed him, he was forced to get his right by Bat∣tel against King Harold; and as to the word Conquestus or Conquest, Mat. Paris writes, Mat. . pag. . Rex Angliae ex Conquestu dicitur tamen, quod beatus Edwardus, eo quod haerede
caruit, Regnum legavit Wil∣lielmo Bastardo Duci Nor∣mannorum. Sir Henry Spel∣man  in his Glossary sayes, Willielmus primus Conquestor dicitur quia Angliam con∣quisivit, i. e. acquisivit, pur∣chased, non quod subegit. And Sir John Skene Clerk of the Register Council, and Rolls to King James in Scotland, in his Book, De verborum significatione, pag. 39. writes Conquestus signifies Lands quhilk ony person acquiris, and possessis privato jure, vel singulari titulo vel donatione vel singulari aliquo contractu. And therefore the learned
Knight, Sir Roger Twi∣den, who well understood the force of the word Conquestus, in his Preface before that Kings Laws, sayes, Non ex∣istimo A Lamber∣dum. Willielmum primum de omnium Anglorum terris ad voluntatem suam & pro libitu in modum absolutae do∣minationis disposuisse. All which is most plain and justified infallibly by Doomes∣day Book, made in that S Review of his History of Tythes. Sir oh Da∣ Reports, in his C of   4. Kings Reign, and in other subsequent Records, where the title and claim of many common persons to their own and Ancestors possessions, both in his time and in the time of
the Saxon Kings, are clearly allowed; but if King Wil∣liam had made an absolute and universal Conquest of the Realm in the modern sense, how could such Titles have held, or who would or durst have made such claim, even against the King himself? would he not have seized all into his own hands, and gran∣ted the Conquered Lands to others? and his grant could not have been avoided by any Englishman who had the in∣heritance and possession, and lived in peace before and at his coming in, and no title could be derived but from or
under him, at least none could have been maintained against his Grant. But that the con∣trary was true, will evidently appear if we consider, 1. That it is recorded in Doomesday Book, that King William had certain Lands in Demesne, viz. the Lands which were in the hands of King Edward, and entitled Terrae Edwardi Regis, and other Lands, which were forfeited to him by those who took part with Harold, entitled Terrae Re∣gis. 2. William the first ha∣ving given away Sharnborn Camd. Britan. in Norfolk, to Warren a great Favourite, one of his
Normans; Edwinus de Sharnborn, being an Eng∣lishman, and true owner of the estate, demands his right in open Court, before the King, upon this reason of Law, that he never was a∣gainst the King, either before or after he came in; where∣upon the King, vinculo ju∣ramenti astrictus, gave judgment of right against the Norman, and Sharnborn re∣covered the Lordship. Sir Spelmans Glos∣sary verbo Drenches, pag. 184. Henry Spelman out of an antient Manuscript concern∣ing the Family of the Sharn∣borns in Norfolk, hath it thus. Edwinus de Sharborne
& quidam alii qui ejecti fue∣runt è terris suis, abierunt ad Conquestorem & dixe∣runt ei quod nunquam ante Conquestum, nec in Conquestu nec post fuerunt contra ipsum Regem in consilio & auxilio, sed tenuerunt se in pace. Et hoc parati sunt probare quo modo ipse Rex vellet ordi∣nare. Per quod idem Rex fecit inquiri per totam An∣gliam si ita fuit, quod qui∣dem probatum fuit: propter quod idem Rex praecepit ut omnes qui sic se tenuerunt in pace in forma praedicta, quod ipsi rehaberent omnes terras & dominationes suas adeo in∣tegre
& in pace ut unquam habuerunt vel tenuerunt ante Conquestum suum. This is cited almost as the only case or act of favour the Conqueror did; but that is a great mi∣stake, for many other in∣stances I could give of this nature, all acts of Justice and right, as appears in Doomesday Book; much more may be said upon this subject. I will only add the Judicious assertion of a great Lawyer and Judge in Edward the Thirds time, admitted and agreed as a rule of Law and truth, by the Judges, and transmitted to posterity.
Le Conqueror (saith he) ne Shad. in Ca. in tin. Temp. E. 3. fol. 143. b. Johannes Shar∣delowe unus Justi. de Ban∣co. Rot. Pat. 16 E. 3. Par 1. m. 2. vient pas pur ouster eux, qui avoient droiturell possession, mes de ouster eux que de lour tort avoient occupie as∣cun terre en desheritance del Roy & son Corone. It was spoken upon an objection made in a Quo Warranto against the Abbot of Peterborough, concerning a Charter granted by King Edgar to that Ab∣bey, which the Kings Coun∣cil would have avoided upon this pretence for want of a better, because by the Conquest all Franchises were devolved and come to the Crown. 2. King William claimed
the English Diadem, Jure hae∣reditario, from Edward the In ore gladii (saith he) Reg∣num adeptus sum, Anglorum devicto Haral∣do Rege cum suis complici∣bus qui mihi regnum cum providentia Dei destina∣tum & benefi∣cio concessio∣nis Domini & cognati mei gloriosi Regis Edwardi con∣cesa conati sunt asrre, &c. Chart. . in in∣spex. Part. 7. 1 E. 4. membr. 26 Confessor, which both his own Laws, Charters, and the Charters of his two Sons William and Henry, do fully prove: There are some indeed that mention that he obtained the Crown, ore gla∣dii, but that must be under∣stood quod jure belli contra Harolaum ipse acquisivit, as a Manuscript Historian sayes. MS. penes me∣ipsum. 3. He did not make an actual Conquest by his Arms (when he came in) of the fifth part of the Nation, for the Pope having sent him a con∣secrated Banner, and a Bull
of Excommunication against the Bishops and Clergy, if they opposed him in adhering to King Harold, and he ha∣ving got the Victory at Hast∣ings, and the Clergy with several of the Nobility (whom he had purchased to his part, both by money and great as∣surances of preferment and other advantages) basely and treacherously deserting Edgar Etheling, a soft and weak Prince, yet right Heir to the Crown; at length upon Wil∣liams declaring that he would confirm the Laws of Saint Edward, he was electus à Clero & Populo, and with
all the Ceremonies and Solem∣nities then in use, was Crowned at Westminster, the whole Nation submitting to him. But hear what the Historians of those times say. Londoniam convenientibus .

Pursuant to all which, and to fix himself more sure in that his new-got Chair of Soveraignty, he by his Magna Charta, or Great Charter, grants and confirms the Laws of Edward the Confessor. . Concil. Tom. 2. pag. 31, 342.  Pi∣is  saith, Pag. 8. nulli Gallo datum quod Anglo cuiquam inju∣stè sterit abla∣tum. Willielmus etiam Rex cui Sanctus Edwardus Regnum contùlit, leges ipsius Sancti servandas esse concessit, saith
Sir Henry Spelman. But now Sldeni ad Ead∣mrum Spice∣leg. pag. 190. we will set down a branch of the Charter, which runs thus. Volumus etiam ac firmiter praecipimus & concedimus ut omnes liberi homines totius Monarchiae Regni nostri prae∣dicti habeant & teneant ter∣ras suas & possessiones suas bene & in pace, libere ab omni exactione injusta & ab omni Tallagio. Ita quod nihil ab eis exigatur vel ca∣piatur nisi servitium suam liberum quod de jure nobis facere debent & facere tenen∣tur & prout statutum est ets Net. & illis à nobis datum & concessum jure haereditario im∣perpetuum    Conquest.
per Commune Con∣cilium ttius Regni nostri prdii. From all which it must necessarily be granted, 1. That this Statute or Law, was made per Commune Conci∣lium totius Regni. 2. The Magna Charta of W. 1. H. 1. King Stephen, H. 2. and King John (the last of which sayes, Nullum scuta∣gum  pag. 5, 257. v xilium ponam in Regno nostro  per Com∣mu Cosilium Regni stri, the same in substa with the Great Charter of William .) was but  restion and de∣claration of the antient Com∣mon
Law and right of the  Kingdom, and no Law in∣troduced de novo, or forced upon King John at Running∣mead, to the disinberison of the Crown, and which by their several sacred Coronati∣on Oaths they had so solemnly sworn inviolably to observe and keep. 'Tis true indeed King William the First gave away the Estates of several of those who were in Arms against him, to his Adventurers and followers, but the rest of the English (as well by his Coro∣nation Oath, as by a solemn ratification of St. Edwards
Laws in a Parliament in his Sns Titles of Honor, pag. 580. fourth year) were to enjoy their Estates and the benefit of those Laws; but that being not done in the general, and the English (who declared à em pag 523. majoribus didicisse aut liber∣tatem aut mortem) being op∣prest by the King and Nor∣mans, begun to be very un∣easy under his Government, so that things were brought, to that pass, that he vehemently feared, ne totum Regnum Mat.  in ta Sanct  Abbat, pag. 48. turpiter amitteret etiam tru∣cidatus; to obviate which mischiess in the seventh year of his Reign, (for so I take it,) by the policy of Lanfrank
Archbishop of Canterbury, serena facie vocavit eos, i. e. the English, ad pacem sed subdolam, who meeting at Berkhamsted, post multos disceptationes, both parties came to a second-compact, and the King to give them satis∣faction, reiterated his Coro∣nation Oath, and swore upon the Holy Evangelists and Re∣liques of St. Alban, bonas Mat. Pare in vita  Abbat  l. 3. & approbatas antiquas Reg∣ni leges quas sancti & pii An∣gliae Reges ejus Antecessores & maxime Rex Edwardus statuit, inviolabiliter obser∣vare, & sic pacificati ad pro∣pria laeti recesserunt. Rex
autem caute propositum su∣um pallians, perswaded many of the principal of the Nobility and Gentry to attend him into Normandy, where Civita∣tem Hoviden pars prior pag. 260. quae Cynomannis, & Provinciam ad illam perti∣nentem maximo Anglorum auxilio quos de Anglia se∣cum adduxerat, sibi subjuga∣vit, the rest that remained here, he suddenly set upon apàrt, which he durst not attempt when united, multos Mat. Paris in a S. Abani Abbatum, pag. 48. eorum trucidando, exhae∣redando & quamplures proscribendo, leges violans memoratas, & spoliatis An∣glis pro libitu ac sine judicio
Curiali depauperatis suos Normannos in suorum homi∣num Anglorum Naturalium. natalium qui ipsum sponte sublimave∣runt, provocationem, locuple∣tavit. So that after this time, 'tis plain, he bore a heavy hand upon the English, and increased his severity to acts of high injustice and barba∣rous cruelty, and so gave occa∣sion to Historians in future Ages, to say, that when he came in, he totally subdued and crushed the Nation, Nobi∣lity, and Gentry. Yet notwith∣standing the great power he took, we meet with some ge∣neral Councils or Parliaments
in his Reign, whereby it ap∣pears, that the Freemen or Commons of England, were there, and had a share in ma∣king of Laws; for what could the promised restitution of the Laws of Edward the Con∣fessor signifie, if their Wit∣tena Gemot, or Parliament, the Augustissimum Anglica∣rum libertatum Asylum & sacra Anchora, was destroyed and broken? For one of the fundamen∣tal and principal ends of Par∣liaments, was for the redress of Grievances, and easing the Oppressions of the People. The Mirror of Justices, an antient Mirror of ju∣stices, Chap. 1. pag. 9.
and learned Treatise of the Law, saith, that Parliaments were instituted, pur oyer & terminer les plaintes de tort de le Roy, de la Roigne & de lour Infans, & de eux specialment de queux Torts lun ne poet aver autrement common droit, To hear and determine the Complaints of the wrongful Acts of the King, the Queen, and their Children, and especially of those per∣sons against whom the subject otherwise could not have com∣mon justice. And Knighton (one of De Eventibus Anglia Lib. 5. sol. 2681. Col. 1, 2. our best Historians) writes, Quod ex antiquo Statuto &
Consuetudine laudabili & approbata, &c. That by an antient Statute and Custom, laudable and approved, which no man could deny; the King was once in the year to convene his Lords and Commons to his Court of Parliament, as to the highest Court of the whole Realm. In qua omnis Ae∣quitas relucere deberet abs{que} qualibet scrupulositate vel nota, tanquam sol in ascensu meridiei, ubi pauperes & di∣vites pro Refrigerio tran∣quilliratis & pacis & Repul∣sione injuriarum refugium infallibile quaerere possent, ac etiam errata Regni reformare
& de statu & gubernatione Regis & Regni cum sapien∣tiori Concilio tractare; ut Inimici Regis & Regni in∣trinseci & Hostes extrinseci destruantur & repellantur, qualiter quo{que} onera incum∣bentia Regi & Regno levi∣us ad Ediam Communitatis supportari poterunt. In which Court all Equity ought to shine forth without the least Cloud or Shadow, like the Sun in its meridian glory; where poor and rich refreshed with peace and ease of their oppressions, may al∣ways find infallible and sure refuge and succour, the grie∣vances
of the Kingdom re∣drest, and the state of the King and Government of the Realm debated with wiser Councils, the Domestick and Foreign Enemies of the King and Kingdom destroy'd and re∣pell'd, and to consider how the Charges and Burthens of both may be sustained with more ease to the people. But to re∣turn. An. D. 1070. which was in the third and fourth year of William the I. at a General Council, or Parliament, Lan∣franc was chosen Archbishop ea Dorob. Act. Pont. Can∣tuar. p. 1653. . 5. of Canterbury, Eligentibus eum senioribus ejusdem Ec∣clesiae

Rex mittens propter Relat.  primi ad  tractat. de      pag. 194. illum in Normanniam fecit eum venire in Angliam, cui consensu & consilio omnium Baronum suorum omnium{que} Episcoporum & Abbatum totius{que} Populi Angliae com∣misit ei Dorobernensem Ec∣clesiam. Anno 1072. The King  Ti. of Honor, pag. 58. summoned a General Council, or Parliament, at Pinneden in Kent, to examine and de∣termine the great cause be∣tween
Lanfranc Archbishop of Canterbury, and Odo Bishop of Bayeux, Earl of Kent, because the first, li∣bertatem Ecclesiae Cantuari∣ensis invaserat, yet Judgment went for the Archbishop, which Mr. Selden sayes, was confirmed totius Regni assen∣su, or as Eadmerus, stipula∣tione totius Regni. In the fourteenth Year of Ex Carlario Coenobii  in Bibliotheca Ctton. sub Ei∣gie , A. 3. this King, at a General Coun∣cil, or Parliament, held at Westminster, the King by his Charter confirmed the Liberties of that Church after he had subscribed his own name, with the sign of the

King William the Second. KIng William the First Eadm  vita . 2. sol. 13. l. 5. An. Dom. 1187. being dead, William his second Son, then living, succeeded him in the King∣dom; who designing to prevent his elder Brother Robert of the Crown, finding Lanfranc Archbishop of Canterbury not altogether consenting with him therein, to the compleat∣ing his desire, and fearing lest the delay of his Consecration might prejudice his desired ho∣nor, he begun by giving large gifts and rewards to the peo∣ple, and as well by himself as
all others whom he could en∣gage, fide sacramento{que} Lanfranco promittere, by his Faith and Oath to promise unto Lanfranc, Si Rex foret, Justitiam, aequitatem & mise∣ricordiam se per totum Reg∣num in omni negotio serva∣turum, he would in all actions observe and keep Justice, E∣quity, and Mercy, through the whole Kingdom; that he would defend the Peace, Li∣berty, and safety of the Church, against all men, and also, that he would in and through all things obey the Precepts and Counsels of the Arch-Prelate; thereupon, in Re∣gem
eligitur & consecra∣tur. But not long after Odo Hoveden pars prior pag. 264. Bishop of Baiox, Earl of Kent, Geffrey Bishop of Constance, Robert Earl of Morton, Roger Earl of Shrewsbury, and the greatest part of all the Norman Pre∣lates and Nobility in England, entred into a Conspiracy to make Robert King, and to deliver King William to his Brother alive or dead; and thereupon they took Arms: the King hearing these things, and foreseeing his inevitable ruine if the English power did not preserve him, caused the Eng∣lish
to be assembled together, and shewed them the Treason of the Normans, and intreats and begs them to help and de∣fend him, upon this condition, that if they would be faithful to him in that his necessity and distress, he would grant them better Laws which they should chuse, and would forbid or in∣terdict all unjust Scotts, Taxes, or Tallages, and grant to all persons their Woods and Hunt∣ing. Upon which assurance and promise the English did faith∣fully assist him, and by thier power valiantly overthrew the Normans, and preserved and fixed the Crown upon Willi∣ams
head. But whatsoever he promised he kept but a short time, the words of the Author are. His auditis Rex fecit Lin. 40. b. congregari Anglos & osten∣dit eis traditionem Normanno∣rum & rogavit ut sibi auxilio essent, eo tenore ut si in hac necessitate sibi fideles existe∣rent, meliorem legem quam vellent eligere eis concederet, & omnem injustum Scottm interdixit, & concessit omni∣bus sylvas suas & venatio∣nem. Sed quicquid promisit, parvo tempore custodivit. Angli tunc fideliter eum ju∣vabant  ruined  . 1.. 'Tis therefore evident from
hence, that William the Se∣cond did not claim the Crown jure gladii, by the power of the Sword, nor did he affirm, that he had a despotical right to make or change Laws, ad libitum suum sine assensu Regni or Parliament. And 'tis a great observation to me, that from the pretended Conquest to this day, I never read of any King of England that decla∣red and publickly owned any such prerogative or right, but only that miserable and unfor∣tunate Prince Richard the Second, which the Parliament Roll thus expresseth. Item, Idem Rex nolens justas leges Rot. Parl. 1 . 4. Art. 1.

But far different were the sentiments and Judgment of his Grandfather Great Ed∣ward the third, who tells us: Because, that by divers Com∣plaints Pultons Stat. 20 E. 3. sol. 137. made to us, we have perceived that the Law of the Land, which we by our Oath are bound to maintain, is the less well kept, and the Execution of the same distur∣bed many times by mainte∣nance and procurement, as well in the Court as in the Country; We greatly moved
of Conscience in this matter, and for this cause desiring as much for the pleasure of God, and ease and quietness of our Subjects, as to our Conscience, and for to save and keep our said Oath, We have ordain∣ed, &c. And wise King James King James's first Speech to his first Parlia∣liament in Eng∣land. Pulton Stat. 1 Jacobi, cap. 2. sol. 1157. saith, That not only the Royal Prerogative, but the Peoples security of Lands, Livings, and Priviledges, were preserved and maintained by the antient fundamental Laws, Priviledges, and Cu∣stoms of this Realm, and that by the abolishing or al∣tering of them, it was im∣possible
but that present con∣fusion will fall upon the whole state and frame of this Kingdom. And his late Majesty of King Charies the First's De∣claration to all his loving Sub∣jects, published with the ad∣vice of his Privy Council. Exact Collecti∣ous of Declara∣ons, pag. 28, 29. ever blessed memory, was of the same mind and opinion, when he said, The Law is the Inheritance of every Sub∣ject, and the only security he can have for his Life, or E∣state, and the which being neglected or dis-esteemed (un∣der what specious shew so∣ever) a great measure of in∣felicity, if not an irrepara∣ble confusion, must without doubt fall upon them.

Henr. de Knighton, Coll. 2374. Cap. 8. l. 14. William, the Magna∣tes Angliae, not knowing what was become of Robert Duke of Normandy, Eldest Bro∣ther of the deceased King (the said Duke having been absent for five years in a Voyage to the Holy Land) were afraid to be long without a King, which Henricus fratrum ul∣timus & juvenis sapientissi∣mus cum callide cognovisset, congregato Londoniis Clero
Angliae & Populo universo promisit emendationem le∣gum quibus oppressa fuit An∣glia tempore patris sui & fra∣tris nuper defuncti, ut animos omnium in sui promotionem accenderet & amorem, ut il∣lum in Regem susciperent & patronum; to which it was generally answered, That if he with a willing mind would grant, and by his Charter con∣firm to them, illas libertates & consuetudines antiquas, which their Ancestors enjoyed in the time of Edward the Confes∣sor, in ipsum consentirent & in Regem unanimiter conse∣crarent.
Henry willingly granted this, and taking an Oath, that he would perform it, conse∣cratus est in Regem, at Westm. upon Lady day, fa∣vente Clero & populo, and so forthwith he was Crowned by Maurice Bishop of London and Thomas Archbishop of York. After such his Corona∣tion, he granted and confirmed to the Nation, for the ad∣vancement of Holy Church, and preservation of the peace of his people, a Charter of their antient Liberties. The Charter the Reader may find in that industrious Revivor, and Restorer of de∣cayed

ascertained and explained the Historians phrase, Clerus & Populus, and proved it to be a Parliament from the Pat. Roll of H. 3. Yet I do not think that the Lords Temporal only were the Populus, nor the Lords Spiritual the Clerus; for I agree with Dr. Heylyn, that D Hylins stumbling Block, pag. 189. there is no Record, either of History or Law (which I have observed) in which the word Clerus serves to signifie the Archbishops, and Bishops, exclusive of the other Clergy, or any writing whatsoever, wherein it doth not either sig∣nifie the whole Clergy gene∣rally,
or the inferior Clergy only, exclusive of the Arch∣bishops, Bishops, and other Prelates; and 'tis my opinion as far as I can find, that the word Populus following Cle∣rus, was, Thema universale in significando, and compre∣hended as well the Commons as the Lords, and indeed the subject matter of the Histori∣ans speaks it. William the Second, Henry the First, King Stephen, and King John, were to be elected and created Kings of England, having no here∣ditary right, 'twas but rea∣sonable then, and according to the Laws and precedents of
other Countries in like Cases, Quod omnes tangit ab om∣nibus approbari debet, and so was the solemn Resolution of both Lords and Commons in the Parliament, 40 E. 3. Rot Parl. 40 E. 3. n. 78.

But now to close the Reign of Henry the first, I will out

Oration, or Speech of that King to the Common Coun∣cil or Parliament, in the se∣venth year of his Reign, his elder Brother Robert Duke of Normandy, then claiming the Crown of England, and ready to invade this Nation with a great Force; the Speech of the King, the learned Monk thus delivers to us.

Nostis etiam in multis aliis superbiam & ferocitatem illius; quia vir bellico∣sus, pacis impatiens est, vosque scien∣ter quasi contemptibiles & quos desides vocat & glutones conculcare deside∣rat. Ego vero Rex humilis & pacificus vos in pace in antiquis vestris libertati∣bus, prout crebrius jurejur ando promisi, gestio confovere, & vestris inclinando consiliis consultius ac mitius more mansueti principis sapienter guber∣nare, & super his (si provideritis) scrip∣ta subarata roborate & iteratis jura∣mentis praedicta certissime confirmare, omnia videlicer quae sanctus Rex Ed∣wardus Deo inspirante providè san∣civit
inviolabiliter jubeo observari, ut mecum fideliter stantes fratris mei immò & mei & totius Regni An∣gliae hostis cruentissimi injurias po∣tenter, animose ac voluntarie pro∣pulsetis. Si enim fortitudine Anglo∣rum roborer, inanes Normannorum minas nequaquam censeo formidandas. Talibus igitur promissis, quae ta∣men in fine impudenter violavit, omni∣um corda sibi inclinavit, ut pro ipso contra quemlibet us{que} ad ca∣pitis expositionem dimicarent. This Speech to me is another strong Confirmation and Argument against the Norman Conquest, for 'tis luce clarius, 1. That King Henry the First did not pretend to hold the Crown Jure Victoris. 2. That the English were not totally sub∣dued and destroyed by his Father Wil∣liam the first. 3. That the Son
(as well as the Father) had several times solemnly sworn to the inviolable ob∣servance of the Laws of St. Edward or of the Saxon Government. 4. King Henry does not depend on the Nor∣mans that came in with his Father, no, it was upon the English Common Council, or Parliament; nor did he call them Vassels and Slaves, but Amici & Fideles mei naturales, in them he fixt his only hope and as∣surance, both for their Fidelity and Courage, and believed that they would (as indeed they did) preserve and defend his Crown and Life against the great Power and Policy of his and the Kingdoms most bloudy Enemies, who were ready to Invade both with a mighty Army; it being then Prudentially and Politickly resolved unanimously in Par∣liament, not to permit, or suffer the Duke to land here, but to fight him in his own Country, which the Eng∣lish
then did (forty years after the coming in of William the first) and at one Battle not only totally conquered and overthrew the Normans, but took Robert their Duke Prisoner, and thereby put a period to the dangers and fears of King Henry the first, and in despite of the French Power, set the Ducal Crown of Normandy upon the head of King Henry an Eng∣lish-man: and after Robert had re∣mained for some time in Prison, at last to conclude the Catastrophe of his un∣happy life, he had his eyes burnt out of his head, and so by a sad fate left all to the English King. From all which Authorities and Reasons, under correction, it is suf∣ficiently evidenced, that in the Brittish, Saxon, and Norman Governments, the Commons (as we now phrase them,) had Votes, and a Share in the making and en∣acting
of Laws for the Government of the Kingdom, and that they were an essential part of the Commu∣ne Concilium Regni, Wittena Gemot, or Parliament, before and after the supposed Conquest by King William the First. Having thus concluded my Preface, I shall now diligently apply my self to discuss that grand point touching the introduction of the Commons in∣to our great Council, or Parlia∣ment, as represented by the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, being in∣deed the principal work I intended, and was finished before this Preface; the difficulty of which cannot be well judg∣ed of but by those who have undertaken subjects of like intricacy; for I have at a great charge, and expence of time, and without any mans assi∣stance or help, out of the dark and
neglected paths of Antiquity, en∣deavoured to make truth publick and general, and (with submission) I hope it will appear, that I have rescued from the force and power of a dan∣gerous growing errour, the just and ancient rights and priviledges of our Ancestors, in a matter of the high∣est moment and concern, which is impartially debated in the ensuing Dis∣course; a subject, whereof (to the best of my knowledge) no Author hitherto hath so particularly treated.
A DISCOURSE Wherein is proved, That the Commons of England were an essential part of the Parliament before the 49th of Hen. 3. SEveral great and learned Au∣thors of our Age having in their works and writings frequently published, and asserted to the world this Position as an unquestionable truth, That the Commons in Parlia∣ment (as distinguished from the Lords) compounded of Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, had their first birth and beginning by Rebel∣lion, An. 49 H. 3. and that too af∣ter
the Battle of Lewes, when the Barons had the King and Prince in their power as Prison∣ers, and exercised Regal Authori∣ty in his name: The consideration and conse∣quents thereof raised in my mind a great desire seriously and impar∣tially to enquire into so important a point of Antiquity; and the bet∣ter to satisfie both my own judg∣ment, and the judgments of some of my Friends, I have run over many Records, and Historians, both Ancient and Modern, in Print and Manuscript, but cannot find any authority or reason to give a colour to so harsh an as∣sertion. I shall therefore, under an hum∣ble submission to so eminent Anti∣quaries, endeavour to disprove this notion of 49 H. 3. by these fol∣lowing Arguments.
1. From the Claim and Prescrip∣tion of the Borough of St Albans in the Parliament of 8 E. 2. to send two Burgesses to all Par∣liaments, sicut caeteri Burgenses Regni totis retroactis temporibus, in the times of E. 1. and his Progenitors; if so, then in the time of King John Grandfather to E. 1. and so before H. 3. 2. From Records Ano 15o Johan∣nis Regis, wherein the Citizens and Burgesses (not so numerous then as after, and now) together with the Earls, Barons, & Mag∣nates Angliae, were to give Consili∣um & Auxilium ad honorem Regis & suum & statum Regni, who shortly after met at London, Con∣vocatum Parliamentum de toto Clero, & tota secta laicali, and so within the express prescription of the Borough of St. Albans. 3. From the solemn resolution
and great judgment of both Lords and Commons in the Parliament of 40 E. 3. against the Pope, That if King John had Ano 14o of his Reign (which was three years before the grant∣ing of his Magna Charta) made the Kingdom tributary to the Pope, he had done it sanz lour assent, which must be under∣stood to be without the con∣sent of the Lords and Com∣mons, and therefore void. 4. From several Records, inter alia, de Annis 28, 32, 37, 42, 48 H. 3. mentioning Parlia∣ments then held, and their pro∣ceedings, in some of which the word Commons is expresly men∣tioned, as well as the Prelates, and Magnates, to be part of those Parliaments. 5. From an act of Parliament 2 H. 5. that famous Prince,
where it is declared and admit∣ted, that the Commons of the Land were ever a part of the Parliament, and so consequent∣ly were part of the Parliaments Annis 16, 17 Johannis, 28, 32, 37, 42, 48 H. 3. all within the prescription of the Borough of St. Albans. 6. From the form of penning of Acts of Parliament, and expres∣sions in Records in 49, 51, 54 H. 3. when it is granted that the Commons were a part of the Legislative power, which agree with the phrases of Re∣cords of Acts of Parliament be∣fore that time. 7. From the defect and loss of the Parliament Rolls of H. 3. and E. 1. and from the univer∣sal silence of all Records, and our antient Historians contem∣porary and succeeding 49 H. 3. till our days.
8. From the various opinions of learned men, in and since H. 8. time, who never dream∣ed of any such origine, nor was ever heard of, till of late. 9. From comparing of the anci∣ent Generale Concilium, or Parlia∣ment of Ireland, instanced Ano 38 H. 3. with ours in England, wherein the Citizens and Bur∣gesses were, which was eleven years before the pretended be∣ginning of the Commons in England.
The FIRST ARGUMENT. From the claim and prescription of the Borough of St. Albans, in the Parliament of E. 2. to send two Burgesses to all Parliaments, sicut caeteri Burgenses Regni totis re∣retroactis temporibus, in the times of E. 1. and his Progenitours, if so, then in the time of King John Grandfather to E. 1. and so before H. 3. 1.

P's 4. part of Parliamen∣tary Wris, pag. . in their Petition to King E. 2. Ano 8o say, that they, sicut eteri Burgenses Regni ad Parliamentum Regis (when it should happen to be sum∣moned) per duos Comburgenses suos venire debeant, prout totis retroactis
temporibus venire consueverunt, tam tem∣pore domini Ed. nuper regis Angliae pa∣tris regis, as well in the time of E. 1. the Kings Father, & Progeni∣torum suorum, as in the time of E. 2. semper ante instans Parliamen∣tum, and declared that the names of such Burgesses coming to Parlia∣ment were always inrolled in the Those Rolls lost, or destoy∣ed. The Sta∣tute of Articuli Cleri made the next year after this Record cells us that there were di∣virsa Parlia∣menta tempori∣bus Progenito∣rum suor Re∣gum Ang. Coke 2. Instit. . 618. Rolls of the Chancery; notwith∣standing all which the Sheriff of Hartford at the procuration and fa∣vour of the Abbot of St. Albans and his Council, refused Burgenses prae∣dictos praemunire, seu nomina eorum re∣tornare prout ad ipsum pertinuit, &c. and therefore they pray remedy. Respons. Scrutentur Rotuli, &c. de Respons. est per Concilium. Cancellaria, si temporibus Progenitorum Regis Burgenses praedicti solebant ve∣nire vel non? & tunc fiat eis super hoc justitia vocatis evocandis si necesse suerit. I do not think there needs much
enforcing this Record, since the prescription of sending duos Combur∣genses ad Parliamentum Regis, sicut cae∣teri Burgenses Regni did, is, that they and their Predecessors were always accustomed to send two Burgesses to Parliament in all for∣mer Ages, not only in the time of E. 1. but his Progenitors; there∣fore in King Johns time, his Grand∣father at least, and so before H. 3. And though the answer to the Petition, which in that Age was given in Parliament (per Concilium, or all the Judges of England, and others the Kings Learned Council) say, Scrutentur Rotuli, si temporibus progenitorum Re∣gis Nota, Rolls of Summons to Parliament, were extant this very Parliament, Rot. Claus. 8 E. 2. m. 25. Selden's Titles of Honor, fol. 604, 605. It appears by the Patent Roll of 26 E. 3. that there were Parliamenta, and Sum∣mons to Parliament, tempori∣bus Progenitorum, & ante an∣num 49 H. 3. Rot. Pat. 26 E. 3. Pars 1. m. 23. (which may go to the whole Reign of King John, as before) Burgenses praedicti solebant venire, vel
non; yet that grave and wise Coun∣cil do not in the least scruple, but clearly admit and confirm the ge∣neral prescription, that there were Boroughs that sent Burgesses to Parliament, temporibus E. 1. & Pro∣genitorum suorum, which goes high∣er than H. 3. his Father; and it cannot in common reason be sup∣posed, much less believed, that the Burgesses of St Albans, or the Law∣yer or Pen-man of the Petition, should dare to tell the King and Learned Council, in the face of a Parliament, a Novelty so great and ridiculous, and that Recorded to Posterity by the Council, that they and their Predecessors, in the time of E. 1. and his Progenitors, had sent two Burgesses to every Parliament, when all the World then knew (if the modern opinion be true) that there was never any Election of any Burgesses to Par∣liament
before the 49 H. 3. which was but 50. Years before 8 E. 2. and at the time of the Petition fresh in their own memories. No, surely the Burgesses of St Albans did not ground their Peti∣tion of Right upon a general alle∣gation, or an affirmation in nubibus; but the justice and certainty of their claim, as they themselves very well knew, so they prayed it might be examined and tried by uncontroul∣able Witnesses, Records, the Rolls of Chancery. The Chancellor and the rest of the Council, did no less know there were such Rolls, and therefore order the search; but if the Petition had been notoriously false and idle, instead of recording it to future Ages, they would with contempt and scorn have rejected it, nor would the great Abbot of St Albans, his Council, and the She∣riff of Hertford, against whom the
Petition was exhibited, have been wanting in their own defence, to have shewed and proved that this antient prescription was a meer Chimaera, and fable; no, they all were well satisfied, that the Bo∣rough had sent two Burgesses to every Parliament, in the time of E. 1. and his Progenitors, and there∣fore it was in vain to oppose or contradict their just and antient right, according to their prescripti∣on; all which appears clearly by this, that both before the time of the Petition, and ever since, they have sent two Burgesses to every Parliament.
The SECOND ARGUMENT. From Records An. 15 Johannis Re∣gis, wherein the Citizens and Bur∣gesses, (not so numerous then as after, and now, together with the Earls, Barons, & Magnates Angliae,) were to give Consilium & Auxi∣lium ad honorem Regis & suum & statum Regni, who shortly af∣ter met at London, Convocatum Parliamentum de toto Clero & tota secta laicali, and so within the express Prescription of the Borough of S. Albans. I Am not ignorant that some have dated the origine of the Commons being a part of the Parliament, from the Parliament of Runningmead, 17o Reg. Joh.
It may therefore be worth our pains to observe this great Record following, and to consider whe∣ther from thence may not be pro∣ved this Conclusion: That  great Cities and Bo∣ros of the ingdom (not so merous then as after and now) in the 16o of King John, before the granting of his Magna Charta, or  confirming the antient Laws in his 17th year, at Runningmead, did send their Proxies and Repre∣sentatives, to the Commune Concilium Regni, or Parliament; for it can∣not be supposed in reason, that every individual Citizen and Bur∣gess could come, no more than every Parson of a Parish to a Con∣vocation, or to a meeting of the whole Clergy of England. The Record saith, That the Rot. Pat. 15 Joh. Pars 2. m. 2. King being in partibus transmarinis, writes

In order therefore to our proof of a Parliament from these Re∣cords, let us make two observati∣ons. 1. Negative. 2. Affirmative. Though the Writ be general, 1. Negative. and mentions not any time or place for meeting or coming to Parliament, or the great Council (the King referring that I suppose to his Regent or Chief Justice here) yet it cannot be intended that Peter
Bishop of Winchester, being then Chief Justice of England, should go from County to County, City to City, Borough to Borough, or as our Church-Wardens do, from House to House, rogare Consilium & auxilium (the proper business of a Parliament) to desire and entreat for their Counsel and Aid, for the Honour of the King, their own, & statum Regni, and the safety of the whole Kingdom; surely that had been an imployment fitter for the wandring Jew, or Johannes de Temporibus; and such counsel must needs have been of a very diffe∣rent and various nature, and both agreeing very ill with the words majori festinatione, and urgency of the contents of the Writs. Let us then enquire what were the effects and consequents of these Writs, and that brings me to the second observation.
King John began his Reign 6o 2. Affirma∣tive. Aprilis, the Writs bear date 6o & 8o Martii, which was the Close of An. 15o. It may be the Winds were very cross, or for some other rea∣son the Letters might not so spee∣dily be brought over, or published here, or after the summons there might be above forty days before they met. But sure it is, in the be∣ginning of July, (after that March) being the sixteenth Year of his Reign, we find: Nicholaus Tusculanensis Episcopus Mat. Paris An. 1214. pag. 249. l. 27. & Apostolicae sedis Legatus per nuntios memoratos Domini Papae Authenticum acceperat. Rex Anglorum erat in par∣tibus transmarinis, sed quoniam idem Rex in recessu suo ab Anglia Legato jam dicto & Willielmo Marescallo vices suas in hoc negotio commiserat, idem Legatus in urbe Londinensi apud Sanctum Paulum grande con∣gregavit Concilium, ubi congregatis Ar∣chiepiscopis,
Episcopis, Abbatibus, Prio∣ribus, Pauis evolutio dibus congre∣gantur apud Londoniam Archiepiscopi, Episcopi, Abba∣tes, multarum{que} Ecclesiarum Praelati cum Co∣mitibus & Ba∣ronibus totius Regni ut negotia Regni & Ecclesiae pertractarent cum Theobaldo Cantuar. Archiepiscopo Apostolicae sedis Legato, eidem Concilio praesidente. Mat. Paris in vita Rob. Abb. S. Albani An. Dom. 1155. pag. 72. l. 26. Comitibus, Baronibus, & aliis ad hoc negotium Interdicti (the very business of the Writs) spectantibus proposuit coram omnibus formam restitu∣tionis. And the Great Selden the Ho∣nour Selden's Titles of Honour, Part 2. sol. 587. of the Inner-Temple, or rather as the Learned Grotius, Honos Bri∣tanniae, to drive the nail home, saith, But we know by what is already shewed, that divers former Parlia∣ments were in this Kings time (mean∣ing before the granting of his Mag∣na Charta, An. 17 Joh.) though the Laws made in them be lost. And in the year before the Charter also (which was An. 16 Joh.) the Author of Eulogium sayes, that Convocatum est Parliamen∣tum Londoniis praesidente Archiepisco∣po cum toto Clero & tota secta laicali, wherein per Domini Papae praeceptum
illa obligatio quam Rex Domino Papae fecerat cum fidelitate & homagio rela∣xatur omnino, vii' die Julii. Having thus proved a Parliament in the 16th of King John, and that the Citizens and Burgesses had their Summons to it, which is remarka∣ble by a Writ particular and di∣stinct from that of the Lords, viz. the Earls, Barons, & Magnates Ang∣liae, I will conclude this Argument with the Statute of 5 R. 2. Cap. 4. where it is enacted by the assent of the Prelates, Lords and Commons, That all and singular persons and Communalties, (be he Archbish∣op, Abbot, Prior, Earl, Baron, &c.) which should have a Summons to Parliament, should come from thenceforth to the Parliaments in the manner as they were bounden to do, and had been accustomed within the Realm of England of old times; and if they did absent
themselves, and came not, he and they should be amerced, or other∣wise punished according as of old times had been accustomed to be done: from hence I shall observe, 1. That there were Summons to Parliament of old times, as well to the Commonalties, that is, the Citi∣zens and Burgesses; as to the Arch∣bishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls and Barons; and so the Statute may seem to affirm the prescripti∣on of St Albans, that saith, that they had sent Duos Comburgenses sicut cae∣teri Burgenses regni did to every Par∣liament totis retroactis temporibus be∣fore E. 1. and his Progenitors. 2. That the phrase of old times is in point of prescription and an∣tiquity applied equally, and with∣out distinction or limitation, as well to the great Lords, as Commons; But if the first had of old times, as our modern Authors write, been
the only constituent parts of the Parliament, it might in reason and prudence be thought, they would not have consented to have admit∣ted that Summons to Parliament; for the Commons was Coeval with theirs; nor would they have ratifi∣ed and confirmed by a solemn Act the protestation or declaration of Right of the Commons of England in the Parliament, 2 H. 5. n. 10. That the Commons had ever been a member of the Parliament, and that no Statute or Law could be made without their assent. 3. That if the Lords and Commons absen∣ted themselves, and came not to Parliament, they should be amer∣ced, or otherwise punished as of old times had been accustomed to be done; this branch plainly a∣grees, 1. With the Modus tenendi Parliamentum, Written as Mr Sel∣den saith tempore E. 3. That the first
day the Burgesses and Citizens should be called, and if they did not come, they should be amer∣ced; and so Mr Prynn mistakes in Mr.  A∣nimadversions on the Lord Cokes Fourth Inst. pag. 3. his Animadversions, when he saith, that no absent Lord was fined be∣fore 31 H. 6. 2. It appears, Ex vi terminorum, of old times it had been so accustomed to be done; that this prescription may well be applyed to the Parliament of 16 Joh. and long before; for the Sta∣tute of Magna Charta, 17 of that King, saith, Civitas London habeat omnes libertates suas antiquas; by force and vertue of which word, antiquas, their old or ancient Li∣berties and Customs (not only confirmed by the Magna Charta of William the First, but used even in the Saxon times, and before) were in Parliament ratified and con∣firmed.
The THIRD ARGUMENT. From the solemn and great Judgment of both Lords and Commons in the Par∣liament of 40 E. 3. against the Pope, That if King John had An. 14. of his Reign, which was three years before the granting of his Magna Charta, made the Kingdom tri∣butary to the Pope, he had done it sanz lour assent, which must be understood to be without the consent of the Lords and Commons, and therefore void. KIng John An. 14. of his Reign Mr. Paris An∣no 1213. pag. 236. An. Regni Ioh. 14. made himself and Crown tributary to the Pope. But Anno 40 E. 3. The Prelats, . Parl.  . 3. n. 7, 8. Dukes, Counts, Barons, and Com∣mons;
upon their full deliberation in Parliament, resolved with one accord, that neither the King, nor any other, could put the Realm nor people thereof into such subje∣ction, sanz assent de eux, without their assent, viz. as well of the And with this agree the Scottish Laws. Et idem Rex Scotiae dicit si∣cut prius quod de aliquo Reg∣num sm con∣tingente non est as nes potest hic respondere inconsultis probis hominibus regni nostri.

Ex Rot. in Turri London. Prynn's 3. Tom. of Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, 28 E. 1. Commons, as of the Lords: and that it appeared by many Eviden∣ces, that if he had so done, it was done sanz lour assent, and contrary to the Coronation Oath. And if the Pope attempted any thing against either (having at the instance and sollicitation of the Rot. Pat. 15 Johannis Pars 2. m. 8. Inter∣dictum, quod vulgariter ut∣lagatio nuncu∣patur. French King, threatned to inter∣dict or out-law both) King and Kingdom; They would oppose
and resist him, ove tout lour puis∣sance. The observations I shall make from this great Judgment shall be two. 1. That above 300. Years ago, there was not the least scruple or fancy, that the Commons of Eng∣land, Nam cum sub Edwardo ter∣tio in ordinum consessu quaestio habebatur de donatione illa decantatissima Johannis Regis sacta Innocen∣tio Papae tertio & successoribus ejus, unde Urba∣nus Quintus tum annum in∣de natum mille marcarum Ang∣liae & Hiber∣niae simul no∣mine censum sibi tunc solvi pete∣hat, &c. Ordines universi id{que} tam generis ieratici (quod mirere) quàm Proceres seu Senatus populus{que} in Comitiis illis solenni inita deliberatione re∣sponderunt unanimes irritam plane fuisse Johannis donationem illam utpote tam sine Ordinum assensu quam Juramento ejus inaugurali adversam. Johan∣nis Seldeni ad Fletam Dissertatio. Cap. 10. fol. 552. of which the Citizens and Burgesses were then undoubtedly a part, ought not, and were not to be present in the Commune Concili∣um Regni, or Parliament of King Johns Reign, and to have assented to that Kings resignation, An. 14. to make it legal and valid, as well as the Prelates, Earls, and Barons. 2. If the Commons had never been a part of the Parliament be∣fore
49 H. 3. but that the King and great Lords only made Laws, and had an inherent power (as some of our Modern Writers say) to tax the whole Kingdom, de alto & basso ad libitum suum jure repraesenta∣tionis; surely they would not have left recorded to posterity so great a testimonial of the antiquity and right of the Commons of England (then so distinguished from the great Lords) as is expressed in the Roll: May it not then be admit∣ted they spoke nothing but what was an undisputable truth, in diebus illis, unless we must believe, that the great and learned Authors of this Age, better understand the constituent parts of the Communia Concilia, or Parliaments of King Johns time (and so upward) above 460. Years since, than the whole Par∣liament of 40 E. 3. the Parlia∣ments of their Grand-Fathers time,
as was the Reign of King John. And indeed this famous resolu∣tion was no other than a Declara∣tion of the antient Common Law of the Land before the Norman Duke gained the Imperial Crown of England, as appears by King Harolds Answer to his Ambassa∣dors, requiring the performance of the Kings Oath to take the Dukes Daughter to Wife, and to preserve the Crown for him. De Regno addebat praesumptuosum fuisse, quod abs{que} generali Senatus & populi Conventu & Edicto alienam illi haereditatem juraverit Which is recorded by William of Malmsbury, Lib. 3. p. 56. l. 24. in vi∣ta Williemi I. an Author without all exception, who flourished in the time of H. 1. and therefore could not be ignorant where and in whom the Legislative Power of England did reside, there being but
33. Years from the coming in of the Norman Duke till the Reign of that King, and of this Histori∣an the learned Balaeus gives this Eu∣logium, Vir erat suo seculo in omni ge∣nere bonarum literarum plene eruditissi∣mus, & in eruendis antiquitatibus in∣genio, diligentia & industria singularis Angliae nostrae nationis studosissimus illu∣strator. Upon the Death of Arthur Duke of Bretaign, the Annals of England tell us, that King John was Sum∣moned by the French King, as Duke of Normandy to appear at his Court, and judicially to answer the pretended murder of Arthur his Nephew; whereupon the Bishop of Ely, and Hubert de Burgo, after Earl of Kent, and Chief Justice of England, nuntii solemnes & prudentes, were sent to the French King, to whom the Bishop thus spake, Do∣mine Mat. Paris. pag. 283, 284. Rex non possit Dux Normanniae

Rex Angliae, cum una persona sint Dux & Rex. Quod non permitteret aliquo modo Baronagium Angliae, etsi ipse Rex hoc vellet. So careful was the Baronage or Parliament to preserve the antient rights, safety, and honour of the King and King∣dom, An. 3 Joh. before any diffe∣rence happened between him and his Subjects. Anno 29 E. 1. the King sent Am∣bassadors Ex Chronico Adam Meri∣mouth in Bib∣liotheca Cot∣toniana sub Effigie Cleo∣patrae. A. 16. p. 67, 68. An.

Quo tempore transacto, ipsis consentientibus, they declare that they could not determine thereof, incon∣sultis secum Scotis. Whereupon those Ambassadors returned. Igitur con∣vocato
Parliamento Londoniis, recitatis{que} frustratoriis dilationibus & falsis machi∣nationibus praedictorum, Ambassadors were again sent, and received this answer: Quod Rex Angliae adveniret Rot. Claus 3 E. 1. m. 9. in Schedula. De∣liberationem habere cum Prae∣latis & Proce∣ribus (i. e.)

From what hath been said, the Reader may easily observe, 1. That the weighty and great affairs which concerned the King and Kingdom, both in the Saxons time, and after, were by a fundamental principle and law of the Nation to be consul∣ted of, and resolved in the Communia Concilia, or Parliaments, and that
no particular person or order of men did take upon them such power, sine consensu Regni: and this H. 3. and his Council well knew, when he told Otto the Popes Nun∣tio, Quod solus non potuit definire, nec Mat. Paris. pag. 325. l. 45. 9 H. 3. debuit negotium, quod omnes Clerios & Laios generaliter totius Regni tange∣bat, which E. 1. and his Council in the 23th Year of his Reign thus confirms, Quod omnes tangit, ab omni∣bus Rot. Claus. 23 E. 1. m. 3. dorso. approbetur. 2. That the Gene∣ralis Senatus, & Populi Conventus, & Edictum, or Saxon Wittena Gemott, the Baronagium Angliae, in King Johns time, and the Concilium Regni, or Parliamentum, in the Reign of E. 1. were verba synonyma, differing in phrase, but one and the same As∣sembly in substance.
The FOURTH ARGUMENT. From several Records, inter alia de An∣nis 28, 32, 3, 42, & 48 H. 3. mentioning Parliaments then held, and their proceedings, in some of w the word Commons are expresly mentioned, as well as the Prelates & Magnates, to be part of those Par∣liaments.

I have an Abridgment or ab∣stract of the Rolls of this Parlia∣ment, writ by the hand of Mr. El∣sing, late Clark of the Parliament, who saith, my Lord Coke had it; and some of the proceedings there∣in mentioned, I have found in the Exchequer enrolled at that time.

And not only so, but that Re∣cord tells us, Quod quaedam Ordinatio facta in Parliamento London habito circa festum Nativitatis Sancti Johan∣nis Baptistae proxime praeteritum pro pace Regni conservanda.

The FIFTH ARGUMENT. From an Act of Parliament, An. 2 H. 5. that famous Prince, where it is declared and admitted, that the Com∣mons of the Land were ever a part of the Parliament, and so conse∣quently were part of the Parliament Annis 16, 17 Joh. 28, 32, 37, 42, 48 H. 3. all within the pre∣scription of the Borough of S. Al∣bans. THE Commons of England, up∣on their claim or protesta∣station, had, as their undoubted and unquestionable right, and in∣herent priviledge, allowed and ad¦mitted in Parliament, that they had ever been a member of Parlia∣ment:
then were they a member of that 16 Joh. before-mentioned, of 17 Joh. 28, 32, 37, 42, & 48 H. 3. and that no Statute or Law could be made without their as∣sent. The Record says, That so as Rot. Parl. 2 H. 5. p. 2. n. 10. Nota. This me∣morable Re∣cord amongst several others as remarkable, is entirely left out in the Ex∣act Abridg∣ment of the Parliamwnt Rolls, publish∣ed under the name of Sir Ro∣bert Cotton, by Mr. Pryn. hit hath ever be their liberte and freedome, that thar should no Sta∣tute, ne Law, be made of lass then they yaffe therto their Assent, con∣sidering that the Commune of your Lond, the which that is and ever hath be a membre of your Parlia∣ment, ben as well Assentirs as Peti∣tioners. Yet was the affirmation of the Commons no other than a reno∣vation or memorial of the ancient Law of the Land, as is proved be∣fore, and more fully explained and confirmed by the Petition to the  King and his Learned Council, and answer thereto in the Parliament
of 8 E. 2. The Record is not un∣worthy of a serious perusal. Er∣cheves{que} Eves{que} Prelatz, Counts, Ba∣rons, & autre gentz de la Comunyalte Dengleterre que tiegnent lour Manoirs en chief de nostre Seigneur, as well within the Forest as without, to which Mannors they had Gasz (Wast) appen∣dant, dont les Seignourages avantditz arentunt, by the acre, half acre, & per rode en approvaunt lour Manoirs. Whereupon the Ministers of the King made seisure thereof, Pur ceo qu' eux ne unt la licence le Roy d'entrer. Therefore they pray, that they may approver leur Manoirs & le povre pue∣ple eyser, &c. Responsum in dorso, Il ne put estre fait sanz novele ley la quele chose fere la Comunalte de la terre ne vult my uncore assentir, infra, Coram rege. From hence I make these Ob∣servations. 1. It proves that the Law could not be altered without consent of
the Commons of England, though in a case particular to the King, as this was, for the Petition was co∣ram Rege; nor could the King and Commons, without the Lords. For Rot. Parl. 22 E. 3. n. 30. E. 3. per avys des Prelatz & Grauntz de la terre fist respondre as les petitions des Communes touchantes la leye de la terre, que les leyes eues & useez en temps passez, ne le processe dycelle useez cea en arere, ne se purrent changer sanz ent faire novel Estatute, which as then they could not attend, but shortly would. 2. That they ought to agree to all new Laws, and that no Statute could be made without their assent. It is then remarkable, 1. That the Commons of England, as now we stile them, gave their suffrage and vote in the enacting and making of all Statutes and Laws in the time of the Progenitors of H. 3. which taken extensivè, is a very large pre∣scription
of right, for that King by the Statute of Assisa panis & cervi∣siae, Pulton Stat. made after 49. when it is pre∣tended the Commons began, viz. An. 51. tells us, That at his Par∣liament Rot. Pat. 1 H. 3. m. 13. Rex Archiepis∣copis, &c. Mi∣litius & libere tenntibs & omnibus fideli∣bus ss per Hi∣bernia, &c. quod in sigm fidelitatis e∣str, &c. liber∣tation Regao notro Angliae a  vostro & nois concessis de gratia nostra & dono in Reg∣no Hiberniae gadeatis, &c. held the first year of his Reign, he had granted that all good Statutes and Ordinances, made in the time of his Progeni∣tors, and not revoked, should still be held. 2. But admitting the word Progenitors be restrained to two, which I conceive was never intended by the Law-makers, yet it cannot be denyed but that the Statute of Magna Charta, for so it is called 5 H. 3. Fitz-herb. Abrid. tit. Sed non si Ang∣liae Statta ori∣ri possunt dum nedum Princi∣pis voluntate sed & tots Rgni ass ipsa condtr. Fortescue, cap. 8. pag. 40. Mordaunc. n. 53. and by Fleta, Lib. 1. Cap. 28. and all other Statutes made at least, temporibus Johannis & Ricardi I. Father and Uncle of Henry the Third, had the assent of the Commons in Parliament, to make them Laws.
Now the word Progenitors in the Statute, must I conceive go higher than Ric. 1. for Bracton a Learned Judge, who flourished in the time of Henry the Third, and so by a reasonable computation of time, may be supposed to have li∣ved in the latter end of the Reign of Ric. 1. or beginning of King John's, after he had declared to po∣sterity that he had bent his mind, ad vetera judicia perscrutanda diligenter non sine vigiliis & labore, and what∣soever he found Notatu dignum, he reduced in unam summam perpetuae memoriae commendanda, concludes this Bracton. Lib. 1. cap. 1. fol. 1. Inhibitio nè qui Magnates, viz. Coms, Bar, Miles, sea ali∣qua alia nota∣bills persona transeat ad par∣tes transmari∣nas. Rot. Claus. 3 E. 2. m. 16. dorso. point thus. Cum legis vigorem ha∣beat quicquid de consilio & de con∣sensu Magnatum & Reipublicae communi sponsione authoritate Re∣gis sive Principis praecedente justè fue∣rit definitum & approbatum. And so just and excellent was the ballance of the Constitution of
our legal Government, in prevent∣ing any order or rank of the Sub∣jects, to impose upon or bind the rest without their common con∣sent, and in conserving as it were an universal liberty and property to every individual degree of men, from being taken from them with∣out their assent, as the County Pa∣latine of Chester, ab antiquo were not Kings Vale Royal of Eng∣land, fol. 9, 10, 11. subject to such Laws to which they did not consent; for as well before the Conquest of England, as after, they had their Commune Concilium, or Court of Parliament, by authori∣ty of which the Barones, Milites & quamplures alii (Rot. 44 H. 3. m. 1. dorso) Barones liberi homines & omnes alii fideles (Rot.

Ex li  The  aring Cestrensis Baroneti ad me m, Anno Dom. .
Clergy, Barons, Knights, Esquires, and Commonalty, did with the consent of the Earl make or admit Laws within the same, such as should be thought expedient and behoveful for the Weal of the In∣heritors and inheritance of the said County, and no Inheritors or Pos∣sessors within the said County were chargeable or liable, or were bounden, charged, or hurt of their Bodies, Liberties, Franchises, Lands, Goods, or Possessions, unless the said County (or Parliament) had agreed unto it. And I dare under submission affirm, that neither this County Palatine, nor Durham, were ever subjugated to have their E∣states given away, at the good will and pleasure of the Earl or Bishop, under any notion or fan∣cy in those days of being their re∣presentatives in the Commune Concili∣um Regni, or that being dependant
Tenants, their consents were in∣cluded in their Lords assent: and if the Commune Concilium Cestrense, or Parliament, was deduced from Records, it would be of greater use to shew us as in a Mirror the Government of England in antient days, than what I have yet seen published by any Author. 3. That the Answer of the King to the Petition penned and made by all the Judges of the Land, his Council in Parliament cannot be supposed to be ground∣ed upon a modern usage of 59. years from the time of 49 H. 3. till then, if the Tenants in Capite jure repraesentationis, made the Parliament as some hold, but was a Declara∣tion of the ancient Custom and right of the Nation. 4. That it was not in the pow∣er of all the Tenants in Capite of England, or the greatest part, who
were the Petitioners, though with the Kings consent, to bind and ob∣lige others, or to make or alter a Law, sine assensu Communitatis Regni, who had votum consultivum, and de∣cisivum, an Act of Authority and Jurisdiction, as well in assenting to spiritual Laws as Temporal, as may appear for an intance, in their Declaration or Protestation to E. 3. in Parliament.

Fortescue cap. 8. pag. 40. tells us, Sed non sic Angliae Statuta oriri possunt dum nedum Principis voluntate sed & totius Regni assensu ipsa conduntur.

And that this was the antient Law and Right of the Kingdom, appears by the answer of E. 1. ano 22. of his Reign to the Petition of the whole Clergy of England; for the Clergy ha∣ving given the King medietatem om∣nium Henr. de Knighton de Eventibus Angliae lib. 3. pag. 2502. l. 24.

The SIXTH ARGUMENT. From the form of penning of  of Parliament, and expressions in Re∣cords in 49, 51, 54 H. 3. where it is pretended the Commns first be∣gan to be a part of the Legislative Power, which agree with the phrases of Records of Acts of Parliament before that time. THE King writes to the Bi∣shop  of London, and to the rest of the Bishops of the Province of Canterbury, that his heart was wounded to dolore, that the Earl of Gloucester, and other Re∣bels, had by crafty perswasions circumvented, pror! Prince Edward, & ad partem suam proditori

D signo . undertaken the Crusado, for the Holy Land, quia tamen Praelatis, Magnatibus & Communitati Regni non videtur expediens ne{que} tutum, that
they should be both out of the Kingdom, istis temporibus, it was agreed the Prince should go, and a Subsidy was granted to the Prince by the Parliament. If one should shew the Au∣thors of the novel opinion, only these Records, and thereupon ask them who the Communitas, men∣tioned in these Records, after the words Praelati, Barones, & Magnates were, I doubt not but they would say, Knights, Citizens, and Bur∣gesses, because they are after the pretended inception of 49 H. 3. but then I desire to know what authority they can shew, why the Communitas in 29, 32, 37, & 48 H. 3. should not be a part of the Parliament as much as of 49, 51, 54. of that King, since the words or phrases of both are alike in the Records.
For I do not think it a true way of reasoning, That because the no∣tion of 49 H. 3. is generally pub∣lished by our now Historians, and so believed: Ergo, it unquestion∣ably was so, and has always and in all ages been distinctly known and believed.
The SEVENTH ARGUMENT. From the defect and loss of Parliament Rolls of H. 3. and E. 1. and from the universal silence of all Records, and our antient Historians contem∣porary and succeeding 49 H. 3. till our days. IT is true indeed for any thing For all Paa∣ment ls of the time of H. 3. are l ▪ me  in the Parlment t O, in 44. of the ame King, which I have hereto∣fore used by the favour of an honourale prson that . yet appears, the Parliament Rolls of H. 3. are all lost or de∣stroyed, though references are made to them by several Clause and Patent Rolls of H. 1. and H. 2. yet no direct Writ of Summons ad Parliamentum, is extant of that time, either of the Lords or Com∣mons (so Mr Pryn) till the Dorse of the Clause Roll 49 H. 3. in a
Schedule affixed thereto, where there are Writs for Electing and sending to a Parliament at London, two Knights, Citizens, and Bur∣gesses, and Barons for the Cinque-Ports, and likewise Summons to the great Lords. But if that Roll of 49 H. 3. and Rot. Claus. 22 E. 1. had been de∣stroyed as many others of that time were, then had there been no footsteps or testimony left us on Record, yet discovered, of any formal Summons to Parliament, of  first Part of  Writs, ol. 16. , sol. 33. them or the Prelats and temporal great Lords, till 23 E. 1. though several Parliaments were in the in∣terim, no less than twelve as the Printed Statute Books tell us. And P's Stat. . 1, 18, 2, , 43, 44, 46, , , 71, 73. the Commons expresly said to be present at some, and implyed in all, if the Phrase of Commune Conci∣lium Regni implies so much, which  think is unquestionable when
compared with the Statute of Vide the Writs upon the Sta∣tutes of m. 1. 3 E. 1. Glo. 6 E. 1. de mer∣catorios, 13 E. 1. de Vao, 20 E. 1. declare they were made per Com∣mune Concilium Regni. Coke 2. Instit. sol. 156. Westm. 1. made 3 E. 1. which was not eleven years after 49 H. 3. wherein the constituent parts of the Commune Concilium Regni, are enumerated and expressed, the Statute being made Per l'assentements des Archievesques, Evesques, Abbes, Priors, Countes, Barons & tout le Comminalty de la terre illonques summones. Now because from that one Re∣cord of 49 H. 3. (being the only Roll as yet found out) it should be wonderfully observed, and from thence infallibly concluded and nicked, and by an ominous and influential Asterism of Rebellion and Treason marked, that the ve∣ry All the antient∣est Writs of Summons of our Temporal Lords to great Councils, being utterly lost through negligence, or pe∣rished through the rust or consumption of time, the very first Writ of Summons to them, and Kalendar of their names, now remaining, is that of 49 H. 3. Prynns Register of Parliamentary Writs, Part 1. sol. 160. t to point out who they were (viz. B maires) that had their first rise by Writ of Summons until 22 E. 1. and afterwards, pasteth my skill, there being no publick Record that doth make mention of them till then, excepting that of 49 H. 3. D Pres▪ to his Ba Angliae, Tom. 1. first Writs (whereby the great
Lords are said to be also first Summoned) to send two Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses for each County, City, and Borough,  Parliamentum, in Octabis Santi Hil∣larii, were made in this very year, at that very Crisis of time, nay te∣sted on such very days, when the rebellious Barons (after the Battel of Lewes) had the King and Prince in their power, and exercised Re∣gal Authority in his name, under good favour seems not at all satis∣factory and convincing to me, un∣til they give more certain and greater testimonials and evidence, and answer these few Records. If the Epocha of the Knights, Ci∣tizens, and Burgesses, or Com∣mons (as now called and distin∣guished from the great Lords) be∣ing first admitted a part of the Parliament and Legislative Pow∣er, had such a Creation and Ori∣gine,
it is more than a wonder, though the Parliament Rolls be destroyed, that the Lieger Books, Charters, or Historians of that time, either National or Foreign, of which there are not a few, or our antient Lawyers, Bracton, Britton, Fleta, and Hengham, had not a∣mongst many Narratives of far less moment and weight, given po∣sterity a remark, or some short hint or memorial of so suddain, so great, and so universal a change or Catastrophe of the whole con∣stitution and ancient frame of the English Government, as that must unquestionably be admitted to be, or some subsequent Chronologer had not so much as dreamed of it till of late, or that branch in the ancient Coronation Oath of our Kings, demanded by the Archbi∣shop, had not been omitted, or ne ver administred, which runs thus.
Concedis justas leges & consuetudi∣nes Ex MS. s Honorabile Dominum Bar. de Hollis. esse tenendas, & promittis per te esse protegendas, & ad honorem Dei corrobo∣randas quas Vulgus elegerit secundum vires tuas. [Respondebit Rex, Concedo & promitto.] The word Elegerit, being ad∣mitted to be of the praeterperfect tense, it certainly shews, that the peoples Election had been the foundation and ground of antient Laws and Customs; and the term of justas leges, seems to allow a liberty of debate, reason, and argument, so much as might be of efficacy and force, to demonstrate and con∣vince, that the Laws so required by the Commons of the King, were just and reasonable; the debate and consideration of which certainly was never, nor ever could be in∣tended to be done in the diffusive capacity of all the Commons of England, separatim, but in an intire,
or in an aggregat body, that is, in their Communia Concilia, or Par∣liaments. And with this agrees the Statute of Provisors, An. 25 E. 3. which saith, Whereupon the Pulton's Stat. sol. 99. 25 E. 3. It is considered and declared by the whole body of this Realm now represented by all the Estates of the same assembled in this present Par∣liament, that the Kings High∣ness, before Almighty God, is bound as by the duty of a good Christian Prince, for the conservation and preser∣vation of the good Estate and Common-wealth of this his Realm, to do all that in him is, to obviate, repress, and redress the said abusions and exactions of Annates, or First∣fruits. Apad Capell. Rotulor. Rot. Parl. 23 H. 8. n. 33. said Commons have prayed our Soveraign Lord the King, that upon the mischiefs and damages which happen to his Realm, he ought and is bound by his Oath, with the accord of his people in his Parlia∣ment, thereof to make remedy and law, and removing the mischiefs and damage which thereof ensue. (And this they say) sith the right of the Crown of England, and the Law of the Realm was such. Nor indeed can I apprehend any colourable pretence, much less a probable reason, that if the Ba∣rons had 49 H. 3. usurped the So∣veraign power into their hands,
they should 1. So easily and spee∣dily divide and share it with the Commons, constitute a new Court of Parliament, and make them essen∣tial and coordinate with themselves in the Legislative Power: sure we know it is natural for all Courts, ampliare & non diminuere Jurisdictio∣nem. 2. That at that Parliament the numerous Barons (as they stile them) should but summon 23. of their own Order, when the Arch∣bishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors and Deans, made 120, if we must be concluded by the Records. If there were then two Houses of Parliament, and that the Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, did not sit with the Lords, the Prelates ha∣ving so great advantage of the Temporal Lords in their Votes, were very unkind to the Crown they made not use of their over∣ballance for the delivery of the
King and Prince, then said to be in Custody. 3. Nor have I yet met with any reasons given, why when the Government of the whole Kingdom was at this Parlia∣ment of 49 H. 3. to be setled af∣ter so long and bloody a War, the Barons being then so victorious and numerous, as our modern Au∣thors say, they would by their ab∣sence hazard and endanger the loss of all by entrusting the Prelates and Commons with the over-bal∣lance. Many remarkable observa∣tions might be raised upon this Record, both as to the Lords and Commons, but I will now pass to my eight Argument, con∣cluding this with Mr Prys opini∣on, Mr Pryn's Pre∣face to S Ro∣brt Cotton's A∣bridgment of the Records i the Tower. how the Parliament Rolls be∣fore E. 3. came to be lost or de∣stroyed. I will use his own words. That there are no Records at all in the Tower (except some few an∣tient
Charters or Exemplifications of them) antienter than the first year of King John, all the rest from William the first his Reign till then (except some few in the Exchequer not relating to Parliaments) being utterly lost, the first Parliament Rolls yet remaining are these, 5, 8, 9, and 19th of King E. 2. the Statute Roll of H. 3. E. 1. E. 2. containing some Statutes made in their Reigns, a Parchment Book of some Pleas in Parliament during the Reigns of King E. 1. and 2. and a few Bundles of Petitions in the Parliaments of 6 E. 1. and 1, 2, 3, and 4 E. 3. none of which are here abridged (viz. in the A∣bridgment by him published) only I find in the Clause Patent Charter and Fine Rolls of King John, H. 3. E. 1, and 2. some Writs of Sum∣mons, and some memorials of Acts, Ordinances made, and Aids,
Subsidies, Dismes, Quindisms, Cu∣stoms granted in Parliaments, held during their Reigns, the Rolls whereof are perished and quite lost, either through the negligence of the Record Keepers, or the In∣jury, Iniquity of the times during the Civil Wars between the King and Barons, in the Reigns of King John and H. 3. and betwixt the two Houses of Lancaster and York, Rot. Pari. 1  4. n. 8.  Richard it Rot Paa∣mnti   suo  & di. for the Title of the Crown, where∣in (it is very probable) the pre∣vailing King's parties, by their In∣struments, imbezled, suppressed such Parliamentary Records and Proceedings, as made most against their Interests, Power, Preroga∣tives, Titles; or through the de∣fault of our Kings great Officers and Attornies, who sending for the Parliament Rolls out of the Tower, upon special occasions, ne∣ver returned them again for rea∣sons
best known to themselves, by means whereof, those Parliament Rolls being no where to be found, their defects must be supplied only out of such fragments and memo∣rials of them, as are extant in our other Records and antient Histori∣ans, especially in Matthew Paris, Matthew Westm. William of Malmes∣bury, Henry Arch-Deacon of Hun∣tingdon, Roger de Hoveden, Simeon Dunelmensis, The Chronicle of Brompton, Radulphus de Diceto, Ra∣nulphus Cestrensis, and Thomas of Wal∣singham, who give us some ac∣compts of their proceedings and transactions, which else had been utterly buried in oblivion, as well as their Rolls wherein they were at large Recorded, as is evident by the Parliament Rolls yet ex∣tant.
The EIGHTH ARGUMENT. From the various opinions of the learned men in and since H. 8. who never dreamed of any such origine, nor was it ever heard of till of late. IT would be tedious to set down the various and wan∣dring opinions and reasons of our modern Authors in English, touch∣ing the beginning of our Parlia∣ments, and constituent parts there∣of, especially of the Commons, as now called and comprehended in the Knights, Citizens, and Burges∣ses in Parliament: I will but in∣stance in a few eminent Authors, and leave the Croud behind. The great Antiquary, Mr. Lam∣berd
holds, that they were before Lamberd Ar∣chion. sol. 246. the time of William the First, and there are other learned men who give their assent to that as a great truth. Mr. Prynn saith, By all the anci∣ent Prynns Truth Triumphing over Falshood, Antiquity over Novelty, sol. 69. Parliamentum Synodus mag∣n nunr Somneri Gloss. Presidents before the Conquest, it is most apparent, That all our Pristine Synods and Councils were nought else but Parliaments; that our Kings, Nobles, Senators, Al∣dermen, Wisemen, Knights and Commons, were usually present, and voting in them as Members and Judges. Polydore Virgil, Hollinshead, Speed and Martin, are of opinion, that the Commons were first summon∣ed at a Parliament at Salisbury, An. 16 H. 1. Sir Walter Raleigh in his Trea∣tise of the Prerogative of Parlia∣ments, thinks it was Anno 18 H. 1.
My Lord Bacon in a Letter to Cabala sol. 65. A. 1621. the Duke of Buckingham, asks, Where were the Commons before H. 1. gave them authority to meet in Parliament? Dr. Heylin finds another begin∣ning,   of the  World. . and saith, that H. 2. who was Duke of Anjou, was the first Institutor of our High Court of Parliament, which (being an Anjo∣vian) he learned in France. But I cannot find that any of those ever supposed the Commons were first introduced in Parlia∣ment 49 H. 3. by Rebellion. Nor was this opinion entertain∣ed by any Author I can meet with, Anno 1529. 21 H. 8. for in an an∣swer of that great and excellent person Sir Thomas More, Lord Sir  Mor's Works, sol. 296. Chancellor of England, in his sup∣plication of Souls against the sup∣plication of Beggers, discoursing about King Johns making (in the
14th year of his Reign, and three years before his granting Magna Charta) the Realm Tributary to the Pope, declares his Judgment without any doubt or hesitation, and therein as I take it the univer∣sal tradition and belief of all learn∣ed men of that and precedent times: That the Clergy and all the Lords and Commons of the Realm made the Parliament in the age of King John, and that never could any King of England give away the Realm to the Pope, or make the Land Tributary without their grant; whose Book, and so his opi∣nion we find approved of and pub∣lished by a grave and learned Judge of the Kingdom, Mr. Ju∣stice Willtelmus Ra∣stall Srviens ad lige constita∣tus Jast. de . Tesre Rege apud . 2 Octo∣br. . Par.   61 &  Rastall, and dedicated to Queen Mary her self, An. 1557. not much above a Century ago.
The NINTH ARGUMENT. From the comparison of the antient Ge∣nerale Concilium, or Parliament of Ireland instanced An. 38 H. 3. with ours in England, wherein the Citizens and Burgesses were, which was eleven years before the pretended beginning of the Commons here. AS great a right and privi∣ledge surely was and ought to be allowed to the English Sub∣jects as was to the Irish before 49 H. 3. and if that be admitted, and that their Commune Concilium, or Par∣liament, had its Platform from ours, as I think will not be denied by any that have considered the Histories and Records touching that Land, we shall find the two
ensuing Records, An. 38 H. 3. clearly evince, that the Citizens and Burgesses were then a part of their great Council or Parlia∣ment. That King being in partibus Rot. Pat.  H. . 4. . transmarinis, and the Queen being left Regent she sends Writs in the Kings name directed Archiepiscopis, .

Fitz Geffery the Kings Justice) the State of his Land of Vascony endangered by the hostile invasion of the King of Ca∣stile, qui nullo jure sed potentia sua con∣sisus terram nostram Vasconiae per ip∣sius fortitudinem à manibus nostris au∣ferre

The other Writ somewhat va∣ries, Ibid. . being a Commission touching the Chief Justice Fitz Geffery, to be as an Assistant or Co-commissio∣ner with Father Nicholas, to hold the Parliament, to declare to them the State of Gascony, & pericula nobis imminentia, & ad tractandum vobis∣cum super auxilio nobis faciendo, against
the King of Castile, desiring they would give Faith to what the Chief Justice should say to them there∣upon. Rot. Pat. 5 E. 1. m. 13. we Rot. Pat. 5 E. 1. m. 13. read: Rex Archiepiscopis, Episco∣pis, Abbatibus, Prioribus, Comitibus, Baronibus, Militibus, & omnibus aliis Anglicis de terra Hiberniae, &c. vobis mandamus quod ad cer∣tos dies quos ad hoc provideritis, vi∣delicet citra Festum Nativitatis bea∣tae Mariae Virginis, in aliquibus locis opportunis conveniatis, & diligen∣tem tractatum inter vos habeatis, utrum fuerit praejudicio vestri & li∣bertatum & consuetudinum vestra∣rum, that the meer Irish should use and enjoy the same Laws and Customs in common as the English there, and to send their Judgment and Counsel, un∣der the Seal of the Justice of Ireland. And in the twentieth
Year of this King, Magnates & Rot. Pat. 28 E. 1. m. 15. De 151 Regi in Hi∣bernia conessa taxand.

Rot Claus. 3 E. 2. m. 16. 19. dorso. probi homines Terrae Hiberniae quint amdecimam partem de bonis & catallis suis concesserunt gratiose to the King, which certainly was done in the Generale Concilium, or Parlia∣ment, and that the general phrase (probi homines) did include and comprehend the Citizens and Bur∣gesses to be part of that General Council, for Rot. Claus. 7 H. 3. m. 7. dorso, the Citizens of Dublin are called Probi homines nostri Dublyn. From hence may be observed, 1. That by the Patent Rolls of 38 H. 3. the Citizens and Burges∣ses were summoned to meet at the great Council or Parliament, as well as the Prelates, Earls, Barons, Knights, and Free-holders, and equally desired to give the King a Subsidy of men and money. 2. That though in the Writ of E. 1. the Citizens and Burgesses
are not mentioned eo nomine, the phrases of directions in Writs be∣ing in those Ages very various, sometimes more general, and some∣times more particular; yet the words omnibus aliis Anglicis after Ba∣ronibus & Militibus, must compre∣hend the Citizens and Burgesses, who were to meet and diligently to treat with the Archbishops, Bish∣ops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, and Knights and Freeholders, whe∣ther it would be in prejudice of their Liberties and Customs, if the meer Irish should enjoy the same Laws and Customs as they of the English extraction did, and they were to join in giving their judg∣ment and counsel with the rest of the Parliament. And reason it self speaks it, since the admission of the meer Irish into equal priviledges and rights with themselves in their Cities and Towns, would be of so
great a consequence to them; for upon the Kings granting by Char∣ters to several Irish Families, the benefit of the English Laws, great disputes arose, so that Rot. Claus. 10 E. 2. m. 28. intus, upon a Peti∣tion to the King, he granted that semel in anno tenetur Parliamentum to redress their grievances touching the Irish and English Laws, and so the word Parliamentum ascertains what those Councils were in the Patent Rolls of 38 H. 3. and 5 E. 1. before-mentioned. And now I will close my Argu∣ments, declaring under the good favour of so eminently learned Au∣thors, that their resolves and opi∣nions which they have published to the World, that the inception and original Election of Knights, Citizens, and Burgesses, or the ad∣mission of the Commons of England (as now phrased) into Parliament
by Rebellion and Treason, Anno 49 H. 3. are not at all satisfactory and convincing in my judgment, unless they give more certain and greater testimonials than yet I have met with, and answer these few Re∣cords against their so severe Position. A Position, believe me, that like a tempestuous Whirlwind, not only rends off and dismembers an essen∣tial branch, but shakes the very Root of the right and honour of our English Parliament, and equal∣ly wounds both Lords and Com∣mons, because these learned Au∣thors themselves do agree, that there is not yet discovered any for∣mal Summons of the great Lords (no more than of the Commons) to any Parliament before the said 49 H. 3. And here I must beg the favour of the Reader of adding a supple∣mental Argument, which at first I
confess was not intended, and it is this. If in the General Councils, or, in our present Dialect, Parliaments, for instance, 1. Of France, 2. Spain, 3. Portugal, 4. Den∣mark, 5. Sweden, and 6. Scot∣land, the Cities and great Towns or Boroughs, have from time im∣memorable, both de jure and de facto, had their Delegates or Re∣presentatives: Upon what authority or reason can it be believed, that so universal a Nor∣thern Custom or Law, did not obtain and was never practised in England before 49 H. 3? 1. FOR France we find their Pauls Aemili∣us Hist. Franc. Lib. 9. Conventus ordinum, or L'as∣semblie des Estates, consisted de Sacer∣dotio, Nobilitate & plebe, of the Cler∣gy, Nobility and Commons, this
is evident by the Parliament Roll Rot. Parl. 9 H. 5. n. 14. Pars 1a. Approbatio pacis inter Rg∣na Angliae & Franciae nuper conclusae. Rot. Parl. 11 H. 7. n. 40. in consimiliforma. 9 H. 5. which takes notice of the peace made between England and France, that the same was confirm∣ed in France, per tres Status regni, viz. Praelatorum & Cleri, necnon Pro∣cerum & Nobilium ac etiam Civium, The last of which, being the Citizens and Burgesses, appeared by their Repre∣sentatives or Delegates. Burgensium, Civitatum, Villarum & Communitatum dicti Regni Fran∣corum, ipsi tres Status eandem pacem & omnia & singula contenta in eadem APPROBARUNT, LAUDARUNT, AC∣CEPTARUNT & AUCTORIZARUNT. It seems by this that the French Kings were not so despotical and ab∣solute by the fundamental Laws of that Kingdom, as their Successors have by acts of power since made themselves. 2. In Spain their Curia or Cortes del Reyno, is compounded (as Dr. Heylin cites out of the learned Bo∣din) of the Clergy, the Nobility, and the Commissioners of the Pro∣vinces and antient Cities.
3. The Portugal Cortes or Parlia∣ment The Portugal History. Im∣press. An. 1677. pag. 279. consists of the Bishops and Prelats, the Nobiles majores & mi∣nores, and two Procurators or Bur∣gesses from every City, who have a deliberative voice, which they call definitive. 4. In Denmark, Pontanus saith, P in Hi∣ the Bishops, the Nobility, & Civi∣tatum Delegati, the Deputies or Commissioners of Towns and Cities, made up their General Council. 5. For Sweden, it does not much Thanus Hist. Lib. 131. fol. 1108. Tom. . differ from the Government and form of Denmark, their Common Council consisting of the same Estates and degrees of people, that is to say, Proceres & Nobiles, the greater and the less Nobility, Epi∣scopi & Ecclesiastici, Civitates & U∣niversitates, the Cities, Boroughs and Villages. I might here if it were needful,
shew how great a share and inter∣est the Hanze or free Towns in Germany have by their Deputies in all Ages had in the Diet or Gene∣ral Council of the Empire. 6. But now at last we are come to Scotland, Sir John Skene in his E∣pistle Regiam Maje∣statem Scotiae. Dedicatory to King James, before his Scottish Laws, writes thus. Intelligo tuas tuorum{que} Majorum Leges quae cum Legibus Regni tui An∣gliae magna ex parte consentiunt; and then in his Book shews, that Wil∣lielmus cognominatus Leo, who as is said, begun to Reign in 1105. and reigned 49. Years, so as he was King of Scotland 510 of our Henry the first, held his Assise or Parliament at Apud eundem Statuta Wil∣helmi Regis, pag. 3. cap. 7. Perth, where several Laws were ordained, to the observance where∣of, Episcopi, Abbates, Comites, Barones, Thani & tota Communitas Regni te∣nere firmiter juraverunt.
King Alexander began to Reign  Statut Alexandri , pag. 2. . 2. Anno 1214. which was the six∣teenth Year of our King John, and Reigned 35. Years, so as he died an. 38 H. 3. he made his Laws de Consilio & assensu venerabilium Patrum Episcoporum, Abbatum, Baronum ac proborum hominum suorum Scotiae. And R. .   2. . 2.   Exon. Wor Hunt. . &c. what the Communitas Regni in King William's Statutes, and the prob ho∣mines in King Alexanders, were, the League made between the French King and the Crown of Scotland, Anno 28 E. 1. clearly shews, be∣ing Ex  in ri London. 28 E. 1. ratified and confirmed in their Parliament, per Johannem de Balliolo, then King, ac Praelatos & Nobiles & Universitates & Communitates Ci∣vitatum & Villarum dicti Regni Scotiae; and the constant practice ever since hath been, that the Ci∣ties and Boroughs have sent their Proxies or Representatives to the Par∣liaments of that Kingdom.
It may therefore seem very strange, that when the Cities and Boroughs in all the Kingdoms of Europe, de jure and de facto were ab antiquis temporibus, even in times coeval with the Government, an es∣sential part of their Common Councils or Parliaments, that England should not be under the same constituti∣on, being but descendants from Gaul, or the more Northern Coun∣tries; if so, 1. Was it because in the Britton, Saxon and Norman times, there were no Cities or Boroughs, or if there were, were they so poor and in∣considerable, as they deserved no observation in the eye of the State? or, 2. Was it because, by a strange and unheard of fate, peculiar and proper only to them, they were not fit or capable to give or hear reason, as well as the Delegates or
Representatives of the Cities and Boroughs of France, Spain, Por∣tugal, Denmark, Sweden and Scot∣land? or, 3. Had they no property or right in their Estates? Certainly, in my opinion, none of these Objections can be admitted, allowed, or pro∣ved; for In the Brittons time, venerable   . lib. 1. cap. 1. Bede tells us. Erat Britannia viginti & octo Civitatibus quondam Nobilissi∣mis insignita praeter Castella innumera, quae & ipsa muris, turribus, portis ac seris erant instructa firmissimis. Nor were they of less reputation in the Saxon or Norman times, when they were thought so necessary and pro∣per for the safety of the Govern ment, preservation and defence of the Laws, that it was ordained by William the First, and the Common . Council of the Kingdom; That no Market or Fair should be permit∣ted
to be held, nisi in Civitatibus Regni nostri & in Burgis ubi consue∣tudines Regni & Jus Commune & dig∣nitates Coronae nostrae deperiri non pos∣sunt nec defraudari nec violari, sed omnia recte & in aperto & per Judicium & Justitiam fieri debent, &c. ad tuitionem gentium & populorum regni & ad de∣fensionem Regni. And if in the Brit∣tons times the Nation was so strong in Cities and Castles, surely it can∣not be imagined but that in the Saxon and Norman times, when the Nation became to be more civili∣zed and considerable in the World, the Estates or Degrees of the In∣habitants    spi∣. od. de . Lib. 1. Cap. 3. would easily part with these Liberties and Priviledges, which their Ancestors, though less knowing and powerful, did claim and enjoy. Having thus concluded my Ar∣guments against the Position of 49
H. 3. I have thought it not alto∣gether impertinent, to add some brief Observations for the better un∣derstanding of antient Records, and Historians in their various Lecti∣ons and different expressions. I shall therefore consider, 1. The different application of the words Commune, Communitas, or Plebs. 2. The several Denominations by which our antient General, or Com∣mon Council or Parliaments, were expressed. 3. The various acceptation of the word Baro, and that under the Phrase of Baronagium Angliae, both Lords and Commons were com∣prehended.
Observation I. The different application of the words Commune, Communitas, or Plebs. THere lies a main Objection Objection. Eum go Plbi∣m vo, qum leges nostrae o∣minem legm appellant, saith a learned man, a Lawyer and Privy Councel∣lor to the fa∣mous Queen. T. S de Rep. A. 1. cap. 23. fol. 43. Di ps. And the Arch∣bishops Que∣stion to the King in the Co∣ronation Oath runs, Si liges & conss ab antiquis justis & deo devotis Regibus Pbi Anglorum as. Ti Maga Charta, fol. 164. against me, for some Au∣thors say, that the words Commons, Communitas, or Plebs, is not to be met withal in any antient Authors or Records; ab ingressu Willielmi Primi us{que} ad excessum H. 3. and therefore conclude, they were ne∣ver a part of the Commune Concilium, or Parliament, before 49 H. 3. be∣cause not mentioned eo nomine. Admitting the Objection true Answer. (which I conceive otherwise) yet it is no Conclusive Argument, for before the Statute An. 3 R. 2. cap. 3. Rs Stat. pag. 135 p. 3.
I cannot find the appellation of Lords Temporal, nor before the 13th of that King cap. 2. the phrase Lords Spiritual and Temporal in our Ibid. pag. 156. Printed Statute Books; Ergo, from thence it follows by a necessary consequence, according to their Argument, that they were not any part of the Generale Concilium, or Parliament, before those times, be∣cause not expressed by that name. I suppose this Conclusion will not be admitted true. But as I am well satisfied, that the Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots and Priors, who were often ex∣pressed by, and comprehended in the word Praelati, and who in after times constituted the Lords Spiri∣tual, and the Earls and Barons, as now differenced, the Lords Tempo∣ral, were ab antiquo undoubtedly a part of the Commune Concilium Regni, or Parliament; so it may be proved
if insisted upon, That the Milites and libere tenentes de Regno or An∣gliae, the Knights and Gentlemen, or Freeholders of England (licet nonnun∣quam diversis & variis appellationibus expressi & inclusi, in which those qui de Rege tenuerunt in capite, or Ba∣rones Reges Antiqui cùm in Chartis mentionem sa∣ciant de Baro∣nibus, saepe sub∣jungunt, posses∣sivum meis vel nostris, id est Re∣gios Barones sic distinguant à Baronibus, Epi∣scoporum, Comi∣tum, Abbatum, &c.

Sed haec obiter.
1. As to the word Communes (or 1. Observation. Communitas) I have in my enquiries observed it to be used in six senses. 1. To comprehend the whole Commune Concilium Regni, or Parliament. A le commune Dangleterre: Here Coke 2. Instit. fol. 539. Arti∣culi super Char∣tas, cap. 1. Commune is taken for people, so as tout le Commune is here taken for all the people, and this is proved by the sense of the words, for Magna Charta was not granted to the Commons of the Realm, but generally to all the Sub∣jects of the Realm, viz. to those of the Clergy, and to those of the Nobility; and to the Commons also. And that [Commune] in this place signifieth people, it is proved by the preamble, for there the great Charter and the Charter of the Forest, are rehearsed to be gran∣ted Note, before 9 H. 3. Magna Charta was granted and confirmed several times. Rot. Pat. 1 H. 3. n. 13. Rot. Claus. 2 H. 3. m. 11. dorso. Of which last there are several antient transcripts. MS. penes praenobilem Will.

To comprehend the Commu∣nitas Rot. Pat. 48 H. 3. Pars 1. m. 8. dorso n. 10. Praelatorum & Baronum. 3. To comprehend the genera∣lity of all that came to Parliament, after the particular enumeration of the Orders of the great Lords, viz. Archiepiscopi, Episcopi, Abbates, Priores, Comites, Barones. The Statute of Westm. 1. made Cok 2. Instit. fol. 156. Rastall's Stat. 12 E. 2. sol. 59. 3 E. 1. eleven years after 49 H. 3.

Observation II. 2. The several Denominations by which our antient General, or Common Council, or Parliaments, were ex∣pressed. IF any man will be at the ex∣pence of so great a charge and trouble, as to compare the various lections of Historians and Records to∣gether, and the manner and phrase of words and speeches, proper to particular ages and times, he may satisfie himself what those Coun∣cils were, and their constituent parts, whom the antient Historians mean, when they say, Convocati, or Congregati fuerunt Nobiles Angliae.

Parliamento autem incipiente so∣lidabatur Magnum Propositum & Con∣silium immutabile exigendo constantis∣sime ut Dominus Rex Cartam Liberta∣tum Angliae quam Johannes Rex pa∣ter suis Anglis confecit & confectam concessit, quam{que} idem Johannes tenere Nota, King John swore to observe Magna Charta, and the Barons did him homage. Rot. Pat. 17 Joh. pars unica n. 23. n. 3. juravit, fideliter teneat & conservet, quam{que} idem Rex Henricus multoties concesserat & tenere juraverat, e∣jus{que} infractores ab omnibus Angliae E∣piscopis in praesentia sua & totius Baro∣nagii horribiliter fecit excommunicari & ipse unus fuerat excommunicantium. So as the Excommunication here meant, being that of 37 H. 3. then made in the presence of the King, Great men, and Communitatis Populi, is here said to be done in praesentia to∣tius Baronagii Angliae. And for the Honour of Magna Charta, I will con∣clude this head with an Act of Par∣liament. That Valiant and great
Prince, E. 4. after the overthrow Rot. Parl. 12 E. 4. n. Rs Stat. 12 E. 4. cap. 7. of his Enemies, and peaceful pos∣session of the Crown, assisted with the Judges of England, Archbish∣ops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, his Dukes, Earls, Viscounts, and Ba∣rons, with the great men or Knights of the Counties, and Commons in full Parliament, hath left this recorded to Posterity. They call this great Charter the Laudable Statute of Magna Charta, which Statute was made for the great wealth of this Land, upon which Magna Charta, the great Sentence and Apostolique Curse, by a great number of Bish∣ops, was pronounced against the breakers of the same; and the same Sentence is four times in the year openly declared, according to the Law of Holy Church; and in affir∣mance of the said Statute, of the said great Charter, divers Statutes have been made and ordained.
And great reason certainly they had to put so high a value on that so famous Charter, since the sub∣stantial part of the Laws thereof were no less than the great results, decrees, and judgments, ordained by the prudence and justice of the Brittish, Saxon, and Danish Dynasties, founded upon two grand and prin∣cipal Bases or Pillars, Liberty and Property, which like those two brasen ones called Boaz and Jachin, supporting the Temple of Solomon, upheld the tottering Frame and Fa∣brick of our antient Government, though often by evil men designed to be overthrown. A Charter, empta & redempta, . purchased and redeemed with vast treasure of the Nation, and the effu∣sion of a Sea of Christian blood. A Law published and established with fearful execrations, and terri∣ble Curses, against the infringers
and breakers thereof, and all done with that religious solemnity, and profound Ceremony, as it may seem inferior only to that of the Commandments of Almighty God given to the Jewish Nation. All great Ministers of State and Rot. Parl. 15 E. 3. n. 10. 37. Justice were at their entrance into their Offices, solemnly to swear the observation thereof, and great reason there was for the making of this Law, both for the preservation of the King, and also the Kingdom; for that Parliament well knew the woful confusions in the Reign of Edward the Second, who being se∣duced by his two Minions the Spen∣cers, for want of observing the good old Laws and Customs of England, cut off the head of Thomas Earl of Lancaster his Uncle, that being the first act of shedding the sacred Royal blood by colour of Law I ever met withal in History; they usurped
Royal Power, they sent the Queen and Prince (afterwards great Ed∣ward the Third) beyond Sea, and prevailed with E. 2. to declare the Queen and Prince Traytors. They Monopolized the Kings Eyes, Ears, and his whole Understanding, so that the King nothing did, or would do, but what they did counsel him, Rast. Stat. 1 E. 3. pag. 64, 65. were it never so great wrong; and if any had the courage to com∣plain against them, or so much as fetch a loyal sigh, or lament the hard fate of the King then impo∣sed upon by those Favourites; they were branded with arraigning the Government, striking at the foun∣dation of State, and being guilty of Treason, and what not. The consequences of whose un∣happy Counsels and Policies, are too well known in History to have been the ruine both of the King and themselves.
The Priests and Confessors were Pupilla ocli, fol. 50. cap. 22. De senentia lata super Mag∣nam Chartam. strictly commanded to frame and direct the Consciences of the peo∣ple to the observation and obedi∣ence of the Great Charter, and they did so, not like the Sibthorps and Manwarings of later times, who by their Flatteries of Prerogative for their own promotion seek to ruine the Subjects property.
Observation III. The various acceptation of the word Ba∣ro, and that under the phrase of Ba∣ronagium Angliae both Lords and Commons were comprehen∣ded. AS to the word Baro, it was Observation 3. not much more in use be∣fore Camd. Britan. sol. 121. Sel∣den's Titles of Honor, in 4••. Parte 2••. fol. 73. William I. obtained the English Diadem, that I can find, than the word Communes, Baro Britanni pro suo non agnoscunt in Anglo-Saxonic is legibus nusquam comparet nec in Alfrici Glossario Saxonico inter dignitatum vo∣cabula habetur. For the English Sax∣ons called those in their own Lan∣guage alepmen which in Latine were named Comites, and the Danes Earls, but of so extensive an im∣port in its signification, as we read
of Aldermani Regis, Aldermani Comi∣tatus, Spelm. Gloss. Tit. de Alder∣manis, & mul∣tiplci Magi∣strata apud Anglo-Saxonis, sol. 24, 25. Civitatis, Burgi, Castelli, Hun∣dredi, sive Wapentachii & novem de∣cimorum, so according to the strict word they had whole Regiments of Earls. The greatest title of which, N t Cantii Comites suo or∣dine percense∣am (omissis Saxonibus God∣wino & aliis) qul non haeredi∣tarii sed offici∣arii Comites erant. Camd. Britan. Canti∣um, fol. 248. Spelm. Gloss. Diatriba de Ba∣ronibus, fol. 64, 69, 70, 71. seldom, if at all, descended here∣ditarily till the Confessors time, and after Will. I. became King, the word alepman began to change and vary its signification, and in room of Aldermani Regis, we find Barones Regis; for Aldermani Comi∣tatus, Barones Comitatus; for Alder∣mani Civitatis, Barones Civitatis; for Aldermani Burgorum, Barones Burgo∣rum; for Aldermani Castellorum, Ba∣rones Castellorum; for Aldermani Hun∣dredorum, Barones Hundredorum sive Wapentachiorum. Sir Henry Spelman saith, that sim∣plices Spelm. Gloss. in  Barons, fol. 69, 70. villarum Maneriorum Domini de quocun{que} tenentes qui sacham & socham habent, were antiently called Barones.
And all Freeholders, hoc est tam Ibidem. Barouiae pluri∣mae in Nor∣thumbria, tum{que} omnino Marti se quasi consecrarunt, non est inter cos quispiam melio∣ris notae qui su∣am turriculam aut munimen∣tum non habeat, & in quamplu∣rimas Baronias divisa suit quarum Domini olim ante Ed∣wardi primi tempora Barones vulgo dicti. Camd. Britan. in sol. 658. in Soccagio quam per servitium militare, had the Title of Barones; and in his species of Barones Comitatus, saith, Proceres nempe & maneriorum Domini nec non libere qui{que} tenentes, Anglice Freeholders, had that appellation. Notandum autem est libere hos tenentes nec tam exiles olim fuisse nec tam vul∣gares ut hodie deprehenduntur. The great Selden in his Notes Johannis Sel∣deni ad Ead∣merum & notis & spileg. fol. 168. upon Eadmerus upon the word Ba∣rones, saith, Vocabulum nempe alia no∣tione usurpari quam vulgo, ne{que} eos dun∣taxat ut hodie significare quibus peculia∣ris ordinum Comitiis locus est. And the learned Camden writes, Camd. Britan. in 8. Di ordin. Angliae, fol. 61. Verum Baro ex illis nominibus videatur quae tempus paulatim meliora & molli∣or a reddidit; nam longo post tempore non Milites sed qui liberi erant Domini & Tinorum enim do rant gene∣ra, majores quos Theinos Regis appellabant, nos Barones Regis & Theini simpliciter seu Theini minores, qui iidem rant qui Barones minores & nonunquam libere tenentes nuncupantm.

And indeed Records and Hi∣stories will furnish us with several Precedents, where succeeding Par∣liaments as well as these of H. 3. have sent Letters to the Pope when he attempted to invade the Rights of the Crown or Kingdom. I will give two instances in the Reigns of the two famous Princes, Ed∣ward the First, and Edward the Third. 1. Edward the First, An. 29 of his Reign, claimed Scotland, as Rex & superior Dominus, the Pope as a Fiefe of the Roman Church; the Pope backed by the French King, Sum∣mons Edw. to appear before him in his Court at Rome, and sends his Letters or Bulls to the Archbishop
of Canterbury to serve them; the Archbishop obeys, the King tells him, Verum quia consuetudo est Regni Mat. Westm. An. Dom. 1301. p. 439. l. 2. Re Regis Archie∣piscopo Cant. ad literas Apostoli∣cas.

The Parliament thereupon send their Letter to the Pope, subscri∣bed and sealed by several of the principal men of the Parliament, as Mat. . A. D. 1302. 29 E. 1. p. 43. l 4. the usage of that Age was, tel∣ling him, that sane convocato nuper per serenissimum Dominum nostrum Ed∣wardum Dei gratia Regem Angliae Illustrem Parliamento apud Lincol∣niam Generali; the King had cau∣sed the Popes Letter, in medio, or pleno Parliamento exhiberi ac seriose nobis fecit exponi, unde habito tractatu

The second is, the Letter to Walsmgham in vita E. 3. ol. 16. l. 22. the Pope, made at the Parliament, 17 E. 3. touching Provisions. Quod Rex & tota Nobilitas Regni pati no∣luit, &c. thus translated, whereby
the phrase Nobilitas Regni, in the Historian, will be explained. TO the most holy Father in A Fom  Vo. . p. 5 1. Rot. Parl.  .

In Witness whereof we have hereunto set our Seals. Given in the full Par∣liament at Westm. on the eighteenth Day of May, Anno Dom. 1343. And indeed the Commons were  so highly incensed, that the Par∣liament Roll of this Year tells us,
that La dite Commune ne le poet ne le t plus endurere those strange oppressions of the Pope and Pro∣visors. So that the Parliament of 24 H. 8. after great debate and consi∣deration, and a diligent search and inspection of the Antient Records of the Kingdom, did ground their Statute amongst others, upon these great Authorities; the Sta∣tute saith, Whereas the King his most no∣ble Progenitors, and the Nobility and Commons of the said Realm, at divers and sundry Parliaments, as well in the time of King Edw. 1. . 3. R. 2. H. 4. and other noble  of this Realm, made sun∣d Ors, Laws, Statutes, and p, for the entire and sure tion of the Preroga∣tive, Lib, and preheminen∣c of th  Imperial Crown of
this Realm, and of the Jurisdicti∣on Spiritual and Temporal of the same; to keep it from the annoy∣ance; as well of the See of Rome, as from the authority of other Fo∣reign Potentates, attempting the diminution and violation thereof, as often and from time to time, as any such annoyance or attempt might be known or espied. Pul∣ton's Stat. 24 H. 8. c. 12. But to conclude the point of the Various Lections, Certainly the dif∣ferent and great variety of words and phrases, by which both the an∣tient Historians and Records have in their several Ages and Times, expressed and denoted the Commu∣nia Concilia Regni, or Parliaments, as now called, and their constituent parts, being not well observed and considered by most of our late English Authors (who understood them as if they had signified what
afterwards they did, and now do) have imposed on our Histori∣cal Faiths, and propagated to po∣sterity many palpable and gross errors, whereby great and unkind clashings and diversities of opini∣ons, as well amongst learned men as others, have had their source and spring, nay, even between Prince and People.
THE General Conclusion. MY only aim and endeavour in this Discourse hath been from publick Records, private Ma∣nuscripts, and the best Historians, to search out and discover truth, and to assert the just honour of our worthy and famous Ancestors Com∣moners of England (as now phrased) great maintainers of the interest and dignity of the King and Kingdom; and with submission to better Judgment, I hope I have plainly proved, 1. That the Freemen or Commons of England were an essential and constituent part of the Saxon Wit∣tena Gemott, or Parliament.
2. That they so continued in the times of W. 1. W. 2. and H. 1. which last being an Englishman, by way of Charter restored and confirmed the Laws of Edward the Confessor, as his Father William 1. as well by his Magna Charta, or Great Charter, as by his Oaths had be∣fore done, both when he was Crowned, and also at Berkham∣stead, in the seventh Year of his Reign. 3. And though the Rolls of Parliament, in the succeeding Kings Reigns till E. 2. be lost, or not found, so as we are at a loss as to the several Orders of Parliament, yet by what has been deduced from other Records before cited, it is evident I conceive, that the Citizens and Burgesses were a part of the Parliament, Anno 16. of King John, and so had not their
beginning by rebellion, Anno 49 H. 3. And therefore I may with good reason and warranty conclude, That our Ancestors, the Commons of England, the Knights, Gentlemen, Freeholders, Citizens and Burgesses of a great and mighty Nation, were very far from being in former times such Vassals and Slaves, or so abject, poor and inconsiderable, as the absurd and malitious ignorance and falsities of late Writers have been pleased to make and represent them, especially the Author of the Grand Freeholders Iquest, and Mr. James Howel, as if they were only Beasts of carriage and burden, or∣dained to be taxed and tllied, and have their Lives, Estates, and Liberties given away and disposed of without their own assents, under a novel opinion and conceit, that
they were no part of the Commune Concilium Regni, or Parliament, be∣fore 49 H. 3. Perlege quae Regni clarissima Conci∣liorum Sunt Monumenta, aliter nil praeter som∣nia cernis.
Appendix. AFter I had compleated the foregoing Arguments, a mate∣rial Objection was by some of my Friends offered me, which, if not cleared in this discourse, might, in their judgment, give a colour and pretence for a belief of an Opini∣on, which is this: That the Commons, or people of Objection. England, were from the time of the Norman Conquest represented by such as held of th K  Capite, until 49 H. 3. and  by two
for each County, and certain Bur∣gesses for several Burroughs, and Barons for the Cinque Ports. Having before laid down a clear Solution. and plain distinction between Barones Regis and Barones Regni, I shall there∣fore now distinguish upon the phrase Milites & libere enenes. 1. Milites & libere tenntes qui de Distinction. Rege tenent in Capite. 2. Milites & libere tenentes de Regno. Distinction. The first Distinction I thus prove, Rot. Pal. 2. Johannis m. 9. Rex dilecis 1.

As to the second Distinction, The  ancient Chronicles of the Kingdom say, That both before and after the Conq (as we phrase it) the Kings of England held their Court three times in every year, at Easter, Whisonide, and Christ∣mas, and then the Crown was attended with most of those qui de Rege  in Capite, this was called ria Regis; if any difference of right did arise be∣tween the King and his Tenants, o between Tenant and Tenant, here it was heard and determined, and many things were there acted and done in relation to the Kings  or Tenants, but under favour this was not the Com∣mune Concilium, Regni or Parliam as we now call it, for the King held this Court ex more of , as Simon D∣netmensis—and  igor∣niensis write in vita  Primi. But when they, and contemporary Historians, take noice of the meeting of the Commune Concilium, Regni or Parliament, then their expressions
and say, That Rex asivit Orderieus vita∣lis, pag. 680. Exprecepto Regis convenerunt. Eadmerus Rex Sanctione sua adunavit, Flor. Wigorn. Continuat, and many such like expressions, which shew it was not held ex more of custom, yet true it is, Kings did often convene or summon the Common Council of the Kingdom at one of the said Feasts, being a great conveni∣ency to the Tenants in Capite. But they summoned the General Council also at other times, according to the Emergency of Affairs, examples of which are obvious in the ancient Histo∣rians. Now to shew that the Milites tenentes qui de Rege tenuerunt in Capite, (toge∣ther with the other great Lords that held of the King) were not the partes con∣stituntes, and alone did compose and make up the , the whole body of the General, or Commune Concilium, Regni or Parliament. I will begin with a Statute or Act of Parliament made tempore Richard the First, who Reigned before King John, Father to H. 3. and 74 years before 49 H. 3. the Assize or . Statute being made per Assensum & Con∣silium Archiepiscoporum, & Episcoporum, & Abbatum Comitum, & Baronum,

Certainly the words Fideles Angli
cannot be understood to be restrained to the Tenants in Capite only. The Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors, & Mgnates Regni gave an Auxi∣lium Rot.

Anno 2 H. 3. Magna Charta was in Parliament granted and confirmd, an ancient Transcript of which, writ in the time of E. 1. I have, and conceive that those who then gave a Subsidy of a Fifteenth to the Crown were the parts that compounded and made the Com∣munc
Concilium, Regni or Parliament, and who they were let the Charter speak. Proac autem donatione, & con∣cessione M. S. penes Do∣minum Samue∣lem Baldwin serientem Do∣mini Regis ad Legem. M.

The Charters I shall pass over, only with this former Observation, that I conceive those that gave the Subsidy were the members of that Parliament, and who they were will appear by the Inspeximus of the Great Charter, and the Charter of the Forest inrolled in the Statute Roll, 25 E. 1. viz.

Teste 10 Octo∣bris. To deny therefore that the Knights and Freeholders de Regno of England were a constituent part of the Com∣mune Concilium, or Parliament, in 2 & 9 H. 3. but were represented by the Tenants in Capite. A man may with equal Reasons, and as strong Authorities argue and affirm, that though the Re∣cords plainly declare the Enumeratio partium of those great Councels, and the Comites & Barones to be one part then present, and that they gave a Subsidy concurrent with the other parts, yet really, 1. They were not there nor joined in the Tax, but were repre∣sented by the Milites and libere tenen∣tes de Regno. 2dly, Though the Comites, Barones, Milites, & libere Tenen∣tes de Regno are expresly and particular∣ly mentioned in these grand Charters, yet in truth they were not present at those great Councils, but their Votes
and Power were included, and they represented in and by omnes Archiepis∣copi, Episcopi, Abbates, & Priores de Regno, (though the greater number of the two latter held not of the King in Capite,) who made Laws, and gave Taxes exclusis or omissis Comitibus Baro∣nibus Militibus, & libere tenentibus de Regno. Or 3dly, Notwithstanding the naming of the Prelates of the Church, yet their Power, Vote, and Authority was transferred and made over to the Earls, Barons, Knights and Freeholders of the Kingdom, and their appearance there was not Personal, but by Representation, which no man certainly can believe. I shall close up this Point with a Inter Communi de Termino S. Hillary 17 E. 3. Recorda pe∣nes Rememorato∣rem Domini Re∣gis in Scacca∣rio. Warr. de Priere de Coventr. at∣tach. pro trans∣gressione. memorable Record which I happily found in the Exchequer de Anno 17 E. 3. The Prior of Coventry was attached to answer to the King de servitio octo seodorum Militum per ipsum Priorem & Predecessores suos Regi, & Progenitori∣bus suis ab Anno 29. Domini Regis H. proavi ipsius Regis nune substracto & con∣celato. The Prior appears per Henricum de Stretford, whereupon the Barons Or∣der a search of the Rolls and Memoranda of the Exchequer, and thereupon it was
found in the Roll of 29 H. 3. sub Titulo de Auxilio ad primogenitam filiam Re∣gis maritandam, That the Prior stood charged with Ten pounds for ten Knights sees, and in the great Roll 32. of the King Titulato Auxilium Episco∣porum Abatum, Prorum conessam ad sororem Regis maritandam Frederio Imperatori, the Prior stood charged de viginti marcis, &c. To this the Prior pleads, Quod ipse & Predecessores sui tenuerunt omnia terras & tenementa sua per servitium duorum seodorum Militum antum & quod Dominus Rex, seu Pro∣gen  de aliquibus aliis seritiis per   , seu Predecessores suos nun∣   Per  , seu servici∣    factum     per Memoranda hujus Scac∣carii,   inde serutinium, &c.  quoad oc quod compertum est ic in Ro∣tulis &c. Quod tempore dicti Rs Henric Tr computatum fuit de    de auxiliis eidem Reg Henrico ad ilium suum ilitem faci∣endum & sororem suam maritandam conc. Hoc i non pr in  parte. Diit enim quod Auilia illa non ,   pssunt sse    subsidia per ,
& Communitatem Regni spontanea, & mera voluntate Regi concessa, & tam de teuentibus alio, quam de tenentibus de Domino Rege in Ca∣pite levanda quo pretetu dictus Compo∣tus de auxiliis praedictis fuit tam pro feodis tenentium, tune Prioris loci prae∣dicti quam pro feodis ipsius Prioris pro∣priis, quod idem Prior dicit posse liquere Curiae per Certificationem tune Prioris loci praedicti tune Baronibus de S∣cario. From this Record I shall make these Observations: 1. That the Crown could not de ju require any serviia from the Subject, but those that were deita, omnes qui de Rege tenent per servicium militare, (and none else,) Regi faciant anxilium ad primogenitam siliam maritandam, saith the King, Rot. Pat. 29 H. 3. m. 7. dorso, and so said the Law long before. Sunt Bracton,  cap. 1. sol. . eiam quaedam Communes praestationes qu servitia non dicuntur, nec de contudine veniunt, &c. sicut sunt Hidagia, Corra∣gia, & Carvagia, & alia plura de neces∣sitate & ex consensu Communi totius Regni introducta & quae ad Dominum di non pertinent.
2. There is a difference appears be∣tween Servitia and Auxilia: The Law Rex Angliae neque per se aut Ministros suos subsidia, aut alia quaevis onera imponit Ligeis suis sie assensu totis Regni sui in Parliamento suo expresso. For∣tescue de La∣dibus Legum Angliae, cap. 36. pa. 84. allows therefore the Priors plea, when he says, That those extraordinary Aides were not Servitia but Auxilia, granted to the Crown per Magnates & Commu∣nitatem Regni spontanea & mera volun∣tate, or as Bracton before cited, Consen∣s communi totius Regni. 3. Those Aides were given tam de tenentibus aliorum quam de tenentibus de Domino Rege in Capite levanda, quo praetexta dictus Compotus de Auxiliis praedictis were as well for the Fees of the Tenants of the then Prior, as for the Fees of the Prior himself, which the Prior said would clearly appear to the Court by the Certificate of the Prior, his Prodecssor, in the time of H. 3. made to the Barons of the Exchequer, so that the Tenants of the Prior did grant an Aid as well as the Prior himself, and that in Parliament, for as I have observed before, Rot. Claus. 32 H. 3. m. 13. doro, there was a Parliament then held. 4. That in the Reign of H. 3. and preceding times, when the Knights and Freeholders, who held not of the King, but other Lords, did in the Commune
Concilium or Parliament, gra  Au∣lium or Aid to the Crown, the great Lord or Baron of the Fee, of who the Freeholders held, was  in the Exchequer to answer for  thereof, under the title of his , as the Bishop of every ,  till Queen Elizabeth's time, was by Law chargeable for the coll, of  granted by the Clergy within his Do∣cess, yet certainly as the Bishop   any power to give for, or tax his ; no more could or did any great Lord of the Fither jure t, or  ttionis, charge or give away the  of his free T, who were indepen∣dent in     solummodo ; this P not well observed and understood  late Authors, has caused the  about the T , represent∣ing the  in Parliament. 5.
held of the King in Capite, yet very considerable in number, and all the Citizens and Burgesses should, till 49 H. 3. either be totally excluded from be∣ing any part of the Generale Concilium Regni or Parliament, or else by a Law, of which there is not the least foot∣steps in History or Law, were for so many Ages to be represented by the Tenants in Capite only in Parliament, the transcendent Power of which Coun∣cil in Conjunction with the King as Head thereof Sir Thomas Smith, that great and learned man, who was Secre∣tary and Privy-Councellor to our famous Queen, an old Parliament-man, when he comes to write of the Parliament, and its largeness of Power, says thus, In Comitiis Parliamentariis posita est  . & Ainistratio∣ne Arglorum, Tho. Smith, . 2. cap. 2. . 50. 51. omnis Augustae absolutae que potestatis vis, quippe quemadmodum Robur & virtus Angliae dieuntur in Acie residere Parlia∣mentaria Comitia veteres leges jubent esse irritas, novas indueunt, praesentibus juxta ac futuris modum constituunt, jura & possesiones hominum privatorum commu∣tant, spurios Natalibus restituunt, Cultum divinum sanctioribus corroborant, pondera & mensuras variant—incerti juris con∣treveras dirimunt, ubi nihil lege cautum
fuit, censum agunt, Capitationes & vecti∣galia indicunt, delictorum gratiam faci∣unt, afflictas & Majorum sceleribus per∣ditas familias erigunt, vitae nisque potestatem in cos obtinent quos ad hujus∣modi disquisitiones Princeps advocaverat, atque ut concludam breviter, quiquid in Centuriatis Comitiis, aut in Tribunitiis Populus Romanus efficere potuisset,  omne in Comitiis Anglicanis tanquam in Coetu Principem populumque represent ante commode transigitur. Interesse enim in illo conventu omnes intelligimur uju∣cunque amplitudinis status aut dignitatis Princepsve aut Plebs fuerit, sive per se ipsum hoc fiat, five per procuratorem, nam omnibus peraeque, gratum esse oportet qu∣quid ex Senatusconsulto Parliamentario profectum est. 6. It is observable, that the Pre∣scription of Progenitores Regis, in the Record of the Prior of Coventry tem∣pore E. 3. did expresly extend to the Reign of H. 3. his great Grandfather It  were needful, I could give numbers of Records, that prove the  tention of sh Pre∣scription high∣. and higher too, so that I had good au∣thority and warrant to say before, that, when the Burgesses of St. Albans, in the Parliament 8 E. 2. affirmed, That they and their Predecessors sicu caeteri Bur∣genses de Regno, as the rest of the Bur∣gesses
of the Kingdom had totis retro∣actis temporibus, in all times past, in the time of F. 1. & Pregenitorum suorum, and of His Progenitors, sent Two Bur∣gesses to every Parliament, they had, as well as other Boroughs of England sent Burgesses to the Generale Corailium, or Parliament before mentioned, in the 17th year of King John, Grandfather to E. 1. at least, and so by clear evi∣dence before 49 H. 3. From the aforesaid Authorities and Reasons, we may with good conse∣quence conclude. 1. That the People or Commons of England, from the time of the Norman Conquest, till 49 H. 3. were not represented in the Com∣mune Concilium, Regni or Parlia∣mnt, by such only as held of the King in Cape. 2. And that the Commons or People   in to be represented by Knights, Citizens, Burgesses, and Barons of the Cinque Ports in the said 40 H. 3. And now I shall subjoin some mate∣rial Records relating to my former Discour.

Communia de Termino Penes Rememo∣rator. Domini Regis in Scacc'. Sancti Hillarii Anno xvii E. 3. Recorda. PRior de Coventr̄ attachiatus fuit Warr. de Pri∣ore de Coventr. attach. pro transgressione. Vide pa. 34. ad rendend Domino Regi de servicio cto feodorum militum per ipsum Priorem & Praedecessores suos Regi & Progenitoribus suis ab Anno 29. Domini Regis H. Proavi ipsius Regis nunc substracto & concelato Et ipse Prior per Henricum de Stretford Attorn̄ suum venit. Et super hoc quia Barones plene volunt informari pro Rege per Rotulos & Memoranda Sacc̄ii de quibusdam negotium prae∣dictum tangentibus antequam &c. Datus est dies eidem Priori hic ex assensu Willielmi de Thorpe servientis Regis a die Pasche in quindecim dies eo statu, &c. Ad quem diem Prior venit Et quia nondum plene scrutinium, &c. Datus est dies eidem Priori ex prae∣fixione
Cur̄ in Octabas Sanctae Trini∣tatis eo statu, &c. Et interim facto scrutinio Rotulorum &c. Compertum est in Rotulo 29. Regis Henrici Tertii sub titulo De Auxilio ad primogeni∣tam filiam Regis maritandam videlicet de quolibet scuto xx s. contineri sic Prior de Coventr̄ reddit compotum de decem libris de decem feodis de quibus quidem decem libris Willielmus Trussell Uicecomes dicti Comitatus in Compota suo de Anno 32. ipsius Regis Henrici oneratus fuit inter alia debita quae debebat in fine ejusdem Compoti sicut continetur in magno Rotulo de eodem Anno 32. & in rotulo 31. ejusdem Re∣gis Henrici compertum est etiam in quodam Rotulo Compotorum titulato Auxilium Episcoporum Abbatum Prio∣rum concessum ad sororem Regis Hen∣rici maritandam Fredirico Imperatori videlicet de quolibet scuto duas marcas contineri in hunc modum Prior de Coventr̄ reddit compotum de viginti marcis de eodem. In Thesaurario octo marcas Et debet duodecim marcas de quibus respondet in Warr̄ in Ro∣tulo 34. Et in eodem rotulo 34. requi∣rebantur de ipso Priore quindecim marcae de auxilio ad transfretationem
Regis in Vasconiam & duodecim mar∣cae de auxilio ad sororem Regis mari∣tand. De quibus quidem duobus debitis Idem Prior postmodum Regi satisfecit sicut continetur in rotulis annalibus de annis 36. 39. & 40. dicti Regis Henrici Tertii. Item compet∣tum est in rotulo de servicio Regis Edwardi filii Regis Henrici Summo∣ni apud Rothelan die dominica in crastino Sancti Petri ad vincula Anno Regni sui decimo contra Lewelinum filfum Griffini & David fratrem ejus & alios Walenses quod Prior de Co∣ventr̄ recogn̄ servicium duorum feo∣dorum Militum pro quo finem fecit Et in rotulo de finibus factis pro ser∣viciis Scotiae Anno ejusdem Regis Edwardi tricesimo primo annotatur quod Prior & Conventus de Coventr̄ recognoverunt servicium duorum feo∣dorum militum & finem fccerunt per quadraginta libras Et in Rotulo de finibus pro serviciis Scociae Anno 34. ejusdem Regis Edwardi filii Regis continetur quod Prior de Coventr̄ per fratrem Johannem Holeweye Commo∣nachum & Attornatum suum recogno∣vit servicium duorum feodorum Mi∣litum & finem fecit pro eodem per
quadraginta marcas. Et inter fines factos in Scaccario coram tenente locum. Thesaurarii & Baronibus pro serviciis Regi debitis in exercitu Sco∣ciae Anno Regis Edwardi filii Regis Edwardi septimo videlicet pro servicio unius feodi viginti marcas continetur quod Willielmus Herle & Robertus de Leicestr̄ finem fecerunt cum Rege pro Priore de Coventr̄ pro servicio duorum feodorum militum per quadraginta marcas. Et praedictus Prior ad prae∣dictas octabas Trinitatis venit ut prius per Attornatum suum praedictum Et Willelmus de Thorp, & Johannes de Stoford Servientes Regis veniunt pro Rege. Et super hoc expositis prae∣sato Priori hiis quae per scrutinium Rotusorum inveniuntur ut supra & per ipsum Priorem auditis & intellectis isdem servientes Regis petunt quod idem Prior super hoc respondeat, &c. Et praedictus Prior dicit quod ipse &   praedecessores sui tenuerunt mnia ter∣ras & tenementa sua tam videlicet ea quae habet in dominico quam in servicio per servicium duorum feodorum mili∣tum tantum. Et quod Dominus Rex seu Progenitores sin de aliquibus aliis serviciis per ipsum Priorem seu
Praedecessores suos nunquam seisiti fue∣runt per finem feu servicium per cor∣pora hominum factum quod liquere poterit per Memoranda hujus Scac∣carii si fiat inde scrutinium, &c. Et quoad hoc quod compertum est hic in rotulis, &c. Quod tempore dicti Regis Henrici tertii computatum fuit de cer∣tis pecuniae summis de auxiliis eidem Regi Henrico ad filium suum Militem faciendum & sororem suam maritan∣dam concessis. Hoc ei non praejudi∣cat in hac parte. Dicit enim quod Auxilia illa non fuerunt nec censeri possunt esse servicia immo quaedam subsidia per Magnates & Communitatem Regni spontanea & mera voluntate Regi concessa & tam de tenentibus alio∣rum quam de tenentibus de Domino Rege in Capite levanda quo praetextu dictus compotus de auxiliis praedictis fuit tam pro feodis tenentium tunc Prioris loci praedicti quam pro feodis ipsius Prioris propriis, quod idem Prior dicit posse liquere Curiae per Certificationem tunc Prioris loci prae∣dicti tunc Baronibus de Scaccario de mandato Regis Henrici factam de feodis quae ipse tunc Prior tenuit de veteri feoffamento & de novo super
quo certificatum fuit quod feoda quae dictus tunc Prior tenuit in Dominico & feoda quae tenentes sui de ipso tenu∣erunt fuerunt in toto decem feoda, &c. Et petit judicium desicut ipse tenet omnia terras & tenementa sua per ser∣vicium duorum feodor̄ Militum tan∣tum, nec sit compertum hic penes Scaccarium quod Dominus Rex seu Progenitores sui de aliquibus aliis seu plutibus serviciis per manus dicti Pri∣oris seu Predecessorum suorum unquam seisiti fuerunt si ipse de aliquo feodo seu hujusmodi servicio concelato impetiri seu calumpnari debet in hac parte. Et super hoc quia dicti servientes Regis volunt super responso suo deli∣berare, &c. datus est dies eidem Pri∣ori hic in octabas Santi Hillarii ea statu, &c. Ad quem diem praedictus Prior venit & ob eandem causam qua prius datus est ei dies ulterior hic a die Pasche in quindecim dies eodem statu quo prius. Ad quem diem idem Prior venit & ob dictam causam adjor∣natur ulterius usque quindenam Sanctae Trinitatis eo statu, &c. ad quem diem ven̄ & datus est ei dies ulterius usque octabas Sancti Michaelis anno viz. decimo nono Regis hujus ea
FINIS.
