For this hes bene ane daylie pra∣ctise and an old custome at all tymes be thame obseruit, quha with grit trauel & eirnest diligence hes profited in letters: that quhensoeuer at any tyme thay ar myndit to commit their lau∣bours vnto licht, they do harbour them vnder the countenāce & couer thē vnder the autority of sum noble personage. mouit theirto be dyuers considerations, pairtly to procure sum de∣fence and protectioun to thair works: Pairtly to purches sum commendatioun to them selfis.

¶THE PREFACE TO THE READER Being compelled to leaue france, be ye cruel persuit of papists after my arryuing to this Countrey, thair did cum into my hāds an letter derected to our Ministers, replenished wt calūnies quhilk quhan thay had perused, thay thocht it expedient that I suld answer thairto, for that the argument of that letter did concerne my selfe. I not willing to deny thair requeist, quhom in euerie way I suld reuerence: and being mair cairfull to satis¦fie thair desire, then affrayit of vther menis reports, haue vnder takin that quhilk I haue done. Bot that ʒow may vnderstand with quhat ordour we haue procedit in this apologie. Ʒe sall knaw that we haue in his ca∣lumnious letter sum things as being maist false, suppressit with silēce: vther things as hauing sum probabilitie, bot ʒit na treuth we haue so confuted yt nothing remanis quhairin this Godles Apostat may iustifie him selfe against me, or falslie alledge for farder defence. And seing that with his calumnious letter thair ar certen erroneous propositions conioynit. I haue refellit thē be this method. In placing first his propositioun, to the quhilk derectly I oppone a contrair plat, thairefter I do come to the probations of his propositions, quhilks are ather for the maist pairt impertinently brocht furth of the scripteurs, or falsly wra¦stit out of the docteurs Lykewayis I haue adducit the citation of the autorities as he hes placit them, that his errour & igno∣rance may the mair appeir. In end I conclude confirming my awin plat. Now thairfor freindly Reader I beseik ʒow effecteously that ʒe wald not miscontrew my guid mening nor mislyke my labours heirin, bot to accept them in guid pairt. I craue for my dily∣gence bot a freindlie acceptance of ʒour courtesy ʒe can geue me na lesse. I confes in deid yt an Scoller of tender ʒeirs, of waik discretiō of raw iudgemnt, of small countenance, and litil vnderstanding can not pyke mekill praise for his trauel. Bot gud mettels ar not to be misly kit, thocht they be takin out
from the dustie earth. The things quhilks I haue weill spokkin ar not to be reiectit althocht I want an exteriour grauite. If any for my newnes thinks worser of me thē I was willīg to deserue & if yair be sum yt for my youth wil contem me, & ʒit thay not being ignorant that nemo repente summus extitit. I am content (thay being abusit ather by malice in detracting, or by lake of discretioun in discerning) to abyde thair censeur. Bot as manye things cums to passe contrair the houp and beyond the expect¦atioun of man, so it may happin heirin against my feare. My aduersar steared vp with enragit affectioun, & be the malicious mynds of vthers, thocht to bereaue me of my lyf, bot prased be God the successe was better. Through his calumnious & maist sclanderous wryting, he purposed to haue drownit me in per∣petual ignominie: Bot it hes fallin out vther ways. The mair yat his malice appeareth: my honour farder (Louit be the Lord) is aduancit. For as he that straik IASON on the stomak thin king to slay him, brak his impostume with the straik, quhairby he recouered his helth: euin sa it hes hapnit with my aduersare▪ His horrible cruelty & detestabil wickednes hes purchest me no small commtdatioun. ANTISTHENES sentence cums weil into mynd, for he said that al persons had ather great ne∣cessitie of good freinds or enuyous enemies: for freindis in ad∣monishing, and enemies in blaming, ar the cause that men with¦drawe them from vice. And suirlye in my awin persoun I haue found this prouerb trew, Virescit vulnere virtus. For had not the occasion bene offred be this apostat peraduenteur I had not profited sa veil in this studie, nor bene sa weill occupyit in this subiect, nather had I procurit sa grit praise of sum, as he is dishonorit of all. Bot I knawe yt he was desyrous that his fame micht be spred, and name knawin in doing euil. as HEROSTRATVS in burning the Tem∣ple of DIANA. And ʒit it may fair with him, as with TRSIMAHVS, baith to be put to shame & silence.

❧ ANE ANSWER ❧ VNTO THE EPISTLE. IT is a saying na les commoun then commonly prouit trew: he quha passes the bounds of schamefastnes, and brekes the borders of modestie, may euer afterwart laufully be impudēt. For the nature of vngodly men, be raschful temeritie and insupportabill audacitie, destitute of the feare of God, not retening in thair actions their ho∣nestie or iust measure, but willingly despysing reasoun, searches vi∣tious extrimities, quhairby they endeuoir tha me selues not only to put to executioun be violent force, all vice and beastly crueltye, Quhilk ather yairto be peruerse mens counsal are persuadit, or be thair awin cankred effectionis preassit, not also fostering their foo∣lishe foly with yair furious fantesies, employes yair haill power, tra∣uel & diligence, calumniously to selander, & sclanderously to blas∣pheme partly thame, aganist quhome iniustly sic violent beastli∣nes yai haif wrocht, partly vthers be ye lyke schameles impudencie to quhome sic outragious mischeif, & inhumane cruelty, iustly is dis¦plesant. quhilk of lait be example mair nor manifest is ratiseit, And in experience be an vngodlie apostat, an filthy & impure pest of mā confirmit. Sua it is (louing Reader) I being in Paris inhumanlie inuadit, & be this bouchour (with vthairs accumpaneit) cruelly persecut, quhisk vnto yame, quha did behald sic outragious dealing gaue ane large mater of sorrow: & to vthair godly men in Scotland, an ampill occasion of grit grit greif, quhairof freindly being admo∣nishit, & be sum sharpely reprouit, despysing ye ane, & contemning ye vthair, reiecting all admonitions quhairby to repentāce he micht bene brocht, now laitly agane his euil wil not being changit, nor h malicious mynd appaisit be a doggishe rage & enraged dispite, as for his last dispair geuin a fairweil to al godlines & honestie, nocht on∣ly my fame & honour (quhilk I micht sufferit with pacience) bot Gods seruants blasphemously is defamit, & his trew religioun sacri¦legiously impugnit.
This euidentlie may apeir by his treatise in notabil act of apostasy & ye maist calumnious that euer was ▪ the iniurious superscriptiō quhairof gaue me not samekil the occasioun of lauchter (being mair superstitious nor religious) then the contents yairof ministred vnto me the mater of meruel, quhilk men wald beleif, him for to haue it written be an ardent desyre and zele of veritie, then throuch osten∣tatioun or arrogancy, les nor his vitious life, & vnbridelit behauiour war mair knawin, nor his deuot affectiō manifest. Be ye quhilk proudly puft vp, & arrogantly inspyrit, mair aboundant he is in detrcting nor in honoring: & in defaming mair copious, thē in deuly praysing. Althocht in it nathing he can craue, or iustly to him vendicat yairin That is his, iniuries, Lies, calumnies, periories, and dispytefull inuec∣tiues being exceptit as (rafehe ilars, Seditious doctrene, Vēnom of intoxecat breists, plattring lyis, reuthles Dogs, calūnious Impostures Foolisch, Mischeauous, dangerous Errors, impoysonit breastis, hideous trumpeters of Seditioun, affectionat ministers of Lyes, Rauing headis Abominabill, Damnabill, Detestabill, Condemnabill heresies, Theaues, Reuars, and Stealers) with vyair infinit blasphemous wordis almaist the hail contents of his treatise, vnwordy to be written, & vncumly to be rehearsit, gatherit out of the bordel, quhairin he euer maist hā¦tit, to defame Christis seruants, & to blaspheme his kirk. O iniquitie of tymes O corruptioun of maners! O shameles malice that passis measure! Are thir ye frutes of Philosophie? Is this rauing railing de∣cent for an maister, quhais lyfe sould be ane example of modestie & grauitie, ʒit makes him selfe the mirrour of lyes, the Trumpet of ca∣lumnies, & ye rote of vanitie. shameles Foole, whair doth foly force thee yat thou sould be so immoderat in displaying filthely ye force of thy venomful toung? miserabil ar tha Discipillis (monstrous heid) quha by thee are reuled & instructed, for quhar may thay els learne of the yan yat quhilk yai heare? or how canst thou instruct yame ver∣teously, quha fa vitiously dois lyue? bot quhair honesty can haue na suey: modestie can haue na strenth. This thy writing ye vmbre & shaddow of thy actionis is voyd of wit, and thy railing without res∣un, yat gif be iudgement punishment sould be decernit, with tor∣ments rather thou art to be confoundit, then wt argumēts confuted.
Treuth it is indeid that from all replying my  did mekil abhorre, willing to quenche ye remembrance of sa immoderit iniuries, be for¦getfulnes, and to burie ye memorie of sa grit offences be obliuioun. ʒit les, nor throuch my silence, his lyes perhappis sould haue sic ad∣uantage of ye treuth, yat, yat quhilk maliciously be writ and deade in effect be hes performit, as rycht sould be receauit. I am forced to enter in defence, to satesfie be iuste report thais quhais heartis are not preocupat be his false narratioun, nor myndes preuentit be his feinʒeid falshoode. How hard & difficil a thing it is vnto yame, quha be ye singulare mercy of yair God, hes engrauft in yair harts, an detestatioun of er¦roneus doctrine, & superstitious idolatrie, quyetly, wtout dissembling grit cummer & perrelous danger, to remaine in Paris ye tresonabill treasons, ye bloody massacars, the vnnaturall slauchters, & horribill murders yair cōmittit wil testifie, & ma ages yan yis wil beir record. for Satan wt sic cruel rage, hes swa enragit & enflamit his seruantis aganist ye members of Christ, yat nayer yair vntowardenes can be assuagit by ye feare of Gods punishments, nor malicious mindes re∣pressit, be his fearfull threatnings, nor yair wickednes coolit be his terribill iudgements, ʒea yair vngodlynes hes sa far increassit, yat ye hope of saluatioun can not alure yame from it, for sa grit hes bene yair vnbridelit feruēcie to pleis yair maister, & sa lytil yair thocht∣les cair to pleis our God. Sa vehement hes bene yair thrist efter ye blood of Christs people, and ʒit not quenchit: sa grit is yair drouth, but ʒit neuer slokned: seing yat dayly ye deuill mouis ye myndes of his awin to all horrible impietie, and ye harts of sic wood tygers to commit al wyld cruelty. Paris, Rouen, Tholouse, Orleane, Burdeaux wt vyair innumerabill Touns in France, may (allace) serue for ouer∣certane proofe in yis mater, & my selfe for a witnesse. Sua ye case is (gentill Reader) & so ye mater standeth. That feruent zeale in professing Christs Euangel, & contemption of Idolatrie, quhair wt God of his mercy from my ʒoutheid endeued me, procurit aganis me ye enuy, & indignation of idolatrous Papists quha perceuing yat nather yair friuole arguments, nor alluring pro∣meissis, micht peswade me to abiure Christes trewe religioun, and
embrace yair feinʒeit fantasyes, & forgit inuentions, tooke at lenth counsall to follow yair accustomit course, and in place of christiane admonitioun to lat me fele sic stripes, as of their foirfathers the peo∣ple of God rasauit of before, quha seikand the occasioun how vnder pretence of particularities they micht coulour thair cruelty, & couer thair hatred kendled against me for the cause of religion, The whis∣perings wherof not being vnto me secreit, nather the takins obscure, I auoidit warly, & from sic maters willingly absteanit, as might haue mouit thame to execute yair enterprise. quhairthrouch thair rage be¦ing for a space deserrit mair then degestit, at last an Hammiltoun (a modest man) be sum Scottis papeists cōmandit, & be others requei∣stit, following yair aduise to accomplish thair desire, & persewing his awin determinatioun to execute his tyranie, be thir monis fulfillit it. To my Lord ARBROITH maister IOHNE HAY a Iesuist pre¦sented an buik composed be him contening certaine questions pro∣ponit to our ministers, I entring in my Lords Chalmer (quhairin al∣so this apostat was present) raceauit of maister Iohne Hay another likwise, and sum of the articles thairof being disputed betuix vs, and be him mair querrelously discussit nor modestly rasonit, We fel after this prolixt disputatioun, into that article quhairby the autour of the Buik affermes the making of Images not to be contrair vnto the cōmand of God. my Lord (mouit be ane constant zele of religioun) re∣plyit, that not onely it was derectly against the cōmand of God, but also the making of them was expresly contrair his Maiestie, he sophi¦stically be a vaine distinctioun of representatioun & adoratioun, con¦fuslie confounding altogether, eludit Gods cōmandiment. My Lord desiring me to ansuer: be a familiar argumēt I insistit in the contrair. that cumming from S. Germains port, I did sie blind men praying  reuerent prostratioun of thair bodeis, & discouerit headis vnto the Image thair placeit. And thairfoir bene inforcit freindlye to demand of him, I did require if any thing could be represented to the blind men? na thing, in respect that nather the sensles Image did thame behald, before quhilk thay war prostrat, nather thair eies be∣ing blinde & destitute of sight, could regard it. Restis then yt quhilk conueniently of this argument insewis, that this thair actioun can
not be cailit representatioun, bot adoratioun & worshipping, expres¦ly & derectly contrair to the command. My Lord glaidly conside¦rit the force of the argument, & seing thairby our blind rabbi, so sud¦denly ouercome, that to vex his lordship with farther disputation he micht not, nather be ausuer to molest me, courteously raisout of his Chyre, and as I had triumphit, embraced me: quhairat our maister a∣postat hauelie commouit, & raging within him selfe, immediatly cam running from the otherside of the Chalmer, desiring me againe to re∣ceit my argument. I in place of praise & victorie, desiring only the treuth to haif place, fulfillit his desire, he then in this priuie confer∣ence, thinking that he might boldly iniury me, nane being present to beir record yair to, na vther wise answerit to the consequence (thē away damnable heretique, I sal pluk ʒour Luggs, I sal ding out ʒour harnes,) to ye quhilk brauling quyetlie I replyit, that he wald offend in performing his promises, nather wald I with pacience suffer sie bragful bosting if he alane wald discharge him self of the same. This querrulous conference thus being endit, I taking my leaue of the cō¦panie, departit. And thair efter did conuene with him, and as he cou¦artlie performit, that quhilk with baldnes he promised: I on ye vther part sumquhat commouit tuik leue at my awin hand of acquentance to visite his eare. Quhairof our countrey men (I mene thais yat ather wilfully hes abiurit thair Faith, or be a blind zeale impugnis the fa∣ming) being aduertised, & grittumlie reioysing, that heirby occasi∣on commodiously was offred, to performe that quhilk befoir was de¦uisit, neglectit a tyme, bot thair hail wittis spedely imploiit, to cause this apostat to put thair counsel to execution. To yat end diuers con¦uentionis wer halden, declaring how I contemnit thair religioun, & micht not by ony moyen persuade me to embrace it. And how they micht peraduenture brokin my Lord Arbroith of his constancie, & sindrie times easily persuadit him to their faction, if yat I had not by insisting in the contrair withstand thair purposis, and to agrauat the caus, & to mak me ye mair odius, yai forgit infinit leis & fals accusati¦ons aganist me. Finaly to persuade this burrio to tak the mater in hād thai laid befoir his eies how grittumly al Catholikkis suld be obleist vnto him, & how far his auin name yairby sould be aduancit.
Bot it was not hard to consel hī, quha in ye mater was redier to obey then yai ayer to cōmand or requeist: quhair of he gaue euident signes in quhatsūeuer he come in, of ye quhilk I not being ignorant, & thin¦king yt Dogs rather barquet throuch custōe thē throch cruelty mair of vse than of wildnes, secuirly I contemnit his brauling & lichtlye regardit his boosting, seing gif yat querrell war to be debaitit (In ye quhilk al men if occasion requyre, sould spend yair lyues) or yat controuersy decydit, betuixt me & him onlye, ayer be disputatioun or vthar extraordinar meanes: nather suld he find me fant in ye last, nor sluggishe in ye former. Neueryeles his malice encressing, diuers times be deceat he awaitit on me, accompaneit wt a grit number of young men, of ye quhllk sum gentil men hauing knawlege, socht ye way to stay his enterprise (wisely considering yat it was easy to him with grit force to ouercome me in Paris, quhilk in frier places and alane had perhappis not bene so facill) & purchessit ten dayis absti∣nence, ʒit he obseruing the reul approuit amongs yame, yat na Faith sould be kepit vnto yame quhome yai esteme as heretiques. The thrid day after quhilk was ye 18 day of Marche. 1580. I not weil instructed in yat point, yat mistrust was ye Mother of Securitie, sud∣denly was onbeset & at vnwaris inuadit be him & 13 debauchit scol¦lers: quha violenly casting yair hands all wt one preis vpon my body & thrawing me to ye ground, tred me vnder yair feite. The pepill astonyit at sic lawles outrage, be sa mony persounis aganist me alane execute. Demandit Whisperingly, quhat menit sic horribill hādling & cruel demaning of me? quhat was ye occasion yairof? yai esteming yat ye pepill wald haue succourit me to hinder yair helpe, cryit out yat I was a Huguenot, a Heretique, a contemnar of ye Saints & a blas¦phemer of ye virgen Marie. quhairat yai war sa commouit, yat enra∣gitly yai conioynit yair force wt yair fury, presing fordwart euery on to strike me, & to plague me mair yan to release me of my pane. But wald God yis had bene all, quhilk was ouer mekill, or ye rest a lye, quhilk is to monstrous. For yis Butchour wt his accomplices back∣wart trailit me through ye rewes, wt thair feit & edges of thair Muiles batit on my face, with pennerinkhornes & batons vpon my head, to the effusion of my blood in grit quantaty, disfigurating of my visage
& wounding of my bodie. And albeit that from the college of or∣teret throuch the rew d' amandeis be the head of the place Maubert shamefullie thai trailit me, euerie man & woman running from the market places to behald sic a spectakil, ʒit thai neuer desistit in rai∣ing fra iniuries, nor in persewing fra crueltie. For be oppin force they drew me in the colledge of Nauer, & thair shamefullye in the presence of sax hundreth dischargit thair beistlines. Ʒea his cruelty with his complices tyrannie, sa far extendit, yt my breist was na mir sparit nor my bak, my craig nor my face, & beīg by my bluid quhilk fel in my throt, almaist wirried, the power of my bodie rather o∣uercome and strenth tyrit, thē my courage failʒeing, how I dispysit his creueltie sa far as my voyce micht extend. (❀ Composito ad hilaritatem vultu subridens dixi excute excute tyrannidem apostata, corpus habes in hoc saeuito animum tamen inuictumgero, nec me vn quam huius supplicij ob Christi euangelum pudebit.) To compt the sorows quhilk I sustenit, and reakning the pleagues quhilk I re∣ceuit, I am certane wald rather breid an admiratioun, then an beleif. But I mene not (gentle Reders) to offend ʒour guid & modest minds with the rehersall of sic immoderat iniuries, quhose eares I am assu∣red dois glow, and haertis alreddy greuin at that quhilk I haue vterit, And ʒit I knaw that sic horrible and monstrous beistlyncs is hard to be credeit of thame quha knawes not the nature of thir cru∣ell tygers. But the Lord is my witnes befoir quhais iustice sait I most compeir, that in this hail discourse I haif not excedit the bounds of treuth. Nather I think yat anie manis toung is abill to atteine to the hundreth pairt of the particularis, quhilk at that present this poore carcage suffered. I haue lykewise many noble, leirnit, wise, & godly countriemen to beir me recorde heirin. Sic as The Lord of ARBROITH. The Earle of CRAVFVRD, The Maister of MARCHAL, The Lord of LENDORS, and Syr IAMES BALFOVR, quhome I name all to thair grit honour, quhairof for thair courtesie, christian loue, and freindly confort shawin vnto to me in my hauie distres I am cōpellit of deutie to be cairful sa lang as my lyfe sal lest. Quhair foir referring this mater to thair testimonie I will be shorte, seing
they are worthie of credit in a gritter matter nor this alreddy bel∣uit. It is not my purpose cairfully to refell, quhatsoeuar this filthy apostat falsly in his vennemous & godles letter, hes writtin, seing the honorable gentilmen befoir namit haue alredie conuictit him to be a shamful lyer. Now I can not sufficiently meruel how this feinʒit Wose, dar be so bauld as to couer sic cruel dealing with the Gabart of the Rectoris command. Truly if the mater war weil tryit in ye maturinis, he wald be found an vnthankfull suppost to staene the honnour of his chief Magistrar, with sic outragious tyranie. This I am able to proue, how boldly I can not tel, how truelie I knaw, that the executioun of this beistlie fact came soner vnto the Rectors eares: then anie complaint maid aganist me. not geuin at the requeist of this vnnaturall Dog, a vndiscreit Rector wald sa far haue extendit his autoritie, I wald knaw of this impudent lier, quhat coulour the Rector could pretend to sie suddane commands. In maters of Religion he is na ordinar iudge: for sic cases are referrit vnto the court of Parliament, befoir the quhilk willinglie I wald haue comperit, knawing assuredly that be the King his edict of pacificatioun, quhilk sic vnbry delit and debordit Brigans dois contem, and by the cleirnes of my conscience void of crime, I wald esilie bene absoluit: If he wil alledge that in particular iniureis the Rectors autoritie was iustly interponit. ʒit be na Law he can mak it iust to condem a man befoir he be ather hard or sene. As concerning the iniuries quhilk faslie he aledgis to be done vnto him be that maist modest godlie and leirnit man Maister NICOLL DALGLEISCH. in that point he hes als leudly & lounlie lyit, as in all ye rest. For as this apostats debordit and vicious life, bent to contentioun & stryfe, euer farther from modestie, then from vanitíe did abhor: sua the maners & good conuersatioun of Maister NICOL DALGLEISCH war adornit with sobriety & wisdome.

Bot let vs expend the consequence quhilk of this propositiō thou dois attex, and of the places impertinently broght furth of ye scriptures and confusly out of the doctours for probatioun. ADVERSAR. Then if hair is a saluatioun out of the Catholik Kirk necessarly it dois follow what ather the Kirk of Scotland, laitlie erectit be Knox & Paul Methuer, & vthers of thair sect is not the trew kirk or els all our forfathers quha dyit in the Romane Kirk ar condemnit in sull & body to the eternal fyre of hel, because they neuer embra∣ced si a religioun as this caluenisme. ANSWER. I answer vnto this desperat conclusioun, that our forbears wer in the same Kirk. that we ar now. And albeit they vnderstuid not sa weil sindry heads of Religioun as was requyrit:Cyp lib 2. cp. 3. Ʒit with S.

Quhat is the meaning of this apostat I sal schortly expone The papists affirmes that the Kirk of Christ, euin in sic thigs as it decreits or decernis without the word of God, can not erre. Our assertioun vpon this head is this, In admitting sa far the Kirk dois not erre, quhen hir awin wisdome being re∣mouit, sho suffers her self through the haly spirit, be ye word of God to be gouernit. the controuersie remains in this point we will haue the autoritie of the Kirk annexit to the word of God, and subiect to the voyce of her Spouse: thay will haue it aboue the word, and consequently aboue the halye Gaist: 14  16. because inseperablie thay ar cōioynit. Bot to ʒour probatiōs. ADV. This conclusioun is confirm¦it in S. Mathew, quhair Christ promisit to Peter that the gates of hel sal not preuail against his Kirk. ANS. We confes that Christ hes promised that the ports and gaits of he sal not preuail against the elect. That is, that thay sall not alluterly ouerthrowe them, albeit in sum things and for a tyme thay may fall. Ioh. 14.AD. And S. Iohne say is I sall pray the Father and he sal giue them the haly Spreit to remaine with them for euer. AN. I answer that this promeis of Christ is maid vnto the elect & chosin children. nether ʒit so to them, but they lea∣ning vpoun thair awin iudgement ar oft tymes suffred to fal, baith in doctrinee and maners. Quhilk insirmityes notwith∣standing sal na way preiudge thair saluatioun. As by monye hundereth examples of the seruands of God is prouin. Sa yat the Spreit of God is neuer alluterly remouit from them. Bot ʒit sumtyme thay feil the weight of thair imperfections wher in neuertheles that Heuinly seid of regeneratioun do tharf∣ter vtter the selfe. AD And be S▪ Paul to Tim calling the Kirk the piller and sure ground of veritie.
AN. I answer that it is not so called absolntly, & without all respect so pronuncit by the Apostle, for then Christe war not the sure grund & corner stane thairof, quhilk is not only maist absurd to affirme: bot contrair the Epistle to Corinth, and Ephesi. thairfore to ansuer directly: in this respect ye kirk is the sure ground of veritie. Because Gods word, & haly scrip teurs quhilks are the veritie, vphalds the Kirk. AD. Of this conclusioun it is notoriously knawin to al vneffectionat me, that the mi∣nisters of Scotland a blasphemous against Gods promeis▪ quhen they teache & preiche that the Kirk of God may erre in ony head of Saluatioun. AN. Blasphemous mouth, thy foolish iudgement & blind∣nes conioynit with extreme malice heirby mair suffiàiently is discouered. Our myndes we haue declarit vpon this mater, vnto to the quhilk we adioyne, that Christ hes left his word vn∣to his Kirk, euen as an compas in an Schip. quhairunto if the Mariners haue regard, the Schip dois not erre nor go astray. Let in lykewaise the woord of God suffice for an Compasse quhairby the Kirk may be reulit that sho erre not. ❧ THE. III. PROPOSITIOVN. ¶ The members of Christs Kirk in the earth ar not only the guid quha as inheriteurs of Christs Kingdome in heauen, bot also the euill sa lang as thay keip vnttie with the rest of Christs flock. I confesse that the visible Kirk of God dois consist of good and euil men. quha be Christ ar comparit to cauff and corne heipit in a barne togither. bot a maist absurd opinioun it is, & damnable in the self, for to affirme the wicked to keip vnitie of faith with the Godly, or that thay ar the mēbers of Christ. For seing Christs flock be faith ar fauit: the wicked retaining with them (as thou hes written) the vnitie of Faith: most ne∣cessarlie be sauit. AD. Of this the cft of the Ministers may be discouerit, quha perceauing themsel∣ues condemnit by the vesible Kirk. feinʒeis to themselfs an uuisible. AN.

I requyrit better iudgement of a xx ʒeirs dialectati∣ner thē in his anticedent he suld haue repugnantia in adiccto and of the saming scoffing calumny is broght in, rather then
a formell conclusioun. I afferme that our Kirkes are veseble, thair doctreine hard, and obedience sa far as our corruptit na¦tures may suffer geuin thairto, and themselves are sene. ❧ THE IIII PROPO. The Kirk of God n the earth of necessitie man be veseble & knawi throgh ye wrld. ❧ I sall conuince be iuste and force bill argu∣ments that quhilk thou wald obtrud vnto vs to wit, visibeli∣tie to be an trew & essentiall note of the Kirk of God. For be dyuers waies the visible kirk may be obscured. of ye quhik w laik not sufficient examples baith in haly scripturs & pro∣phane histories. Quha knawes not that vnder the dayes of King Achab, the Kirk of God was so obscurit, that the Pro∣pheit Elias heuely complainit, nane was left on lyfe except him that did honour God? And quha is ignorant of that cru∣elty in the dayis of Nero (Domitian, Dece, Diocletian, Max∣imilian, Valerian, Aurelian, Valentian, Rhedaguse, Gersorich, Attill, quhairby the persecutioun of the faithfull was so feir¦full that the haill number of the Christians being almaist de∣uourit by the sword, the remanent had na Kirkis to assemble themselues to the seruice of thair God? In constantinus age the resident of the faithfull was so small: that the Empriour mokking Athanasius and Liberius said, that thay only pertur¦bit the peace & tranquilitie of the haill earth. Vnto whome Liberius ansuered, not because O Empriour we are fewe in number and alane, the worser is our faith. Moreouer as the Kirk of God may be oppressed be persecution: sua it may ba obscured by the darknes and clouds of superstitious errours, broght in be corrupted pasteurs, subiect vnto ignorance and malice, quhairthrow the Euangel of Christ uely may nocht appeir. For S Paull him selfe testifyis that in the latter dayes the Antichrist sall sit in the middes of hir. I micht vse in this argument mony autorities of ancient writers for probatioun, les nor I sould seeme to be tedious. Thairfoir I returne vnto the rest of his reasones. and to that

In the last dayes he mountaine of the house of the Lord sathe preparin  ontains and exalted aboue all h, and all nations fall come vto it. I answer that the excellencie of the mount Sion, quhairof thy Prophet speiks, pertains lytle or nothing vnto the perpetuall visibilitie of the Kirk. Bot that in this respect it was prefeirit befoir all vthair mountains. Because that thair christ was first preichit be his Apostles. To quhais doctrine fter∣wart the hail warld gaue obedience. And thair for it is said, that all nations sall flow thairunto. Not that al men come rin¦ning to Ierusalem;M. .bot that forsaking thair errours, returned vnto the trueth, quhilk at Ierusalem first was preichit. AD. And S. Mathew saying that an eytie puildi vpon an montain can not be hid. AN. This place nathing establisseth thy errour. For he yat hes a spoink of iudgement may perceaue, that Christ onelie speakes in that place of the mners and conuersatioun of the Apostil.Mat. 10. AD Christ commands also to haue recours vato the Kirk and shaw vnto it [quhilk war impossible. les nor it war visible) if that he quha has offendit the ma na satisfacti∣on for piuat admonitioun. AN. Demanding of the, I answer with that Godly & lei∣nit man Maister THOMAS SMETOVN. whether heirfoir suld we haue recourse to an vniuersall or particular Kirk? To an vniuersall we may nocht, because nather it nor the mem∣bers thairof can be conuenit togidder in an place. And a par∣ticulare be the proces of tyme may decay and be obscurit, And thairfor not visible, sa be this argument thou may proue lytle, seing Christ in that place alludis vnto the Senat of the Iewis, quha Inquyrit of the maners of euerie man. AD. S. Augustene promis this clirly saying,. Augu. devn ccl.  is against the promeis of Christ that ather his Kirk be vnuesible or only knawin as ʒours in Gene & in Scotland in certe cone of the wald. AN. I grant that in S.

And iustly he reprouis the donatists, quha did reioyce in their fewnes, afferming that the Kirk of God be onlie in a corner of Aphrica, & that they for the sinnis of vhers, war sparat from the communioun of the arld. Ʒit if

And gritter is the number of hethens,Chrisi. 4 in Isi∣am. Iewes and Turks, than of Christians. AD. S.

AD This conclusion is pri because  place of the scripture can be produci wh  i forbiddi. First I answer be the contrarie seing i is na way comman∣dit by the scripteur of God: it can not be na wayis laufully vsit. AD. And gif it had be forbiddin i th 2. p. of xodus witut al diicio s the Ministers falslie allegis he had bene ctrarious vnto him self because in the 25. hp, he commands to mak the Image of the Chrbims. AN. I answer vnto this quhilk is mair an calumnie the obiectioun. That they condemne not all Images without di∣stinctioun. for they knw that Christe him selfe did not con∣demne Caesars Image in the money. For painting & grauing r things indifferent nather guid nor euil, in sa far, that quhen thir vse teuds not to deuoaoun bot to decoratioun and or∣nament. Bot euin sua, that God can not be reprsentit be na Image. As to the Cherubims they war set vp to couer the Arke or the Mercie seat, to the end that the pepill micht vnderstand that the nature & Maiestie of God quhome they worshipped was altogether hid and couered from them, and na wayis culd be sene,Num. 1. nor be any visible thing represented▪ As for the brasin Sepent it was set vp for the present necessi∣tie, as  sacrament only for a tyme to indure, as by the fact of Ezechias was manifest. 4. reg 18. Bot thir examples can na wayis serue for your Images, vnles thou find me a sure war∣rand out of Gods worde, commanding them, as we lie of the Cherubims and Serpent. AD It is provin also by Christs a win exmpill quh as teies Eusebius in hi 7. bik of his ecclesia history set hi a win Imge vnto the King Abga. AN. Read quha will Eusebius 7. buik, they all dprehend thee to haue falslie lyit. AD Also i the premitie Kik emorrhie quh ws halit by Christ did  a
image o him quhilk as Christian did repif as contrair the command of God. AN It appeareth  how ʒour cause itendeth, quhen it is confirmit by sic sutill probations. That image was onlye historicall maid for an declaratioun and monument of the hailng of the woman by Christ. And that it sould not be thought that Iesus Christe or his Aposties did commande the same Eusebius subiounds. It is na meruell that the heathens receauing sic benefites of our Saluiour did these things, for, we haue sene the Image of Peter, of Paul, & of Christ drawin in coleurs & preserued. And it may weill be thoght that men in old tymes being not ʒit remoued from thair superstitioun vsit after this sort to worship thame by an eathnisch custom as thair sauiour, Au. ib . de cu  &c. AD. S. August. declaris it was the cuom in his dayis to haue the Images of Pe and Paul with Christ. AN Contrarie waies it is plaine that he alluterly reiects them as it is euident in his 49. epist. & in his Catolog heresi, 7 amangs the rest of the nrpocratians errours, he notis a certen woman namit. Marcellina quha being of that saming sect, or¦shipped the Image of Iesus and Paul, Homeir and Pythagoras In the place be ʒo cytit, he approuis a Imagis speciallye maid for Religiouns saik, Bot declares be quhat occasion the enemies of Christ feinʒeit certen buiks in his name, written to Peter and Paul of magik and witchcraft, because sayeth he they saw in sidrie places peter & paul paintit vpon the walis with Christ. nather dois heir August. approue sic paintrie, na∣her deny we for beautie and knaweledge picteurs maye be maid. AD. And the viuersalt traditioun of all gi  in the Kirk to have the signe of the crosse as Tertlian witnesseth  crs militis. AN Bot sic an signe was not as now is vfit, in his tyme the Christians held vp thair hands in the air, and by thair fingers transuersly puttin, formit a figure of the crosse, quhairby they declared thair professioun that they beleuit in our Saluiour crucefyit. and ʒit thair is a grit difference of the signe of the Crosse that incontinent euaishis a way, and a material Image substancially existin. The signe is ancient, bot the figure laite.
By the quhilk Christe is abominablie fixit to ane galow tri, quhilk ʒe honour with reuerence, and worschipps with pro∣stratioun of ʒour bodies, as it is euident by the words of ʒour Masse buik. O crux aue spes vica, Blissed be thou O cro our only esperance. Auge piis iustitiam reis{que} dona veniam. Incresse iustice to the Godly, & schw mercy to the culpabil. Heirby ʒour impietie mair nor beastly is discouered: for Hab. in his 2. cha. pronuncis this sentence, malediction aboue him that sayis to tree, stok, or stane, a walke and teache me, and ʒ esteme them as books of the Laics & commoun pepill, be th quhilks they are callit to remembrance to serue Christ. Bot an vnhappie memorie is that quhilk stands in nead of a sight∣full conceat, and miserabill is that man quhilk na vtherway is can haue the presence of Christ with him vnles he haue his Image paintit on the wall,NOT or express it in sum vther mater, for sic a memorie that is nourisched by Images procedeth not of haty loue: bot of necessitie of eye sight. AD. Of this we  the fraudfull interpritatiouns of the command of God he the Ministers, and how they follow the futsteps of Iulianus apostaza in destroying the images of Christ, as the Turks causes the renega Christians to spit vpon the crucifix quhilk the trew Christians he for an ensige and baner. AN. Quhen sall we haue an end of thy calumnies? I think neuer, bot I leaue them vnto thy self; and the vnto thy awin wickednes. Quhat Iulianus the apost hes done against the Christians, quhat the Turks lykewayis we knawe, all that to haue procedit of plaine malice against Christ. Bot that quhilk our Ministeres hes done in destroying the Imagis placit for Gods in ʒour kirks, that I say hes follow it from a good zeall to praise God, for the quhilk they haue sufficient assuraunce by the command of God and example lykewayis of the an∣cient fathers. For EPIPHANIVS wrytis to Iohn Patriark of Ie∣rusalem in the 2. tome of Hierome. In that I hard certaine did grudg aganist me, for that when we went together to the holy place, quhilk is caled Bethel, to mak a gathering thair wt me according to the maner of the Kirk; and come to a village caled ANABLATHA, & as I passed I sawe a candil burning, &
asked quhat place it was, and quhen I learned it was an Kirk and hd entred into it to mak my prayers, I founde thair ane vaile hinging at the entrie of the Kirk paynted hauing the Image as it war of Christ or of sum Sanct,NOTE for quhose picteur it was in deid I do not remember, thairfoir quhan I sawe the Image to hing in the Kirk of Christ, contrarie to the cōman∣diment of the scripteurs, I rent it in sondre, and gaue counsell to the kepars of the Kirk to burie sum poore bodie in it. I besik ʒo charge the preists of that place, that they cōmand that sic painted claiths as be contrary vnto our Religioun, b no more hanged vp into the Kirk of Christ, It behouis ʒour reuerence to haue cair heirof, this is snperstitioun vnmeit for the Kirk of Christ, and dangerous for the pepole, and thair∣fore oght to be remoued. ❧ THE XII. PRO. It is consonant to Gods word to pray for the dead. 12 ❧ If that be consonant vnto Gods word or conuenient vnto the Scripteur, quhilk ather from ignorance of the bene∣fites of Christ hes followit, or fra vnbeleef or incredulitie hes procedit: or fra an humane affectioun hes cumit halelie disteu¦lit hauing but the name of charitie, the prayers for the deade ar then to be halden agreable to Gods word. Bot seing in the blood of Christ our sinnes ar waschin away. Be it far from vs, that so ignorant of this benefeit we suld be r s increduteuis in esteming that the prayers of men may mair awaill then the mereits of Christ, or that we sould think God to be so inhu∣mane that he wald haue payment estet the obligatioun is rent I mene, that he hes forgeuin vs in Christ our debt & not the punischemen thairof, quhilk rather the Papeists teaches sould be remouit beprayes of men, ringing of Bellis, offring of sil∣uer, and to be extenuat through passing vnto pilgramagis. AD. This is prouin by the . buik of the Macah. the . chap, quhirin it is said yet it is an haly and hailsome prayer to pray for the deid that they may be  from thair sinnes,
AN. Bot quhat autoritie suld be geuin to that buik, it is e∣uident by the hinmest verse of the saming, qnhairin the autor crauis pardoun quhair he failleth, nathr is the haly spreit to be aseryuit vnto it,NOT quhilk the authour ascryuis vnto his awin diligence, for in it thair are many contrarieties. First as con∣cerning the death of Antiochus. Seing in the 1. buik, & 6. cha It is writtin that he dyit of a fewer. In the 2. & 1. ch. it is said that he was slaine in spuilʒeing the Kirk of Nanea. & in the 9 chap. of that same buik, it is writtin he was strukkin miracu∣louslie be the hand of God in the montains. Bot in the 1. buk it is said he dyit in Babylon. the ʒeir of his death in the 1. buk & 6. chap. after the grecian calculatioun is. 149. In the 2. & 1. chap. 148. Lykewayis Lysias gouernour of Eupators armie maid peace with Iudas Machabeus, vnto quhome Antiochus Eupator (sone to antiochus the tyran aboue specifiit.) wrytes concerning that mater. the ʒeirs of the dait of the letters are 148, ather then most Eupator be haldin King before his fa∣thers death, quhilk is maist fals, as in the 9. chap. it may apear or els Antiochus dyit not the 149,Aug. lib. 18. .3 de ciuit. dei ʒeir of the Grecians, quh∣ilk is contrair vnto the 6. chap. of the 1. buik. AD. Albeit perchance the books of the Mach. war not asuit in the Synagog of the Iewes a  canons ʒit S, Aug witnesseth that the Kirk of God asauit them as canoi. AN, I deny not Hammiltoun that in them ar not thingis conteined profitabill for edificatioun, Bot I affyrme that they war not writtin, that our faith suld be established vpon them on that thay may serue for confirmatioun of doctreine, or to haue flow it from the haly spreit. For the Spreit of God neuer vsis in the scripteur to be suppliant vnto men, and for his im∣perfectioun to beg pardoun at thair hand., for nathing ought to be impute to the Halie Gaist, quhilk becommeth not the grit Maiestie of God. And althoght that S. Augu. approueth hem ʒit he dois not also laitlie, bot rather with twa prouisio admits them. First if that thay be soberlie red, nixt warlie hard. Bot sa conditionarlie he pronunces not of the rest of the canonicall scripteurs. Ʒea GREGORI him selfe in the
19. booke, vpon the 17, chap. of Iob, testifies that thay war not canonicall. AD. S Paul also affirmes this, that quhair he sayis they that buy de vpon Christ trayle hay or stubill salb sait hot as by the fyre quhilk place can not be vndertande of the fyre of hell because fra it thair is na redemptioun. AN. A far soght, obscure, and confusd probatioun, and na∣thing pertinent to the purpose. For rather he confirmes pur∣gatorie, that is ignotum per ignotious: then directlie prouis the prayers for the dead. Neuertheles I sall indeuour my selfe to answer vnto that quhilk inderectlie is obiectit. Be the fyre is vnderstand the tryall of the halie Gaist, be the Stubil & Hay courious and vnprofitabill doctreine, quhilk be the fyre, that is, be the halie Spreit salbe tryit, be the quhilks mens inuenti∣ons and traditions with vnprofitabill doctreine not groundit vpon the word of God salbe consumed. Bot seing vpon this place be falslie builds Purgatorie, I am glad that it is bigged vpon hay and stubbil, that in our age now the fyre of God being kindlit, it is all burnt away, AD. And ortulia counts the prayers for the deap amangs the tralatio obser in the Kirk in his age. AN. If this autoritie of Tertulian be thee alledged be tre thou dois maliciouslie, falslie, and wickedlie, wraist the Scrip∣teur of God in confirmation of that quhilk is not writtin, bot as an vncerten traditioun rasauit. Vnto S. Aug. thou dois ar grit iniurie, that wald hane him establish thy errour, althoght he prayit for his Mother MONICA. quhairin he erred by an luising affectioun and humane compassioun towards hir. for he him self in his euch. ad laurent. 67. chap. in an worde he slokkins purgatorie and condems the prayers for the deade. saying, Qui hoc credunt sunt et catholici qui humana quad beneuolentia mihi falli videntur, tha quha beleuis Purgatory for to be, ar not only Herityks hou also catholyks, qua be an humaine beneuolence appeirs vnto me, to be deceauit, and after he subioynes, post enim hanc vitam, nullus est peniten∣tius locus. Efter our Sauls be desoluit from our bodyes, thair is na place of repentance. This also is confirmit by erom say¦ing e knae that in this world we can not be helpit an of a∣nother
ather with prayars or with counsalls bt efter we be once befoir the iudgement sait of Christ, nather Io DANIEL nor NOACH, be abil to pray for any bodie, but euerie man fall beir his awin burden. I might vse many vther autorities for the confirmatioun of his mater, but thir I thinke are suf∣ficient. ❧ THE XIII. PROPOSITIOVN. In the Sacrament of the Altar vnder the forme of bread and wine the bodie and blood of Christ is reallie and substancially coteaned. AD. This conclusioun is confirmit e thrie Euangelists, quha testifies that Christ i his latter supper said ak eat this is my bodie quhilk fall he geuin for ʒow, the quhilk words are so cleir and euident that no n can doubt vnles he wald giue mair credence vnto his awin sense and iudgement nor to Christs infallabill words. AN. I answer with S Hierome that the Euangell standeth not in the words of the scripteur but in the meaning,Ir. vpon 1. Galla. for gif in sic wechtie maters, we wald pretex the simplicitie of words Christ then suld be ane Lambe, an Porte, an Way, the trewe Wine, and an husband man, Quhilk forme of speaking onlye is figuratyue. AD. Iustinus the martye to Antonimis saith that euin as we beleiue Christ had flsch and blood so we oght uo beleue that breacnd wine quhilk he conecrat was chan¦ged in his fleshe end blood. AN. I answer that thir words are misticallie and sacramen∣tallie to be vnderstand, for in that secound apologie, he pro∣ueth against ye heretiks be ye sacramēt of the eucharist Christ for to haue had verry body and verry fleshe, and not phanta∣stik as they did think, in this maner, if Christ had neuer tree flesh this Sacraments suld be false, seing they neuer culd repre¦sent nor signifie that thing quhilk was neuer extant. Bot I wald not thou assumed him for ane patroun of ʒour transub∣stantiatioun, quhen he teachis in that saming apologie the bread and wine efter consecratioun to be changed in our bo∣die and nurisch the saming, quhilk plainelie Ireneus aprouis saying by the bread and Cup quhilk ar the sacraments of the odie and blood of Christ, ex quibusagetur et consistir car is nostraesubstantia, of the quhilk the substance of our flesh
and of his precious blood neer institute be him nor obseruit in his kirk, les nor thou wild willingly close the eyes of thy cōscience against the treuh. Bot I knaw thy stubbernes, that althogh good reasons may mak the acknawledge the veritie, ʒit thou rather will consent with ʒour superstitious mesmon∣gars, nor say treuth with the veritie now.. 14. AD This conclusioun is prouin because Christ has callit himself a Priest for euer ef¦ter the ordour of Melchisadek: we reid in the book of Genesies that Melchisadek offred bread and wine thairfor Christ being presigurat be Melchisadek of necessitie man hau anelyke maner of sacrifice to wttrubldie. AN This confusd reasoun is saxtymes repeted be ʒow, bot fa oft to answer, it wld be countit superfluous, thairfoir I wil contract the sume of all in an forme that I may derectlie an∣swer thair vnto.OBIEC¦TIOVN The figure of Melchisadek behouit in veri∣ritie to be accomplishe in Christs preisthood. Bot Melchisa∣dek offred to God the Father bread and Wyne. Thairfoir it behouit Christ not onlie to offer that, bot that the veritie of the figure might be performit in his body and blood also. I admit the propositioun, and denyis the assumptioun, because that in the Epistle to the Ebrewes many conferences and dy¦uers collations ar maid of Melchisadeks preisthod & of Christ quhairin na mention is maid of bread and Wine.ANS. To be short ye figure of Melchisadeks preisthood dois consist in tha things quhilks ar not comon with Arons preisthood; bot the offring of bread and wine, was dayly in the sacrifice of Aaron, thair∣foir Christs preisthood rather suld be after the ordour of Arō nor Melchisadeks, if the offring of bread and Wine ware the principall things in Christs preisthood.NOTE Bot all this contro∣uersy floweth from the ignorance of the Ebrew word, for in the 14 of Gene it is writin, that after Abraham returnit from the battel with his souldiers being werie, Melchisadek quha was King causit bread & wine be broght furth quhairby A∣braham and his armie micht bene refreschit. The same King also being hie Priest blissit him the error of our aduersar con¦sisteth in this word (broght furth) quhilk be sum is exponit obtulit, bot wrang and be vthers as be Iero. proulit, and be
vthers, educi fecit, causeth bread & wine to be brocht furh to refresche the stomaks of the wearie souldiers, quhilk he did lyberallie being King, and being hie Priest deuotelie he gaue him his benedictioun. AD. Of this we collect that tha quha lawbours to abolich the sacrifice of Christs body and blood in the messe ar blasphemous against Christ and his eternall preisthood after the ordour of Melchisadek. AN, I affirme boldy that that quha imbraces sic horrible prophanatioun of Gods glorie, dois defile their soule with I∣dolatrie, and sa far as thay may, not only puts Christ to shame & approbre, bot also dois him crucesie. For inrespect if the sacrifice be iterat, Christ must be crucifyet, quhilk was bot on & singulair sacrifice. For S. Paul writing to the brews 6 ch. witnesseth, that nane can be offrit except him that dieth. ❧ THE XV. PRO. It is contrarius & repugnant to the custom of the primittu Kirk to institut & cōmand any publict fsting on Sonday & to ma bankets on Fryday. AD. This is prouin be Tertulian quhan he wrytis of the constitutioun of the Kirk, saying we hald it as a sacriledge to command any fasting on Sonday. AN. Since by the scriptur y• art not able to confirme this, we are not constranit to obey mens inuentions, for Tertulian in that same place saith, it is altogether vnlaufull that vpon y• Sonday in worshipping God, to fal vpon our knees the con∣trair quhairof notwithstanding his autoritie, is rasauit be al chri¦stians, & thairfoir we may als easily reiect this superstitloun in fasting vpon the Fryday,Te  psych. as not kneling vpon the Sonday, & ʒit he wryts vther wais in his buik contra PSYC. saying we mā hencfurth fast wtout cōpulsion, of fre will not be comandimēt of this new disceplin, acording as euery mā sal se time & place AD.

AD. Of this conclusioun is manifest that the Ministers instituting thair publict fa vpd onday & making thair banquet vpon Fryday, ar ot only selaudrous to the hail krk bot also followis the firsteps of the Manicheans & vther condemned herityks.

To the matter.Di. 61, qua san∣onia. First I ansuer with Pape Stephanus & conforme to his command, quhairof the tennour is this. If syndrie of our predicessurs haue done certen thinges, quhilk at that tyme might weil haue bene done without hurt, quhilks afterward are turned vnto errour and to superstitioun:NOTE let them be dist∣royit and abolished by the successeurs.
