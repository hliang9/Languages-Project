The last DECLARATIONS OF THE Committee of Estates Now Assembled In SCOTLAND, Concerning Their Proceedings in opposition to the late unlawfull ENGAGEMENT against ENGLAND. Together with The ARTICLES agreed upon by the Com∣missioners appointed by the Noble∣men, Gentlemen, and Burgesses who Protested against the late ENGAGEMENT. And the ANSWER thereunto. Edinburgh, Printed by EVAN TYLER. And Re-Printed at LONDON for Robert Bostock, at the Signe of the Kings Head in Paul's Church-yard. 18 Octob. 1648.
A DECLARATION of the Committee of E∣states concerning their Proceedings in opposition to the late unlawfull Engagement against England. THe manifold dangers to Religion, to the Kings Majesty, to our Laws and Liberties, and to the Peace of these Kingdoms, are so manifest, that they cannot be hid from any, who will not wilfully shut their eys against a cleer light: and the remedies which we have taken in this extremity, wil (we doubt not) be judged by all men of common equity and understanding, to have been most necessary for pre∣serving Religion from ruine, and our selves from slavery and oppression: Yet, to prevent m sinformation and misconstru∣ctions, we have thought fit to publish a short narration of the Causes of our late undertaking to rise in arms, of our procee∣dings by way of Treaty with those that joyned in arms for the late Engagement against England, and of our resolutions for setling Religion, and the Peace of this distracted Kingdom, and strengthening the Union betwixt the Kingdoms, which are the best foundations of Honour and Happinesse to the King; whose Throne we desire may be established in Righteousnesse. When wee look back upon some proceedings in our neigh∣bour Nation, though there wee see that the work of Reforma∣tion hath been much obstructed, and many things have been done, of which we cannot approve, and wherewith God was highly displeased; yet we finde the Fountain and Spring of all our troubles mainly to arise at home, from the craft and malice of our Natives and Country-men. For, notwithstanding the Right Honorable Houses of the Parliament of England had of∣fered by their Commissioners to remove all differences which had arisen betwixt them and us, and to do what-ever was just
and Honourable for the satisfaction of this Kingdom: And fur∣ther, had declared their readinesse to joyn with this Kingdom in the Propositions agreed on by both Kingdoms, presented to the King at Hampton Court, for the making such further proceed∣ings thereupon as should be thought fit, for the speedy settlement of the Peace of both Kingdoms, and preservation of the Union according to the Covenant and Treaties. And further, to give satisfaction in all things which should be judged necessary for the Peace of both Kingdoms, not intrenching upon the particu∣lar Interest of the Kingdom, and Priviledges of the Parliament of England: yet many of this Nation having entered into a sin∣full Association and wicked Combination, did joyn together in Arms under the command of the Duke of Hamiltoun, for pur∣suance of an unlawfull Engagement against our neighbour Na∣tion of England, contrary to the ends of the solemn League and Covenant, the manifold admonitions and exhortations of all the faithfull Ministers of the Gospel, the warnings and Declara∣tions of Commissioners of the Generall Assembly, 1647. As likewise against the unanimous proceedings of the late Generall Assembly in this yeer 1648; against the Judgement and Prote∣stations of many Members of Parliament, who have been most constant in the Cause, and to preserve the Union betwixt the Kingdoms; and generally against the minds and judgements of all the well-affected in the Kingdom: And further, brought over from Ireland some Regiments of the Scots Army to joyn with them in this Engagement, contrary to the Treaty betwixt the Kingdoms of the 7 of July 1642. And having joyned in an unlawfull Association with the Malignants of England, did im∣ploy some of them to surprize and take the Garisons of Berwick and Carlile (and yet professed openly before the World, they were ignorant who had done it) contrary to the large Treaty betwixt the Kingdoms, and the Treaty of the 29 of November 1643. And when by miserable and cruell oppression of the people of God in this Kingdom they had gathered together a numerous Army, they took possession of the Garisons of Ber∣wick and Carlile, and in an hostile manner entered into our Neighbour Nation; where the Lord of Hosts poured forth his Wrath and Indignation upon them for their lyes and hypocri∣sie,
as was before threatned by many of the faithfull servants of God in this Kingdom. While these men were invading England, the Earl of Lanerick and others engaged in the same Designe, stayed at home to op∣presse this Kingdom; and under a pretence of raising a Guard for the Prince, did begin a new Levie of Forces, whereby they might be able to send supply to their Army in England, if need were; but principally to bear down the godly and wel-affected in this Kingdom, and force upon them unlawfull Bands and Oathes, which they devised to be engines and snares to compell men to make Shipwrack of their Consciences, by joyning with all their wicked ways, or in case they refused to take those ac∣cursed Oaths, and subscribe their Bands, that then they might not onely be uncapable of all publick Trust, but be esteemed and used as Enemies to Religion, King and Kingdom; and so every way to oppresse all honest men in their Persons, Estates and Consciences, as nothing was to be expected from their Go∣vernment to these who desired to fear the Lord, and adhere to their first Principles, but slavery and ruine: for they having ad∣journed the Parliament till March 1650, had assumed to them∣selves an Arbitrary Power, that in the mean time they might rule at their pleasure, and make such alterations in the King∣dom as they thought fit. Upon news of the defeat of their Army, they did give out Commissions to prime Incendiaries, and en∣couraged such as were eminent and active in Rebellion, under the conduct of James Graham late Earl of Montrose, to rise in Arms; and sent directions to the Forces under the command of George Monro, which had invaded England, but were not present at the Fight, and other Officers and Souldiers who esca∣ped from it, to return to this Kingdom, that so by their conjun∣ction with the Forces lately raised, they might have a new Ar∣my on foot to prosecute their former designe, and to tyrannize over this Kingdom, as is evident from their Letters of the 28 of August, sent to the Earl of Marshall Vicount of Dudhope, Clerk Register, and George Monro, (ten days after the defeat of their Army in England) wherein speaking of the Engagement, they declare their resolution to recruit their Regiments, and to ha∣zard their Lives and Fortunes, and all that was dearest unto
them for carrying on against all opposition whatsoever that pious and loyall Service, and that they and many others of this Kingdom did intend not to live and out-live it: By all which, and many other their like proceedings expressed in the Declarations of the Generall Assembly and their Commissio∣ners, it is sufficiently evident that Religion hath not only been endangered, but the whole work of Reformation in these Kingdoms for these ten years past hath been very neer to bee wholly overturned, our Laws and Liberties almost destroyed, Authority weakned, the person of the King put in hazard, and his restitution (which they pretended) rendred more dif∣ficult, and endeavours used to break the Union and Peace be∣twixt the Kingdoms, and to continue (so far as was in their power) a lasting War betwixt this Kingdom and our neighbour Nation with whom we are joyned in Covenant. This being the true estate of affairs, We did find it most necessary for us to joyn in Armes together against these Co∣venant breakers and their Adherents who had invaded Eng∣land, and were disturbing the Peace of this Kingdom (and who under a specious pretence of seeking the Kings Honour, Free∣dom and Safety, were seeking their own Honour and base private ends, and have made the Kings condition harder then ever it was before) this course being the only means which was left us whreeby to endeavour the preservation of Religi∣on, our native Country, and the Peace and Union betwixt the Kingdoms, and our own Consciences being ready to condemn us if we should sit still and suffer Religion to be ruined, England to be further provoked (by detaining their Garri∣sons) and this Kingdom to be enslaved and brought under the yoke of a perpetuall bondage. When we had put our selves in a posture for our own de∣fence neer Edinburgh, the Earl of Crawford, the Earl of La∣nerik, George Monro, and other Commanders of the Forces joyned with them, having marched to Inneresk, sent us some Articles upon which they desired to Treat, for remove∣ing all differences betwixt us; but these Demands being very unreasonable and inconsistent with Religion, the Covenant and Treaties betwixt the Kingdoms, We refused to admit
them to be the subject of a Treaty; yet were content if they had any other thing to propound which might conduce to the setling of Truth and Peace according to the Covenant, to appoint some from us to Treat with the like number autho∣rized by them, at any place equally distant from both Armies. Whereupon they professed a readinesse to have all differences ended by a Treaty, that an intestine war might be prevented; but they assigned so short Dyets for us to return our Answers about the necessary circumstances to be agreed on before a Treaty could begin, as the time was elapsed before we could be well conveened; and then they took the advantage of marching away, whilest we continued in our Quarters in ex∣pectation of a Treaty, by which means they gained the passe at Sterling, and surprized our Forces there, killing some, and taking others Prisoners when they were in security being ad∣vertised that there was a Treaty betwixt us; All this not∣withstanding, so desirous were we of the peace of this almost ruined Kingdom, as passing over all the provocations given unto us, we readily entertained all proffers to Treat, and upon the 14. of September, Commissioners on both sides met at Woodside, together with some Ministers and Elders from the Commission of the Kirk; but after three daies debate that Trea∣ty (during which their Army was grievously plundering the Countrey) produced little else but delaies, they refusing to accept of any conditions without rewards for their service, Liberty to transport the Irish Forces in a body to Ireland, se∣curity for their Lives, Estates, Honours, Fortunes and places, and assurance that none who had been accessory to the late En∣gagement should be questioned either by us, or by the Kingdom of England for any thing done by them in relation thereun∣to, which was impossible for us to grant without involving our selves in the guilt of the Engagement, and giving occasi∣on of quarrell against us to our neighbour Nation, in whose names we could promise nothing without their advice and con∣sent. And here we cannot but remark, that these Lords and o∣thers, who in Parliament and otherwise, pretended so great a zeal for his Majesties Honour, Freedom and Safety, yet in all their demands to us in this Treaty, they never made the least
desire of any thing for the King, but were ready to close an a∣greement with us when ever they could get satisfaction in what concerned their own Honour, Freedom and Interest. So soon as we understood that the Forces of the Parliament of England were come to the Borders, for pursuit of the com∣mon Enemy, and reducing the Garrisons of Berwick and Car∣lile, We wrote a Letter from Falkirk to the Commander in chief of these Forces, and sent two from us with Instructions to acquaint him with the estate of our affairs, particularly our proceedings in the Treaty, and to assure them that we would contribute our utmost endeavours for the restitution of the Towns of Berwick and Carlile to the Parliament of England to whom they do of right belong: In return whereunto we re∣ceived from Lieut. Generall Cromwel a Letter to this purpose, That upon the defeat of the Forces of the Duke of Ha∣milton they had received in command that they should prosecute the Victory, untill the Enemy were put out of a condition of growing into a new Army, and the Garrisons of Berwick and Carlile were reduced, in pursuance of which commands they had resolved to advance into Scotland with their Army for obtaining their Garrisons, and that the com∣mon Enemy might be the sooner brought to a submission to reasonable conditions, withall ingaging themselves that so soon as they should know from us that the Enemy should yeeld to these things we had proposed to them, and the Garrisons of Berwick and Carlile were delivered, they should forthwith de∣part out of this Kingdom: after the receipt of this Letter, We sent some of our number with power and instructions to do their utmost endeavour for obtaining the Towns of Berwick and Carlile to be surrendred to him for the use of the Honou∣rable Houses of the Parliament of England, and to represent our earnest desire and firm resolution to preserve inviolable the Union betwixt the Kingdoms according to the Covenant and Treaties; and since they had resolved in obedience to the Com∣mands laid upon them, to send Forces into this Kingdom for pursuing the common Enemy; therefore to desire that those which should be sent might be such as would give no offence or scandal to the Ministry and well-affected in this Kingdom.
Upon the 18. of September some Propositions were sent unto us from those at Sterling, to which we returned an Answer upon the 20. And after a new meeting at Kirklistoun with Commissioners from them, Articles of Agreement were drawn up and subscribed by the Commissioners on both sides, which are now published in print: In all which proceedings we have studyed to set before our eyes the Honor of God, and the good of Religion, the preservation of our Laws and Liber∣ties, and of the Union betwixt the Kingdoms. And to the end it may further appear to this Kingdom and to all the World, that no sinister end or worldly design for self-interest, hath stirred us up to this course, we do declare. First of all, that we have both matter of deep humiliation before God, and thanksgiving to him when we consider his gracious dispensa∣tion towards us, in preserving a remnant from following the evil courses of the time, and that he was pleased so soon after a great defection and backsliding in the Land, to put us into a condition to resist the force and fury of our Enemies, whom neither Christian duty in so dear a Sunshine of the Gospel, nor natural affection to their native Country, could re∣strain from horrid impieties and intolerable oppressions. And we do freely acknowledg that it had bin just with the Lord to suffer us to lie still under that yoke of bondage, which we had wreathed upon our necks with our own hands, by compliance with Malignants and Malig∣nant courses, not trusting the Lord with his own work, and resting on his strength, but following the rules of carnal policy, when ever we were brought into straights. It is the desire of our Souls that for the future we may amend, and it shall be our constant study, with Gods assist∣ance, to avoid the rocks on which we were ready to split, that we may neither upon the one hand put confidence in the arm of flesh, and other wordly advantages when things are prosperous, nor upon the other, comply with the Enemies of the cause when we are low, but in all e∣states and conditions to put our trust in God Almighty, the Lord of Host, who also is only wise to give Counsel. Secondly, That whatsoever Power God hath already, or shall here∣after put into our hands, we shall improve it for setling and propagating Religion, and promoting the work of Reformation according to the Covenant, and in particular, to have the Liberties of the Kirk ratified, which have bin many ways incroached upon and violated, as is particu∣larly instanced in the Declaration of the General Assembly.
Thirdly, To vindicate and establish the liberty and property of the Subjects, who have bin most grievously oppressed in their Consciences, Persons and Estates. Fourthly, That we shall indeavor the Kings Majesties Restitution to the exercise of his Royal Power, as soon as he shall give security for set∣ling Religion in the manner expressed in the desires of the late Commis∣sion of the Kirk, and shall give satisfaction in such other things as shall be found necessary for the peace and safety of the Kingdoms. Fiftly, That the late unlawful Engagement against our Neighbour Nation of England, with whom we are joyned in League and Cove∣nant, may be disclaimed and disavowed by the Supream Authority of this Kingdom, it being most destructive to Religion, and to the Peace and Happiness of these Kingdoms. Sixthly, To strengthen and confirm the Peace and Union between the Kingdoms, which the Malignant Party hath so much endeavored to break and dissolve. Seventhly, That we shall endeavor to purge out of all the Judicatories in the Land, Malignancy and Prophaness, and use all other good means that Justice may be equally and impartially administred to all the Sub∣jects in the Kingdom, and that a more effectual course may be taken throughout the whole Kingdom then heretofore, for punishing and suppressing all Prophaness, Malignancy and Impiety. Eightly, All means having bin used with great industry, to get Ma∣lignants chosen to be Commissioners to the last Parliament, and to pre∣possess mens minds when they came to the Parliament, from which as a Fountain have issued all our troubles and distractions. That we will faithfully indeavor to have a free Parliament, consisting of such persons as have not bin accessary to, and furtherers of the late Engagement, for which end we do again hereby require that in the Election of Commissi∣oners from Burroughs and Shires to the Parliament, the rules and directi∣ons set down in our Acts of the 22. September last, and the fourth of this instant month of October, may be punctually observed throughout the Kingdom. And we call the searcher of hearts to record, that these are our real and true intentions, and that we do not, nor shall by the Grace of God pursue any private ends or interests of our own. And we trust, the Lord our God who knoweth the sincerity of our resolutions, who hath also had mercy upon us, and hath begun to do so graciously for us, will
assist us herein until his work shall be accomplished. And now last of all, since it is agreed upon in the Treaty, that all que∣stions and differences about Religion be referred to the determination of the General Assembly or their Commissioners, and that all Civil que∣stions and differences be referred to the determination of a Parliament, which is to sit down before the 10. of January next: We do exhort and require all and every one of the Subjects within this Kingdom, to live peaceable and quietly, and to wait patiently for the determination aforesaid, but in case any shall not rest satisfied with, or shall rele from the said agreement, and shall continue, or rise in Arms, or levy any For∣ces without Warrant from the Committee of Estates as it is now con∣stituted, consisting of persons not accessory to the late Engagement. We do declare that they shall be esteemed Enemies to Religion, the King and Kingdom, and punished as wilful disturbers of the Peace of the Kingdom. M. Thomas Henderson. A short Declaration to the whole Kirk and Kingdom, concerning present Dan∣gers and Duties. Edinb. 9. September 1648. Ante meridiem. ALbeit the sad and dangerous condition wherein this Kirk and Kingdom is now cast, by the publick Resolutions and practised of these who have ingaged in War against the Kingdom of Eng∣land, do proclaim unto all the lowers of Religion and the Country, what is needful to be done in this day of distress: Yet for the better infor∣mation of the Lords people, we conceive it necessary, shortly for the pre∣sent
sent to declare what we hold incombent in duty to all these who would not betray the cause of God, and render themselves slaves to the tyranny and lust of ungodly and Malignant men, hoping in a short time to make known our thoughts of these particulars more fully. When the dis-affected and prevailing party in the Parliament of this Kingdom did manifest head-strong resolutions to make War upon Eng∣land, under a pretext of suppressing Sectaries; But in effect, to dissolve the Union betwixt the Kingdoms, and to restore the King to the exer∣cise of his Arbitrary Government, and make way for promoving of the Designs of the Malignant party in both Nations, just and necessary de∣sires relating unto the grounds of an ingagement, and unto the securing of Religion, were presented unto their Lordships by the Commission of the former General Assembly: But these desires were altogether slighted, and an ingagement resolved upon such grounds as are contrary to the Word of God, and do infer the breach of all the Articles of the Solemn League and Covenant, as is clearly holden forth in the Declara∣tion of the last General Assembly; wherein also may be seen the great incroachments that are made upon the Liberties of the Kirk: Neither was there any regard had unto the dissent and Protestation of a consi∣derable number of Members of Parliament, who had bin most active and straight in the Cause from the beginning; nor unto the Petitions and Supplications of many Synods and Presbyteries, and of the well affected people of the Land, who were seeking satisfaction to their con∣sciences: But instead of a satisfactory answer, the ingagement which was wickedly resolved, was violently carried on by most strange plun∣dering and cruel oppression, especially of these who did it upon no o∣ther ground then out of fear to sin against God: And as though it had bin too little to force obedience unto their unlawful Resolutions and Acts; the Committee of Estates have urged and pressed the subscribing of a Band and Declaration of Parliament, wherein men are obliged to acknowledg the justice and equity of all the Acts, Conclusions and Re∣solutions thereof, or if they refuse, are to be esteemed Eenemies to Re∣ligion and their Country: And after that the Committee of Estates had sent such an Army unto England, as by the leaders therof, was professed to be so considerable, as was sufficient to prosecute their Resolutions in that Kingdom, without any further supply of Forces from this: Yet they have resolved upon, and prosecuted a new levy, with no less vio∣lence then the former, that they may wreith the yoke of their oppression
upon the necks of the Lords people, and bring the whole Kingdom in flavery and bondage: And though the Lord hath declared his wrath from heaven aginst these their resolutions and proceedings, by bringing their Army to so sudden and shameful on overthrow; yet do they still adhere unto, and pursue the same designs, and have not only brought within the bowels of this Kingdom the remnant of that godless and prophane Army, but have given Commission also to classed incendiaries and Rebels who served under the conduct of James Grahame to raise Forces, and by the whole tenure of their carriage, do make it appear to all who have eyes to see, that they do intend rather to involve the King∣dom in blood, then to be restrained in the persuit of their former wick∣ed resolutions. Therefore albeit the thoughts of peace be precious unto us, and that we wish and exhort every one to follow peace with all men as much as is possible; yet looking upon the eminent dangers that threaten Reli∣gion, the grievous oppressions that lies upon the Lords people in their Consciences, Persons and Estates, and the many fearful evils, that threat∣en both Kirk and Kingdom, if the remnant of these mens wrath be not restrained: We conceive that all the people of God are obliged and in∣gaged by Covenant, with their Lives and Estates, to endeavor and pur∣sue these following ends, and to oppose all the Enemies and Adversaries thereof; First, Because Religion is of all things the most excellent and precious, the securing thereof is to be most in our thoughts, and in the indeavors of all men, that it may be preserved unto us, and transmitted unto our posterity, in purity. Secondly, All are bound to defend and maintain the Liberties of the Kirk, which is the House of God, and the ground and Pillar of Truth. Thirdly, All are bound to vindicate the Liberties of the Subjects, in all these things which concern their Con∣sciences, Persons and Estates. Fourthly, There is no less obligation, care∣fully to maintain the Union betwixt the Kingdoms, and to avoid every thing that may weaken the same, or involve us in any measure of acces∣sion unto the guilt of these who have invaded the Kingdom of England. Fifthly, All are to indeavor the Kings Majesties Restitution to the ex∣ercise of his Royal Power, as soon as he shall give security for Religion, in the manner expressed in the desires of the late Commission of the Kirk, and shall give satisfaction in such other things as are necessary for the peace and safety of the Kingdom. Sixthly, All are to take a more ef∣fectual course then heretofore, for punishing and suppressing of all Ma∣lignancy,
injustice, iniquity, prophaness and impiety, and to indeavor, that the best and fittest remedies be applied for taking away the causes of these evils, and advancing Religion and Righteousness in the nd, and that those men who have been formerly instrumental in our present miseries and calamities, be not again admitted unto any such trust or power as may enable them to involve the Land in the same or the like Evils. These things are of such importance and consequence as that we know not what can be expected without them but a continuance and increase of our present miseries and calamities; And therefore seeing the Lord hath now put into the hands of his people such an opportuni∣ty, and made many willing in this day of his power: We do exhort and beseech all men, throughout the Land, by the mercies of God who hath not given us over unto death, but left us a nail in his holy place, that they would seriously mind, and to the utmost of their power pre∣fer these ends against all lets and impediments whatsoever, and oppose all these who stand for the engagement. In the beginning of this work the Lord stirred up the spirits of his people to joyn together and defend themselves against tyranny and oppression in these things which concerned their consciences and liberties; and albeit their power was but small, and the strength of adversaries great, yet because they did their duty in the simplicity of their hearts, and trusted in the name of the Lord, he was pleased to make the enemies melt as wax before the fire, and to vanish as smoak before the wind: And if after so many rich experiences of his assistance and rare testimonies of his loving kindness, and great deliverances out of troubles and solemn ingagements by vows and Covenants, we should sit still, or comply with those who have carryed on the ingagement in a time that threatens so much danger un∣to Religion, and so iminent ruin to our liberties, persons, and estates, we could not but be exceedingly guilty before the Lord, and deserve to be plagued as betrayers of the cause of God, and of the safety both of Kirk and State: Let us therefore arise, and do our duty, and the Lord of hosts, who hath already broken the power, and pride of our adversaries, shall be with us. A Ker.
Articles concluded upon by the Officers and Soldiers, now in Arms by authority of the Parliament of the Kingdom of Scotland. WE being servants to the State, and unwilling to ingage in a ci∣vil War, do conceive our selves obliged to remit the ways of prosecuting of all duties to Religion, and to our King, to the determi∣nation of Church and State: And let them move in it as they will be answerable to God: Our lives shall ever be ready to be exposed to all hazards for the good of both; and if all duties for them, and for our friends release in England, shall now be deserted, let the blame be∣fore God and men lie upon the obstructors of it: And if no further use be made of our service, We do demand, 1. That security be given to all, who are or have been ingaged in this service, for their Persons, Honors, and Estates, whereby they may be free from all dangers, prejudices, and censures whatsoever, whether Ec∣clesiastical or Civil, for their accession to the late Engagement, or any thing done by them relating thereunto, or to this service for our own defence: And this to be confirmed by Parliament, or the lawful Au∣thority of the Kingdom. II. That in regard of our extraordinary charges and loss; one Mo∣neths pay be instantly delivered unto us, for payment of the Irish For∣ces, and that Boats and Ships presently be provided for their transpor∣tation into Ireland: And for preventing all disorders upon their march through the West-Country by Free-quartering, We do desire that a regular course may be taken for their entertainment during their abode there, which shall be no longer then wind and weather shall serve, and Boats be provided to transport them.
III. That one Moneths means be provided for the Scottish Forces▪ and that they be not disbanded until the Irish Forces be transported; and that sufficient pledges be delivered for performance of what is de∣sired. And that our disbanding and transportation be done by Autho∣rity of the Committee of Estates. These reasonable demands being performed, We the Irish are ready instantly to march towards any part of the West coast which shall be thought most fit for our transportation into Ireland, and we of the Scottish, instantly to disband: Otherwise, rather then expose our Lives and Fortunes to the mercy of any, by the want of fitting assu∣rances for what is past, or the loss of our Honors by deserting the in∣terest of those commanded by, or joyned with us, We are resolved to sacrifice our selves at the dearest rates we can; And take God to wit∣ness how free we are of the guilt and consequences that may follow thereupon. Stirling 18. Septemb. 1648. We have appointed our Commissioners to stay no longer then six o clock at night, to morrow the 19. and that the Treaty shall then end; and that the Cessation shall expire eight hours thereafter, unless the De∣sires before-mentioned be fully granted. Signed by Warrant and Command of the Officers now in Arms by the Authority of Parliament, Jo: SPALDGUGE.
The Answer of the Noblemen and Gentlemen now in Armes for the Covenant, to the Articles of the Officers and Souldiers that joyned in the late unlawfull Engagement against England, and now continue in Armes to disturb the peace of this Kingdom. WEE have considered the desires of the Officers and Souldiers at Sterlin, and do return this an∣swer; That the Imputation of neglecting dutyes to Religion and to the King mentioned in the Preface to the Articles cannot be charged on Us, who have never been wanting in the use of all lawfull meanes, to prosecute the ends of our solemne League and Covenant: But upon those who joyned in prosecution of the late unlawfull Engagement against our neighbour Nation of England, which hath beene destructive to all these ends. Touching the first article, Wee referr you to the answer given in our former papers, and do here again declare, that we shall not challenge, nor incite any other to challenge any of your number for their lives and estates, but shall endeavour to secure them so far as we can without approbation of their actions, or the breach of Covenant and Treaties. As for that which concerns exemption from Church-censures, we cannot meddle therein without breach of Covenant, but must referr you to the Iudicatories of the Kirk, to whom you may make your own addresse, and receive their answer.
Concerning the second and third articles, we refer you to the answer given by our Commissioners to the Commissioners on your side, which was, that we held it unreasonable that they should desire any thing from us, or any other who adhere to us, for satisfaction of their Officers and Souldiers, because we will not involve our selves in any thing which may import an accession to the late engagement or may be the ground of a quarrell to England against this Kingdome; but if they had reall inclinations to Peace, they and their adherents might without our accession thereunto take course amongst them∣selves for giving satisfaction to their Officers and Souldiers, and therefore did desire (and do now again renew the same) that all their forces, and the forces of these who adhere unto them, may be disbanded betwixt and the twenty fifth, or at furthest the twenty eight day of this moneth of September, and that none of them be found together after that time, in Troops, Companies, or Regiments; and wee shall betwixt and the said day, disband all our Forces, and none of them after that time shall, bee found in Troopes Companyes, or Regiments; for the punctuall performance whereof on both sides, mutuall pledges are to bee given; and further we cannot say in an∣swer to these articles. If you shall not agree to the Desires made in our last papers of the 16 of this instant, and not rest satisfied with these An∣swers, but shall continue in Armes to the disturbance of the Peace of this Kingdom, and persist in the courses in which you are now engaged, contrary to the Declarations of the Generall Assembly & their Commissioners, we do hereby certify unto you, that all who have been active in the late Engagement, as well chose in England as those in this Kingdom, and all such as have or shall hereafter joyn with you, are to be declared enemies to both Kingdoms; and that this Kingdom will be necessitated to concurre with the Kingdom of England for punishing them ac∣cordingly as breakers of the Covenant and Treaties; and wee leave it to you seriously to consider whether the wayes and courses you are upon, bee really for the good of the King and this Kingdom, or a safe way for the releef of your friends that are prisoners in England.
We do declare that unlesse the Desires contayned in our pa∣pers of the 16 of this instant, and in this paper, be clearly and positively agreed unto, and wee advertised thereof before Fri∣day the 22 of this instant, at twelve of the clock in the day, that then the Treaty shall end, and that the Cessation from acts of hostility and marching of forces shall expire eight houres thereafter. September 20. 1648: Subscribed by command of the Noblemen and Gentlemen now in Arms for the Covenant. Mr Tho: Henderson. Edinburgh 22 September 1648. VVHereas many within this kingdom have joyned in Armes for prosecuting an unlawfull Engagement a∣gainst our Neighbour Nation of England, contrary to the So∣lemn League and Covenant, and Treaties between the King∣doms; the Warnings and Declarations of the Commission of the Generall Assembly 1647. And likewise against the unani∣mous proceedings and Declaritions of the late Generall Assem∣bly and their Commissioners. And whereas God hath evi∣dently manifested his displeasure and wrath against their sinfull wayes and proceedings, in oppressing the well-affected in this Kingdom, invading the Kingdom of England, by Routing and Defeating their Army there: and now some of their Army have returned to this Kingdom, and joyned with others their associate to disturb the peace thereof: By which their proceed∣ing▪ and actions, the work of Reformation of Religion hath been almost wholly overturned, the Liberty of the Subject very near destroyed, Authority weakned, the Person of the King
