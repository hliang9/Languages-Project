By the King. Trustie and welbeloued, wee greete you well: Although there be nothing more against our minde then to be drawne into any course that may breed in our subiects the least doubt of our vnwillingnes to throw any burthens vpon them, Hauing already published both by our speeches and writings, our great desire to auoide it in the whole course of our gouernment: yet such is our Estate at this time, in regarde of great and vrgent occasions falne and growing dayly vpon vs (in no sort to be eschewed) as wee shall be forced presently to disburse greater summes of money then it is possible for vs to prouide by any ordinary meanes, or to want without great preiudice. Jn which consideration, seeing no man of any indifferent iudgement or vnderstanding, can either plead ignorance how much woe found the Crowne exhausted by the accidents of Forreine warres, and inward rebellions, Or on the other side doth not obserue the visible causes of our dayly expence euer since wee came into this Kingdome, Wee thinke it needlesse to rose any more arguments from such a King to such Subiects: But that as our necessitie is the onely cause of our Request, So your loue and duety must be the chiefe motiue of your ready performance of the same. To which woe may further adde one thing, which is no lesse notorious to the Realme, that since wee came to this Estate, no one meanes or other of extraordinarie helpe hath beene affourded vs, notwithstanding more extraordinarie occasions of large Expence, one falling on the necke of another without time or respiration, then euer lighted vpon any King of this Realme. A matter whereof wee make not mention as proceeding from the coldnesse of our people affections, of whose seruice and fidelitie in the highest points wee haue had so cleere proofe, But rather as a circumstance the better warranting this course, seeing the ordinarie fourme of Subsidies offered to Princes in Parliament, caried with it now that inconuenience of burthening the poorer sort of our people, which wee doe endea∣uour to eschew by all the wayes wee can. You shall therefore vnderstand, that in this consideration, and in respect of our opinion of your good minde towards vs, howsoeuer the omission in the former time to repay some loane, in regard of vnexpected violent necessities, might make a doubtfulnesse now that promise should be kept, we haue persuaded oneselues that you will no way measure our Princely resolution by the precedent accidents, nor euer doubt of vs when wee engage that word yet neuer broken to any, which now wee doe hereby giue for repayment of whatsoeuer this Priuie Seale of ours shall assure you. That which we require therefore is, that within twelue dayes after the receipt hereof, you will cause the summe of Twenty pounde to bee deliuered to  Charles Cornwallis knt▪ whom we haue appointed to bee our Collector in our Countie of Norffolk: The loane whereof, we doe desire to be vntill the foure and twenty day of March which shalbe in the yeere of our Lord God 1605. For assurance whereof, we haue directed these our letters of Priuie Seale vnto you, which, with the hand of our sayde Collector testifying the receipt of the same summe of Twenty pound shal binde vs, our heires, and successors, for the repaiment thereof, and shall be an immediate warrant to our Exchequer to pay the same vnto you, or your Assignes, vpon the deliuerie of this our Priuie Seale  our sayd Receipt. Giuen vnder our Priuie Seale at our Palace of Westminster the last day of July, in the second yeere of our reigne  Ireland, and of Scotland the eight and thirtieth.
