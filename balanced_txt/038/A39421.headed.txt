Charles R. RIGHT trusty and welbeloved, and Trusty and welbeloved, We greet you well. We are in∣formed that there are several persons who go un∣der the name of Quakers, or other names of sepa∣ration, now in the Gaols for London and Middlesex, for being at unlawfull Assemblies, who yet profess all Obedience and Allegiance unto Us. We would be glad that all Our Sub∣jects could be brought to agree in an Uniform Worship of God; and We hope that the foresight of the Dangers which they runne into by a willfull contempt of the Laws, and Our pre∣sent indulgence, may prevail with some of these persons, to reduce them to a better Conformity: And therefore We do willingly lay hold of this time and occasion of publick Joy for the first coming of Our dear Consort the QUEEN to Our Royal Palace at Westminster, to Declare this Our Royal pleasure unto you, That you cause all such of the said persons in Our Gaols for London and Middlesex, who have not been Indicted for refusing the Oath of Allegiance, nor shall appear to you to have been Ringleaders or Preachers at their Assemblies, to be enlarged. Given at Hampton-Court this 22th day of August. 1662. By His Majesties Command. Edward Nicholas. To Our Right trusty and welbeloved and to Our Trusty and welbeloved the Lord Mayor of London, and others our Commissioners and Justi∣ces for the Gaol-delivery of Oier and Terminer and of the Peace in Our City of London and County of Middlesex. Printed by James Flesher, Printer to the Honourable City of London.
