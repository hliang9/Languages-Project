A more full Relation of the great Victory obtained by our Forces neer Worcester: The taking the City of Worcester, and to∣tall routing of the Scotch Army. SIR, THe account I gave you by the last Messenger, though it was rude and un∣pollished, yet it was a true one as to the Narrative of the Victorie God hath blessed us with; only the particulars were wanting, which I have here inclosed. Our men went on very resolutely, and possest themselves of Worcester by
eight of the clock on Wednesday night, onely there were about one thousand three hundred who fled to the Castle Mount, who surren∣dred themselves  mercy, next morning. The Mercy is highly seasonable and glorious; and though in the Field we kil'd more then we tooke Prisoners; Yet up∣on entering the Town after the Souldiers fury was over, there were multitudes Prisoners, as in the List inclosed you may see. We heare of many that are taken by Major Generall Harrison, Colonell Lil∣burne, and the Countrie people. I hope the Lord will deliver if not all of them, yet most into our hands, so that few shall escape. What shall we returne unto the Lord for
his great kindnesse, his mercies ne∣ver faile. I suppose we are now drawing a little neerer you. The last newes from Scotland is great al∣so; Old Lesley, Crawford, Linsey, Ogleby, with divers of qualitie, be∣sides three hundred taken that were making Levies to raise the Siege at Dundee. This is in great hast; but the full of all things that I know. I am most faithfully yours, ROBERT STAPYLTON. Worcester, Septem. 5. 1651. For my deare friend, Cap∣taine George Bishop, these at Whitehall. Hast, hast.
