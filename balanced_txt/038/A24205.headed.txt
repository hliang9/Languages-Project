Of the Eclipses this Year, 1674. THere will happen five Eclipses this Year, viz. three of the  and two of the Moon, but all of them invisible to us, except one. The first, is an Eclipse of the Moon, which happens upon Munday, the 12 of June, about 5 aclock in the morning. Hence at Edinburgh▪ H. M. S. The beginning of the Eclipse is at 15 13 36 The greatest Obscuration is 16 45 49 The end of the Eclipse is 18 18 8 This wll be an visible Lunar Eclipse to the inha∣bitants of Sya, Germany France, Holand, Denmark, Great Brittain and Ireland &c. The second is an Eclipse of the Sun, the 26 of Ja∣nuary about 9 a clock at night. And therefore it will be invisible to us, yet it may be seen in Amei . The third is an Eclipse of the Moon, the 7 day of July about 8 aclock at nigh, so that the Moon rises E∣clipsed▪ and though the beginning will not, yet the latter end will be visible if clouds, &c. interpose not The fourth is an Eclipse of the Sun, the 23 day of Jul, about 2 aclock in the morning. And the fifth and last is another Eclipse of the Sun, about 5 in the morning; But because these last Solar Eclipses are invisible to the inhabitans of Great Britt therefore I forbear to speak any more of them.
A Brief description of the four Quarters, Seasons of this Year, 1674. Of the Spring. THe Spring Quarter begins at the entrance the Sun into the Equinoxial sign Aries, whi is upon the 10 of March 20 min. past 4 in the mor¦ning, making the days and nights equal in length. Of Summer. SUmmer Quarter taketh its beginning when the Sun entreth the Tropical sign Cancer, which is up∣on the  day of June, 4 min. past 7. in the morning when the days are at the longest. Of Harvest. AUtumne or Harvest Quarter, taketh its begin∣ning when the Sun entreth the Equinoctial sign Libra, which happeneth the 12 of September, 27. min. past 10. at night, the day and night being equal in length. Of Winter. VVinter Quarter taketh its beginning when the Sun entereth the Tropical sign Capri∣corn, which upon the 11 of December, 30. min past 10 in the morning, the days at that time being at the shortest, and the nights at the longest. Concerning the Lord of this Year and Quarters. AT the desire of certain Persons I have set down here the Lord of the Year, or of this Annual re∣volution, with the Lords of the Quarters, by e∣recting figures, for the entrance of the ☉ Sun into the four Cardinal signes ♈ Aries ♋ Cancer ♎ Libra, ♑ Capricorn; and to the time of the Lunatious pre∣ceeding and succeeding the ☉ Sun entrance into the same signs, which done, I find ♃ Jupiter Lord of the Spring, with ♄ Saturn partner. Secondly
Lord of the Summer, and partner ♃ Jupiter. ly, for Autumne, ♄ Saturn, and partner ☽ Luna,  or the Winter, ♄ Saturn, Lord & partner ♂ Mars, nence for the Lord of the Year, I find ☉ Sun  h his two partners ☿ Mercurius and ♂ Mars.  erve, When ♄ Saturn is Lord of the year, and  dignified, the people shal during that yea  revolution, build and erect houses, shal make many alterations in Fabricks, shal abound in all things, the Earth shal be fruitful, and the people al be in esteem, and honored by their neighbors. And the Husband-men shal exceedingly increase their store and wealth, and be succesful in all their labors. But if he be watery and afflicted, there shal be much cold, great and grievous infirmities, and men shal sustain much sorrow losses and cros∣ses; and great damnage by storms and rain, and wind (but this must warrily be considered, if other significators of weather concurr, thou may assuredly onclude it to be so) ancients and old men, and wo∣en shal die, and these things shal chiefly happen,  these places, Cities & Regions, under ♄ Saturn his ominion, & the dominion of the sign which be doth ossess. Secondly as he is accordingly placed in the 12 oules (as in this revolution in the second) & if held  the fortunat Aspects of the Lord of the second,  denots the succesful and prosperous condition of  comon people in their rads and merchandising  they shal thrive & grow richt especially in such things as are signified by the sign wherein the cup of the second is. If he be therein weak, impd,  unforunat, he shal signifie contrairy, and that the people shal be poor, have losses and crosses, espe∣cially in such things as are singified by ♄ Saturn, and e sign wherein he is, for according to the nature  the sign and planet therein must you give judge∣nt
