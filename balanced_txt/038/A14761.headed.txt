Short Grounds of CATECHISME: Delivered by way of Question and Answer, with plaine proofes for the Answer set downe at large. By WILLIAM WARD Minister of the Word at Guysbrough in Cleave land within Yorkesh re. IOB 5 last. Lo, this we have searched, and so it is: heare it, and know it for thy good. ACTS 17. 11. These were more noble then they of Thessalonica, re∣ceiving the Word withall alacritie, daily searching the Scriptures whether those things were so. CAMBRIDGE: Printed by the Printers to the Ʋniversitie. 1027.
TO THE READER. ALthough there be Catechismes enough, whom I might have followed in teaching our Chil∣d yet I though: fitter to choose that, which our Mo∣ther the Church hath com∣mended to us for that purpose, and which in truth, containes the grounds as rightly deci∣phered and truely disposed as any other; so as for all manner of Explanation, Confirmation, and Enlargement, I could not have followed a better Guide: Having therefore conceived such Questions as I thought fittest to explaine the severall foundations of Catechisme, and sought out according to my weake ability some places of Scripture, (the onely true foundation of our Faith) to confirme the conscience  very point, both of Faith and of Obedience, desiring that the Youth might learne and have in memory, as well the holy Scriptures confir∣ming, as the Doctrines thereby confirmed, I perceived it was both a wearisome trouble to
them to search and w ut so many places, (and our lazie daies are hardly drawne to la∣borious workes especially in matters of Religi∣on) and also the places, though truely quoted, were often so unfuly and obscurely extracted through their weakenesse, as it required a se∣cond labour to unteach their mistakings: for this onely purpose I resolved, (to which other∣wise I should never have been drawne) to offer it to the Presse; hping that (seeing custome hath bred a willingnesse to commit Catechismes to memorie) it will be no small instruction to youth, to have in readines in their hearts plain places of holy Scripture, to confirme every maine point of our Profession. For my doing herein, I have for president Bucaeus, who hath in like sort done; this excepted, that I have neither with him brought in any testimo∣nie without the Scriptures, nor (except verie seldome) from the Apochryphall, as beeing in∣sufficient for foundation, howsoever of holy and profitable instruction. What is done for thy good take in good part, and the Lord blesse it to thy edification for his Christs sake. Thine in the Lord, W. WARD.

Q. How is it then said, The Lawe is not given to the righteous man? A. It meanes, that the Law condemnes not righteous workes. Gal. 5. 22. The fruit of the Spirit, is love, joy, peace,—goodnesse, meekenesse, tem∣perance, against such there is no Law. Q. How are wee then at liberty from the Law? A. Wee are freed from the impossible conditions of the Law. Rom. 8. 2. The Law of the Spirit of life in Christ Iesus, hath freed me from the law of sinne and death:—that, that which was im∣possible in the Law, in as much as it was weake, because of the flesh. Q. What conditions? A. First, we need not seeke to be iustifi∣ed by the Law. Rom. 3. 20. By the workes of the Law shall no flesh be justified. & vers. 28. Gal. 2. 16.

As many as have sinned in the Law, shall be judged by the Law. 1. Tim. 1. 9. The Law is given to the lawlesse and disobedient: to the ungodly sinners, unruly, prophane, murtherers; &c. Q. What else? A. To let man see the uglines and hor∣ror of sinne. Gal. 3. 19. The law was added because of transgression. Rom. 3. 20. The Law entred—that the offences should abound. & 7. 13. That sinne might be out of measure sinfull by the Commandement. Q. To what use serves this? A. To a destroy our carnall confidence, and make us b seeke unto Christ to bee ju∣stified. a Rom. 7. 9. When the commandement came, sinne revived, but I died, and the same commandement was found unto mee
unto death. b Gal. 3. 24. The law was our Schoolemaster unto Christ. Rom. 10. 4. Christ is the ende of the Law for righte∣ousnesse. Q. Is there no further use of the Law? A. Yea, it is a rule a of direction, b to be obeyed with c reverence.. a Pro. 6. 23. The Commandement is a lant-horne, and instruction, a light—and the way of life. Psal. 119. 15.

The grace of God that bringeth salvation—teacheth us to denie ungodlinesse, and worldly lusts, and to live soberly, righteously, and godly in this world. c 1. Pet. 1. 17. If ye call God Father, passe the time of your dwelling here in feare. Q. What doth it teach us? A. The wayes of a righteousnesse, and the b knowledge of sinne. a Psal. 37. 31. The law of his God is in his heart, his steps shall not slide. Esa. 51. 7. Hearken ye that know righteousnesse, in whose heart is my law. b Rom. 3. 20. By the Law came the knowledge of sinne. & 7. 7. I knew not sinne but by the Law. Q. What is the generall scope of the Law?
