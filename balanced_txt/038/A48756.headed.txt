A LIVELY POURTRAICT OF OUR New-Cavaliers, Commonly Called PRESBYTERIANS. CLEARLY SHEWING, That His MAIESTY came not in up∣on their Account. In a Compendious Narrative of our late Revolutions. printer's device with crown surmounting spread-winged bird LONDON, Printed in the Year, 1661.
A Lively POURTRAICT OF OUR NEW CAVALIERS, Commonly Called PRESBYTERIANS. NOT, in the least, to blemish the loyalty of any, who (late, indeed, but seasonably,) became Proselytes, And, with subsequent Merits, can∣celled the memory of their former Errours, Yet, for that many Persons of unbyassed Principles, are apt to be misled with this vulgar Prejudice, That the Presbyterians were the Principal In∣struments of his Majesties Restauration, From the jealousie and disdain, which, (as a passionate Lover of his Majesty,) I conceive at the very mention of such a Rival, And for the Vindication of that Cause and Party, which is dearer to me than my life, I shall under∣take to disprove it, by reporting Naturally, the whole Series of their Behaviour, and deriving the Pedigree of Affairs, since the War. It must be acknowledged, That, from the time, when the two great Factions began first Visibly to sever, Though a few, the most Noble and ingenious of them, were early convinced of their mi∣stake,
in seeking to reform alawful Government, by an unlawfull War, And endeavoured worthily to attone their guilt; Others, observing the tendency of Affairs to infinite Violence and Perplex∣ity, became more wary, or, (as they termed it,) Moderate; Yet the Actions of that Party, for the mayn, declared, that they were still fierce with Victory, and without Remorse; True it is, that finding, by degrees their own Impotency to quell the spirits which they had raised or govern the Mutiny of their Souldiers, without an Establishment; And withal supposing, that the King, being un∣der their Custody, would not, at his Peril, reject their Propositions, how hard of digestion soever they were; They sent him Conditions to sign, but not to consider, much lesse debate; Nor was it long, that they continued in this friendly Mood, But being easily scared by the Army, desisted from their Treaties; And, some Months after, the Vote of Non-Addresses passed both Houses, in full Carreer, which, what pretence or glosse soever may be given it, (sure I am,) It pro∣ved a Petemptory Summons before Sentence, and an apt Prologue to our succeeding Tragedy, For, the King being once cast off, the Captive was, afterwards, easily disposed of. In the year 1648. the great Imposture being, by this time, clearly unmasked, many others, who, at first, no question, meant sincerely, peceiving the total miscarriage of their unadvised Zeal, withdrew themselves from their Faction, and frankly sided with the Roya∣lists; Who, by this Accession of Interests, and other probable In∣ducements, were encouraged, (though with disadvantage e∣nough) once more to Arme, for the prevention of so great and im∣pendent Mischiefs; Suddenly the whole Kingdom was full of Insur∣rections upon this Account, seconded with a powerful Invasion from Scotland; And now, or never, (I take it,) was the Critical hour, for our Pretenders, to have expressed their Loyalty; Kingly Govern∣ment then gasping, and the sacred head being visibly exposed; But, (contrarywise,) we felt their hands, in many places, heavier upon us, than the Independents, And, in Committees, especially, they acted with all the violence imaginable. The Scotish Army being defeated, and the Royalists, every where, suppressed, the best Issue, that any good Englishman could now presage, was very fatal; For though the Factions might seem to dif∣fer, much like those on Shooters-hill, some of them inclining only to bind the Traveller, and leave him helplesse in the adjacent Woods, Others, for their greater security from pursuit, determining
rather to kill him outright, Yet they agreed in the main design, (viz.) Robbery; The milder sort of them, indeed, calmly dissented from the Murther, professing to abhor the needlese effusion of Royal Blood. But, whilst the opposed only came Negotiations, to re∣solute Actions, (as it commonly happens in Counsel, so managed,) Fury took Place. And, without interruption, finished that accursed Parricide. The Presbyterians seemed generally to be surprised, and even Planetstruck, with this deadly blow, Nor could they, patiently, en∣dure the Scandal of being accounted Privy, much lesse Parties to the Action, or Contrivance; As if, (forsooth) they wondred to see him slain by others, whom, themselves had sorely threatned, and, in effect, out-lawed; Yet, had the Tragedy proved only personal, or had sweet Aristocrasie next succeeded, together with Parochial Episcopacy, it is possible, the Pill might have been swallowed: But the Independent Party, having projected other designs, and resol∣ving to go through-stitch with their work, by the old Principle of Root and Branch, laboured, together, with Monarchy, to reform, (viz.) extirpate Peerage, Scattering withal, or rather sowing, the popular seeds of toleration, which made the Breach, in appearance, irreparable; However, (after a breathing space, civilly allowed them,) the tumour, of it self, began to asswage; For many of the dissenting Brethren, judging it, I suppose, unseemly for them to continue long in a state of discord, and professing, that they would not stand upon Punctilios, where the publick was concerned, were, in a short time reconciled to their enchanted Seats; Wherein the great Bug-bear of the times, (viz.) the Common Enemy, was of singular advantage to them both: Wherefore, that all pretences might be duely acco∣modated, and a certain Decorum in Affairs preserved, (as it were by implicite Contract or Consent) whilst the Military Charge re∣mained with Independents, as the surer Cards, the Civil Authori∣ty with all its preheminencies rested still with Presbyterians, as the soberer Party, who had, likewise, a Major Vote in the Junto. Matters of Civil Policy being thus compounded, one would mar∣vel, that the Spiritual should break any squares, or that either Par∣ty should be much troubled with a case of Conscience; But as the Puloits had all along served other ends, than that of Religion, so, now, it should seem, the Clergy of those times, (pardon me if I mistake their quality,) finding themselves utterly disappointed of
that Dominion, which they first aspired to, and fearing yet a further downfal, by the daily growth of Independency, in despair of compas∣sing their wishes by that Junto, which was awed by an Army, not of their Complexion, stirred up in the People, (especially their own Disciples,) a new disaffection to their Rulers; Wherein, being animated from Scotland, they boldly Preached up the Covenant, which they had kept in Lavender for this or the like Occasion; And, since they thought fit to remember their Covenant, they could not fairly forget their King, who (amongst other matters of deeper design) was herein mentioned, (as it were, of Course,) with reference to the times, for which it was first calculated: Wherefore, on a sudden the Presbyterians grew very troublesome, And something they offered at, upon these Accounts, But with what kindnesse to his Majesty, I leave to any mans Judgement, For their Jealousie of the Royal Interest increasing, (especially after their disaster at Dun∣bar,) instantly, they rather recoyled, than retreated, And, with their Numbers, Oppressed the King at Worcester, chusing rather to run their Risquo with the Sectaries, whom hey hated, than take their Fortune with his Majesty, whom they feared. Immediately upon this Miscarriage, Scotland being subdued by the Forces of the Independents, The Interest of that Faction grew so prevalent, And their pretences so exorbitant, As involved all Persons, of what Judgement soever, if either they had Estates, Professions, or common foresight, in an equal concernment to op∣pose such encroaching Anarchy, And, thereby, afforded Cromwell both a stirrop of great Advantage, and a convenient cloak for his Usurpation, The People being Weather beaten, and willing to Anchor any where for present shelter; But still it was with this no∣table difference, That, whilst all good Englishmen looked upon themselves as cast upon a remote and barbarous Island, where they could not, or would not dwell; The Presbyterians, for the Major Part, judging, it seems, that they were at home, set up their Rests and pitched their Tents there: And though all things did not fully answer their humours (which are hard to please,) Yet, having lear∣ned to permit somewhat to necessity, and share what they could not engrose they found, (or rather made,) their condition very comfortable, Many of them, who had the faculty of shifting, and varying their forms, (as Sects and Insects are, alike, apt to do,) kept steady footing in the Government, For, if the times did not comply with them, they, (to be sure,) would comply with the times;
Such, (being, no doubt, the choicest factours of Tyranny,) were the Usurpers own Creatures, and possessed the chief Dignities & Offices of State: All that had been once Roundheads, and would but hold their tongues, were countenanced in their several Wayes, And, if they could swallow a Gudgeon, sure of great Preserments, as they fell, However justified in all their illegal Possessions; The Le∣vites, with their odd Addresses, and Doctrines, magnifying some∣times the Piety and Justice, sometimes the Policy and Prowesse of their Benefactour, were, by him, reciprocally entertained, as good Mussulmen, with due encouragement, And to humour them throughout, their Pulpit Phrases, Gestures, and Tones, were de∣voutly imitated and grew in fashion at the Court: Those, that pre∣tended to be clogged with Principles, and could not walk up to the perfection of others, (being not very Numerous,) passed under the favourable Notion of tender Consciences, or weak Brethren, Be∣twixt whom, and the Usurper, there was alwayes this General un∣derstanding of each other, He, in his part, desired to shew them, He took them not for Royalists, they, on their part, to satisfie him, That he had no reason to distrust them: In sum, The many Cour∣tesies, which that Party did him in the Junto 1657. with testifie up∣on Record, That they were not utterly at defiance with him: On the other side, the Royalists, (unshaken in their Fidelity, and unpolluted with the General Corruption, whether by Confederacy, Consent, or Compliance,) reasonably enough supposing, That, the Popular Basis once undermined, such Paper-buidings could not long continue, took heart again, And, (being withal ensnared, by the Sepentine Practices of some Professours,) freely embar∣barqued themselves in great and hazardous designs to bring in the King; Which, being rather nipped, than suppressed, were fre∣quently resumed, Every Year the Common Gaols were filled with Cavaliers, whereof, such as the Tyrant could convict by the Justice of those times, were, accordingly, dispatched, such as he ve∣hemently suspected, were sent to Plantations, and remote Prisons, such, as were only in his general List, after some months durance, went out upon Bail, till the next Summons, or Warrant to appre∣hend them, And this, I take it, may serve, at least, for a Landship of that strangely blended, and Promiscuous Scene. After the Decease of Oliver Cromwel, It cannot be forgotten, with what reluctancy, the Souldiers and Phanaticks were brought to acknowledge his Son Richard, whom, soon after, they contemptu∣osly
discarded: The Souldiers Objected, That they had never known him in Arms, And that he was a Stranger to their Cause and Merit; The Fanaticks found him not for their turn, And were not willing to hazard their Affairs with him, in whose Experience or Conduct, they could no way confide; But the Presbyterians judging him to be naturally of their Principle, However, of soft Me∣tal, and altogether dependant on their Interest, (as if their Sure were now Trump again) made him their Prince, And inclined, certainly, to have laid themselves and their Country at his Feet, For the Pulpits, (the Oracles of Presbytery) recommended him to the People, as a man after Gods own heart. With the Fortune of Richard, fell all the hopes of the Presby∣terians, For, in Junto's it was easily perceived, they would be o∣vermatched by those of the other faction, who were backed by the Army, and furnished with better Notions, as to the present pur∣pose, than they; And, from a free State, (if such a Chymaera could then be fancied,) their Prospect was yet more unpleasant. Their Empire being, on all sides, rejected, as the least tolerable of any, that had been propounded; So as now they were put to find out a new Bottom, or rather an Expedient to preserve themselves, if not as Presbyterians, yet as men. Hitherto, I suppose their Modesty will not pretend much of Loyalty; For making use only of their ambidextrous Covenant, some∣times by adhering to the Letter, sometimes by pursuing (as they said,) the main End, (viz.) Reformation, They hovered, like a Cloud, uncertain where it should drop, and lurked, as it were, in Ambuscade, (like the Germane Boors, near a Battel,) ready to pillage either Party, when a disaster befell them; But now, consult∣ing rather the present State and Exigence of Affairs, than their own Principles, or former Practises, They found a necessty of engage∣ing, or remaining at the discretion of the Victour; For, on the one fide, they saw a desperate faction, supported by a great Army, which must be maintained with Rapine, so as none could, in reason hope to be Innocent, that was rich, nor safe from them, but by adventu∣ring with them; Besides, that Tythes, and Colledges, being, in dis∣course, swallowed, as the first sweet Morsel, gave a shrill Alarm, Especially to their Ministers, who, surely, were not silent, or sloathful in communicating their fears; On the other side, they found the People violently inclined to the King, exasperated with their Burthens, weary of Unsettlement, and fearful of extreme Anar∣chy
The Royalists full of fresh hopes, and ready for some notable Effort; And the King, (to whose Justice they saw themselves very obnoxious, in case they endeavoured to make no Attonement,) not like to be long destitute of reasonable Aid, by the general disband∣ing of Souldiers in Foraign Parts; Wherefore, (not to sit dry, as they say, betwixt two great Rivers, (they Chose to espouse his Ma∣jesties, as the safer and nobler Interest, being grounded on an En∣glish Basis, which they observ'd the other wanted; But how lamely they proceeded, Let the year 1659 declare; For, though they knew; what reasonable expectations were from them who had boasted so much, And who indeed could come more easily to a Rendezvous, than the Royalists to a Private meeting, Though, for their encouragement, the right hand of Fellowship was civilly af∣forded them, Their Atchievements, alas, were very Abortive; And, if we may judge from our Enemies Intelligence, by which they proceed to apprehend suspected Persons, It will soon appear, where the Burthen lay. Indeed, though some particular Persons of them Acted, at that time, very clearly and honourably, yet the greater Number were, (at best,) Luke-warm, many Subtle ones, forejudging, I presume, the Event of a Free Parliament, (then contended for,) declined the Enterprise; The Rigid Presbyterians, openly, branded it with Malignancy, And divers of their most famous Ministers, particular∣ly those in Leicestershire, published an Addresse to the Junto then sitting, with their names subscribed, beseeching them, that the un∣advisednesse of a few might not prejudice the integrity of many, who still soberly adhered to their first Principles of a Godly Magi∣stracy and Ministery; So as, admitting the Faction to be more nu∣merous, then, I trust, it is, Yet the Dissentours being so many, And the tempers of the rest so various, I suppose their Endeavours might appear, perhaps the more generous, but could not be conside∣rable, in proportion with the Royalists, who so freely engaged. From the Ruines of this design (how dismall soever they appear∣ed,) there sprung an unforeseen, but considerable, advantage to the Kings Affairs, For Lambert, having, thereby, gotten a new Rise of Fortune and Reputation with the Army, And finding by late ex∣amples, how easy and cheap it was to Usurp, especially, where the Usurpation could not be more unwarrantable, or intollerable, than the Authority it self, was incouraged to thrust out that Junto, and set up a Committee of his own, with a purpose, no doubt, to follow
the very traces of Oliver; Wherein the whole fraternity, of Fana∣ticks, (Presbyterians excepted,) firmly adhered to him, as their great Captain, and Patron, who was to finish that work, which o∣thers had left imperfect, (viz.) the Subversion of all our Foundati∣ons both in Church, and State; In order whereunto, the Confiding Party must be first refined, And the Notion of Malignancy spread as far, as Policy, or Avarice could extend it; In which danger sure∣ly none were so near concerned as the New-Cavaliers (they being a fresh booty) but especially the famous City of London, whose sack, it was visible, the Souldiers gaped for, And their Masters were not very unlike to gratifie them therewith: Wherefore, if they would not altogether renounce their Senses, They were obli∣ged (as their last refuge) wholy to mingle Counsels with the Roy∣al Party, and unite themselves to that Cause, which was then very Popular, And could only in appearance give check to so foul and fierce a Monster, Or rescue them from Captivity, under those, that measure the Rights of others by their own Lusts. In this Confusion of Interests, enervating and supplanting each other, His Grace, the Duke of Albemarle, (who, with profound Secrecy, had, till then, reserved himself for such a Juncture,) wisely judged, That Now was his only Opportunity of Acting, For in dissipating the Fanaticks, by the Collision of Parties, He should Cut the Sinews of Faction, and advance prosperously, upon their Bellies, towards freedome, and lawful settlement; And, though to vanquish an Army, so resolved, and appointed, with slender Troops, on which he could little rely, seemed almost impossible, Yet, sup∣plying his want of Forces, by his Conduct, and correcting their stubbornesse with Excellent Discipline, with great assurance, he committed the Event to Providence; The Authority he made use of, was that of the late Junto, which, (how frivolous soever in it self,) was the best then in being, And, indeed, afforded him suffi∣cient colour against his Enemy, who acted mutinously under that Commission, From thence, therefore he determined to take his Rise, by the Example of good Builders, who, to erect a lofty Fa∣brick, lay the Foundation low, Foreseeing, no doubt, That as Lam∣bert, and his Confederates were very Guilty to the Powers, by them interrupted; Those Powers were no lesse obnoxious to the Excluded Members, And they again to an entire Parliament; So that publick interest, being one in motion, probably would never rest, till, by continual progresse it came to center in our Antient
and Natural Constitutions. His Successe was suitable to the Merit of his design; For, by Civil Stratagems, added to his Military Ex∣perience, Temporising, and Amusing his Enemy with uncertain Treaties, he soon dissolved that Veterane Army, without hazarding so much as a Skirmish. This, indeed, was a fair and Auspicious Introduction to better things, But, alas, Our deliverance was as yet, a meer Embrio, And, (if here forsaken,) Subject to fatal miscarriage; Whereof his Grace being very sensible, he resolved to perfect it, by comming with his Victorious Army to London: His Pretence was very favourable, (viz.) The final Suppression of the Fanaticks, who otherwise might easily be encouraged to make head again, Wherefore, be∣twixt taking, and asking leave, preventing resistance, or denyal, with a Sober and Orderly Expedition, he advanced Southward, But, in his March, received Addresses of all kinds, with such Indifferent Behaviour, and Answers so like Oracles, as, at once, gave Courage to his Friends, yet Hope to his Enemies, and brought him, undis∣covered, to his Journeys End; Where acting, Yet, for a time, the same Person, having, by an unheard of Stratagem, throughly felt the Pulses of the People, and caught the Malicious in their own Net; He seasonably appeared, what he alwayes was, A Perfect Lover of his Country. In the Glory of which enterprise, (the most fortunate and me∣morable of our times,) Let not any Party or Faction pretend to share; It being fresh in our Memories, That neither Presbyterians, nor Royalists were so Convinced, or Satisfied of his Graces Inten∣tions, (the Disguisal whereof was then his Masterpiece,) that they thought it fit, or safe for them, to engage with him, But the whole Nation stood musing, in a kind of Trance, full of various thoughts, and discourses concerning him, Inclining, doubtlesse to wish him well, Yet rather desirous, to know why. The Welcome of this Notable Deliverance both from present and future Violences, was Celebrated with unusual Triumphs: For, as well the People in general, as the Royal Party, being therewith surprised, could scarce contain themselves, but were transported with Excesse of Joy, Wherein the Presbyterians seemed also to par∣take; But (like Persons, who debauching over night, are Crop-sick the next morning,) No sooner was the publick security digested, but they began immediately to consult the concernments of their Faction, And examine, Whether the Liberty, long desired, and then
expected by the People, would not blast, and finally frustrate their hopes, which were inconsistent with such Liberty; Many of their Countenances betrayed a kind of Chagrin, or secret regret, which, for shame, they must not own, And accordingly, from henceforth, their Businesse was, not so much to bring in his Majesty, (which no Endeavours of theirs could greatly expedite, or obstruct,) As to contrive and limit the Manner of his Entrance, that it might serve their purposes: His Grace, (no question,) knew a Part of their minds, And, to make his Passage, as clear as might be, resolved to gratifie them, in all things consistent with his design; Wherefore, pursuing his Method of effecting that, securely, by degrees, which could not, (without manifest hazard,) be, at once, accomplished, Instead of a new and free Election, (the Popular pretence,) He per∣mitted the Members, excluded in 1648. to take their places, and Act as a House of Commons, without the Lords, But, first agreed with them of a time of Session so short, as might afford them no latitude to consider ought, but what was in Order to their own disso∣lution, and the Summons of a freer Convention, Keeping that other Expedient, as a reserve, in Case they should herein prevaricate with him. The Excluded Members were, generally, Persons, who, by long Experience, had acquired much Prudence, and Moderation; And great Matters were in reason expected from them, whom it highly concerned, at length, to perform their Vowes, and redeem their ho∣nours; Yet, (Whether they only yielded to the Iniquity of the times, (as many alleadged,) Or (as others doubted,) their teeth were still on Edge with the sower Grapes, they had once eaten,) Certain it is, That the Subscription by them imposed in the Settle∣ment of their Militia, And their narrow Confinement of Elections be excluding even the Sons of Royalists, afforded matter of much Scandal, and evil Prognostick, That they only wanted Elbow-room for further Severity; Neither, indeed, was their unwillingnesse to quit their beloved Seats, without special Notice; But they soon made amends for all, by their much desired dissolution, Commit∣ting the Interval of Government to a Select Counsel of Estate. During which Interval, the great Argument of our Cabales was this, viz. What would be the force of those Shackles, wherewith both Parliament and Militia were then charged; There being scarce ever the like Engines of Faction, invented, by the late Refiners; so as most of those, whose Complexions were not sanguine, pre∣saged
that all the satisfaction we had swallowed, must be vomited up again: His Grace was generally acquitted, as having done his part, for it could not be expected, that he should inspire Parlia∣ments, it was for him sufficient, that rescuing them from outward interruptions, he both enabled, and directed them to do good: But, whilst matters thus continued in great suspense, it pleased God to send a strong East wind, with a Spring-tide of Loyalty, which overwhelmed all those Banks and Damms, wherein the Po∣lititians thought themselves so secure: For the Royalists, rightly ap∣prehending, that then was the very Crisis of their future hopes, some of them generously despising those Qualifications, which un∣der great Penalties disabled them, others, most industriously assist∣ing in Elections; The People perceiving and declining the snare; and his Grace continually favouring the Cause of Freedom, as the only Groundwork of his Proceeding, the Major Vote of that Par∣liament, (by Gods Blessing,) proved such, as hath produced the Peace and happinesse we now enjoy. Had his Majesty lain at the Presbyterians feet, it is probable e∣nough, they would, at length, have brought him in, if not out of Loyalty, yet for quietnesse sake, since, without him, they found, there could be no Settlement; But, then, he must have taken Con∣ditions from them, and such, as would have rendred, it doubtful, whether a Diadem, so qualified and Circumscribed, were worth his acceptance; The Church must have been relinquished, and all the Sacriledge of the times established, with his consent; His Par∣ty forsaken, and condemned as Felons; Laws should have been made, and executed only in his name: Upon these, and other the like Agreements, he might, perhaps, have obtained an honourable Pension, together with a Writ of ease; That whilst he Reigned, they might Rule, as a kind of Ephori; So that, at best, they may be said to have contributed to the bringing in of a King of Sparta, but not of an English Monarch; In a word, either they renounced, or retained their Principles; If they retained them, they could not with any reason, be presumed to act, with so little Conformity to themselves, and their Affairs, if they renounced, they were, then, no longer Presbyterians. Indeed, if we examine the demeanour of many since our blessed Change, we shall have little ground to believe, that they were great∣ly sollicitous for the bringing in of his Majesty, whom, (pardoning with abundant clemency, and governing (as he doth) with infinite
Moderation,) they can yet lesse afford to comply with, than they could with the worst of Tyrants; But by their continual snarling, their readinesse to report and improve Calumnies, their delight in any thing, that may seem to crosse his Majesties wishes, their Pro∣verbial Interlocutions, importing Menaces, and Designs Above all, their flocking to seditious Preachers and Lecturers, declare that we owe our Settlement, rather to their weaknesse, than their Loyal∣ty; Alas, it is for men of noble and sincere minds, to be convin∣ced by reason, or reclaimed by benefits, Levened Natures are not soon purged, nor Cities, overgrown with Faction, easily weeded: And since, under long Persecutions, the Royal Party not only kept their own station, but, selling their Inheritances, entailed their Principles, to their Familes Why should any imagine, that our Pro∣fessours are regenerate, since the Kings return: I wish his Majesties goodnesse to them, find a due requital, and this Argument prove a false Alarm, which, at all Events, is safer, perhaps, than none. Some, I hear, have undertaken to draw a kind of parallel, betwixt our principal Covenanters, and the Lords of the League in France, concerning their return to their obedience; But, I suppose, the disparity will appear to be vast and important: Those in France be∣ing possessed of strong Garrisons, and entire Provinces at their De∣votion, had it in their choice, whether they would present them, as Peace-offerings to their Prince, or make use of their Advantages, (as some did) to dis-member the Kingdom. It was otherwise here, for, his Grace having once muzzled the Army, and thereby freed the Nation from its bondage, there remained nothing, that could obstruct our immediate Settlement, or afford leisure for any to capitulate with his Majesty; Again, the holy League was not infringed by any notorious prevarication that might blast its Credit, But the Covenant, being trampled on by the Imposers, was grown as vile as Dung, as scandalous, as the stewes, and had done all the Mischief it could: Finally, the Leaguers had never, personally, dis∣obliged the King, nor affronted the Crown; And, since their Quarrel was purely Religious, (though surely, therein extravagant enough, yet) after that Kings conversion to the Romane Faith, whereby, he partly purged them of their guilt and scandal, there was little fear of their Loyalty, for the time to come; Whereas, our Cove∣nanters, having greatly injured their Soveraign, and being poisoned in their Principles, as to the Government, may, probably, still continue as Thornes in the side of Monarchy, and have therefore of
late been justly branded with an indelible Character of reproach, So that, I presume, the same Arguments cannot serve them both, either in relation to merit antecedent, or future confidence. Hitherto, I have chiefly argued their want of Inclination to serve his Majesty, if further it shall appear, that they likewise, wanted power, I hope, it will then be readily granted, that the work was not theirs: Now, what, in reason, could be expected from those, who by their manifold Perjuries, and Impoures, (long since detected,) had forfeited all their Interest and Reputation with honest or sober men; It was easie, indeed, at the first to do mischief, to disturb a lawful and peaceable Government, For, in combustible matter, even little sparkes, (unquenched,) have kindled great flames, and sedition is commonly the work of mean Varlets: But, to prevent disasters, or redresse them, to encounter Tyrants, and restore lawful Powers, is no sleight atchievement: Briefly, that Party, which in a free Election, could scarce be chosen to serve for any one County, nor, indeed pretend to it, but in a few, will not, I suppose, arrogate to it self a national Interest, nor can it seem to be any way considerable, without faction, or usurped Power. From all which, it is manifest, that, to God only belongs the glory of his Majesties Preservation, and our deliverance, To the blood of King Charles the Martyr, and other noble Assertours of his Cause, shed in its defence, the vertue and renown, by which it hath out-lived its ruine, To his Grace, the Duke of Albermarle, (next under God,) the honour of redeeming his Country, and restoring his Soveraign, without bloodshed, or servile Conditions; To the Royal Party, this just Commendation, that by their restless endea∣vours, and matchless constancy, they harrassed all the Sentinels of Tyranny, with duty and fatigue, blunted the edge of Persecution, and seasoning the people continually, both with wholesome Prin∣ciples, and great examples, (like the Salt of their Country,) pre∣served it from putrefaction, in the worst of times; To the Presby∣terians, this single Character, that they acted all along like prudent men, who knew a better use to be made of Conscience than by suffer∣ing for it, and that having tryed all expedients of Settlement, or security, without the King, and found them ineffectual, they at length, inclined to the bringing in of his Majesty, lest he should have come in without them. FINIS.
