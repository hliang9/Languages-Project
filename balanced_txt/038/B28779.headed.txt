REASONS Humbly offered to the Honourable House of Com∣mons, Why the Wagoners ought not to be obliged to any certain Weight. First, THat the Clothiers in general of the Cloath∣ing Counties of England will thereby be prevented of keeping their constant Mar∣kets at Blackwell-Hall, and many other Markets confin'd to a certain time; and also it will be ve∣ry prejudicial to the Norwich Traders if they cannot bring their Goods to London Weekly, there being such great al∣terations in the Fashion of their Stuffs, that it will be a great discouragement to their Manufacture, it being impossible for them to Travel the Roads by reason they will be lia∣able to all Officers to stop them and make them unload their Wagons in every Parish they go through. Secondly, Another Reason is, That when their Wagons are unloaded their Loading is then known what it is, which may endanger them to be robb'd, for they do not take up all their Goods at one Town or Place, but at several places on the Road, so that it is impossible they can give a∣ny true Bill of Loading to be just, and if they are oblig'd to an Oath they must forswear themselves, by reason they cannot have Weights at every Place where they take up their Loading. Thirdly, 'Tis very probable the Officers will not believe them without an Oath, and Highway-men may pretend themselves Officers, and force them to unload their Wa∣gons, and when they see what they have, may take that op∣portunity of Robbing the Carrier. Your Honours Favour is humbly begged in their behalf, to consider their Condition as to Your great Wisdom shall seem meet.
