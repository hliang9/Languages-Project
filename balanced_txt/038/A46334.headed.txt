SOME OBSERVATIONS Upon the LIFE of Reginaldus Polus Cardinal OF THE Royal Bloud of England. Sent in a Pacquet out of Wales, By G. L. Gentleman, And Servant to the late MAJESTY of Henrietta Maria of Bourbon, Mother to the present KING. —Majora canamus: Non omneis arbusta juvant humilesque Myricoe. Virg. Ecl. 4. LONDON, Printed for Mathew Turner at the Lamb in High-Holbourn, 1686.
EPISTLE To his Worthy Friend Mr. THEOPHILUS EVANS. THe different aspect of Countries, wheresoever I travell'd, was still grate∣ful; and Nature, in her various formes and dresses, like so many diversyfied scenes and represen∣tations, alwayes pleased me; but never more, me thinks, than here in Wales: Where in a lofty and stately Situa∣tion, having the Ocean on one side, and the flat Campagne on the other, she seems, as it were, delighted in her self, and to look about her with a sort
of comely Majesty. The rich and for∣tile Vales, (as they call them) with their misty exhalations, foggy vapours and fat offrings, had formerly, in∣stead of feasting me, only stupifyed with a lethargique dulness, my wit and senses. Which here with the pure and subtil air of a supremour Region are reinvigorated: and enter∣tain'd with so many various Objects of profitable use and meditation, that I cannot well express them. The low, flat, pastoral Country, which I lately left, seems now to my imagina∣tion like some calm, dead water; than which, nothing is more odious or tire∣some to an active sturdy Vessel: which ever best appears in a proud, imperi∣ous and tempestuous Sea. Which kind of pompous and majestic aspect, I, methinks, at this present enjoy among
these lofty Mountains; Not to be consider'd without some excellent re∣marks. For the strange precipitation of waters, in vast currents, from such places not over-topt by others, is to be admired as scarcely comprehen∣sible. So that the artificial cascades of Ruelle and Versailles are but faint shews and shadows compar'd to these impetuous and natural Cataracts. Besides, their excessive latitude con∣futes and destroyes the earths Eter∣nity, asserted by the perversity of some Philosophers. Which otherwise at this time could not appear in so unlevel'd a posture, though the substance of these Mountains had been adamantine. Sir, I was delighted, with a kind of ravishment, in the midst of such pleasant thoughts, which your last Letter, on a sudden, has utterly di∣sperst,
and left me in a mourning so∣litude. For, the good old Knight you say, is irrefragable, and earnestly in∣sists upon some speedy Accomplishment of what I once promised concerning Reginaldus Polus. To whom, I hear, he has some remote Relation, by reason of the Princely Bloud of Wales being commixt with that of the Royal Line in him. 'Tis strange, a person so generous, so remiss, so indulgent amongst his Tenants, should be so severe and rigorous to me; and that no confession of a debt should avail without immediate payment: Especially where he knows such occur∣ring difficulties, which by such weak undertakers as my self, cannot be overcome. He thinks it, perchance, a prone and easie matter, with ad∣vantagious language, to reduce this
noble Of spring of the Royal Fa∣mily into favour again among his Compatriots; not considering the pre∣sent posture of the times, where the hearts and minds of people are in that high, violent and malignant fermen∣mentation, which no rational, perswa∣sive Discourse can mitigate or reduce to any moderation: Where the in∣genuous, candid, Loyal Protestant passes for a manifest Papist; though the Religion of the latter, (wherein their forefathers were regenerated) be now more odious among them, than the Saracenical, or any sort of Paganism. So that an Essay herein, is not, as he esteems it, alike as to commend the Athenian Socrates at Athens, among persons thus former∣ly seduc'd with false principles, false histories, false doctrines, and still
infested with the same prejudice and passions from thence resulting: but rather almost of the same nature with the undertaking, to have plausibly commended the Major African Scipio in the old Carthage, or Hannibal at Rome. However, you tell me, that he sayes for my comfort, if I write ill, I shall be in the Mode and Fa∣shion; if Well, it will be Recommen∣dable: And how noble the attempt alone will be to restore the memory of this Person, who was the honour of our Nation, and the Age wherein he lived; when Tully so glorifies himself in recovering the very Tomb stone only of the great Archimedes. All this only tends to the same purpose, of lea∣ving no escape or subterfuge, but forcing me to write some rhapsodous Discourse: Which is all I can per∣form,
and will never satisfie his cri∣tical Judgment. Had I any dexterity for this Task, I should need no spur or invitation. For this Cardinal has been along time the only Object of my Affection and Admiration. My volatile Fancy, which every where else is quickly tyred, can only here insist, repose and dwell. He is my Socrates, my Aristides, my Eastern and Western Gregory the great. But having mentioned the former of these persons, I must add, That he is not only mine, but the Roman So∣crates, and that, in an Age, which the Italians place in parallel and com∣petition with that of Augustus in point of Wit and Learning. Those rare examples of a sublime Vertue, and Christian Piety, as Cardinal
Borromeus, and others, which fol∣lowed after, they confessedly owe to him, as the Reformator of Religion and the Age. These considerations, as they in∣cite my Affection, so they deter my Modesty: Especially when I look upon him, as an Object of such diverse Qualities, and so various Dimensions, which afford no certain limits of Mo∣dification. For sometimes his Devo∣tion imprisons him like an Hermite in a Cell; sometimes some other qua∣lities enclose him in the Cabinet-Coun∣cils of Princes; at other times he is at a more large restraint in his Study, like an elegant Writer, subtile Philoso∣pher, and profound Divine: And sometimes again, I find him so wholly inconfin'd, and expos'd to the Sun and Air, as they call it, that no person
was ever employ'd in more different Embassies, or of higher Nature, and betwixt the greatest Princes, that in these many hundred years have ap∣pear'd on the stage of humane Af∣fairs. But, methinks, the chief scene of the splendid and glorious part of His Life, was at the open∣ing the oecumenical Council of Trent: where, as first Legate, he had a rare occasion to shine, and appear in that ample Posture, which became his di∣vine Person, his Royal Extraction and his admirable Elocution. Where I shall at this time abruptly leave him, in complyance of our noble Friends re∣quest, to prepare for the next Pac∣quet, the Preface to his Life, as it is in Italian, Latin, and now very common in French.
PREFACE. THE real passages of this piece are various, like those of a well-contiv'd Poem, intermixt with surprising accidents, sometimes pleasant, sometimes horrid, and at last ending in a strange cata∣strophe. Than which, as the Critiques say, nothing can be more agreeable to an inconcer∣ned Reader. Of which conditi∣on, I presume most are in this distance of time. The Author is one Ludovico Beccatelli an Itali∣an, sometimes domestique of this great person, and afterward ad∣vanced
to the Archbishoprick of Rhaguse for his rare piety and learning. Which latter partly ap∣pears in the artifice of this wri∣ting, wherein he has us'd a na∣tive, graceful and perspicuous eloquence, becoming the learn∣ed age and place wherein he lived. From which our times, with their studyed follies and af∣fectations, have much degenera∣ted. There is not seen the least mention of him among our Wri∣ters, in recognisance of this great benefit, and our national obliga∣tion. However, as it happens in those vertues which reward themselves, in the choice excel∣lency of his Subject he has not only given, but received also a never dying memory. I am sor∣ry,
I can say nothing else, save only that I find every where ho∣norable mention of him among the forrain writers. We owe in∣tirely to him, what we have of the pretious remains of this per∣son: his very ashes as I think, in the foul sacrilege committed in our times at Canterbury, being sa∣crific'd to the winds. For our late brethren spared neither King nor Priest in the fury of their zealous preaching & proceeding. Though this age, like some others, be pester'd with swarms of writers, yet 'tis prudently observ'd by my Lord Bacon and others, that there have been ever too few of this nature. Which whether it hap∣pen out of the scarcety of sub∣jects, or difficulty to express them,
I cannot tell. But 'tis certain, there is nothing more properly conducing to human happines. The way to which, though this preaching age may perchance deny it, being neither so certain or compendious by precepts, as great examples in this kind, which not only instruct, but al∣so animate us at the same time. But where to find them, and af∣ter to illustrate them is a tasque of much difficulty. Which I per∣ceive in the case of our noble Au∣thor, who though he brought an eloquence proportionat to the singular affection, he had for his subject: Yet I find him succum∣bent, and, as it were, opprest with the weight of it. The di∣vine pencil of Plato has set forth
Socrates with what exquisitnes, art or wit could contribut: Yet we imagine something much a∣bove what we read of him. So our fancy must assist us in form∣ing the idea of this great Cardi∣nal, who crown'd all those ad∣mired vertues of the other with a supream and Christian perfecti∣on. In expressing shapes of sin∣gular beauty, and of some lumi∣nous objects, the art is often more deficient then the painter, too much light, which will not be confin'd, causing in him an obscure confusion: which hap∣pens in the same fashion to a wri∣ter from the resulting splendor of an eminent worth and vertue: which if ever appeared in a cor∣poreal shape, as the antients dis∣course,
certainly it was in the rare person of this Cardinal. As we may see by the powerful at∣traction and strange effects of those divine rayes which enlight∣ned him; and not only surpriz'd such persons who approacht him, but drew others out of remote parts into Italy. Where they were not only captivated, but detain'd in a manner, I think, unknown to all antiquity. But, what seems incredible, Italians of noblest quality left their own Country, rich relations and all temporal respects to come into a northern climat, where they were sure to be incumber'd with various infirmities and troubles, besides the disaffection and ha∣tred of the people. But all this
was more than recompenst in the constant fruition of his charm∣ing aspect, discourse and com∣pany: whom I percieve they would have follow'd to the very Antipodes, or where ever he should be: For among the sect (as I may call them) of his friends and followers I find those most troubled, who surviv'd him. As they found the first and choicest fruit of life in the enjoyment of him; so death it self could pre∣sent nothing so dark or terrible as a separation and deprivance of him. And yet most of these per∣sons were neither of pedantique or monastique humor, but of no∣ble extraction and education, and of that Country, whose greatest stain is, to breed up minds
too much addicted to temporal respects and interest. But to con∣sider what qualities wrought these wonders, let us in short survay him, and first externally, observing his extraction from the Houses of York and Lancaster, which produc't the comliest and the greatest Princes of those times. Which rare advantage he made use of in the cultivating his mind, as other Princes in neglecting this principal part in them, through the false doctrine and insinuati∣on of flatterers. From the practi∣ces of which sort of domestique cattle, that he might be entirely freed, he early past the Seas, submitting himself to the institu∣tion of the best Masters of Italy. Under whom though his natural
wit was much admired; yet it was alwayes surpast by his singu∣lar industry; so that his progress in learning was stupendious. But that which most surpriz'd the ju∣dicious, was to see a person of so high bloud, in the heat of youth and at his own disposal, which all seems invitations to corrupti∣on, to keep himself pure, chast, and unstained from all vice, and besides exempted from all those disordinate affections and passi∣ons which so incommodate our human natures. Which effects though some may enviously im∣pute to a stupid heavines of dis∣position: yet this can have no place here in a person of a san∣guine complexion, vigorous health, and such a singular viva∣city
of wit and spirit. They are rather to be ascrib'd to the free election of his noble mind, and the known domestique valor of his family, which he a person of the long robe shew'd in this trampling all vices and passions under foot; and so according to the rule of nature and religion keeping original slaves in a con∣tinual vassalage. The antients observ'd two sort of vertues, wherein we chiefly approach our celestial origine; the one contem∣plative in matters most worthy of human knowledge; the other consisting in actions chiefly con∣ducing to the general good. In Polus we find a rare commixture in this kind, and all the moments of his life thus happily divided.
As if from his infancy he had propos'd this the universal scope of his intentions, in which con∣sists the Soverain perfection: to which so few in all Ages have arriv'd. For as the finest earth cultivated with skilful hands and choicest seeds, scarce ever produces fruits without some in∣termingled weeds: So the sin∣gular excellency of nature and education seldom exempts us from all sorts of imperfections. Yet no defect has hitherto bin ob∣serv'd in the life or actions of this Cardinal, expos'd in so much light to the curious inquisition of so many nations: which ad∣vantage we owe to his exile and memorable proscription. The confines of our Iland were too
narrow a space for so sublime and boundles a vertue. So that fortune herein seem'd to prepare him the noblest Theatre of the Universe, for his rare eloquence, erudition, and other eminent qualities to appear in a fit lustre for the benefit of mankind. Which being compos'd of several and opposite tempers, could never from one example draw so vari∣ous and manifold advantages. For no excellent qualities though incompatible in themselves found any discord in him, as magnanimity and humility, for∣titude and modesty, frugality and magnificence; in fine, such a tenor of mind, that 'tis unknown with what fortune most suitable. For at all times I remarque in him
a constant serenity, like that of the ethereal region, unalter'd with any aspiring vapors of am∣bition or dejecting clouds of ad∣versity. When a price was set upon his head, and the cursed undertakers provided; and the Earth conscious of the future loss seem'd, as it were, to tremble at the horror of the act, he himself rested, with a stupendious indif∣ferency, wholy inconvern'd. What so honorable, so glorious a pre∣sent can Heaven or fortune be∣stow on us like a Principality, especialy where the votes and suffrages are free? yet Polus re∣fus'd this, profer'd to him by a Senate of Princes, or at least the greatest men that ever appear'd since, in that place. Besides he
was at that time in want, in ex∣ile, devested of his total patri∣mony; and had only received this, as the just and innocent ac∣quisition of his merit, superior to any of that age, though fer∣tile in great persons. When I consider the circumstances here∣in, this seems to me an act of a no∣bler temper & elevation of Spirit, then what I have ever read. But to be short, there is no vertue in∣tellectual, moral or Christian, to which at his birth he seems not to have had a rare disposition, and in process of time perfect∣ly habituated. If it be thus, some will ask, why his memo∣ry thus long lies inter'd with his ashes. I answer, because the popular judgment in England has
bin a long time strangely cor∣rupted by some Demagogues. So that they have bin very ill esteemers of the worth of great persons▪ especially those of the Royal Bloud. Which that we may sufficiently demonstrate, let us consider some occurrents in the late head of his Family, be∣cause passages are fresh, and not yet, as the fashion is, hi∣storicaly corrupted. If his royal birth and fortune had not cast a crown upon him, his rare en∣dowments of mind and body, and excellent vertues might have challeng'd it in a popular or aristocratical election. To which I chiefly attribute his ruine, by the rule of contraries; as being directly opposite to the hypo∣critical
and vitious manners of the times. We hear of no Prince persecuted with so violent and obstinate a hatred by his im∣placable adversaries. Who in their impious designes could be prevented with no kind of anticipating oaths; nor represt with any humane, natural or divine obligations. Nay, but the last preparative of a volun∣tary perjury invented to accom∣plish his destruction, exceeds all imagination. For who could fancy in his thoughts a sort of creatures visibly stampt with the impression of humane form, who just before the robbery, should voluntarily enter into a solemn league to preserve the person, whom they destin'd to
utter ruine; a pactise unheard of till this latter Age. I speak this because some regarders of events, have suspected some human deficiency in the King to have expos'd him thus to Fortune and his Enemies which is a manifest error, for he had both the moral and politique Virtues of an Excel∣lent Prince and that in no mean degree. But how could he, (conscious of his own worth, and high meriting of the publick) imagine the future Eruption of that Villany in his dayes, which never shew'd it self in the world before? Some have brought in Religion, as a principle actor on the scene of these affairs: but the error is easily discoverable, and the grounds of such discourse will
be found fallacious. Unles we mistake a profound hypocrisy, or a volatile religion, changeable with the humour of fickle times, for a serious profession of faith. The truth of this assertion, though to some strange at first, will ma∣nifestly appear; if we consider, how the old Protestant and Ro∣man Catholic were the onely Christian Religions, which ever this Nation publickly embrac't. Now in these different profes∣sions their late Majesties were as sincerely zealous, as in their mu∣tual affections. So that both par∣ties boast of them as admirable examples in different kinds. Yet tis not known, which was the greater object of hatred to the same enemies. For though the
Queen escapt the publique scaf∣fold, yet perchance 'twas through her flight and exile. For after declaring her a Traytor, they barbarously sought to tare her in pieces with their canon at Bur∣lington, without al respect due to her birth, or very sex. Now in the mention'd case of religion, and not rather mutual excelen∣cy in vertu, these occurrencies could not have hapend, for o∣therwise hatred on the one side must with a necessary sub-alter∣nation have encreast affection on the other. 'Tis not to be wonderd therefore, if the same causes have bin prejudicial to the reputation due to the memory of this Reginaldus Polus. Among whose other vertues a clear, con∣stant
sincerity of mind was the least observable, because this, with many other excelent qua∣lities, was formerly habitual to the nation. Nature was ob∣serv'd to imprint an ingenuous candor in our looks, uniform to that of our hearts. At the first appearance of the English beyond the Alpes, the Ita∣lians deriv'd the name Angli from their angelical aspects. To which, the frank sincere inte∣grity of their minds was cor∣respondent. Hence proceeded that mutual love and generous hospitality unknown to other nations. So that whoever in∣form'd with this notion had ar∣riv'd among us in the late times, would certainly have thought
our iland had bin absorpt (as 'tis said of one of the Cyclades) and a new England started up in the room. For insted of Monar∣chie, he would have found a wild anarchie spiritual and tem∣poral, the preachers being scarce distinguisht by sexes; insted of sincerity, perfidiousnes; of hos∣pitality, treachery; of faith, per∣jury: insted of religion, a sacri∣legious superstition; and insted of those above-mention'd looks, a cloudy forehead, distorted eyes, with a worse distorted heart, from al the courses of equity, justice, and honor. We owe the original cause of these changes to hypocrisy, transplan∣ted hither from forrain parts, where I am sorry the soil has
prov'd so fertile. For nothing sooner induces, as we have seen by the sudden improvement, atheistical impietie. This was the secret engine, by which at first the ruin of the best of Princes was procur'd, and then his murder; and afterward a Hydra set up in his place, and at last a Barabbas to shew and make manifest in al fashions, that the true Anointed, and a Man according to God's heart, could not be according to the hearts of these people. Al these vile, wicked, and cursed practi∣ces were follow'd with such a confirm'd, publique and obstinat impenitence, that it raises at pre∣sent horror and amazement, not onely in al sober Christians, but
al others, who have not clearly devested themselves of their hu∣manitie. The English nature and dispo∣sition in it self certainly excels that of most nations, as being capable of al sciences, and more easily applicable to that sort of vertu and piety, wherein others find much reluctance. But there is no temper, which by false opi∣nions, especialy in religion (which swarmd here in the royal absence) by education and disci∣pline wil not be corrupted. Hence it is that the noble actions and monuments of magnificent Foun∣ders and Benefactors have not onely bin defac'd, but defam'd among us by an ingrateful poste∣rity. Which has bin alike inju∣rious
to the most illustrious emi∣nence of this Riginaldus Polus, but with less effect, his reputa∣tion soaring in another region, a∣bove the reach of their Malice. For our suburbian Chronicles allow him no other attribute, than that of a barbarian, a monster, and idolater. Sure 'tis with the pub∣lique damage of the Country, that such mechanique spirits should be thus the judges and disposers of the price of merit in noble men. But since the disorder is such, and they have ac∣quir'd general reputation among no vulgar persons, I cannot pass them over with that scornful neglect, which they deserve, without some prejudice to that of the royal family, and the ge∣neral
honor of our Country con∣cern'd herein. In opposition therefore to their abuses, out of many, I shal produce some few testimonies; which I desire may be perus'd circumstantialy in the greatnes of the persons, and as the effects of no flatery or inte∣rest, being chiefly after death, with such profusion of praises, from a nation so jealous and cautiously abstemious in this kind to al strangers, besides himself. Ex Pauli manutii Epist. a Pium quartum e Medicea familia Principem. Quae cum per se maxima sunt, & curandis Christianae Rei∣pub. vulneribus utilissima; tum verò ponderis accedit plurimum ab exi∣miâ
scriptoris innocentia, doctrina, dignitate. Quis enim quibus animi bo∣nis, quibus industriae ingenii{que} orna∣mentis abundaverit, qui deni{que} vir, quantus{que} fuerit Reginaldus Polus, aut ignorat; aut si quam modo tan∣tarum laudum partem habet cogni∣tam, non earum memoria, & desi∣derio vehementer commovetur. Po∣testne quisquam tam inops a judi∣cio, tam aversus ab humanitate, tam plane ferus esse ac ferreus, qui non intimis eum sensibus dilexerit. Cu∣jus non modo in studiis, in moribus, in sermonibus, sed in ipso plane as∣pectu omnis probitas, omnis luceret bumanitas. De religione verò, deque Christiani hominis officio quid sense∣rit, & judicarit, non aut in uno al∣teróve libro ita ostendit, ut in aliis unquam dissenserit: aut ita scripsit,
ut aliter viveret, aut ita vixit, ut interdum sibi non constaret. Sed om∣nia literis ab illo prodita, sine ulla ex∣ceptione semper laudarunt, hodie{que} laudant boni, & sapientes viri; quo∣rum directa ad verit atem ipsam, id est, ad unam Dei gloriam sententia nec obtrectandi studio, aut invidia flectitur, nec malevolentiâ, aut am∣bitione mutatur. Vitae vero totius in∣stituta, & excellentem in omni actio∣ne, omni{que} fortunâ pietatem, utinam quam facile noverunt, tam libenter imitarentur multi. Opes, honores, clientelas, Regum maximorum gra∣tiam & benevolentiam qui assequun∣tur, proxime ad felicitatem putantur accedere. At ille haec omnia apud Henricum Britaniae Regem, & jure propinquitatis, & multo etiam magis sua virtute cum possideret,
ultrò contempsit, ne turpissimas Re∣gis actiones, & adversantem Christi Vicario sententiam probare, aut etiam adjuvare cogeretur. Patavii diu vixit, quanquam erat habitu naturae prope divino, liberalibus tamen dis∣ciplinis vehementer deditus: Et cum eloquentiae at{que} philosophiae pari studio flagraverit, in utra tamen magis enituerit, non facile est existimare. Illud certe constat, qui vel meliora, vel ornatiora scriberet, hâc hominum memoriâ extitisse neminem. Quan∣quam id ei propositum fuit, eo di∣rexit cogitationes omnes, at{que} curas, ut philosophiae scientiam non tam scrip∣tis, quàm vitâ ostenderet. Ita{que} ma∣jor at{que} excelsior Patavii in tenui & humili fortunâ fuit, quam cum in regno omnibus copiis, & ipsius maxi∣me regis gratia floreret. Hic nimi∣rum
verus est, ac praestantissimus optimorum studiorum fructus, si qui à seipso pendeat, si temporum vicis∣situdines non extimescat, si adver∣sus hominum iniquitates, fortunae{que} in∣jurias ratione & vertute pugnet. Quam in Polo constantiam & sapi∣entiam fuisse quis ignorat? Metuen∣dae erant a rege potentissimo insidiae, metuenda vis propterea quod, suscep∣ta Ecclesiae causa, luculento illo de Pontificis autoritate libro, susceptum simul a se gravissimum ejus odium intelligebat. Deserebatur etiam quo∣tidie magis à re domestica. Nemo tamen eum dejecto, aut demisso sen∣sit esse animo, nemo unquam vidit tristiori vultu in sermonibus, in consue∣tudine, in convictu: in tota deni{que} vitae ratione tranquillitatem mentis, quam habuerat antea, perpetuo reti∣nuit.
Nec defuêre, quae nunquam speraverat, ac ne cogitaverat quidem, tantis debita virtutibus praemia. Nam cùm ita viveret, ut in uno Deo om∣nia poneret, caetera quae mortales ad∣mirantur, infirma, caduca, inania duceret: cum{que} in illa Patavini gymnasii celebritate domesticis otii sui fimibus contentus, paucorum admodum consuetudine uteretur: brevi tamen (ut sibi viam facilè virtus aperit) ita manavit fama de admirabili ejus prudentia, temperantia, doctrina; ut ad aures Pauli tertii Pont. max. pervenerit. Qui cùm ea esset mente praeditus, ut nemo unquam magis de ornanda egregiis Cardinalibus Eccle∣sia cogitaverit, & eo judicio, ut nemo in delectu erraverit minus: commotus multorum indubio sermone, Reginaldum Polum, disciplinae Chri∣stianae
renovandae caussâ, cum prae∣stantibus aliquot viris ad Urbem accivit: eum{que} Paulo post non pe∣tentem, non optantem, prope etiam recusantem Cardinalem creavit. In hác dignitate, cum alios antea, tum seipsum vicit omni genere laudis. Omitto fingularem illam, cui par oratio reperiri milla potest, in caede matris acerhissima fortitudinem at{que} constantiam. Unicum illi contraommes injurias, omnes{que} calamitates consci∣entia praesidium fuit; & in aduersis rebus jam antea didicerat esse fortis. Gravitatem eximiam, pari comitate conditam, mansuetudinem prudentiam, benignitatem in sublevanda miserorum inopia non attingo; communia sint haec, in quibus tamen principua quadam lande Polus txcelluit. Venio ad id quod à Cardinalis persona
postulatur. Nam ubi primum sacer∣dotio est ornatus amplissimo, non ille mentem, ut multi, cum fortuna mu∣tavit: non sericam vestem, non argenteam supellectilem, non deui{que} illustrem aliquam, aut optimam pro∣vinciae praefecturam appetivit. Sed contempta prorsus rerum hnmanarum specie, divina studia, quae antea non leviter attigerat, toto pectore com∣plexus, de tuenda Pontificii juris majestate, de augenda inter homines Dei gloria, de illustranda veritate dies noctes{que} cogitare coepit. Quan∣tum in ea philosophia, quae a sensi∣bus ducitur, erroris insit, at{que} ob∣scuritatis, cum antea non ignorasset, tum verò totus ad cam philosophiam traductus, quae caelestium bonorum cognitionem parit, clarissime perspexit. I am illam, quae colligitur ex rheto∣rum
praeceptis, eloquentiam, in qua praeter coeteros floruerat, neglexit penitus, inanem duxit, cum librorum voces, non durium voluptati ser∣vientes, sed ad intimas animorum partes incredibili quadam suavitate penetrantes, exaudivit attentus. Nec verò quidquam habuit antiquius, quam ut a sanctissimis Ecclesiae le∣gibus discedentes, quoquomodò ad sanitatem redirent: cum ipse multos cohortatione sua, consilio, doctrina, nonnullos etiam lenitate quadam ad meliora consia converteret. Incidit tempus, cum de sufficiendo post obi∣tum Pauli tertii Pontificis succes∣sore Cardinalibus deliberatio esset: affuit Polus ita sedato animo, ita cupiditatis & ambitionis expers, ut majore Collegii parte Pontificatum ad eum de ferente, non statim assense∣rit,
differendam{que} rem tantam in posterum diem censuerit: fore enim; si probaret Deus, eundem post aliqot horas Cardinalium consensum: sin minus, omnino sibi quod Deo displiceret, placere nihil posse. Scripsit etiam in eo Conclavi praeclara quaedam de officio Pontificis: quae cum aliis ejus libris, quos Joannes Moronus Cardinalis ob summa erga sedem Apostolieam me∣rita, perpetuam{que} vitae innocentiam clarissimus, accuratè servavit, pro∣pediem in lucem proferentur. Quibus in libris, cùm spirare adhuc mens illa divini hominis & vigere videatur, afficimur non tam praeceptis at{que} docrina, quàm recordatione tauta∣rum virtutum, quas in illo vidi∣mus.
Ex Jacobi Sadoleti Cardinalis, Epist. 10. lib. 5. DE consuetudine & convictu Poli nostri tantum te capere volupta∣tis, quantum scribis & minime mi∣ror, & tuum de illo judicium ve∣hementissime probo. Quid enim esse potest homine illo humanius, cruditi∣us, sanctius? Eum ego cùm hàc iter haberet, paucis illis horis vix degustare quidem potui: sed tantas tamen in illo omnium ornamentorum divitias tum mihi persplexsse visus sum, ut posteà illum non amore mo∣dò, sed insigni quadam observantiâ semper sim prosecutus. Nam cùm illa mihi amabilia in eo sunt cognita, ingenium probitas, literae, in quibus ille non mediocriter excellit, tum id
praeterea admiratione summâ dignum (quod ego primum statuo omnium) quòd cum tantâ generis amplitudine & nobilitate tanta naturae bonitas atque humanitas juncta sit. Itaque quanti fieri a me putas, quod à te scriptum est, nomen saepe meum ver∣sari in sermonibus vestris? Ego verò vobiscum, o amicissimi homi∣nes, & animo semper & cupiditate illâ sum, ut si detur facultas, vo∣biscum vivere potissimùm velim. Etenim si essemus unà, Deus im∣mortalis, quantas & quàm va∣rias caperemus suavitates? quae stu∣diorum cunjunctio? quae communica∣cio voluntatum? qui denique ardor existeret animorum? ut ad illa prae∣clara atque sancta philosophiae ady∣ta copulati introiremus.
Ex ejusdem. Epist. 13. lib. 5. POlus ad me scribit uberrimis ele∣gantissimisque literis, multa illa quidem digna illo ingenio & sanctis∣simis ipsius moribus, sed plurimum & praecipuè de te, quem ipse admo∣dum cuperet ad Theologiae studia jam aliquando animum adijcere. Ex ejusdem. Epist. 20. lib. 12. QUanquam quod ad suavitatem amicitiae & familiaritatis at∣tinet, multorum mihi amicorum vi∣cem praestat vir clarissimus Polus, qui apud nos complures jam est men∣ses: quo homine cave mi Bembe quenquam existimes aut dulciorem in congressibus, aut fideliorem in con∣siliis
aut sanctiorem in omni parte vitae optimisque moribus existere: praeterea summae ipsum doctrinae, summique judicii. Sed quid ago? tibine ego eum laudo, qui tibi ipsi melius notus est, quam mihi? illud affirmare possum, hòc illius sermones mihi etiam gratiores esse & jucun∣diores, quòd in magnâ copiâ & va∣rietate rerum, de quibus colloquimur, saepe nobis de te in loquendo incidit mentio, in quâ diutius commorari solemus, Priulo praesertim tuo mate∣riam & copiam sermonibus suppe∣ditante. Ex Epist. lib. 14. ADventus huc Poli amplissimi collegae nostri, & magnum mihi dolorem attulit, ut tu quoque
futurum videras, & non minorem etiam voluptatem. Videre enim ho∣minem amicissimum utrique nostrûm, summâ ipsum virtute, summâ tem∣perantiâ modestiâ, sanctitate vitae praeditum, sanè jucundissimum mihi fuit. Eundem autem videre tot ap∣petitum injuriis, atque alienae impie∣tatis & crudelitatis scelere, in tan∣tas & tam graves conjectum cala∣mitates, certè non mediocriter mihi molestum accidit: cum praesertim non amici solùm in eo incommoda, sed Christianae etiam Reipub. vulnera uno & eodemtempore, dolere & mi∣serari cogerer. Atque ipse quidem, quo animi robore, & quâ erga De∣um pietate munitus est, ferebat res adversas fortiter atque constanter. Ego vero qui nequaquam simili vir∣tute praeditus sum, cum me afflicta∣rem
in ejus acerbis casibus, illo ipso consolatore sublevatus sum, cui me afferre solatium magis oportebat. Atque is unum diem apud me cum fuisset, ita a me discessit; ut praeter pristinammeam de illo opinionem no vam etiam admirationem suae spectatissimae virtutis in animo relinqueret. Ex ejusdem. Epist. 11. lib. 15. QUòd enim me cum Polo meo, tuâ opinione sententiáque conjungis, homine summâ eruditione, summâ pie∣tate, summâ prudentiâ praedito: optas{que} denos utriusque nostrûm similes, si fieri possit, existere: quorum fide, vigilan∣tiâ, consiliis afflictae Christianae Reip. subveniatur: est quidem hoc & tuae probitatis, ac religionis maximum ar∣gumentum & ejus opinionis, quam
de me habes conceptam, indicium in∣signe. Veruntamen scito, cùm jam∣diu sit, quòd ego virum illum, & colo & admiror, nunquam autem me optare esse ausum, ut cum eo com∣pararer: tantum sat mihi duxisse, si illius modò persequi vestigia, vel procul observando atque imitando possem. Itaque habeo eum in vitâ & in disciplinâ, & in omnibus fo∣rensibus senatoriisque actionibus, du∣cem ac magistrum: Quem quòd tu quoque tam studiosè laudas & probas, perjucundum id mihi est, proprium∣que ejusdem praestantis animi tui, de quo jamdudum loquor. Ex ejusdem. Epist. 9. lib. 16. QUomodo ergo hoc lues? opinor si & literas mihi miseris, & doctissimorum hominum contuberna∣lium
tuorum Aloysii Priuli, Conta∣rini & Marci Antonii Flaminii acta aliqua ad me perscribes. Ni∣si fortè omnem tuam mentem, cogi∣tationemque rerum caeterarum, illa prope immensa suavissimi hujus co∣mitatus voluptas sic obruit, ut des∣picere in partem aliam non queas: praesertim, omnium hominum longe & virtute & comitate & pru∣dentiâ praestantissimo, Polo, tuos oculos animumque complente: quod si est ita, ignosco tibi equidem, neque te amplius ullo crimine ac∣cers. Joannes Casa in vita Petri Bembi Cardinalis. CUltus est Romae Bembus, cum à bonis plerisque omnibus Contareno, Sadoleto, Cortesio,
Morono Cardinalibus amplssimis, hominibusque eruditissimis: tum ve∣rò praecipuè a Reginaldo Polo, homine, Dei immortalis, dubio pro∣cul, beneficio, ex ultima usque Bri∣tania ad nos vecto, vel de coelo potiùs, si modò dictu fas est, lap∣so; cujus de laudibus, quamquam de tam praeclarâ ac divinâ virtute ne∣mo satis digne unquam loquetur, alius mihi profectò dicendi locus da∣bitur. Hoc certè haud facile in praesentiâ dijudicare audeam; plus ne eam insulam, multis vulneribus Chri∣stianae reipub. per summam impieta∣tem infligendis, nocuisse dicam; an quòd in illo solo talis tantusque vir ortus & procreatus sit, unde verae, planeque Christianae pietatis, vitae∣que exemplum peteremus; pro∣fuisse.
Is igitur cum Bembo fami∣liarissime vixit, &c. Which Bembus speaks some∣where to him, as I remem∣ber, in this manner; Tu verò lon∣ge ornatior atque illustrior factus, non Italiam modò, sed Britaniam eti∣am tuam, atque ipsum coeli verticem tuarum laudum splendore fac impleas. As if his eminent vertue, like the surprizing light, of some new Comet, without a parallax, was to shine universaly in al parts, for the benefit of man∣kind.
SUPPLEMENT. THE comendations of these great persons, I know, are of little account and vali∣ditie in Countries under the do∣mination of Zuingle, Calvin, and Beza. But al learn'd and ci∣viliz'd spirits rise up with a kind of reverence at the very mentio∣ning of Sadoletus, Bembus and Contarinus, &c. Whose Names stand already consecrated to al posterity in the histories of their times. They liv'd in a happy, glorious age, which not onely reviv'd, but, I may say, ac∣complisht the noble arts, and sciences of the antient Greeks and
Romans, which are now univer∣saly and much degenerated. For in painting we see no pie∣ces like those of Raphael, Michel Angelo and Titian, or their very Scholars, in the three famous schools, at the same time of Rome, Florence, and Lombardy. And what is very remarquable, the Statuarian art appear'd in per∣fection, and was extinguisht in the very same person of the fore-mention'd Buonaroti. Elocu∣tion in al her dresses either Hi∣storical, Oratorian or Poetical, scarce ever appear'd more ma∣jestique, polite or floride with al her artificial colours, beauties and graces. The above-cited persons Contarinus, Casa, Polus, Sadoletus and Bembus were very
eminent in this princely, com∣manding facultie, as adapted thereto by their extraction (which was very noble in al, though only royal in Polus) by their learn'd education and na∣tural excelencie of wit. They have left us rare monuments in al kind of Eloquence, wherein the old Grece and Rome ever boasted; but have proceded no further, like over-cautious Pi∣lots not venturing in unknown Seas. Where however they knew others more rash and les ex∣pert would at the last hazard. For being al Churchmen and honor'd with Episcopal dignity, they have left us no rule, art, or methode of preaching; nor any example, to look upon,
like a canonical picture of Titi∣an, and trace thereby the futur model and general lineaments of a regular sermon. Which neglect in these our Master-guides has bin of great damage and detriment not only to their own age, but also that of their posteritie, leaving us in the dark and ignorance, nevertheles rash∣ly venturing to put and push forward with hardy boldnes, not so much as like blind men, groping to find out the true way. To illustrate and give some light to this Parodoxical discourse, let us consider, what the moderate and judicious Spa∣niard, Ludovicus Vives sayes. Than whom, after his Countriman Quintilian, no one has better
censurd the lifes, actions, and writings of men. He was con∣versant in most Countries, where human literature florisht, and sometimes in Corpus Christi Col∣lege in Oxford, and therefore his censure fals particularly on no place or persons, which was this, in his famous book de Cau∣sis corruptarum artium. —Receptâ Christianâ pietate, pas∣si sunt Principes, quod universis in commune conduceret, ut Presbyte∣ri ad populum de rebus sacris lo∣querentur: ita sacri Concionatores priscis illis Oratoribus successêre, sed dissimillimo successu. Nam quan∣tó illos-superamus rebus, tanto parti∣bus omnibus eloquentiae, totâ vi per∣suadendi, sententiis, argumentis, dis∣positione, verbis, genere orationis,
actione inferiores sumus. Cujus rei culpa divisa est inter dicentem & audientem. Olim qui dicebant, erant callentissimi usûs & totius pruden∣tiae communis, & tractandorum animo∣rum peritissimi artifices. Qui nunc dicunt quam dispares, imperiti, igna∣ri vitae, imô communis sensûs: qui sint affectus, aut quemadmodum vel impel∣lendi vel revocandi omnino nescij. Nec cui rei quae verba, quod genus orationis sit adhibendum nôrunt, omnia bent convenire omnibus rati. Sententias habent plumbeas, frigidas, jacentes, segnes quae animos dejiciant potius quam excitent: argumentatiunculas colligunt ab illo exercitio scholastico, quae ventilant quidem, & titillant interdum, nunquam feriunt aut caedunt. Dispositio fusa & dissipata: nihil dicunt suo loco: actio immoderata:
nihil pro re aut tempore: non in voce, non in oculis & ore, non in manu & digitis, non in gestu & statu corporis universi: quae illi ita habent cognita, ut nulla esse arbi∣trentur, nec interesse saltitent dicen∣tes, an sedeant. Jam auditores ha∣bebant illi olim acutos, attentos ple∣ros{que} eruditos, nunc socordes, segnes, peregrinantes, animo rudes at{que} im∣peritos, &c. Italie at this time florisht in eloquence and polite learning, more than at present; and as for our Cisalpine Countries, I leave them to the pleadings of no mean advocates Sir Thomas More, Erasmus and Budaeus, &c. As for the first of his animad∣versions, touching the excessive disparity betwixt our Preachers
and the antient Orators, whom they succede: I think there is no disagreement amongst the Learned. Nor how far we ex∣cede them in the noblenes, va∣riety and amplitude of subjects; which the Mysteries of our re∣ligion in a copious manner af∣ford us. Yet al this has pro∣duc't no considerable effect, nor any thing to be put in parallel with those pretious reliques of Antiquitie; richly embellishing with a pleasant variety, for the most part trivial, temporal and profane subjects. In our French travels, you remember, the com∣mon Sermons much deceiv'd our expectation, with their long repetitions, tedious circumlo∣cutions and ayerie expressions,
under which there was no so∣lid sense or fundation of matter methodicaly dispos'd, wherin the antients were admirable; which defect made the words (as it usualy hapens) flye and flutter about our ears, with a great deal of insignificancie. Which however are pour'd forth with a confident readines and a great volubilitie, the Preacher never otherwise appearing arm'd and provided, than with his hanker∣chief, insted of prompting pa∣pers, so contrary to the custom of the English, who are nothing inferior in wit, and of a bet∣ter memorie. At our return home, having seen King Charles the first in his writings often complaining and ascribing his
ruine to the Pulpit; we presump∣tuously thought to have retriv'd the antient Eloquence rising a∣mongst us there again, in a for∣midable Majestie. For the ad∣mirable effects of this renoun'd facultie being known to be good and bad: we have here seen the latter, higher and of a more cursed nature, than what Anti∣quity can shew. For where shal we find among them, so great and vertuous a Prince soberly murdred with cold hands in Publique, so incomparable a Queen and numerous issue either miserably wandring, banisht or imprison'd; in fine, the Religion and State wholy subverted by the voluntary swearers to defend both. Now, to this vast de∣molishment
and downfall of three Kingdoms, if you imagine in fancie to find proportionated Enginers, you wil be much de∣ceiv'd. For Hugh Peters, the chief Architect among them, had in his looks, behavior and discourse more the fashion of a Buffoon, then the face, habit and autoritie of one of the antient Orators. As for the rest of his Brethren, we wil passe them over in silence, as being his inferiors, and for our own credit sake; that the nature and paultry condition of our Antagonists may the better remayn indiscover'd Tis strange to think, how a noble Kingdom, acquir'd by the invincible hands of so great a Conqueror, should in proces of time fal thus by
the wretched tongues of so vile, mercenary and ignominious Gowmnen. There was nothing more foolish or frivolous, (set∣ting aside the Treason) in form and matter than their discon∣certed Sermons: nor indeed more ridiculous, unless it was the action and pronuntiation, which was with an odious noise and utterance through the nose, yet appearing very musical and grateful to their most attentive & pressing Congregations. Their general custom was, to pick out of the Scripture some ob∣scure Text, which they man∣gled, insted of dividing, into fragments, and certain diminu∣tive particles, which were con∣verted at last into so many po∣sitive
points, strangely pricking & tickling the currupted fancies of their Audience. In whose opinion and judgment, they would often destroy al Prelacie and Popery in the same breath. Which, by vertu of former Scriblers in this kind, was as easily done; as the body of their Sermons com∣pos'd out of Common places and Concordances. Their Epilog and terrible Peroration was usualy in∣cluded within the seven hils of Rome there furiously baiting the horn'd beast, and Antichrist. Which however many times were their best friends and assistants, at a dead halt and stand; when al their Hebrew, Grec and Latin; and their last uses, doctrines and applications fail'd them. Which
sort of sorry shifts and poor in∣ventions, to waste time, are only the lazy customs of these latter dayes, unpractis'd by the Anti∣ents. Whom we cannot suffici∣ently admire, with their artifi∣cial methods; somtimes analy∣tique, somtimes of an opposite nature, and somtimes mixt; yet ever producing admirable effects: Which subtile wayes were very wel known and practiz'd by my Lord Bacon, and are the hidden reason why so may of his discourses in∣struct, improve and please the readers in general, like a legi∣timate piece of Architecture ve∣ry often surprizing, incompre∣hending, and ignorant fancies, which can give no reason of
their ocular delight and satis∣faction. Some of these discourses therefore have past the Alps, and found approbation in an Italian dress, from the exquisit judg∣ments of that Country. Where∣as tis best for most Sermons to rest satisfyed with the applause of their first Audience; whe∣ther it be in City, Court or Coun∣try. The open light and air are very improper and hazard∣ous for them, as being usualy Creatures of a week fabrique and constitution: somthing not unlike in nature to the fading compositions in Musick of our dayes, which scarce ever sur∣vive the Author, and so disor∣derly thrust one another out of
date, that the younger stile gets place. Which ever fals out con∣trary in the just and lawful pro∣ductions of noble spirits, where∣in we alwayes see precedence in antiquity rather giving autority and prerogative, than causing any kind of detriment or de∣minution. However I hear of late, that there are started up among us, excellent Preachers of al Religions, who with choice matter curiously elaborated, and with a free noble delivery, sett of with looks and gesture suita∣ble to the subjects and passions represented, are likely to work marvelous effects, and reduce again the happy first dayes of King Charles the first. Which appears the more probable, in
that I understand, these worthy persons are for the excelent, mo∣ral and pacifique doctrine of the old Grec and Latin Homilies, having laid aside al Controver∣sies, which are most improper for Pulpits: and serve rather to irritate, than heal or compose our minds too much already fester'd and exulcerated with so many late seditious contentions of al sorts. We are onely fit now for a peaceable quietnes, like such patients, to whom the prudent Physitian prescribes a weathering repose alone, with the use perchance of some wa∣ters to purge and wash away certain scurvy, malignant hu∣mors. The matter of Contro∣versie has bin drain'd to the
bottom on all sides and hands, ever since my Lord Bacon's dayes, as he himself testifies: So that now there's nothing left, but filthy lees and dregs for new Operators. And there∣fore, like a sage Lawyer, as wel as great Philosopher, he dis∣swades any father progres in such contentions, fruitles and endles in a Countrie, where there is no Tribunal of judica∣ture erected, or wil be admit∣ted by either sex. If any, by reason of the difficulty and va∣rietie, find themselves unfit for those noble, profound sciences, which he often proposes; yet have an itchy, buisy spirit, which must be in some action; there are many other more in∣genious
occupations and em∣ployments, to take up their time of leisure, if aptly follow'd, as the various and delightful operations in Chymistrie; and so many excelent inventions and practices, lately discovered at home and abroad, in Experi∣mental Philosophie, with seve∣ral other accessory and subser∣vient parts of Philosophical learning in general.
POSTSCRIPT. As concerning the above-cited Te∣stimonies. THe fame of Paulus Manuti∣us, Bembus, and Sadoletus, is spread among the lear∣ned of al nations; but this of Casa has not taken so large a flight, nor is much conversant in Northren parts, unles among Travelers. To give therefore some credit to his testimony, and make it more authentique, we wil hear, in the first place, Muretus, speaking in this man∣ner. — Neque immeritò commendati
sunt, aut is qui pauca quidem scrip∣sit, sed in scribendo omnium politis∣simus maximeque, limatus, idemque ab omnibus ineptiis remotissimus fuit Joannes Casa, &c. This ex∣pression ab ineptiis remotissimus, a∣mong others, as he elswhere testifyes, reflects on the conceits and Batavian jests of Erasmus, in his praise of Folly and Dialogs, &c. which sort of sawce and seasoning, some scholars have grosly mistaken for pure Attique salt and wit. The noble Tri∣dentine Historian speaking of this Casa, sayes, As his brother was formidable with his sword; so he was with his pen. His Ora∣tion to the great Emperor of his time, is imagin'd to be the first piece of true genuine
eloquence, which has appear'd since the dayes of Augustus; and therefore I wonder it has found no Translator. But perchance it would not please, since in∣stede of the figures, tropes and schems, in a solid discourse, and other graces of the Antients, we are now so delighted with gingles, quibles, and trifling conceits in a frothie, incohaerent matter, interlarded with a nau∣seous multiplicity of citations, in diverse languages. Which, for the most part, are onely sorry, servile shifts, pedantique arts, and odious deformities in speech and writing, introduc'd by some modern Orators: and nothing conducing to the true delight or benefit on the one side, but
much assisting and concealing the supine ease and lazines of the cunning practiser on the o∣ther side. Whereas an orderly discourse should, with a certain analogie, imitate the works of nature, or of art in perfection; where al parts have ever a congruous and conspiring union as wel as uniformity among themselves. As for example, in a Dorique composition, ei∣ther in musique or architecture, any thing Jonique, though ex∣celent in it self, would be viti∣ous; and so al enterlacings and embossements, which are like frequent citations in speech, though otherwise splendid, would be here offensive to the senses and understanding of a wel-bred
Gentleman. But let us passe to this short Character of Bartholomeo Zucchi in his Idea of a perfect Secretary. Questi è quel Giovanni della Casa Gentilhuomo Fiorentino, che ha lasciato in dubio, in qual lin∣gua egli scriuesse meglio, ò nella Latina ò nella Toscana, e nel verso e nella prosa: Cosi fu mi∣rabile nell'una e nell'altra. Ha scritto poche cose, ò almeno poche vanno attorno, le quali il faranno piu immortale, che le molte, che hanno publicate alcuni. Son tutte belle, tutte eccellenti. Fu e Segre∣tario di Cardinali, e impiegato in gravi affari. Dopo essere stato alcun tempo Prelato molto stimato nella Corte Romana, hebbe l' Arcivescovato di Benevento, nel quel grado si mori.
Englished thus. This is that John de la Casa a Florentine Gentleman, who has left in doubt, in what language, he was most dex∣trous and excelent: whether in Latin or Italian; or Verse or Prose. He was so singular and admirable in all these facul∣ties. He has writ few pieces or at least few passe currant as his genuine productions. Which however wil more immortalise his name, than the voluminous works of others. Every thing proceding from him is rare and excelent. He was Secretary a∣mong the Cardinals, and em∣ploy'd in affairs of great con∣sequence. After having bin a
Prelat of great estimation in the Court of Rome, he was advanc't to the  Arch-Bishoprick of Beneven∣tum, in which condition he dyed. Monsieur Balzac, whose fol∣lies and affectations in his young dayes, corrupted not only the the spirits of his own Country, but many also of those abroad, seems at last to have had a mature judgment: which per∣haps is the reason, why his latter books please lesse, and remain every where untransla∣ted. However out of the value I have for them, I shall pick out here something concerning our present subject. En Italie il s'appelle Monsig∣nor de la Casa, il estoit Gen∣tilhomme Florentin, de tres bonne
et tres ancienne maison. Il auoit este nourry petit garzon a la Cour de Rome, ou d'abord il eut l'ap∣probation de tout ce qu'il y auoit d'honnestes gens. Il a escrit en prose et en vers, en l'une et l'au∣tre langue auec tel succes, qu'il fut admiré des Orateurs et des Poetes de son temps, au dessu desquels il s'estoit eleuè. Torquato Tasso l'a tant estimé qu'il a voulu estre son grammairien. Et j'ay leu, sur un des sonnets de ce Monsig∣nor, une lecon, que ce poete re∣cita, si'l m'en souvient bien dans l' Academie de Ferrare. Cet ex∣cellent homme estit d'une santé as∣sez vigoreuse, il vescut dans le loisir tantost de Rome et tantost de Venise: et neantmoins il n'a laissé en toute sa vie, qu'un liure de
l'espaisseur de deux almanachs Cest n'est pas qu'il eust, l'esprit sterile, et qu'il cultivast une terre ingrate. Car jamais homme n'apporta au monde de plus grands avantages, ni plus de disposition a l'eloquence, &c. Englished thus. In Italian he is cald the Sig∣nor de la Casa, being a Florentine Gentleman of a most noble and antient race. The education of his unriper age was at the Court of Rome, where on a sudden, he gain'd the approbation of al persons of merit and honor. His prose and verse in both languages was so happy and succesful, as to make him ad∣mired by the Orators and Poets of his time, whom he much
surpast. Torquato Tasso valued him at so high a rate, that he vouch∣saft to become his Grammari∣an. And I have read, if I wel remember, a lesson upon a sonnet of this Signor which this Poet recited in the Academy of Ferrara. This excelent per∣son was of a sufficient and active health, and enjoy'd a hap∣py leisure somtimes at Rome, and sometimes at Venice. Yet al his life has onely afforded us a litle book no thicker in bulk, than two Almanacks. The reason of this proceded not from the sterility of his spirit; or that he cultivated a barren and ungratful soyle. For ne∣ver man was born with more natural advantages, or endowed
with a better disposition for Eloquence, &c. The memory of Monsieur Blazac has not faild him; for the lesson here mention'd (which I have by me) was recited in this manner: and there was a kind of civil war between the two Academies of Ferra∣ra and Florence at the same time, when it was compos'd be Torquato Tasso. Who was, without dispute, the greatest and most universal Poet, that has appear'd in any known language, since the death of the Roman Virgil. And yet here he acts the inferior and subservient part of a Gramma∣rian, Scholiast, Comentator. Which condescention in so
Princely a Poet, is the greatest which I have ever heard: and crowns with an everlasting honor the memory of this Signor de la Casa. From hence we perceive of how high a value, is this large Encomium of Polus, from a person of so rare merit, and o∣therwise, as we have seen, so pe∣nurious of his choice and pre∣tious Ink. What is spoken here of this Giovanni della Casa, seems de∣vious & episodical, as to our sub∣ject; but I could not omit it, out of respect and gratitude, for the great honor, this noble Flo∣rentine has done our Country, in the person of this royal Cardinal, to whom we will now return in this following relation of
Le Sieur Maurier. REnaud Polus, Cardinal & Archeveque de Cantorbie, estoit fils de Richard Po∣lus Cousin Germain du roy Henry VII. & de Marguerite fille de George Duc de Clarence, frere du roy Edouard IV. La nature luy avoit donné un excellent esprit, qu'il avoit cultivé soigneusement & beureusement dans les plus celebres Academies de l' Europe, où il se'stoit fait d'illustres amis, & sur tout en Italie. Comme il avoit de la naissance, & du scavoir, de l'esprit, & de l' habilite, tout le monde l' honora en Angleterre: & le roy Henry; VIII. ne fut pas des derniers a luy faire des avances de
bienveillance & d'estime. Renaud Polus en temoigna bien de la gra∣titude. Mais il ne pût jamais ad∣herer, par une lasche complaisance, au desirs injustes de ce Prince, qui pour satisfaire une passion brutale, viola toutes les loix de l'honneur, & de la religion, introduisant, par un renversement deplorable, le schisme & l'heresie dans son estat. Polus fut contraint de sortir du royaume. Cēst dans ce temps q'uil se crût ob∣ligé d'escrire au roy, un traité de l'union de l'eglise: Et ce zele ge∣nereux passant pour insolence & pour temerité dans l'esprit d' Henri, il promit cinquante mille escus a celuy qui luy apporteroit sa teste. Le Pape Paul III. qui l'avoit creé Cardinal en 1536. luy donna des gardes. Henri en temoigna un
deplaisir extreme, & ne pouvant se vanger sur la personne de ce Car∣dinal, il fait mourir sa Mere & divers de ses Parens, & le perse∣cutast luy mesme dans toutes sortes d'occasions. Le genereux Polus supporta la mort des siens & la desolation de sa famille, ayant tant de constance & de courage, qu'il merita des eloges des plus illustres Ecrivains de ce temps & l'admira∣tion de toute l'Europe. Il pardon∣na aussi aux trois Italiens & a deux Anglois, qui l'avoient voulu assassiner. Cependant il fut employé en diverses legations, & envoyé au Concil de Trente. Apres la mort de Paul III. les Cardinaux voulurent le mettre sur le siege pon∣tifical, & il fut le seul qui s'oppo∣sa a cette exaltation glorieuse. Sa
mort fut un coup fatal & pour la religion & pour le royaume, elle arriva seize heures apres celle de la Reyne le 25 Nov. de l' an. 1558. Les Auteurs, mesme les Protestans, don∣nent les eloges a son esprit, a son scavoir & a sa prudence: & tout le mondé avoue q'uon vist peu d'egale bonté pour les hommes, ny de semblable zele pour Dieu. Englished thus. Reginaldus Polus Cardinal and Archbishop of Canterbury, was Son of Richard Polus Cousin germain to Henry the seventh. His mother was Margaret daugh∣ter of George Duke of Clarence, brother of Edward the fourth. Nature had given him an ex∣celent spirit and wit. Which
he carefully and happily enricht in the most famous Academies of Europe: where he gain'd the friendship of many illustrious persons, but especialy in Italie. As he was eminent in birth, wit, knowlege, and activenes of spirit; so he was much be∣lov'd and honor'd at home; and King Henry the eighth was very forward in applauding and shewing the singular esteem he had of him. Wherein Polus was never backward in a rea∣dy demonstration of his hum∣ble gratitude. But however, could never adhear, and sub∣mit, with a servile complyance to the injust desires of this Prince, who to satisfy a carnal appetite, broke the laws of honor and
religion, introducing a deplora∣ble confusion into his Kingdom. Out of which Polus was con∣straind to depart. In this time of absence, he thought himself obliged to writ a treatise to the King, concerning the general u∣nion of the Church. But this general Zeal passing for an in∣solence and rash enterprise in the spirit of King Henry, he set a price, and promist fifty thou∣sand Crowns, as a reward, to him who should present him with his head. The Pope Paul the third, who had created him Car∣dinal in the year 1536. preserv'd him with Guards, appointed for his safety. Which put the King in∣to so great a passion and cho∣ler, that being unable to re∣venge
himself upon the person of this Cardinal, he made his Mo∣ther dye a violent death, with many of his kindred; neither leaving to persecute his remain∣ing person also, in al sorts of oc∣casions. The generous Polus patiently sufferd the death of his nearest allyes, and the desolati∣on of his family, with so great a constance and courage, that it merited and procur'd him the testimonies and admiration of al the noble Writers in Europe of his time. He pardon'd also three Italians and two Englishmen who would have assassinated him. He had the fortune to be employ'd in many Embassies of several kinds, and to be sent Legat to the Council of Trent.
After the death of Paul the third, the Cardinals would have plac't in the Pontifical Throne; and he himself was the person alone, who oppos'd this glorious exal∣tation. His death was a fatal blow to the religion and king∣dom, which happen'd sixteen hours after that of the Queen in the year 1658. The Pro∣testants themselves give elogiums to his wit, learning, and pru∣dence. And al agree that there scarce ever appear'd so great a zeal for the service of God, nor charitie and affection for that of men. The learn'd Mr. Camden, a person of another religion, as being a worthy old Protestant of the old Church of England, seems
to approve of these commendati∣ons, and verify this last pas∣sage in these words. Eodem quo Maria obijt die, post pauculas horas Polus Cardinalis, Archiepiscopus Cantuariensis ex∣piravit, Vir quem pietas, doctrina & integritas multò magis, quàm re∣gij generis splendor illustrârunt; licet ille Georgij Ducis Clarentiae fratris Edvardi quarti Regis An∣gliae è filiâ nepos fuerit. His persecution, with the tra∣gical desolation of the Fami∣lie, and the cruel, unnatural destruction of the members by their proper head, is thus describ'd by Gratianus. Nam Henricus, cum ei omnia ten∣tanti, ac ne maximis quidem par∣centi sumptibus intercipere Polum
non successisset, implacabilis irae at{que} acerbitatis suae impetum in Margaretam Poli matrem avertit. Ea erat lectissima & sanctissima faemi∣na, Edvardi Regis fratris filia. Nec tamen genere, quam moribus, innocentia ac totius vitae laude nobilior: in cujus disciplinâ antè Henricus Mariam unicam filiam educaverat. Tum abreptam in carcerem diu aerumnis ac miserijs male habitam, falsis etiam nuntijs interfecti Regi∣naldi filij tortam, postremò altero filiorumu natu majori, qui simal cap∣tus in eâdem custodiâ habebatur; crudeliter necato, anum ipsam alte∣rum & septuagesimum annum agen∣tem, palam in foro capitali supplicio afficit, nullum ob crimen aliud, quam quod Reginaldum genuisset, & de fide Catholicae pietatis decedere recusasset.
Though enough has bin al∣ready promoted in this kind, to please and satisfy al persons, whose Religion allows them any freedom of spirit; yet I cannot think this following Re∣lation will appear tedious. Ex L. B. ILlud autem persuasum habeo, ejus∣modi me legentium oculis imagi∣nem propositurum, quae omnibus iis, quae in Christianum hominem cadere possunt, virtutibus ornata & expo∣lita appareat. Tantas in hunc Deus hominem ex uberrimo illo benignita∣tis suae fonte divinorum munerum di∣vitias transfuderat. Atque hae qui∣dem tot tamque insignes Poli Car∣dinalis virtutes omnibus tota Eu∣ropa
ita cognitae atque perspectae fue∣runt, ut multi etiam, qui eum nun∣quam vidissent, èjus nominis studio∣sissimi atque cupidissimi fierent. Ce∣lebre est etiamnum ejus nomen apud omnes bonos, magnáque cum laude, saepenumero in sermonibus usurpa∣tur: at{que} ita gratiosa est apud mul∣tos Principes ejus memoria, ut, si quem in ejus familiâ aliquandiu ver∣satum intelligant, eum, vel hanc u∣nam ob causam, benevolentiâ, com∣plectantur, ei{que} libenter faveant. Tan∣ta fuit ejus mansuetudo & clemen∣tia, ut si quis eum offendisset, ni∣bil de ulciscendo cogitaret, omnes{que} injurias facile remitteret, at{que} condo∣naret. Viterbij tres Italos, ne∣cem sibi molientes, liberari jussit. Duos item Anglos Capranicae, quò ipse ob aestivos calores vitandos
secesserat, comprehensos, qui ad eum trucidandum ab Henrico rege ex ultimâ usque Angliâ submissi erant, necari noluit, cùm ad unum se eam injuriam pertinere diceret; nec duri∣us in illos animadverti passus est, quàm ut paucos ad dies ad triremes relegarentur. Res adversas & ca∣lamitates, tam forti magnoque animo semper tulit, ut, ei hac virtute pa∣res qui essent, paucos admodum me∣moriâ nostrá fuisse existimem, su∣periorem verò neminem. Ejus rei multa possem afferre exempla, sed hoc uno contenti erimus. Quodam die cum multas ex Galliâ, atque ali∣is ex locis literas accepisset, mihi∣que mandâsset, ut iis respondcrem; tum ego literas in unum fasciculum colligens, cum quasdem Anglica lingua scriptas vidissem: Ad has
verò, inquam, non est, quod ego respondeam, cùm ejus linguae planè sim ignarus. Ille minimè turbato vultu, utinam verò, inquit, eas & legere posses & intelligere. Laetum, enim nuntium referunt. Ejus ego nuntii cupiditate incensus, ut me quo∣que ejus participem esse velit, rogo. Tum ille, equidem semper ex∣istimavi, inquit, Dei benefi∣cio, ejus me faeminae filium esse, quae tum genere ipso, tum virtuti∣bus primaria esset. Quâ de re maxi∣mas etiam Deo gratias habebam. Nunc verò non id solùm, verium etiam majori me Dei benificio auctum video. Matrem enim meam mar∣tyrii gloriâ ornatam esse audio. Nam cum illa Catholicam fidem nostram constanter retineret, neque eam dese∣rere ullâ ratione vellet, Henrici
jussu, septuaginta jam annos natae mulieri caput est amputatum. Hoc sciliect praemium tulit laborum, quos in educandâ ejus filiâ susceperat. His verbis, consternato animo cum essem; bono, inquit ille, animo simus: haec quoque accessit ad caeteros patronos, & advocatos, quos in caelis habemus. Postea in sacellum, ubi deum pre∣cari solebat, secessit; ubique aliquan∣diu commoratus est, egressus ad suos eundem semper vultum, ean∣dem hilaritatem retinuit. Neque verò hoc ille faciebat, aut quòd me∣diocriter matrem diligeret, aut quod non vehementer ab illá redamare∣tur; sed eâ animi fortitudine, ut dictum est, munitus erat, ut his fortunae telis de constantiâ suâ deji∣ci non posset. Sic prorsus nuntium tulit de fratris sui natu maximi ne∣ce,
cui Rex caput, uná cum duo∣bus aliis ejus Consanguineis, religio∣nis causâ, praecidi jusserat: Sic a∣lias complures calamitates, & res adversas. Atque in his quemad∣modum fortiter se gerebat; ita in secundis rebus humiliter; ut neque in alteris ullo modo efferetur, neque alteris depimeretur. Sic paupertatem tanquam dives; opes tanquam pauper tulit. Pridie ejus diei quo è vitâ discessit, extremae unctionis sacra∣mentum sua sponte ipse, nemine mo∣nente, postulavit, & ad extremum usque spiritum & locutus est, & prae∣clarè sibi semper constitit; ac tam leniter, quietéque animam ipsam ef∣flavit, ut dormientis speciem magis, quam morientis, vultus ejus ac to∣tus corporis habitus referret. Obiit autem, quod sanè mirum videri que∣at,
eo ipso die, quo Regina. Scrip∣to to testamento Aloysium Priulum Patritium Venetum, quem unicè amaverat, & semper fratris loco habuerat, suarum rerum omnium haeredem instituit, ejusque arbitrio permisit, ut cum alia quaedam ip∣sius legata distribueret, tum iis, qui se longinquis è partibus se∣cuti fuerant, sibique ministrave∣rant, tum aliis; id singulis dom daret, quod cujusque diligentiam promeritam judicaret. Is cum haereditatem recusaret, neque tamen proptereà distribuendorum legato∣rum onus suscipere nollet; Ro∣gavit eum Polus, quod etiam in ipso testamento perscribi voluit, ut aliquam saltem bonorum suorum partem sibi sumeret, quae tanquam aliquod veteris ac perpetuoe inter
ipsos conjunctionis pignus ac monu∣mentum extaret. Hoc ille planè renuit, seque jam inde ab initio cùm in ejus se familiaritatem con∣tulerat, longè alterius generis bona secutum, ex eisque plurima assecu∣tum esse respondit. Atque ita cum haeres scriptus esset, nihil ex haere∣ditate capere voluit, praeter duos libellos, ex quibus Polus deum pre∣cari solitus erat, Breviarium vo∣camus & Diurnale. Atque hic quidem est Priulus ille, quem ini∣tio diximus, anno 1532. Patavii in arctissimam Poli consuetudinem venisse, neque ab ejus lutere un∣quam, ex eo tempore, discessisse, sed omnium itinerum, legationum, laborum comitem ac socium: studiorum item consiliorum ac omnium periculo∣rum participem fuisse, ut neque ullis ho∣noribus,
nec dignitate, quae illi, cùm in patriâ suá in quâ summa est ejus familiae nobilitas atque ampli∣tudo; tum Romae, non semel pro∣ponebatur, a Poli consuetudine avelli posset, quam omnibus divitiis omni∣que dignitati facilè anteponebat. Post ejus mortem xx totos menses, qui∣bus ille superstes vixit, in colligen∣dis magno labore ejus rebus, quae va∣riis in locis disjectae erant, & in illis, summâ cum fide, distribuendis consumpsit. Englished thus. But I am verily perswaded, that I shal herein represent to the eyes and understanding of the reader, an image polisht and adorn'd with all those vertues, which can fal within the capa∣citie
of a true Christian spirit. The divine Goodnes, with so large an effusion of grace, had enrich't the soul of this Reginaldus Polus. Whose rare and excel∣lent vertues were so eminently conspicuous over al Europe, that many, who never saw him, cherisht the very thoughts, ima∣gination, and name of him. Nay even now any mention or commemoration of him is very pleasant and delightful a∣mong al persons of honor or worth: and among Princes his memory is stil so gratious and prevalent, that to have bin of his family onely, is a sufficient commendation and entrance in∣to their favor. His peaceable mildnes and clemency was so ex∣traordinary,
that howsoever offended he remitted al injuries, never complotting or meditating any sort of revenge. At Vi∣terbo he caused three Italian con∣spirers of his death to be deli∣ver'd out of prison. Whilst he was at Capranica retir'd to shun the infesting heats of the summer, two English men sent by King Henry to dispatch him, he would by no means suffer to be put to death, alleging how the injury pertain'd to him alone, as Judge and Partie: Nor would he permit any other punishment to pass upon them, save only the condemnation to the Gallies, for some few dayes. His va∣rious afflictions, misfortunes and calamities he ever sustain'd with
so great a courage, and noble constancie, that certainly this age has not afforded his equal. To this purpose I could pro∣duce many examples, but let this alone for the present suf∣fice. When on a certain day, he had receiv'd several letters out of France, and many other remote parts, and order'd me to prepare their answers: so foon as they were collected in∣to distinct pacquets, perceiving some in English, I told him, I hope, Sir, you expect not that I should answer these, as being a stranger to the language. He, not the least chang'd in looks or colour instantly replyed; I wish you could read and understand them both at once, for they
import joyful news and tidings. Withat impatient in my itching desire, I humbly beg'd, that I might participate. I alwaies thought my self, says he, the son of a woman as singular and eminent for her vertues, as extraction: in which respect, I have often rendred thanks to the divine Goodnes. But now I find these former qualities strang∣ly dignifyed with a noble van∣tage of quite another and higher nature, by her being crown'd & adorn'd with the glory of a happy martyrdom. For whilst she constantly retain'd her Ca∣tholique faith and religion, im∣movable by any threats or per∣swasions, she lost her head up∣on the Scaffold, at the age of
seventy Years, receiving this re∣ward, for the great pains taken in the education of his only daughter, from King Harry the Father. When, I amaz'd with sudden horror and astonisht, startled at this relation; be of good courage, sayes he, my Mo∣ther has happily encreast the number of our patrons and ad∣vocats in heaven. After this, re∣tiring for some few moments to a Chapel, where his use was to pray, he strait appears among us again, with the same former looks and chearful countenance. Neither did he act this strange unexpected part out of a tepid indifferency of affection, which he had for her, or she for him
(which was quite contrary in both) but out of a magnani∣mous constancy not expos'd or obnoxious to these violent at∣taques and cruel injuries of for∣tune. No other alteration was perceiv'd by us in him, at the sad doleful message of the death of his eldest Brother, who with two other of his nearest allies, lost their heads upon the Scaf∣fold by the Kings order, for con∣stantly adhearing to their reli∣gion. These, and many other afflicti∣ons, calamities and injuries of di∣vers sorts he suffered with the same perpetualy inalterable con∣stancy. And as Fortun could not terrify him with her frowns;
so she could not seduce him with her smiles. His affairs running prosperously somtimes beyond expectation could ne∣ver puff him up beyond his accustom'd station; nor turning retrograde on the contrary cause in him the least dejection. So that his seeming poverty in riches; and his great satis∣faction in poverty were both alike commendable. Three dayes before he dyed (of his one accord without a∣ny other admonishment) he desir'd to have the Sacra∣ment of Extreme-Vnction, retaining his speech, senses and understanding entire to the very last moment. He ren∣dred
up his spirit in that gen∣tle, quiet and placide man∣ner, that his face, visage, fashion and habit of his whole body represented the posture of one sleeping, rather than dead. That which seems mar∣velous to some, is that his Queen, and he should expire both within the compas of the same natural day. In his last Will and Testament he or∣dained Aloysio Priuli a noble man of Venice, whom he most singularly affected, the entire heire of whatsoever he pos∣sest. To whose wil and pleasure he freely transmitted the disposal of certain legacies, gifts and rewards to such,
who had followd him out of forrein parts, and others of his attendants, according as he thought the merit and diligence of each person proportionaly required. Whereas this noble Venetian absolutely refus'd the total inheritance: he beg'd and entreated of him the ac∣ceptance onely of some part, which might appear, as a lasting pledge and monument of their ever inviolated love and friendship. This also he utterly renounc't, replying, that when he first courted and in∣sinuated himself into his fa∣miliarity, he propos'd in his minde an other sort of rich∣es, goods and treasure, with
which now he thought himself a∣bundantly gratifyed. Thus he the total heir of so conside∣rable an inheritance accepted of nothing, but only two prayer-books, renderd precious in his thoughts by the frequent u∣sage of Reginaldus Polus, where∣of the one was cal'd the Ro∣man Breviary, and the other the Diurnal belonging to it. This is that Aloysio Priuli, who in the year 1532 at Padua contracted that individual and exemplary familiarity and friendship with Polus, which never afterward admitted of any separation in adversity or prosperity. He was a con∣stant companion in all his jour∣neys
by Sea and Land, in his tedious and dangerous em∣bassies, and al other toyles and troubles: so unanimously participating also of al his in∣tentions, purposes, studies and counsels, that he was sensible of no titles, honors, digni∣ties, which were open and obvious in his own Country, by reason of the great no∣bility and prerogative of his family: nor could Rome her self with her dazling purple and other allurements ever seduce him from this habitual society and enjoyment of his friend, a hapines which he so inestimably valew'd above al others: and whom he sur∣viv'd
only the space of twenty months, which interval of time he wholy employ'd in the collection of those goods, which were disperst in several Coun∣treys, and in the just and equal-distribution of them. This memorable friendship of Reginaldus Polus and Aloysius Priulus contracted between per∣sons of so distant and diffe∣rent Countreys, certainly ex∣cels in al circumstances, that of Laelius and Scipio, or what e∣ver other examples, the an∣tient Grece or Rome or the Bar∣barians (as they cal them) could ever produce. For that religion which most enriches our minds with the best Vertues,
and devests them of usurping passions, renders them the most susceptible of this rare and divine quality. Which therefore consequently must alwayes be among the most excelent Christians. The Phi∣losophers and their followers had the sublime vertues of this nature in subtile specula∣tion onely, which were left for others to put into real exercise and practise. I have at present suffici∣ently, as I hope, refuted some perverse Chroniclers a∣mong us, enemys, as we see, to truth, honor, and the just respect due to royal families: and have shown how requi∣sit
it is for these many years, to look abroad, that we may understand any truth at home of this kind. The Testimo∣nies produc't are very authen∣tique. Which I have the ra∣ther encreast, because nothing, methinks, can be said too much of so Rare, Divine and Princely a subject. How∣ever I shall now supersede, omitting many Authors of ex∣celent account, as the French President Thuanus, and the fa∣mous Pallavicini, with many other Italian Writers. Who generaly in their relations, very much extol and magnify the power of King Harry, able to revive in Italie a custom
abolisht ever since Marius, Sulla and Marc-Antony, in proscribing a great Roman senator in Rome it self, as wel as other parts of the world. Among these Authors, which I must advertise you, you will often find il Cardinal d' Inghiltierra mentioned; which you must have a care, not to take for our rich, fat Prelat the Cardinal Wolsey. Otherwise your mistake will be very grosse. For this Reginaldus Polus, who is thereby signified, and He were as different in quality and worth, as they were in extraction; the vast, immense ambition of the one, almost equalizing the most Christian
humility of the other, and therefore vainly coveting and courting with an insolent presumption that Papacy, which the other with so generous a magnanimitie refus'd. Now, as I suppose, I have fully satisfy'd my engagement, though perchance not the desire or expectation of our obliging friend. What the postscript of your last letter signifies, concerning some versification on this subject, was never included in my promise. Yet to be as complyant, as I can, I shal send here two Epigrams: in the former of which, could I dispense with
my self, from being serious, in so grave a subject, as the sacred memory of this Cardinal, I could impose upon our friend, acting the jocular plagiary, and make my self pass for the author; being they seem so adapted to this noted Epitaph, Depo∣situm Poli Cardinalis. But I can assure you, they were made above a thousand years ago, as I shal make it ap∣pear at our next meeting. As for the latter, they are excelent verses, made on the picture of this great person, drawn by Titian, and now in the Farnesian Palace. It would appear almost a madnes in me, to write on the same
subject, after Marcus Antonius Flaminius the celebrated Au∣thor. I shal onely therefore venture, for satisfaction sake in this kind, to send some recover'd fragments of a Poem, dedicated to the honor of the Heroical Prince of this age, during the Dutch Wars, and to be prefixt before a meteo∣rique treatise, not publish't, by reason of the late rogueries, set here artificialy on foot a∣mong us.
Epigrama primum. FƲnctus honorato sienio, plenusque dierum Evocor ad superos: pignora quid gemitis; Reddere Depositum lex est: ideoque petenti Corpus humo, manes restituoque Polo. Sumite quod vestrum est, insignia, ju∣ra, parentis Scilicet & titulos: plus satis r∣na mihi haec.
Epigrama secundum SIvelut egregiae picturae, maxime Pole, Est expressa tui corporis effigies: Sic divina tuae potuisset mentis imago Pingi, nil oculi pulchrius aspicerent. MArtia progenies Caroli, quem Gallica nympha Magnorum soboles regum, conjux{que} soror{que} Et formosa parens peperit felicibus astris; Quique tuum tantis animum natalibus aequas; Cum tua tot cupiant vates praeconiae laudis
Dicere, victuris necnon inscribere chartis; Hactenus baud facile inceptis timor ob∣stitit ausis. Me traxit non unus amor, vel causa canendi. Nam cum perjuri jam factio dira Se∣natus. Factio non omnem non execranda per aevum, Cum superis & patre tuo sibi bella gerenda Censuit, & victo leges imponere caelo: Te profugum sedes nostris habitata Ca∣maenis Excipit, & primae docuit praeludia famae.
Hic primum conscendere equos, frae∣nare lupatis Discis, & attonitos cursu proevertere cervos; At{que} alia exerces belli simulacra futuri, Cujus te posthac docuit Turennius arteis, Exemplo & monitis magnus Turennius inquam, Sic ut jam tanto vix cesseris ipse ma∣gistro. Nam tibi cum fuerit teneris maturius annis Ingenium & robur, vix puber ad arma vocatus
Non finis has tacita dotes torpere sub umbra; Principibus licet hos mores indulserit oelas. Si memorare juvat primornm elementa laborum Ac veluti puerile decus, quis fortius unquam Aggressus fuerit, repulitve audacior hostem? Signa magis prompte anteivit, serove reliquit Sub dio aestivos soles, ac frigora passus? Ʋnde tibi nullum imperium Turennius olim
Detraxit, tanti semper securus alumni! At tua non superat civilem bellica lau∣rum: Non hinc aut illinc debentur praemia laudis Inferiora tibi: Cum tu bellique do∣mique Idem semper eras; eadem constantia vultus Atque animi laeta sorte adversaque renidens. Quo sumis vultu fasceis, deponis eodem. Nil nova miraris raptus popularibus auris,
Immemor haud unquam morum vitae∣que paternae: Nec te fixa manent, aut plebiscita refixa. Libertas, legesque placent; mensura∣que recti Non tibi sunt vires: scelerum victoria merces Parta, tibi est odio: licet hi jam sae∣cula nostra Infamant mores: ut dextera fortis in armis, Promissis sic firma sides: Castrisque foroque Justitia & pietas una comitantur u∣bique.
Hic tua non virtus veteris cum laude magistri Substitit ingenti: sed me per inhospita ponti Impatiens secum abreptat, non flucti∣bus istis Assuetum, ac ultra timidum contendere litus Cum jam concurrere nostrae Ausa fuit Batavum classis: non acrius unquam Pugnatum est: tamen hinc spolia ampla & opima tulisti
Summe Ducum, patriae decus admi∣rabile nostrae E pelago primus: nam cum Praetoria puppis Opdamii tecum congressa est; prote∣nus ipsam Ignivomis globulis attollis in aethera, quamvis Ingenti sub mole viri, sub mole ca∣rinae Ingemuit pontus. Sic formidare coactus Oceanum Batavus, sua regna antiqua reliquit, Ac te sanguineis urgentem fugit in un∣dis.
Ah tamen haud parvo stetit haec victo∣ria nobis: Nam quam lecta manus prope te juve∣numque virumque Concidit! illa tuis tam digna natali∣bus ora Ah visu indignum! sanie sunt sparsa tuorum: Non autem domitus Batavus, sed victus abibat: Major colligitur classis post damna, priori. Nam quibus antiquus, novus ac vix sufficit orbis,
Sic puduit vinci, in ponto dare terga coactis. Armatas igitur propriis e sedibus urbeis Emittunt pelago, ventoque aestuque se∣cundo. Navibus opprimitur pontus: tot car∣basa venti Vix simul impellunt. Jam nobis for∣tius instant Robore nec numero paribus: tum flecte∣re gyro Incipimus laceras puppeis: Et jam tua navis Strage virum cumulata fere subsidit in undis,
Vela cadunt, pinus fracta est: At non tua virtus Fracta fuit; sed enim mediis excelsa periclis Clarius emicuit, revocatque in milite vireis: Qualis, ubi obductum picea caligine caelum Cum premitur, Coro Boreaque agitante procellas Per mare, per terras; soboles si forte refulsit Ledaea, assumit faciem natura priorem, Laetior & ridet, subductis nubibus aether.
Jam cocunt naves, ubi te Vexilla fe∣rentem Regia conspiciunt, medios lapsumque per hosteis. Nunc iterum redeunt animi, paulo ante sopiti, Atque irae, quas tu regalia lumina torquens Accendis; nunquam tanta est data co∣pia famae Caeruleis campis, virtusque exercita u∣trinque; Belga licet primus vireis animosque re∣mittens
Non tua laethiferae jam tandem fulmina classis Sustinuit, cessitque mari, rursusque sub∣egit Hos contemptores regum tua regia classis. O toties invicte malis, terra{que} mari{que} Egregium o gentis Britonum per saecula nomen, Spesque tui generis, nostri & tutela Profundi Quandoquidem decus & longe tibi ces∣sit avorum Gloria magnorum, patriaeque exempla parasti
Virtutis, quae te summis Heroibus ae∣quat; Parce pio tandem capiti, & sic pros∣pice nobis: Communem belli sortem reverere, nec ultra Prodigus heu animae magnae, patriaeque salutis Atque tuae, tantis ita te committe pe∣riclis. Cum vero his pridem terris Astraea reducta Consiliis, placidoque tui moderamine fratris Otia secum affert, curarum pondere pectus
Expediens, hoc pacis opas tibe some, meamque Uranien vestris samulam penetralibus altis Admitte: affinis tua mens caelestibus astris, Satque datum pelago & terris: ne si∣dera differ Amplius ac caelos: En haec te lucida∣late Aetheris immensi spatia, astrorumque meatus, Atque situs, variosque obitus, ortusque docebit. Aurea quinetiam sua limina pandit Olympus,
Quae tibi pulcher honos pridem pietas∣que reclusit. Respice sam qua parte mices; seu Sig∣nifer axe Arrisit ruilo, magis aut temone Tri∣ones, Qua unquam poteris nostris occumbere terris, Invenies virtute viam: sed pauperis umbrae Quo feror e tecto, quae me caligine celat Seclusum vulgo? quo me rapit ardor amantem O Dux magne tui? cujus perstringere laudes
Hic volui tantum: nos posthac plura canemus, Quaeque meas coluit musas, florente ja∣venta, Inclyta clarorum genitrix Limnestria vatum, Mecum una aeternis condet tua nomina Fastis. FINIS.
