REFLECTIONS Upon some Passages in George Keith's Third Narrative. P. 2. HE recites some words of G. Whitehead, as if they were Haeretical, which are not only Inoffensive, but such as import the Profession of that Faith, without which no Man can be Sanctified. Again, in Answer to T. Smiths Question, p. 23. Q. 43. When you tell us that ye have Faith in Christ, do you mean Christ, whose Person is now Ascended into Heaven above the Clouds? Or do you mean only a Christ within you? G. W. replyeth. Answ. Here thou wouldst make two Christs, a Christ, whose Person is a∣bove the Clouds, and a Christ within. But how provest thou two such Christs? We have Faith in that Christ that Descended from The Father, who is The SAME that Ascended far Above all Heavens, that He might Fill All things, and this CHRIST We Witness IN US, who is not divided. P. 6. On these words, 'His HUMANE PERSON (Agreeable to the Haeresie of NESTORIUS) us'd by John Faldo, G. Keith hath this Note: He means His Nature of Manhood, Personally United to his Godhead. Why Na∣ture
of Manhood, and not the usual words His Humane Nature? If G. K. would put so favourable a construction on the Words of the Quakers, as he does upon those Haeretical words of John Faldo, the Bulk of his Narrative would shrivel into a very Narrow Compass. P. 10. He recites these words of William Penn: The Seed of the Promise is an Holy and Spiritual Principle of Light, Life, and Power, that being received into the Heart, bruiseth the Serpents Head. And because the Seed which cannot be that Body, is Christ, as testifie the Scriptures, the Seed is one, and that Seed Christ, and Christ GOD over all, Blessed for ever; we do conclude, and that most truly, that Christ was, and is the Divine Word of Light and Life, that was in the Beginning with GOD, and was, and is GOD over all Blessed for ever. 'Tis Evident that when W. P. says, the Seed cannot be that Body, he means the Body of Christ considered Abstractly from His Person or Essence which is Eternal. The SEED in the Language of the Apostle, signifies The SON OF GOD, considered with reference to that Body which he Assum'd in the Womb of the Blessed VIRGIN. The rest of William Penn's words in this Place, contain a plain, and evident Con∣fession of Faith in the SON of God. P. 17. G. K. hath these words: Nor will G. Whitehead, nor yet his Moderate, and Learned Church-man, their Eva∣sion Excuse G. Whitehead his Gross Error, in thus Opposing by Socinian Arguments the God-head of Christ, &c. And his Moderate Church-man is Idle, and Weak in granting the word Co-creating, and not Co-creator. Answ. Co-CRE∣ATING signifies there are More Creating, or who do Create, than One: Co-CREATOR signifies there are More CRE∣ATORS, than One: The first Saying I Approve, the lat∣ter I Abhor. The Father, Son and Holy Ghost are Co-creating, but ONE CREATOR. Whether I Deserve the Epithets
of Idle and Weak; or G. Keith of Proud and Insolent, the Learn∣ed and Pious Reader may Determine. In his Letter to G. W. He says that I take part with G. W. in his Vile Errors. I CHALLENGE GEORGE KEITH to Prove that I have Asserted any one Error, in any one of the several Papers that have been Publish'd for Me by the People called Quakers. He would have the World to Believe that I am one of those who call themselves DEISTS, viz. who Deny that Jesus Christ is the True and Eternal GOD. E. El. says he, by name, and some other Deists. Here he's Guilty of a most Notorious LYE: For he knows that I do most Earnestly Profess the Belief of the God-head of JESUS CHRIST. That this Malitious Aspersion may not in any measure stick on Me, I shall entreat the Learned Reader to Peruse my Trea∣tise entituled, DEI INCARNATI VINDICIAE, and my Paper against CRELLIƲS. I would have G. Keith to Know, that the Moderate Church-man most earnestly Desires, that both Himself and G. Keith may be ever Mindful of those words of the Blessed Apostle: Let your MODERATION be known unto all Men. The LORD is at hand. Edmund Elys. LONDON, Printed and Sold by T.
