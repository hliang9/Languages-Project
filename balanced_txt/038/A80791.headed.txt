CREDIBLE INTELLIGENCE CONCERNING CAPTAINE TUTHILL Governour of Rushall Garrison IN STAFFORDSHJRE. HAving viewed some little in a late Diurnall, of the great activity of the No∣ble Governour of Rushall in Staffordshire; I was desirous to make a more true relation of what was then published, and so signifie divers later pas∣sages to the end that that faithful servant of the Parliament might be better observed, and his worthy acts (formerly too much neglected) might now be published, who upon the fourteenth of this instant Iune, with his small Troop coasting the Countrey (according to his constant custome) for the securitie thereof, discovered a partie of the enemies Forces, having a Coach, and a number of Horse guarding the same towards Liechfield, whom this noble spirit saluted with so hot a charge, that in short time he made him master thereof, wherein was the younger sonne of Sir Gual∣ter Devereux, whom the enemies had taken, and were carrying him to Liechfield: For his elder brother having beaten up the enemies Quarters at Lye Court where Captaine Debdale, a Pestilent plundering person in Liechfield, lost the most part of his horses, and fled to Worcester, and procured a partie of horse to fetch in Sir Gualter Devereux his yon∣ger sonne, intending to keep him prisoner untill all their Horses and Armes were again re∣stored: But the unconquered Champions of Rushall dashed their hopes, rescued the priso∣ners, ceized the Coach, with many prisoners and brave horses, and forced the rest to flie, leaving theîr luggage and portmantues, amongst which were some belonging to the said Debdale, and the Lord Carington, who escaped very narrowly. The said garrison of Rushall hath been now lately faced twice, and once summoned by the Kings forces: But the later time they sallied out and encountred them, and tooke two good horses and one Souldier, and since that went to the very towne of Liechfield, and took a Lieutenant, and three o∣ther prisoners, with three very good horses. It is much desired for the safety of that coun∣trey, and keeping the way open betwixt London and the Northwest parts of the King∣dome, that the Garrison of Rushall were more countenanced, and the number of Horse therein augmented.
