To the Reader. Courteous Reader, YOu have now the Second Part of Cloria and Nar∣cissus, sooner sent after the First then was deter∣mined, in regard the Stationer was some∣thing pressing to have it with the for∣mer: perhaps it may give more satis∣faction then the other, for that (ac∣cording to my apprehension) it doth as much cleare difficulties, as can well stand with the nature of a Romance: More I shall not need to say, to any o∣ther purpose, then what you may read in the Epistle to the first part.
Onely, judicious Reader, craving your favourable construction of all such faults as may have escaped in both parts, either by defect of printing, or otherwaies by oversight of the Author.
THE SECOND PART OF Cloria and Narcissus. AS the Princesse Clorias thoughts now were reasonably well setled, concerning the safety of Narcissus, in regard of the messengers relati∣on, so Roxana with more alacrity and cheerfulnesse, summoned a a new Dedalus, to make an end of those passages belonging to the Island of Crete; whereupon one day meeting in the same walke that had entertai∣ned the Princesse, upon her first arrivall in the Country, they both seated themselves together under a tree, artificially made into an Arbour of pleasure, that had its full prospect toward the sea; whilst he gave her this further accompt: Madam said he, as for the interests which I for∣merly mentioned unto you not many dayes since, you may be pleased to know, that as Evarchus our King in his Warres with the Senate of Lydia,
must be forced upon all occasions, to court any assistance whatsoever for his best advantage, so of the other side doe the Cretans resolve to make use of their present power, to gaine benefits to them∣selves, and party in any thing they can procure, either from their Prince or any other: to this pur∣pose, after the agreement that I told you of, which I made with the Natives of the Country, (howe∣ver many of the most rigid sort, would not at all come within any manner of communication, whereby to be subject to the Lydian power, there∣unto incouraged as 'tis supposed by a messenger from Delphos, that neither understands the Islands interest or the peoples good) they designed Com∣missioners to be sent to Philadelphae, where the King then remained, to Treat upon such conditi∣ons, as they conceived most necessary for their commodity and security: Thus arriving at court, in a short time they were not onely admitted to kisse the Kings hands, but withall permitted to present their Petitions and requests; for this cere∣mony (and so I may well call it, since it produced but small effects, to the advantage of any party) there was appointed a great Hall in the City of Philadelpha, into which place the messengers were brought with some State, as soone as the King was seated in his Throne, because they should not complaine of the want of any circum∣stance, that belonged to the solemne entertaine∣ment of Ambassadours of other Nations, to make them the willinger to comply towards the assi∣stance desired: After they had beene in this man∣ner received, as also with good language from the
Kings own mouth cherished, they presented a pa∣per that contained these peremptory demands: First they desired to have, not onely the free exer∣cise of their religion through the whole Island, notwithstanding the Lydian lawes to the contrary according to the rights and customes of Delphos, but withall to enjoy the use of the best Temples, alone appropriated to themselves, with all the rents and priviledges that of old at any time be∣longed unto them: Secondly, they expected an absolute concession from his Majesty, that no go∣vernours whatsoever of any forraigne Nation, should be appointed over them in Creet or in any Fort or Island belonging to the same; besides they refused to admit of those of the very Country it selfe, unlesse they were confirmed and approved of by the gentrall councell, which they had esta∣blished to manage & odered all their affairs both in peace and Warre: And lastly they expected, (as the writing which they had delivered the King exprest) an absolute restoration of all those lands to the true owners, that had beene taken from their possession, by reason of any former pre∣tended rebellion, and given to the Myssians or Ly∣dians, either by the old Queene of Lydia, or E∣varchus father: The King, as I was informed after he had read these propositions, seemed to the out∣ward view of the assembly, extreamely troubled in his apprehensions, as if he had been exceedingly deceived in his expectation, concerning the good nature and reality of our country-men: howe∣ver, notwithstanding he was by this meanes suffi∣ciently inflamed in his thoughts, in regard of these
proceedings; (not onely in some sort disdaining to be thus handled by his Subjects in his necessi∣ties, but being also with some reason suspicious of their intentions, as fearing that they aymed to become Masters of the whole Island, and so by consequence to be possessors of most of the Lands of his best friends, who were actually imployed now with him in his Warres) yet conceiving that he was not at the instant, in a capacity to shew much discontent to any party, that could either good or hurt him in his present differences with the Senate, he gave their commissioners at least∣wise faire words in the generall, promising spee∣dily to send particular messengers of his own into Creet, not onely more knowingly to Treat with them concerning their demands; but withall, if it were possible, to conclude with them concerning his own desires, which he conceived would be for both their advantages, against the common ene∣my, that had an intention to destroy either: in this manner they were dismist into their owne Country, partly pleased, and a great deale more unsatisfied, in regard no more life remained from their imployment, then the expectation of the comming of the Kings officers: But in the inte∣rim whilst these messengers were look't for, both the Kingdome of Syria and the Country of Aegypt put in for their severall interests, as well concer∣ning the government it selfe of the Island, as to be supplyed from hence, with Souldiers in their Warres, one against another; the State of Syria went onely upon the score of Evarchus right and Titles, though Sorastros challenged their affecti∣ons
in his service, by an ancient Tye as he said they owed the Aegyptian Nation: neither as I told you formerly, was the Arch-Flamin of Delphos backward in maintaining to the uttermost of his power (by the industry of some instruments he imployed) his owne jurisdiction above either; as pretending the best right to the same, by reason of those agreements that had been made with the Kings of Lydia, who first conquered this Island. These attempts I must say, extreamely divided the inhabitants both in their actions and opini∣ons: for as the more moderate sort of people (especially those that had any correspondency with the Lydians, either by extraction or com∣merce) were willing enough to continue the old government, and retaine both their lawes and cu∣stomes they had formerly used, so the violenter part of the Natives, that had time out of minde contracted a certaine kinde of barbarisme in their manners and dispositions, would heare of no a∣greement, but what was prescribed them by a few commanders, that were sent from the Aegyptian Warres, who seemed onely to comply with the religion of Delphos for their owne ends: The people I may affirme with some confidence, were so far transported, & infatuated with this spight∣full ambition (their governours in the interim, supposing they should be made petty Princes in command, amongst the more ignorant sort of Na∣tives) that they did not onely decline violently all manner of reasonable accords, but even were per∣swaded to hate with an exact spleene and malice, all their owne country men, friends and kindred,
that had any manner of correspondency, or al∣most the least communication with those of the Lydian race and interest: In the Interim the Se∣nate of Lydia, finding this violence and distracti∣ons amongst us, resolved to put many of the strong Forts of the Country (which from the beginning of the troubles, they had kept in their possession) absolutely into the hands of the Myssians, the bet∣ter to avoid the expence; and inconveniency of the Warre in their owne particulars, having as they thought enough to doe with their King in in Lydia; and the rather for that they knew, that as Myssia was most proper, to send Souldiers of their owne Nation into the Island of Creet, where∣by to contend with the inhabitants, so was there such an inveterate spleene and hatred between the Natives of both Countreys, not onely in regard of their possessions, but their religion, that no recon∣ciliation was at any time to be feared: besides the Myssians with others of Lydia of their faction and interests, supposed the old Cretans owed them a secret revenge, for having injuriously outed them of their lands and estates, in the time of the late King Evarchus father. These Transactions I say, filled the whole coun∣try a new with bloud and slaughters; and the more confused it proved; (and so consequently the more horrid) in regard that for the most part, we fought dividedly upon the generall score of three interests: sometimes two against one, & then againe each for it selfe, as often as any opposition was found, which not seldome hapned, in regard of the many jealousies and suspitions, rising daily
out of the variety of apprehensions by reason of frequent accidents: so that in a short time, almost in every place the Townes were fired, the people destroyed, and the countrey depopulated; being no safety in any place, or scarce the least meanes of subsistance out of Armies, unlesse it were under the walls, and protection of some few garrisons, that secured a kind of small circuit, for necessary provisions, to maintain themselves and the inhabi∣tants of their jurisdiction: but the King at last re∣ceiving from me and others intelligence of these lamentable proceedings, in the Island of Creet (as truly in a manner it was past all examples, since the intention of all sides, was not alone to contend about disputable rights, occasioned by some for∣mer oppression, but even to extirpate not onely whole families, but the very remembrance of the Nation it selfe, that should have the unhappinesse to be overcome by the other) gave order to me if it were possible to reconcile these bloudy diffe∣rences and horrid contentions, with all the speed I could, especially amongst those of his own party, neither was he determintd to exclude out of this number the old Cretans themselves, however de∣pending upon other interests, onely in regard they seemed by their declarations formerly in words to stand for his Title and authority, against the proceedings of the Myssians, though publickly, they contended violently with his Forces in the field: 'Tis true I cannot deny but in some things they had reason enough for their jealousies, the King very often being constrained, to goe even from his own resolutions, to give satisfaction to
those Councels that were continually about his person; who perswaded him, he lost the love of his people in Lydia, by seeming in any kind to fa∣vour or countenance the Cretans in their de∣mands, who as they pretended were enemies to their generall established religion; Of the other side the Natives were againe by much too cove∣tous and mistrustfull not onely to desire violently other mens possessions and estates from them, but so entirely to doubt the Kings performance of his promises, when as they knew he did but endea∣vour for his better advantage, to contract private∣ly with them in most particulars, in such matters as appertained to the Temple of Delphos, for gi∣ving as I said too generall a distast, to those of his owne party, within the Kingdome of Lydia. But to be short, it was not very long, before the King sent a most intimate councellor of his owne into the Island of Creet, as well to informe me particu∣larly of his pleasure by word of mouth, as also to joyne himselfe with me and others in commission for the better and speedier effecting of his designes: presently as soone as hee arrived, we sent out our summons to the whole Countrey in the generall, either to meet themselves, or to appoint Deputies for each division in the Island, to attend the Kings orders and direction upon a certaine day at Pergame, not onely to heare what should be propounded in their Princes behalfe, for their future peace and advantage, but also we our selves would be ready to heare what the people would demand, to their further satisfaction, whereby their enemies, the Myssians, might be op∣posed
in their intentions; who endeavoured not onely to beat downe all Kingly authority in the Island, but to become absolute Lords, over all the inhabitants ancient liberties: I must tell you, whilst we expected a joyfull issue of these purpo∣ses, we understood another great Lord of Lydia, was newly arrived with certaine directions as was pretended from the King, independent to that power was granted us, whereby as we were infor∣med, onely himselfe was impowred underhand, to deale more intimately with the inhabitants con∣cerning matters of religion: as this something startled our expectation having no such notice from the King, so did we resolve to send for the party upon our authority, who upon his appea∣ring, neither obeying our commands, nor giving us the satisfaction was desired, we at that very in∣stant restrained his person, untill the Kings plea∣sure in that particular (as we said) should be pub∣lickly knowne: but whether these proceedings of ours (which however we esteemed for the best) or that the Natives in truth were otherwise setled in their resolutions, hindred the successe, when the day came according to the appointment for this assembly to meet, there appeared none at all of the ancient inhabitants of the Country, so that upon some conclusion of a few things between us and the rest of the Cretans, who were not altoge∣ther so spightfull against the Lydian customes as the others, we for the present dissolved any further Treaty, which in a manner is as much as I can say of our present state and affaires, ntill I shall be better instructed, either by the Natives inclinati∣ons,
or concerning the Kings fortunes and suc∣cesse; it not being yet a month since the intended Treaty was broake up: Roxana as she had beene very attentive to all Dedalus discourse, for that shee was extreamely desirous to informe her selfe in what particulars she could, concerning the passages of the Island, so when he had absolutely made an end of what he would say, she used these words unto him, tru∣ly my Lord, said she, I must needs confesse, this seemes to my imagination to be a most unfortu∣nate Country in the generall, if not to be threat∣ned by some desperate fate from the heavens, to its destruction: however of the other side, it seems something doubtfull as yet to my apprehension in what things the Natives are so much to blame according to many mens thoughts, since it is but reasonable, as the King is to expect from them their fidelity and assistance, so they should in some sort, be assured in their religion and possessions; e∣specially in a conjuncture of times when there are so many enemies of all parts that conspire their ruine; not onely in respect of the Myssians that are in open hostility against them, but in regard also of those that attend about Evarchus person at the Court; who are no way inclinable as you have already intimated to favour their procee∣dings or interest. Truly Madam answered Deda∣lus, if there were no more in it then those generals you mention, there might be much said in their behalfes, but being pleased to admit so farre of a tedious discour, that I may a little take apart the particulars of their demands, I make no que∣stion
but you will easily perceive, that as they were unreasonable, to exact from the Kings ne∣cessities such conditions, so was it unpossible for him to grant them their desires, without endan∣gering in a manner the whole frame of his affairs, both in Lydia and Creet it selfe. Dedalus finding, that Roxana was most willing to heare all his arguments for her better satisfacti∣on, he began thus to dispute: First, said he for their propositions mentioned, not onely to have a free liberty to exercise their owne Countrey rights, in the worship of the gods, according to the use of Delphos, but to have most of the chiefe Temples, belonging to the Island delivered into their hands, with all the rents and revenues belon∣ging unto them, it cannot but evidently appeare to all knowing judgements, what a distraction it would soone have made in Creet, when as in many places most of the inhabitants themselves, are contrary in their opinions to those principles, whereupon would follow a most desperate confu∣sion amongst all sorts of people; when such should be of a suddaine, debarred of the usuall place of their sacrificing to the gods, by those that for∣merly were subject to their lawes and customes; and much more strange and distastfull it would be, to have the maintenance of all their Priests and Flamins (being for the most part Lydians by birth) taken from them, and they turned with their whole families into the world without any sub∣stance at all, after so long a time of possession and settlement: besides it is very well knowne, many of the Noblemen and Gentry of the Country it
selfe, upon whose fidelity and power the Kings present affaires depended, were actually vested in a great part of those Titles and rents (in a manner beyond any remembrance) either by gift or pur∣chase: who no doubt upon such a disadvan∣tagable change, meerly out of spleene and di∣staste, would have quickly turned their endea∣vours and affections, to the countenancing abso∣lutely of the Myssians proceedings, against Evar∣chus their Prince: In the next place whereas they demanded, that either no strange governours should be appointed over any part of the Island, but meerly Natives, or at leastwise such as should be approved by the generall councell instituted by themselves, I pray consider but with indiffe∣rence, which I know you doe, what an extraordi∣nary (and I may say) a most preposterous incon∣veniency, it would have brought upon the Kings designes, not onely by reason of those contempti∣ble opinions, it would have created in all mens minds concerning his actions and want of spirit, but also have given so generall a distast to all his Subjects of best quality in both Kingdomes, that the effects must needs have beene of a most dange∣rous consequence, when as the principall men of honour should be absolutely outed, both of their present command or future expectation, to give way to the advancement of such people, that nei∣ther knew well how to governe when they should be imployed, or the King himselfe could be at all certaine of their fidelitie, when they were in of∣fice; as well in regard of the fantasticall inconstan∣cies of their own natures and dispositions; as also
in respect of their severall interests depending up∣on other Nations. And last of all, whereas it is de∣sired, that all those lands be againe restored to the ancient Natives of the Island, which had beene at any time forfeited, for what pretended rebellion soever, either in the raigne of the father of Evar∣chus, or the old Queene of Lydia, and so conse∣quently in the possession of any Lydians or Myssi∣ans, would have proved as dangerous an inconve∣niency to the Kings affaires, as any other thing we have yet mentioned; and in truth would have beene a worke (besides the generall distaste) of a most stupendious labour to have effected: not onely in regard of the severall intricate Titles, that must of necessity depend upon the long con∣tinuation of them from one family to another, by reason of alienations and bargaines of diverse natures and manners, made betweene man and man, but also would be a most difficult matter for the Natives themselves, justly to distribute with an indifferent equality and content, to each party who should make their demands, since as many would pretend to what was none of their owne, so others againe being but very young (if at all then borne) when their ancestors lost the possessi∣ons of their estates, (the property of them being also since that time changed, either by cutting down of woods, erecting of building, or peopling of Townes and Villages) would be defrauded of their dues, for want of certaine knowledge, what belonged to their Parents: besides how many hun∣dred of families, would be turned to a most mi∣serable begging posture? who as Tennants to
their Lords, had laid out their money of a confi∣derable valew upon purchases, either for lives or yeares, and knew not where to seeke other habi∣tations with their wives and children for their subsistance; neither truly could the Natives make any considerable profit of the said lands, for want of people to mannure them, since it is very well knowne, they in their owne persons are not any way husbandmen, or at all industrious without the Lydian assistance; wherefore consequently, this course and alteration must bring a generall devastation upon the whole Countrey: but put case some would readily yield to these orders and injunctions, by reason of quietnesse and possession, yet no doubt but the most part would oppose, being by birth or extraction either Myssians or Lydians, which of necessity would procure confu∣sion enough, as also be a meanes that Evarchus enemies, would dispossesse all his friends under their jurisdiction in like manner, wheresoever they had gained by their swords any thing over the Kings fortunes in Lydia, Myssia, or Creet. Of the other side, if we doe but consider, the small aide and assistance, these people could have affor∣ded their Prince at the best, we shall find these concessions (upon the matter) would have beene wholly lost, since they undertooke onely, to pro∣cure him ten thousand men to be imployed in his Warres, without paying them for any considera∣ble time; and the gods know perhaps, they would not fully have performed those promises; being as uncertaine in their undertakings, as unreasona∣ble in their demands: No no, Madam, said he,
these were but meer chymeras, broached by some of their eminent commanders for their own ends, to render themselves great and potent amongst the people, and afterward would have made use of their power, as their ancestors did before them, to no other purpose but to exercise Tyranny and nourish rebellion: And however, I say, that the messenger sent from Delphos seemed to concurre in these designes, yet I will not say he erred, so much in will and intention, as out of ignorance and want of judgement: neverthelesse though he imagined onely perhaps to reduce the inhabitants to their ancient obedience to the Temple of Del∣phos, without prejudicing much others rights, yet his complying so much with their rude and bar∣barous customes in outward shew, according to the old Natives humours; with his publickly dis∣countenancing all others of a more civill conver∣sation, notwithstanding they professed the same religion and worship of the gods, gave not onely cause of too much suspition, concerning his de∣signes and purposes, but occasioned a great deale of confusion and distraction in the generall as well to the overthrow of the Kings est, as to the hazard of the Natives subsistance in their owne Country, in regard of the advantages their ene∣mies the Myssians make of their differences. But heare a messenger sent from the Princesse Cloria stopt their further discourse, who as he said desi∣red to speake with Roxana: so that the old wo∣man, onely thanking Dedalus for what was past; and promising too meet him often upon the same subject, made hast to know her Mistresses pleasure:
When Roxana came into her Chamber, the Princesse told her, that she had beene lately trou∣bled with a most untoward and fearefull dreame, which however in her thoughts she was not at all superstitious as shee said, yet shee could not abso∣lutely free her apprehension from the considerati∣on of it: shee imagined her selfe and Narcissus to be upon the Sea together in one Vessell, when of a sudden an extreame darknesse seemed to cover the face of the water, in so much as they could not perceive any thing at all about them, whereupon both of them remaining frighted, with a kind of horrour to see so great an unexpected change in the weather, from a cleare Sun-shine-day, to a time almost as black as night, they might at last behold themselves incompassed round about with many ships, belonging to the Senate of Lydia, that bid them presently yield to that power without resistance, unlesse they would hazzard their owne destructions: so that instantly conceiving them∣selves no way able to resist so peremptory a com∣mand, their persons were presently not onely sei∣zed, but separated with a great deale of cruelty one from anoth, to their no small griefe and a∣mazement, whilst in the interim also shee heard some of the company say, that as this designe was put in execution, by the authority of young Philos Philostros nephew, so was it his pleasure to have her selfe carried prisoner into her fathers King∣dome of Lydia, as he was resolved to dispose of the person of Narcissus, according to his owne will and intentions in the Kingdome of Syria: presently upon the apprehension of the dreame (as
shee said) shee wakened, with some kinde of see∣ming trouble more then ordinary as the people about her had informed her her: Roxana finding her Mistresse notwithstanding her professions, to be something discomposed, either by reason of the distempers of her sicknesse, or in regard of the distraction of her apprehen∣sion, having belike before shee went to sleep, filled her imagination with some unprofitable thoughts proceeding from the discourse of former actions or conceptions, told her, that as it was the grea∣test folly in the world (if not a most supreame impiety) to put any manner of confidence or beliefe in dreames unpleasant, that were ingen∣dred onely in the fancy by meere accidents, mee∣ting with the indisposition of the body, so if the gods at any time had a will, we should be in∣structed in things to come necessary to be known, they would certainly send us for true informati∣on to Oracles, that are not to be held fallible in any kind: of the contrary, the motions that pro∣ceed from our selves are for the most part gover∣ned by passions; and so consequently not to be relyed upon, although sometimes I cannot deny said shee but they happen accordingly, though no otherwise then like as a person should cast a stone over a house, and by meere fortune might kill a bird of the other side; for though the stone had but that one place to light in to doe the thing, yet by meere fortune it might as well light there as any where else: but however this short dis∣course, reasonably well quieted the Princesses thoughts for the present; yet both shee and
Roxana fell upon a resolution, with all possible speed to haste their journey towards the Island of Cyprus; as well for that they doubted not, but to meet Narcissus to their extraordinary content and satisfaction there; as of the other side, not con∣ceiving Greet to be a place of sufficient security any long time, in regard of those many factions and disturbances in the country, depending upon severall interests, according to the relations of Dedalus the governour; for besides the inconstant natures of the people, with the small authority the King seemed to have by way of jurisdiction, over the very actions and affaires of his own party (as they were informed) could they be ve∣ry confident of the fidelity of the City of Per∣game, where they for the present remained; in regard the Senate of Lydia by occasion of Trade, seemed to have a kinde of hidden influence, in the thoughts and affections of most of the inhabi∣tants: neverthelesse, although Cloria and her go∣vernesse might have these passionate desires, of removing with all expedition, yet neither the di∣stempers of the Princesse, or the commodity of the Syrian Vessell that had conveyed them thi∣ther, as yet afforded them the conveniency. But whilst their expectations from day to day waited the opportunity, Dedalus of a sudden had intelligence, that the old Cretans having newly given the Myssians in their Countrey a kinde of a desperate overthrow, esteeming themselves there∣by at more liberty to act as they pleased, were marching in all hast against the Walles of Per∣game, with an intention as 'twas said, to obtaine
the absolute jurisdiction both of the Towne and Haven: The Governour upon this, after he had made the Princesse Cloria acquainted with the newes, assembled the chiefe Magistrates of the City, whereby not onely to take their advice, but to demand their assistance; however all the bene∣fit this congregation produced towards the end he intended, was to breake up the meeting in di∣stracted councells instead of more setled resoluti∣ons; for he found some were for the Senate of Lydia and the Myssians; others againe declared their affections to be most inclinable for the pro∣ceedings and Religion of the ancient Natives; though the third sort of people however fewest in number declared for the Princesse Cloria and himselfe: but Dedalus finding, he could not build his determinations upon these uncertainties, wherein both the safety of the Towne and his own honour, might probably suffer, by reason of the protraction; as also the person of the Princesse Cloria be endangered by his slownesse and neg∣lect, he quickly mustered up all the Souldiers of the Castle, with such others of the Kings party in the City, that were willing to obey his command, with an intention according to Roxana's perswa∣sion, onely to guard and defend the Walls and the Bullwarkes of the Towne from any suddaine surprize of the Rebells; not conceiving himselfe able to contend equally with them in the Field, by reason of their numbers and provision: no sooner was this resolution of his publickly made knowne in the generall to the people, but the most part of them, began with open mouthes to ex∣clame
against his intentions, calling him Traytor and coward, with a thousand other words of most infamous language, pretending he durst not issue out into the field to fight with the enemy, for feare of his own person, though it were thereby to secure all their lives and estates: As this mad rage in the multitude, was kindled by the Myssi∣ans faction in the City, as doubting if it were not speedily prevented, the old Cretan Natives might probably become masters of the place, and so by consequence they should be hindred of their Trade and commerce with Smyrna, and other Ha∣ven Townes belonging to the Senate of Lydia, so was Dedalus forced to issue out into the Field, and venture a Battle with the Rebels, which he per∣formed with so gallant a bravery, that within few houres time he dislodged most of their Troopes from about and neere the walls of Pergame: But three or foure dayes after, thinking to returne a∣gaine into the Towne with both honour and au∣thority, he was suddainly (contrary to his ex∣pectation) violently opposed and denyed ente∣rance at the gates of the City, the inhabitants pretending that he onely seemed to have put the enemy to flight, when he had resolved to deliver up the Towne into their hands: Dedalus in the interim being enflamed with this ungratefull pro∣ceedings of his Country men, resolved by power and force of armes, to gaine a new entrance to his old command; and to this purpose, although his Souldiers were not many, he began to make for∣mall Trenches, as if he intended a long and con∣tinued siege, whereby againe to bring the people,
to their wonted and ancient obedience, to that jurisdiction he held under the King his master, as supposing neither their strength or skill, would long be able to contend with his right and pow∣er: but alasse, they had already too craftily pre∣vented his purposes, by more preventing designes; for as soone as they fell upon these resolutions, to keep him by strong hand out of the Towne, they sent privately to those Lydian ships that lay dispersed over the Seas, with a full declaration of their intentions, which was to render themselves obedient to the Senat's commands; of which a considerable number was already come into the Haven, to take possession of the City, whereby to receive the peoples offers in that nature, with a promise also of their parts, to afford them pro∣tection both in war and peace, against all those that should oppose: This being soon made known to Dedalus, he had no other way, but to endea∣vour the best conditions he could both for him∣selfe and the Princesse, to which effect Commis∣missioners of each side were appointed to Treat; since as he could not altogether have declined this remedy, so with no probable hope, could he have expected the gaining of the Towne by force, in regard of those supplies which remained in the ships newly come into the Haven; to strengthen the inhabitants endeavours and resolutions; of the other side, being obliged to lye with all his Forces in the Fields before the Walls of Pergame, without either supplyes or provision, he was in certaine danger to be destroyed by the old Na∣tives, who not many dayes before by his valour
and conduct, he had disgracefully chased from the siege. However the Princesse Cloria, when shee came to the assured knowledge of these unfortunate passages, by which her owne liberty seemed again to be circumscribed, by a new though a more in∣feriour jurisdiction, although shee could not be but sufficiently sensible of the unhappinesse of such a subjection, yet shee resolved to meet her captivity with such a majesty, as either would bring revenge upon her person, in regard of her Fathers contentions, or procure a respectfull compassion from her enemies, that might defend her Dignity from all oppression: with these thoughts (as if shee had beene of a sudden mira∣culously cured of her distempers) shee called for her Clothes, whereby the better to put her cou∣ragious determinations in execution, when any violence to that purpose should be attempted: but Roxana upon the instant comming in to her chamber, and finding her body not in a capacity to answer to that resolution of her minde, not onely gave her counsell to lye still, and expect as yet the farther event of things during the Treaty, but also entered into more necessary discourses with her, concerning what was to be thought up∣on and done, in this unlucky conjuncture of af∣faires; although shee could not apprehend much danger would happen, either to her person or quality by this accident: To this purpose shee used this language unto her as shee lay in her bed: Madam said shee, put the worst, which is to be made prisoners to this new power, that as you
see, hath not onely driven out Dedalus from his command, but probably will now circumvent all our other designes, if they can finde the oppor∣tunity: they must either carry you into Lydia, or send you home into Cyprus; if they conducted you into Lydia, they cannot certainly be so inhu∣mane, as to debarre you from the sweet society of your most honoured and noble Father, in whose conversation you will not only be delighted; as it may be imagined with a most supreame felicity, but also you will have the commodity, to impart unto him your secret resolution, concerning the intended marriage, between my Lord Narcissus and your selfe, which perhaps is a conveniency you would be most unwilling to misse; and in some sort requisite before you absolutely finish those other ceremonies, which in effect as you know, must have beene performed either in per∣son or by Deputy, to render you fully satisfied in your thoughts; since as you may remember you made an open profession to that purpose: besides how doe you know, but that you may finde your Father in such a prosperous condition, that by the absolutely subjection of his enemies, your mo∣ther the Queen may againe be called home to her old honours and felicities in Lydia? which would be the convenietest and best Theatre, whereon to act the happy parts of your most glorious Nuptialls: of the contrary if they should send you into Cyprus, certainly you should be in the place according to your own wishes, since all this while you have endeavoured the expedition and suc∣cesse of that journey, as the last seeming period
of your desires, after all your strange and severall adventures; esteeming it as a full satisfaction from the gods, in recompence of your so many troubles and hazards: neither let it ever enter into your thoughts, that the Senate of Lydia will in any kinde, either endanger your person or restraine your liberty; for that, as such intentions would afford them no manner of benefit whatsoever, in their contentions with the King your Father (since there are already many of the royall Issue out of their power and possession) so would it not onely cause a more generall hate upon their acti∣ons throughout all Asia, but highly exasperate your Uncle Orsames against their proceedings; to the endangering certainely, of a new Warre be∣tweene Syria and Lydia, which no doubt but the Senate will endeavour to prevent, by all meanes possible they can invent. Yet however Roxana might be of these opini∣ons, or that shee onely used such discourses, the better to encourage the Princesse, neverthelesse it was not many dayes before the Senates Sea For∣ces declared their intentions; which was abso∣lutely to conduct Cloria into Lydia, restrained in her person, untill (as they said) the farther plea∣sure of the Senate, should be known concerning her particular; withall pretending they had a pe∣remptory commission to execute according to this purpose; proceeding belike from the unto∣ward endeavour of that Ambassadour at Mem∣phis, that had beene imployed by Philos, to di∣stroy the Loves between Cloria and Narcissus: As for Dedalus, all the conditions he could procure
for himselfe, was, upon their undertaking to pay him thirty Talents for the discharge of his Soul∣diers, and the defraying of his necessary expences, presently to lay downe Armes and quit the Island of Creet; though if he pleased being so agreed between them, he might visit the Kingdome of Lydia, untill such time he should more commo∣diously prepare his occasions, for his absolute transportation into forraigne parts. 'Tis true Roxana cast about many wayes in her working thoughts, how yet to alter or prevent these determinations of carrying the Princesse Cloria into Lydia a prisoner: first shee fancies to steale out of the Towne, to those Forces which Dedalus had in a body entire without the Walls; and notwithstanding the agreement to animate their spirits to stand for the Kings right and the Princesse safety: but finding they both needed necessary provisions, and were in danger in their persons hourely to be cut off by the old Cretans, that lay every where dispersed over the whole Countrey; who hated them as they knew equall with the Myssians, shee thought that would be a project of no great consequence to their benefit; then againe shee imagined, that perchance they might use some stratagem, to be conveyed pri∣vately out of the Haven, by some hired ship to that purpose; and by that meanes concealedly get into the Island of Cyprus, according to their for∣mer intentions: however when shee remembred she was told, that the officers of the Senates forces, had lately not onely taken a strict account of all the Vessels that remained in the Harbour, but had
also put in new Commanders of their owne in every ship, she supposed with no probability what, soever, could they attempt such a designe with∣out being revealed; and then they might come to be worse used in their confinement. Whereas now the Princesse was promised all honour, fa∣vour, and respect according to her Dignity in the journey. And lastly she conceited, that perchance they might find not onely reception but protection in the Armies of the ancient Natives: but when she considered the inconstancy of their dispositions, the rudenesse of their customes, with their several particular interests, she thought it a vanity, if not a madnesse to put in execution any such designe, and the rather for that the Princesse Cloria her selfe, was not yet so perfectly recovered of her health, that she could possibly expose her person to those uncertainties, both in travel, & dyet, with other inconveniences, that she would necessarily be obliged to suffer amongst those unpollisht Troopes: wherefore the old woman being in her opinion convinced in all these particulars, shee perswaded her Mistresse, with a kinde of a majesty mixt with affability and kindnesse, to entertaine both her fortunes, and those Commanders that should be designed to conduct her under the ju∣risdiction of the Senate, since as yet they could not by any meanes learne what probably might be resolved of, concerning the farther disposure of their persons, upon their arrivall in the King∣dome of Lydia. It was not many dayes when the Princesse Clo∣ria
had declared her selfe, both fit and willing, to undertake a journey, that the Admirall at Sea, who had been sent out by the direction of the Ambassadour, that remained as was formerly re∣lated at Memphis, conducted the sweet Princesse with her governesse into his own ship, where he had prepared a magnificent Cabin for her recep∣tion; but whether so adorned out of any inten∣tion thereby the better to win her beliefe, or out of the humanity of his own nature I can∣not tell: yet so it was, in that unwelcome Tri∣umph, that both the Fleet and the Seas themselves received them with a prosperous Wind, which in two dayes and a night or thereabouts, landed them in the faire and ancient Haven of Smyrna. where they reposed not much longer, before they were conveyed by many gallant Troopes of horse (by the Senates directions) to a brave Castle of the Kings, seated upon a hill not very far off the great City of Sardis, where they had not onely time enough to rest, but to exercise abundantly their own thoughts, since as they knew they were confined, so were they in a manner out of hope to know for how long. Some weekes after the said Princesse, and her affectionate Governesse, had remained impriso∣ned in the Castle, which the Senat had ordered for their confinement, spending their time for the most part in fruitlesse complaints, accompanied with more Teares, of a sudden Roxana one day as shee was sitting in a low Parlor, that opened a Balcona-window into the parke, where many tame Deere grazed, that all the winter were accu∣stomed
to be fed by the hand, for the pleasure formerly of the King, who upon his retirement from troublesome affaires, would repaire thither for the better privacy of recreation, was salluted by a young gentleman, of more then ordinary beauty and comlinesse of person, who after he had with a certaine winning behaviour made up between confidence and humility, bestowed some complements upon her, he uttered this language: Madam said he, not finding the excellent Prin∣cesse Cloria so apt and capable for my discourse at present, as I wish she were, in regard of those desparing sorrowes, that seem to cloud so many admirable perfections, that were wont to give new lustres to the world, and may againe not∣withstanding these ominous interpositions, that seem to be governed, not onely by a cruell but a most presumptuous and unmannerly fate, if shee can but be wrought to such a confidence and be∣life of my intentions, concerning her service, as is not onely convenient but most necessary for the season: for however the office I now seem to hold under the Senats jurisdiction, is cause I must confesse of suspition enough, to the most strongest perswasions, yet I call all the gods to witnesse, who best know my heart, that I harbour never a thought inwardly that doth not entirely wish a most supreame happinesse to every action, that Evarchus can thinke may againe bring him to the uttermost height, of all his ancient honours and Dignities, though the circumstances and reasons of my affections, in regard of my present conditi∣on, are so many and various at this time to be
disputed: but if this beliefe of my loyalty, shall take that place with your charity, as I humbly desire it may, I shall then discover unto you such passages, lately come to my knowledge, that will not only probably secure the Princesse from a storme com∣ming upon her, which perhaps shee would most willingly avoid, but also put her in a way of so absolute a happinesse, that I dare be hold to say, neither her hopes nor yours can yet arrive unto. Roxana however she knew not (notwithstan∣ding all his violent professions) how to be over confident of his intentions, yet in regard both of the necessity of their condition, as also having some kind of reasons given her, by the earnestnesse of his language, and the ingenuity of his counte∣nance, to be something plyable to his discourse, she thought it at leastwise the safest way, to com∣ply with his offer without any seeming jealousie, whatsoever: And to this purpose, after she had abundantly thanked him for his extraordinary curtesie, she told him, both her Ladies obligations and her owne, would be exceedingly augmented, by any information he should give of the Senats intentions, since as yet they could sinde nothing but effects of their cruelty; And much more if by his assistance, they might winde themselves out of their present troubles and future dangers. Then Lady said he, as the story I have to tell, concernes Prince Cassianus fortunes, since his de∣parture out of Lydia, wherein the Princesse Cloria is involv'd, so must I desire your leave to prose∣cute all those circumstances that belong to the relation, however perhaps they may not be alto∣gether
judged so necessary to the matter, by your discerning judgement, yet in regard the passages cannot be but something delightfull to your fan∣cy, I shall make bold to presume upon your pati∣ence, since truly they are both admirable and al∣most past all beliefe: Know then, that Cassianus at his being at the Court of Lydia, though his businesse in outward view seemed to pretend to nothing, but the pro∣curing assistance from the King, to regaine his lost Countrey of Iberia, yet secretly I must tell you, he fell in love with the Princesse Cloria, which however he durst not discover: In this posture he continued between hope and despaire, untill the arrivall of the old Queen Anaxia, as he belie∣ved drowned all his encouragements, in a vast Sea of impossibility, for that she brought with her in her journey, certaine propositions full of honour and benefit to Evarchus Court, from the King of Aegypt, concerning a marriage betweene the faire Princesse and his Son and Heire Osiris, which caused Cassianus that night, when all the world was imployed about the triumphant sports, that were designed for the entertainment of the Queen of Syria, to leave Lydia: belike being put on to those resolutions, by his melancholly ap∣prehensions, which however as you very well know so enflamed the whole Kingdome, by the spightfull practises of factious Dimogoras joyned with the crafty insinuations of others of the same interest; that it proved a maine occasion that since hath disquieted the King in his government. But Cassianus himselfe who had left Lydia in∣gendring
certaine blacke clouds of malignant va∣pours, that afterwards became furious stormes of bloud and slaughter (though I cannot say he was any way guilty in their effects; for Princes Ti∣tles and interests are oftentimes abused to sini∣ster ends and purposes) retired in person, under the jurisdiction of an ancient Forrest, not many dayes journey from the Court, where sometimes he privately lived, delighting his solitary inten∣tions, with the exercise of hunting, and other rurall delights, which those pleasant woods, and that fruitfull Countrey plentifully afforded his nature and fortune: but not long it was before Hyacinthia our Queen also, by reason of the in∣flamations of Lydia, was forced to quit her Hus∣bands Kingdome by which accident as you know she met in that place, with the company of her banished brother Candalus, outed in like manner of all his happinesse, by the powerfull authority of Philostros great favourite to Orsames. As most of these passages were within the com∣passe of your owne intelligence, which I have re∣lated onely for my stories better method, so now I shall presume to informe you of such particu∣lars, as you have not yet heard of; for Cassianus remaining as I said in the delightfull Forrest, and going under the borrowed and abbreviated name of Cassa, being disguised in the habit of a young huntsman, upon the Queenes arrivall, presented himselfe to your view though not to your know∣ledge: by which encounter, he was encouraged, againe to prosecute his old love (almost laid asleep by time and separation, to the Princesse Cloria
since the conveniency (as he thought) could not be bettered; and in that manner resolved to wait upon the Queen undiscovered into Syria: Ne∣verthelesse in that intended voyage as you know, both himselfe and Eumenes suffered shipwrack; however Cassianns (though the other perished) by the prospitiousnesse of the heavens, escaped in a manner miraculously the desperate danger of the Sea, and entered into such adventures as scarce can be paralleld: for his body being supported, upon a flat chest full of Jewells belonging to him∣selfe, by the onely flowing of the water, was car∣ried into certaine Nets belonging to poor fisher∣men, who finding a young man full of beauty, though almost dead by the violent agitation of the waves, after they had recovered some life in him, presented him to a Lords daughter of the Country called Brisania, as a subject worth her best compassion; but the Lady-whether taken with the youth and beauty of her patient, or ha∣ving an inclination to affect that she had once preserved, of a sudden fell in love with his lovely person, since she had no motives to be inticed by the knowledge of his Titles, he having concealed himselfe, the better to performe his intended journey into Syria: and this love at last from small sparcles, began to encrease to a great flame, though for a long time Cassianus was not infor∣med of the Ladies passions; for her virgin modesty ever supprest the declaration of that which shee had much adoe to hide, untill the secret fire was discovered by the sharp sight of another Suitor, that had already procured the good will of her
Father for their future marriage; notwithstan∣ding another Rivall by a more noble love con∣tended with the former for preheminence: In the interim that these intricate affections seemed to act severall parts, the old Lord by his unex∣pected death, left his faire daughter to inherite rather misfortune, then jurisdiction; For Fridius her hated Lover (being so called) presently sei∣zed both upon her Person and Country, preten∣ding that her Father in his last will, had institu∣ted him the sole governour of her Minority, least she might endanger both her honour and safety by some inconsiderable match; resolving withall to make Cassianus a Sacrifice or a Petitioner to compasse his ends: to which purpose, he caused him publickly to be accused, that he intended to have betrayed the Towne and Conutrey to a for∣raigne power; under pretence of freeing Brisania from prison, who seemed also to have consented to the practice, whereby to have procured her own releasement. And this being falsely laid to his charge he was unjustly condemned; however Fridius suspended the execution untill he had not onely againe attempted the Ladies consent to his offered Love, but procured Cassianus, who went by the borrowed name of Cassa, to be him∣selfe a Sollicitor in his suit; which opportunely gave Brisania occasion, instead of granting Fri∣dius his request, to discover her own love; but Cassianus became rather confused then pleased at this discovery, since the hazard of his own life could but purchase the acceptance; in so much as onely with a sorrowfull courtship he entertai∣ned
her discourse, however she gave him leave to depart, and carry her peremptory denyall to the proud Tyrant. Neverthelesse poore Cassa was to be made the object of his spleen, since Brisania would not be the subject of his love; for some few dayes after he was brought to a publicke scaffold erected before the Castle window, where Brisania remained, that she might be the better witnesse of the bloudy Tragedy intended; Cassa appeared in a mourning habit, becomming the sadnesse of his present condition, but much more clouded in his sorrowfull countenance, that shewed his dejected minde; though his beauty had yet so large a possession in his person by the opinion of the people, that he seemed a Sun shaded in a dark skie, that notwithstanding shot forth bright beames under the blacke coverture; And in this manner was lead to the Theater of death in the view of the people, who accompanied him all the way with their liberall lamentation, since these were the onely sacrifices they could offer in his behalfe; for although he was esteemed amongst them but a private Gentleman of Iberia, yet could they not chuse but grieve to see a Youth of his naturall perfections, untimely brought to his destruction, by the cruelty of a wicked Tyrant: But in the meane time poore Brisania summoned to the spectacle by the noyse of the spectators, at the first sight began to feele new passions in her gentle bosome, not so much of love as pitty, since the prisoner himselfe had by divers messages soli∣cited her to yield, rather then to make him the onely object of Fridius his hate: wherefore, first
she laid before her thoughts the innocency of the prisoner that was to suffer, onely because she con∣tinued wilfull. Then she began to thinke there was nothing but her own miserable captivity could redeem his life, religion, charity and affecti∣on pleaded of one side, as hatred, honour, and courage contended of the other, which made her sometimes resolve to breake through the crowde, and fling her selfe at Fridius his feet to begge his pardon: But then her spirit againe disdaining such a submission, rather chusing to cast her per∣son amongst the people, and by her own death incite their revenge, Whilst these considerations tormented her gentle soule, and that his approa∣ching execution seemed to exact from her consent a speedy resolution, at the further end of the Mar∣ket place appeared a confused feare amongst the common people, which was quickly seconded, not onely with cryes of Treason, but with the noyse of many warlike instruments, tending to the surprize of the Towne, so that the scaffold that was ordained to be the stage where Cassa was to act his last part, became soon emptied of all those unwelcome assistances, and he left onely to be his own prisoner; an accident certainly that sufficiently pleased him, although his amazed joy had scarce beliefe enough to apprehend he was freed, which made him longer continue that po∣sture the executioner had put him in, then his good fortune required at his hands, so that he moved not untill one of the Souldiers wish't him to pray for the life of Saxanius who had delive∣red him from death. By which declaration it
was quickly knowne throughout all the Market∣place, that Brisanias first Suitor had both saved Cassa from destruction, and possest himselfe of the City, who hearing of the cruell captivity of his deere Mistresse by the wicked tyranny of Fridius, had assembled all his friends to her rescue, and by a neat stratagem, had happily brought about the designe for her delivery, and her enemies pu∣nishment: Fridius sufficiently apprehensive of the guilt of his own Treason, staid not to dispute the right of his cause with his victorious rivall, but presently retired under the safe protection of the strong Castle, where he supposed was a Garrison able to contend, whilst other succors came to his assistance; besides he had Brisania in his power, by whose authority and Title he imagined the better to retaine the obedience of the People. But Saxanius intending neither to be slothfull in his love or hate; after he had given some orders for the surer obedience of the Towne, soon placed a formall siege before the Fort where his Mistresse was imprisoned, with so great a probability of prevailing that within some few dayes he recei∣ved a Message from wicked Fridius, that if he did not presently retire himselfe and his Troopes from before the Castle, he vow'd by all the gods that Brisania should act the first part in that Tragedy was intended: And for the grea∣ter assurance of his intention, he caused the Lady to be brought upon the Leades, where were already prepared the circumstances of her death. Saxanius after he had understood this peremp∣tory
demand from the proud Tyrant, and beheld with his sorrowfull eyes the threatned danger of his faire Mistresse, for whose safety he had inga∣ged not onely his owne courage, but the valours also of all his friends and kindred, became tor∣mented with many thoughts, and divers resoluti∣ons, since if he absolutely performed the com∣manding request of his hated rivall, he was no more secured (as he supposed) of Brisania's pre∣servation, then if he should yield to nothing he desired, but rather gave Fridius the more liberty to be cruell, when he had no occasion to feare; And for any promise he could make, it was to be esteemed like the rest of his false actions: where∣fore he almost determined to send away the Har∣ralde with a threatning deniall, instead of a sub∣missive consent. But then reflecting upon the ap∣prehensions of his deare love, who as he believed, would imagine that he esteemed much more a little honour then the saving of her life, it de∣stroyed his former halfe resolution, and entered him againe into new and confused considerati∣ons, which were lost in his desperate breast with diversity of passions, untill casting his sad eyes to∣wards the place where Brisania was, as a pure sacrifice to be offered according to his imaginati∣on, who seemed in his apprehension already to accuse him of unworthy love, that could so long dispute in his minde her preservation; of a sud∣den he might see one cast headlong from the top of the Castle into the ditch; which too soon per∣swaded his beliefe that the wicked Tyrant had prevented his judgement, by performing the exe∣cution
before the returne of his messenger: so that he remained like one that seemed to be chan∣ged into a marble Statute, untill a flagge of Truce appeared joyfully upon the Castle, as a testimony of future friendship: however Saxanius could not be satisfied in the Omen, untill a Messenger from the Fort assured him not onely of the Ladies safe∣ty, but also of the death of Fridius; with this re∣lation, that the Souldiers of the Fort, neither be∣ing able to endure their Princesse captivity, nor the Tyrants cruelty, had by force rescued their Mistresse, and committed a supreame Justice up∣on his person; who now was sent from Brisania to know what conditions the besiegers expected both for her liberty and the Towne they had al∣ready conquered. But Saxanius would make no Articles at all with his Love, for after he had disposed of his Troopes into severall Quarters, he went to present himselfe a slave to the faire Cap∣tive he had redeemed, where he intended to chaine his freedome for ever. However Cassianus finding that he was not onely fallen into some disdaine by reason of those desires he exprest for his own preservation, as also Saxanius likely to take possession of those favours he might have enjoyed, imagined there was no way to preserve him still in the good will of his Lady, but to dis∣cover his quality, which he supposed would both advance his esteeme, and lessen his rivals credit; and by that meanes become a publicke pretender to Brisania; which notwithstanding produced no other effects then a challenge from Saxanius, which Cassianus in honour could not refuse, after
he had given sufficient testimonies of his conditi∣on to be a Prince and no wandring stranger. Yet however the day was appointed for the combate, and every ones expectation attended the finall e∣vent of the quarrell, Brisania's nurse called Rhena promised to satisfie all parties without danger or bloud, provided her Mistresse would be directed by her Counsells, and become wife to him whom the heavens had ordained to be her husband. This strange intricacy gave curious desires to multitudes of people to be present at the wonder, since both the Champions were resolved not to be foyled in their honour, scarce in their loves; Wherefore they came into the Field armed, to supply the defect of the old womans performance, according to her bold promise: but when they were prepared to have ended the difference by a bloudy encounter. Rhena intreated them they would first repaire to the great Temple to sacri∣fice to the immortall gods, where she said, she might perhaps relate such a story, that would sa∣tisfie all their desires. This proposition from the old woman, although it carried not with it much probability of according the rivalls, their quar∣rell being grounded upon a difference that knew not how to admit of any competition, when gra∣titude it selfe seemed to have no place in Cassia∣nus disposition, though he enjoyed his life by the fortunate favour of Saxanius; yet by the impor∣tunate cryes of the people who began to be lesse curious and more pittifull, they were perswaded to follow her directions; and being before the Altar encompassed round about by the expecting
multitude, Rhena after she had called the heavens to witnesse of the truth of what she intended to utter, delivered this relation, which as she said, she had bound her self by a vow never to declare, untill some necessity not to be avoyded forced from her the discovery. When beautious Elizana said she, the vertuous mother of Prince Cassianus here present, was con∣strained with her deare Husband, to flye from the Countrey of Mesopotamia by the prevailing power of Artaxes generall, in the way being great with child, she was forced to retire to the house of my late Lord, Father to Brisania, whose wife was her neere kinswoman, and at the same time great also, where she had not remained many dayes before she was delivered of a faire daughter, as my Lady not long after of another, to the joy of the whole house: however, the gods esteeming my Mistresse too good for this life, took her out of this world before she had finished the moneth of her child∣birth, to the unspeakable sadnesse both of her husband, and all her servants, leaving no issue to inherit her singular vertues but a daughter only. Elizana also being quickly called away by her own troubles, left her little infant unto my edu∣cation, as my Lord also trusted me with his jewel: but accidents and the warres in Armenia growing every day more hot then other, for the better se∣curity and quiet, I was perswaded with the two children, to retire to my own house, where we remained for some yeares, they contented to be each others companion, as I happy to be both their Foster mother, since they increased not so
fast in dayes and nights as in beauty and good∣nesse; but alasse the Fates were envious at our fe∣licity, and tooke one of them out of the world, and with these words, the old woman wept with the remembrance of her deare losse, untill her many Teares running downe her aged cheekes gave some interruption to her discourse: but fin∣ding her griefe was scarce seasonable to the pas∣sionate multitude, she wiped her eyes, and then proceeded: When the violence of the warre said she became so qualified, that Parents had some lea∣sure to enjoy the comfort of their children, I pre∣sented my Lord with a beautifull daughter; though for the other I had in charge, I desired his favour to make my excuse, since it was not in my power to prevent the will of the gods, which gave him so much satisfaction, that he perswaded Elizana by letter to be content that had many more, which continued untill my Lady Brisania by his late death as you know became heire to all his possessions, though interrupted some time by wicked Fridius, and redeemed by valiant Saxa∣nius, to whom without a great deale of ingrati∣tude she cannot but give her selfe, and all that she hath, since she hath received it from his hands. At which words Cassianus began to muster up within his brest a multitude of passions, untill the old woman turning towards him told him, that pre∣sently she would render him satisfied also: where∣fore, after the people were a little quieted in their confused murmur, she thus ended her story: But now said she to unriddle this mystery, and fully to performe my promise, I must let know, that
Brisania wat not child to your late deceased Go∣vernour, but daughter to worthy Elizana; I onely using that fallacy upon the death of the other, because I feared the losse to my Lord would have proved a vexation intollerable, since he wanted children to inherit his fortune and ho∣nour; and for Elizana, I supposed the crosse would not appeare so great, in respect of the bountifulnesse of the issue which the gods had bestowed upon her; however I made a private vow to my selfe as I said, never to discover this mystery, untill some pressing occasion forced from me the declaration, aswell to retaine Brisania in her supposed Fathers possessions, as to take from their Parents all jealousie of my fraude. But since the heavens by the power and right of conquest, have now establish't my Lord Saxanius in that government which Brisania did intend innocent∣ly to usurpe, and that his noble pretentions to her love deserve her best entertainment, as if the Gods intended a perpetuall unity in their hearts against all obstacles, I hope it will be the opinion of all here present, that the marriage between them be solemnized instantly in the Temple; and the ra∣ther for that I cannot doubt Prince Cassianus will forbid the conjunction, since nature denies him the capacity of such a happinesse. This declarati∣on was quickly warranted by the desires of all the people with loude acclamations, so that Brisania turning about to Saxanius with a blush that more enflamed his joy, after a little pawse saluted him with this language: My Lord said she, for so it should seeme the destinies have designed you a∣gainst
all difficulties, though whether I shall be now esteemed worthy in your vertuous thoughts to give you that Title may be some question, since your noble addresses formerly received not those ready entertainements they merited: however, I shall endeavour to perswade you to believe that the heavens have had a secret influence whereby the better to unite our selves, since my preposte∣rous affection to my Brother upon small grounds endeavoured something to obscure your perfecti∣ons in my apprehension, which now appeare to my knowledge in a most full and affectionate pro∣spect, that absolutely delights all my senses. And with that, as if she had been too liberall in her language, like a Rose over-prest with the nights dew, by little and little cast downe her lovely lookes upon the ground. Saxanius instead of delivering his judgement concerning Brisania's plea, put in execution his intended decree by a gentle kisse upon her faire lips, which gave the people sufficient intelligence of his thoughts, so that the marriage became presently solemnized, to the content of all the standers by, but more specially to themselves, whose happinesse could not fully be apprehended but in the fruition one∣ly. And this Madam, I say, is the delightfull, though intricate story of Cassianus adventures, since his departure out of Lydia, which he was pleased to signifie in writing under his own hand; however to none but to his faithfull friend and chiefest counsellour Dimogoras. But now that I have entertained your eares with these strange though pleasant passages; as
I may say, seemingly rather miracles, then acci∣dents, I shall come neerer a great deale to your concernments: This intelligence of the safety of the Prince, you must know, enflamed the thoughts of Dimogoras; whereupon he began to consider if a marriage could be compassed, be∣tween Cloria the Kings daughter and Cassianus, it would undoubtedly, not onely strengthen his own greatnesse, but exceedingly fortifie all man∣ner of contentions of the Senate, with Euarchus the King, since by this means his daughter should not be matched to any forrain Prince, that might give her father assistance; but rather by degrees would be wrought to be an enemy to his preten∣tions and desires. With these considerations he went presently to the Senate, whereby to make them acquain∣ted with the intelligence he had received. To this purpose, being sat in the Councell, he utte∣red this kind of speech, with as much eloquence as his naturall roughnesse, and want of education could deliver. My Lords, said he, as it is most evident, the gods have hitherunto prospered our attempts in a most admirable manner, to the wonder of all Asia, so of the other side may we againe behold, a kind of miraculous influence depending upon those accidents, fignified unto you by Prince Cassianus Letters: These things being considered, I see no reason, nay I may boldly affirme there is a great deale of piety in the resolution, both be∣longing to the service of the gods, as also to∣wards the establishing of our own affaires, to
endeavour all waies possible, to unite the persons and affections, of Cloria the Kings daughter, and Cassianus the advent'rous Prince, in such indissol∣vable ties of love and marriage, that may not onely render them happy themselves, but secure us from all feare of a forraigne conjunction, that undoubtedly would disorder (if not destroy) that work we have already wisely begun, and hope shall fortunately end in this Kingdome. For my part, I must confesse, I doe almost trem∣ble yet, when I consider in how great a hazzard our affaires stood, before your Admirall surpri∣zed the Princess at Pergame; for that the alliance intended between her selfe and Narcissus, could not have been other than ominous; when as of the other side, we are most assured, to finde Cas∣sianus upon all occasions, not onely a furtherer of our designes, but a lover of our persons. Per∣haps you may be a little startled with the doubts, that Cloria will scarce be brought to think of such Nuptials; but truly these are meerly frivo∣lous considerations, in comparison of benefits of States, and Kingdoms; wherefore I say, If she can∣not be perswaded to yield her consent, by the influence of his Courtship, she must be com∣pelled by your power and authority. So that my opinion is, that Cassianus be presently sent for, not onely to put in execution, with all expe∣dition, what we shall determine for our own happinesse, and the Kingdomes welfare; but also to be honoured and maintained by our loves and affections, according to our former resolution and promises. Let it suffice there seemeth al∣ready
them sent by the gods for their good) yet she resolved in her thoughts to enquire after the party and his interest, by which she intended to lay the ground of those Councels she would use. To this purpose, after some few daies she became informed, that he was a young Nobleman of Ly∣ria, called Creses, imployed by the Senate in the government of the Countrey about the Castle, which made her also observe his actions, whereby she might learn, whether it were a new instru∣cted duty that taught him better obedience to the Kings service then formerly; or whether some discontent of his other Lords proceedings at Sardis, in regard of his own person, caused him revengefully to put off his trust. But as within the compasse of some weeks she was satis∣fied it was neither of these reasons that gave him an appetite to leave his command, and begin a new loyalty to his King; so of the other side she became assured in her opinion, that his secret love to the Princesse Cloria was the principall cause that made him offer so acceptable a ser∣vice, to the hazzard of his own life; and with this knowledge fell into many considerations with her Mistresse, whether it were better with security of their persons, still to remaine in the Castle, where they were under the jurisdiction of the Senate, and to expect the vexations of Cassia∣nus importunity upon his arrivall, as Creses had informed them, or hazard themselves under the protection of the new lover, whose disposition and intention they were not acquainted withall; neverthelesse, after long debate they fell upon the
latter, which was rather absolutely to trust his passion, then expect the Senates goodnesse; And to that purpose Roxana told Creses in the Princesses name, that she was resolved wholly not onely to relye upon his fidelity, but to be directed in her journey to her Father by his care; which gave Creses a wor f content, not alone that he was thought wo of so great a confidence, but by this meanes he should free his apprehension from the danger of Cassianus courtship; so that within a weekes space he provided all things necessary for their escape: whilst in the meane time Cloria pretended a sicknesse that caused her to keep her chamber, whereby no suspition of her flight, might remaine for some dayes after her depar∣ture, as Creses did of important businesse, which called him to a necessary attendance at Sardis: When the designed night came that they were to begin their journey which was expected with some impatience, the Princesse Roxana, and their intrusted dwarfe, the only attendants they would use for feare of discovery, repaired to a place at the foote of the Castle hill, where one Sentinell being more curious then the rest, would have in∣terrupted their passage, but their ready know∣ledge of the word, gave him a quicke discharge, and so consequently set them free to take their Horses, that were provided not farre off by Creses care, who was there also attending himselfe to mount the Princesse and the other company: But scarce had the cheerfull morning appeared in the East, after a tedious nights travell in rough and unbeaten wayes, when they arrived at an even
plaine, that not onely afforded them some conso∣lation to sweeten their past inconvenience, but gave opportunity to Creses, reflecting upon his owne trust, and enflamed by his secret love to use this language to the Princesse. Madam, said he, as I envy not the Gods happi∣nesse in the conversation I have  to enjoy, so the trust that is committed to , deserves a diligence beyond expression, wherein if I had a thousand lives they were all too few to be im∣ployed in such a service; yet give me leave to say without profanation of your sacred selfe, that love is the onely price that ought to purchase your person by an honourable pitty, which can∣not be wanting where there are so many other admirable perfections; for since none can merit your vertues, your goodnesse will appeare in the greatest lustre, when it shall be seene you chuse, because you intend absolutely to oblige, like the heavens that take most pleasure in forgiving high∣est offences. It may perhaps be esteemed by igno∣rant apprehensions, a kinde of an equality in worth, when Titles are united; but you know that darke foyles are used to illustrate bright Diamonds, wherefore let not honours be the ob∣ject of your lookes; which however, although they cannot outshine yours, yet cettainly the clearnesse of your beauty will best appeare when others are removed, like the faire Moone when the Sunne is most obscured that offends by his too much violence; Flowers seeme more delighfull in innocent fields, then in stately Gardens; and christall streames are plentifuller replenished with
variety of watry inhabitants, whn the green meadowes give them boundes, rather then where Marble structures enrich their aboade; then kis∣sing her hand with a passionate earnestnesse, he bathed her white glove with a few of his owne Teares, that quickly gave Cloria Items of his in∣tentions; but she would take no notice of his dis∣course being unwilling to disquiet her protecti∣on, since she could not condiscend to his desire, so that she was constrain'd prettily to divert the occasion by calling her Governesse to the com∣munication, pretending that else her rigid gravi∣ty might chide them both for their dis-respect; when Roxana was arrived at a neerer distance, the Princesse perceiving her to be much troubled, if not altogether tired with the past nights travell, by her often removing her selfe upon her Saddle, not being accustomed to many such exercises, af∣ter she had bid her be of good cheere, began to question with her concerning the practice and imployment of her youth; and whether or no women in those dayes did use to ride a hunting according to the fashions now of Lydia? faith no Madam said Roxana, in those times maides were more modestly bred then to exercise such hoyting recreations; for if their mothers suffered them to walke a turne or two in the garden, after they had performed a good dayes worke upon their Sam∣plers, and of holy dayes to goe eate a messe of Creame in some honest neighbours house, it was esteemed a large liberty; besides there was a care∣full provision by their parents, that no men of any sort should accompany them; although they were
such as pretended to be Suitors, and the conditi∣ons of marriage already agreed upon; but now by my truly there is nothing but private court∣ship, and publicke love with continuall diver∣tizements, from one pleasure to another; so that young girles endeavour nothing more, then to become bold and scandalous: nay I can assure you Princesse said she, a Maide durst not so much as smile before her Father and Mother, scarce looking upon their woers before they were mar∣ried; in which bashfull posture on the night of their Nuptials, they entertained their husbands with teares onely. This discourse or rather passion of the old wo∣man, proceeding as 'twas supposed from the hard going of her horse, gave Cloria occasion to tell her in a gentle smile, that the reason why they did not practice such pastimes, was because they wanted good horses for the sport, and Coaches at she had heard were not then in use: good hor∣ses said Roxana, I cannot tell what you call good, but for my part I was never worse carried then at the present; at which the Princesse began to laugh out-right, since she had so directly hit upon the disease of her Governesse. However Creses that he might prevent all quarrells told her, that since she found hers not easie, she should ride on his, which perhaps would better please her, al∣though he protested he had no designe but to ac∣commodate her before himselfe; whereupon ta∣king her downe from her saddle, in a quarter of an houres time made the exchange, though the labour seemed fruitlesse; for the old woman be∣ing
no whit amended in the choyce, shewed the defect proceeded from her age, and not from her Steede: Neverthelesse, most couragiously (though she did sweat for the businesse) she arrived at the Forrest, where they intended to repose themselves for the noone season, that required some shade against the Suns violence; Creses chose a flouri∣shing Tree for the Princesse accommodation, which contented her thoughts as well as the ri∣chest Canopy of State in her fathers Court, and the provision that the dwarfe had brought with him abundantly satisfied instead of other curiosi∣ties: these satisfactions exacted from Cloria ano∣ther necessary duty, that the night past had abso∣lutely debaured her of, which was shewed by the gentle closing of her faire eyes from the dayes light; whilst in the meane time Roxana had con∣veniency, after she had put something under her Ladies head, to retire her selfe under another tree to be indulgent also to her owne senses. But Creses whose love and care caused him to be a diligent Sentinell over the Princesses rest, afforded him also the happinesse of this contem∣plation, in which faine he would have stollen a kisse, but that he feared the heavens would have revealed the theft: can the gods (thought he) be altogether stupid to suffer so divine a creature upon earth, and leave their own habitation bar∣ren of such excellence, since more then a thousand Cupids are ready to offer sacrifices upon the pure Altar of her faire forehead, perfumed by the in∣cense of her odoriferous breath? can these two illustrious cherries said he, that onely kisse one
another, because they cannot meet with the like perfections, be lesse powerfull then to invite Iove from Olympus to taste of the dainties; but behol∣ding a presumptuous flye boldly to entertain it selfe in the delicious garden of her face, where mixt Roses and Lillies gave it both nourishment and delight, notwithstanding the many gentle prohibitions of her white hand, he began passio∣nately to exclame against the rudenesse of the creature; yet when he saw its black colour and curious shape served instead of a foyle to become her beauty, as if put there rather by art then na∣ture, he not onely let the silly beast alone, but commended his industry; however finding her sleeping importunity, desired something earnestly to berid of that troublesome ornament, he could doe no lesse then contribute his assistance, and ha∣stily endeavoured to chace the flye from that pa∣radise, where it wanted neither flowers nor exer∣cise; at which the Princesse suddenly wakened with a demand what had disturbed her in her rest: But poore Creses durst not owne the dis∣quiet, and so she fell asleep againe, in which in∣nocent calme she remained untill Roxana's confi∣dent authority made her know, it was time to prepare for the afternoons journey; and this in∣junction was sufficient to render her obedient a∣gainst the inticements of her wearied senses. Many dayes they had not travelled in this large Forrest, to seeke out obscure wayes to prevent surprize, since they supposed they should hastily be pursued if not encountered by some of the Se∣nates Forces, lying in a manner every night, ei∣ther
in a poor Cottage, or in the open aire, which the couragious Princesse underwent with an ad∣mirable fortitude, hoping her reward at last should be not onely to see her deare Father, but to heare some newes of her love Narcissus, for whose sake her thoughts were chiefly tormented; before they arrived at a small playn encompassed with wood, which the more flourished, because Phaebus had not so absolute a dominion in that place as elsewhere. At the farther end of the Plaine upon the rising of a little hill, that directed its view towards the East, they might behold a house; though not of any appearing capacity, to containe many persons: but long they had not contemplated the commodity of their supposed nights lodging, ere they spyed an. old Father with his booke in his hand, sitting under a Tree, which gave occasion to Creses, whilst the Prin∣cesse and Roxana were content to take some plea∣sure in that solitude, to present himselfe to the aged man, aswell to be informed who he was, as also to receive some benefit by his assistance. Wherefore after they had civilly saluted one another, and that Creses had told him he con∣ducted certaine distressed Ladies towards Phila∣delphia, where their friends remained in the Kings warres, and also that they wanted for the present accommodation of lodging for the ap∣proaching night, the old man seemed not onely willing to pleasure him in any thing, but of the sudden burst forth into abundance of Teares and complaints, as it should seem at the remembrance of Euarchus and his fortunes, which made Creses
the more passionate to be informed of his conditi∣on, and to that purpose desired him that he would be pleased to let him know what accident had driven him into that solitary course of life; so both seating themselves upon a little rising hil∣lock, because the old Father was not capable of a long discourse without some repose, he uttered this language: Sir said he, since you will needs be acquainted with my fortunes, you must know in my youth I was bred by the carefull industry of my parents a scholler, which profession brought me first in cre∣dit with my Prince Euarchus Father, who was himselfe not onely learned, but exceedingly lo∣ved the conversation of those that were possessed with such qualities, which at the first joyned with the ambition of my owne nature, made me a Courtier, and that vocation as I thought, ex∣acted from me a diligence to preferment, howe∣ver, honours were but moderately conferred upon me, during the life of the old King; though after his death his sonne Euarchus, whether mistaking my ability or being in love with my fidelity, showred downe so many favours upon me, that I not onely in a short time, became chiefe Flamin of all Lydia, but in a manner governed the whole State under the King, which heaped on me suffi∣cient envy; and the rather since I conferred many offices possessed formerly by the Nobility upon those of my owne profession, whereby the better to strengthen my party, and dignifie my conditi∣on: In this posture I remained untill the great Senate that now rules in Lydia chaced me from
Court and Common-weale, which made me seek out this private habitation, untill the fa of Eu∣archus government shall be so determined that I may againe returne to his service, or resolve to end my life in this solitude; and with that wept, which for some time continued them both in a pensive silence, untill Creses importuned the aged father to put off his sorrow; or at leastwise suffer him to be a sharer with him in his griefe, by let∣ting him know more particularly the causes: this gave occasion to the old man to tell him that ma∣ny Souldiers were newly arrived in the Forrest to shelter themselves by the protection of the woods, from the rage of their persecutors, who followed them after a Battell that was lately fought be∣tween Thyasmus and the Senates Forces, where both he and almost his whole Army being surpri∣zed by an Ambuscado of the enemy, had lost the day to the absolute destruction of the Kings af∣fairs, and an utter undoing as 'twas believed of all his friends, since Euarchus expects every houre in person to be besieged in Philadelphia. This unexpected newes did more then trouble Creses, not onely because it did in a manner de∣stroy his owne hopes that seemed to depend upon the successe of the journey he had in hand, which was to present the Princesse Cloria an acceptable offering to her Father, but in denying them all meanes to avoid a dangerous consequence, fince they neither could advance towards their first in∣tention, for doubt of interruption in the passage by scattering Troopes of the Senates garrisons, nor durst retire back againe to the Castle for feare
of being cruelly punished for the escape: so that he was orced to make the old father acquainted with the personall presence of the Princesse Cloria, and the rather since he could no way intrust his fidelity, but of the contrary by that knowledge procure a reception of her in his house untill his owne returne from Philadelphia, whither he in∣tended secretly to go, that he might the better be informed of the Kings condition, and by that di∣rection more conveniently secure the Princesse Cloria either by flight into some forraigne Coun∣try, or deliver her person into the protection of her owne Father as he had promised: yet he con∣jured the Flamine, after he had layed open unto him his thoughts, intentions, and desires, not to discover the least syllable of these disasterous acci∣dents to the Princesse, for feare of disquieting her gentle bosome with misfortunes, no care of hers could remedy; though he determined to per∣swade her to be contented to dispence with his owne absence for some time, to performe preten∣ded necessary service for her safety. When they had sufficiently digested these resolutions and a∣greements, they both rose from their seats to pre∣sent themselves to Cloria; the Princesse at their approach entertained the Flamine, with the same affection she conceived to be due to one, that had beene formerly honoured by her Fathers favours; whilst he with Teares in his eyes, presently con∣ducted her and the rest of the company to his small habitation; excusing notwithstanding in a courtly phrase, the poorenesse of the welcome she was to expect: but long she had not enjoyed
the pleasing security of that retirement, before she was overtaken with a most horrid and insolent treason in this sort. The Souldiers that cowardly were fled from the battell, as the Flamine had related to Creses, and were retired within the Fortifications of those woods, for their better security against their pursuers, understanding by some intelligence that the Princesse Cloria was lodged privately within the old Fathers house, began to consider, that if they returned her back again to the Senate at Sardis, from whence they understood she was escaped, it would prove so acceptable, that they should not onely thereby purchase all their par∣dons, but probably many of the chiefe actors might receive considerable rewards. This opi∣nion they no sooner entertained in their wicked and disloyall breasts, but the execution followed with so much violence, that they not onely seized Cloria and Roxana, but also carried with them the old Flamine, as a full period to their supream villany, notwithstanding all the perswasions could be used towards them; but the gods ha∣ting the traytors, though the Senate made use of the treason, all they could procure for this ac∣ceptable service, was to have their lives saved, upon condition, they should within ten daies de∣part the Kingdome; or else, to suffer present death wheresoever the could be found after the limited time, which used them to curse the very day of their births. However this just sentence was a deserving re∣ward for their offences, yet poore Cloria enjoyed
no comfort in her captivity, but rather her crosses were augmented by the arrivall of Cassianus: one day when she was retired into the inner∣most part of her lodgings, with an intention to contribute a large proportion to her sorrows, esteeming it the best conversation she could pos∣sesse in these sad times, she was of a sudden salu∣ted by the Prince, who conceived his power gave him a sufficient warrant for any intrusion; where, after he had continued his courtship with a few complements, he strived to protest his affection, with all the reasons that the same religion, neer∣nesse of kindred, and his vow'd service to her father could pretend unto; which pluckt from the Princesse this sharp and sudden reply, contrary to her nature. Cozen, said she, although your own thoughts can best witnesse the Religion you hold, yet give me leave to tell you, that my knowledge receives no satisfaction by your profession, since you vio∣lently seem to runne along with that current, that seeks by all means possible to destroy the Lydian rights, in taking away the Flamins out of the Temples, the onely pretended occasion now of these warrs between my father and his Senate, in which customes I have been brought up from my cradle. Again, for your blood, I must con∣fesse it is of so neere kindred with mine, that I wonder you doe not bl to see me suffer an in∣jurious captivity, without revenge or assistance; much more, to be a principall cause of my impri∣sonment, since your preposterous affections adds flames to the Senates cruelty; when as my love
in all justice should rather be perswaded then compelled. And lastly, concerning the service you professe to my father, as I would be glad to see some effects thereof by reall actions, instead of ayerie, and perhaps of false professions; so of the other side, I must desire you to remember, that Prince Cassianus was alwaies entertained, & cherished by King Euarchus, with all humanity and bounty, when his regall power was not di∣minished: Wherefore in my opinion, you have no reason to side with that faction, that strives to pluck the Diadem from the browes of him and his posterity; in which number I have, or ought to have a confiderable interest. Cassianus, after he had received this bitter re∣ply, with a certain pale, if not guilty look, rested for some time, as it were frozen in a kind of de∣spaire, not being able to utter one syllable in de∣fence of himselfe, against such desperate lan∣guage, as he thought delivered by a heavenly Oracle: yet at last, lest he might seem altogether conquered by the force of her reasons, when it was impossible her sweet words could wound, but with the darts of Cupid, he fearfully returned this answer, which reached her eares, but not her beliefe. Madam, said he, for the differences in Religion between your father and his Senate, I esteem them no way essentiall; consisting onely in matter of ceremony, which with a little labour may easily be reconciled to both their advantages. And for that bloud of yours, that so much honoured my birth, I could wish to have an occasion to let it
out from nourishing my heart, whereby to doe you the least service; though your release cannot fall within the capacity of my power, since it is the command of the whole Kingdome that re∣straines your liberty; neverthelesse without any thought of injury intended to your person: for, if I believed the Senate had any determination to diminish, much lesse to deprive your Royall fa∣ther of those flowers which belong justly to his glorious Crown, I should be so farre from coun∣tenancing of their endeavours, that I would con∣tend with all difficulties to teare the remem∣brance of their intentions from the face of the earth; however, I cannot deny, but I meerly sub∣sist by their extraordinary bounty, since I have lost the possession of mine own Countrey, that should maintain my condition. At which words the Princesse with a disdainfull smile gave him a dissembled thankes, accompanied by so sweet and becomming a scorn, that Cassianus seemed more bitter at her silence then by the dispute; though Roxana could not chuse but take her Mi∣stresses part, and consequently made this cholo∣ricke answer to that little he had said in his owne defence. My Lord said she, I cannot but wonder if the points in Religion be of no greater difference then you speak of, that the Senate should disturbe the quiet State of Lydia with so much bloud and slaughter, to compell Euarchus to change the go∣vernment, when it is evident he desires but to maintaine the profession of his Father without alteration; nay rather me thinks it would have
beene greater markes of their piety, to have given way to the Kings humour in so small a thing of consequence, then to have bought the alteration at so deare and dangerous a price. And for the latter part of your discourse, I shall onely put you in minde, that as your Uncles love and bounty never failed you, when he was in a flourishing prosperity, so you may doe nobly to pay his acti∣ons past, and his necessities present, with testimo∣nies of gratitude and duty. Cassianus although he vowed to the uttermost of his power, he did and would render him his best endeavours, yet he quickly changed the subject of the discourse, pretending that love at the present, was more su∣table to his disposition then hate, and therefore began againe to court the Princesse with fresh complements: however when he found with a neglectfull silence she onely seemed to heare his words, without a will to understand the matter, as if she were lesse pleased with those smiles then with the Senates frownes, he abruptly quitted the roome with a kinde of a darke clowde in his lookes: within two dayes after this encounter the old Flamine, was brought before the great Senate to receive his tryall, not onely for having been in his court imployments a disturber of the State as 'twas pretended by his ill councell to Eu∣archus, but at the present for being an instru∣ment to convey the Princesse out of the Senates protection, and conceale her person in his house, whereby to marry her to some forraigne power that might indanger the prosperity of Lydia. Which accusations were so spightfully alleadged
against him, with such prejudicate resolutions for his ruine, that the old man had not force e∣nough, to sustaine the waight of the prosecution, though he exprest a competent courage in his de∣fence, and so was condemned publikely to lose his head upon a Scaffold in the view of all the people, who at leastwise appeared contented if not pleased at the novelty. But Cloria when she heard of this sudden, and as she conceived horrid determination, was pos∣sessed with a noble compassion, not onely consi∣dering the old man to have been a most faithfull servant to her Father, but unfortunate by this in∣tended Tragedy, onely for entertaining her at his house, as a testimony of his loyalty to the royall Family, which wrought in her gentle soule divers perturbations: First she considered, that if he suffered, it would be some staine to her honour, since he appeared rather to be a Martyr for her, then for himselfe; which obligation she was un∣willing to undergoe without some testimonies of a supreame gratitude; yet then when she reflected upon that submission she must use to beg his life of the Senate, she thought the sacrifice of an old Flamine, who e're long could not chuse but be an offering to the earth, would not prejudice his owne happinesse, much lesse taxe her of ill nature; And therefore became halfe perswaded to let him runne his last period with glory, rather then be∣come a supplyant to her Fathers Subjects for mer∣cy: yet after much contestation with her selfe, the vertuous Princesse fell upon this apprehensi∣on, that she in a manner became the author
of ill, by omitting that good she had power to doe, and by that meanes should deserve the worlds censure: so that pitty, gratitude, and re∣ligion, seemed to contend with courage, honour, and disdaine, till at last she flew to this resoluti∣on, to send for Cassianus, and conjure him by the hopes of his desired love, to be so farre an inter∣cessor in the poore Flamins behalfe, as to preserve him from destraction by his power or interest; though againe when she entered into considerati∣on what a jealous scruple the request might raise in Narcissus thoughts, if ever he should come to know of the action, it almost destroyed the piousnesse of her intention: neverthelesse she cal∣led Roxana, and wisht her in her name to fetch Cassianus to speake with her, since her resoluti∣ons were not long to be protracted, if she had a will they should prove effectuall; yet as the old woman was going out of the doore to performe her message, she suddenly commanded her backe againe, labouring as it were in her inconstant constancy, untill Roxana her self being displeased with her fruitlesse irresolutions, at length went without her leave. When Cassianus came, he found the Princesse seated not onely in a darke chamber, but inviro∣ned with those mourning Curtaines about her bed, which she had caused to be hung up since her last imprisonment, as testimonies of the discon∣tented State she conceived her selfe in: when Roxana had informed her of the Princes pre∣sence to attend her pleasure, after she had with a low voyce desired him to sit downe in a chaire
neere her, she used this discourse unto him. Cousin said she, is it possible you can thinke, that the bload of the poore and aged Flamine may be so acceptable an offering to the gods, as to make them thereby more propitious to your desires? or doe you believe, that my love which you seeme to hope for, will be perswaded easily by the cruelty of so horrid a sacrifice? if you meane to threaten instead of intreaing, perhaps you may please your owne nature, but never I can assure you, compell my liking, since I finde in my soule so much courage yet left, notwithstanding all my misfortunes, as not to give away my affections to one that hath merited so much just hate from me. Certainely you are mistaken to thinke Cypres branches are fit orna∣ments to become a marriage bed, for the many examples in that kinde have beene alwayes prodi∣gious; can you flatter so farre your owne imagi∣nation, as to apprehend the slaughter of my friends, and slaughtered chiefly for my service, can create lesse effects in me, then a revenge when I shall have power to execute it according to my will, upon those that have occasioned my displea∣sure? It should be strange they should expect to be entertained in my bosome, that have spight∣fully procured my disgracefull discontent. No Cousin, assure your selfe, these are not the wayes to captivate a Virgins gentle heart, or to trust protestations of such a Suitor, that wanted not hate in the highest professions of his love. Cassianus after he had heard these words from the Princesse, hastily without any reply at all
tooke his leave; which not onely gave occasion of many conjectures both to Cloria and Roxana, but also of some discourses that produced hopes and feares, untill within three houres of his de∣parture, he againe returned into the Princesse Chamber, with a reprieve for the old mans life, signed by the hands of the Senate; though with this condition, that she must be pleased to follow the direction of the whole Kingdome in her mar∣riage, however Cassianus vowed by the heavens, he imployed all his power to have procured it absolute. Cloria notwithstanding she was not well satis∣fied with the restriction, yet she was pleased with the pardon, and presently sent it by Roxana to the officers that had the custody of the old Flamine, whilst in the meane time she conceived some dis∣sembled satisfaction was necessary, that he might continue still his begun courtesies to the aged fa∣ther; withall to possesse him with the knowledge of the impossibilities that hindred the progresse of his love, whereby he might be lesse violent in pressing the Senate to the accomplishment of his desires; and the rather she fell upon this resolu∣tion, for that Narcissus absence secured him from all danger by underhand practises, though her selfe could not be confident of his safety, since she had heard nothing from him; which considera∣tion at the present drew from her faire eyes some teares before she used these wordes to Casstanus: Worthy Cousin said she, (for so I will now call you, since I finde your words reall, and your love noble) if the Gods did give me the possibi∣lity
of being your wife, I should a great deale ra∣ther, declare my selfe perswaded to the choyce by your owne vertues, then by the Senates wisedome, since the interest of a kingdome is not to be put in the ballance with the unity of affection; the one proceeding onely from forced reasons, that last no longer then the motives have power by the operation of private ends, when the other arising from the secret influence of the heavens, engraves a perpetuall affection in the heart, not to be re∣moved by humane Tyranny. Wherefore I say, interests of Crownes cannot contribute any thing to the felicity of Nuptialls, however sometimes they pretend false shewes to cover hidden discon∣tents, and so by that meanes conzens the world into a beliefe of what the married couple never enjoy, of the contrary enduring millions of con∣cealed torments, that are increased in violence when they burst forth like imprisoned flames, which by accidents procure their owne liberty: Therefore I say, nay I will boldly professe the un∣dergoing the punishment of a thousand deaths, before I be ever compelled to marry by the pre∣scription of earthly respects, much lesse be com∣manded to take any for my husband, that hath not really perswaded my judgement, or absolutely wrought upon my fancy; let it suffice your per∣fections carry with them more powerfullnesse in my consideration, then the Senates desires doe waight in my understanding, though I should be sorry to chuse rashly, or to be guided wholly by mine owne opinions; which is enough to let you see my unconquered, and I
hope pure love cannot be constrained, although my deare life pay the ransome of my seeming wilfulnesse: for though Tyranny may shut up my weake body within strong Walles, untill the just gods punish the wickednesse, yet my resolved soul will be free to make election of death, or life, as the occasion shall be presented; so that as your actions have changed already my beliefe of your intentions; doe not againe change your actions, that I become of an other minde, wherein you will but lose honour instead of gaining love; and that losse perhaps may make you uncapable of all other fortunes; it is enough, I valew your bloud, I esteem your person, and love your ver∣tues; however I cannot be yours in possession as long as Narcissus lives; and with those words wept againe, as at her former apprehensions of his safety, which continued her in a silence, untill Cassianus reply gave her thoughts new matter to work upon: Madam said he, as I cannot but be perswaded, though unwillingly by your powerfull and excel∣lent Rhetoricke, yet give me leave to tell you, that I understand not your conclusion, since you have beene pleased to say in your discourse, that as long as Narcissus lives you cannot be mine; a choyce I must confesse, that the gods have never to this houre revealed unto me, since at my lea∣ving of Lydia, a match of a farre greater dignity in Titles, seemed to be the obstacle that destroyed my hopes, and so consequently all motions I could make of my secret love: but however, if my ears have not much deceived my knowledge, I have
heard it generally reported, that some accident many moneths since hath deprived Narcissus not onely of the share you pretend he hath in your af∣fection, but also of all the claime he can expect in this world. If it have said Cloria, your pretenti∣ons are the neerer; and with that fell a weeping again so bitterly that Cassianus could not chuse but accompany her in her griefe; but after some time that his thoughts had liberty to enter into consideration both of the Princesses words and of his owne concernment, scarce yet believing her relation, he told her, that he had no reason to claime the interest of another; yet if Narcissus were dead, he hoped his love and service should expect the next place in her affection: and with that parted from her, with an intention to make a more particular enquiry, into the truth of the intelligence, which afforded the Princesse a kinde of a calme for the present, that contented her thoughts. And this calm having made her discontents some∣thing tolerable, she was perswaded one afternoon by her Governess, to take some little delight or re∣creation, in a green Meadow within the limits of her imprisonment, that usually was not frequented by strangers, where a River in the midst divided the field by a seeming equall arbitration; which afforded a kind of a sad entertainment to the Princesse, whilst Roxana was perswaded also by her many solicitous thoughts, to search out soli∣tary walkes in the neighbouring woods, for the exercise of her contemplation: To this purpose Cloria sitting down by the Brook side, supporting
in the interim her faire cheeks by her white hand, whilst her knee underpropped both, as a rich foundation that nature had created, for the esta∣blishment of a most noble building, her fancy was carried as it were with a stedfast melancholly to behold the running streame, that represented to her troubled imagination, her own inconstant fate, that had formerly afforded her some mo∣ments of happinesse, in the conversation of her deare Narcissus, whom now she was not sure ever to enjoy againe, which by a quick course seemed to hasten to the Sea to be drowned in that vast confusion, as her past delight was buried in her Fathers misfortunes and her own. And as she was sending also her teares along with the course of the River into the man Ocean, to be confoun∣ded in the multitude of those rude waters, of a sudden she saw a Pilgrim to travers the Meadow, as if his ignorance in those parts had rendred him altogether unskilfull in the wayes: But the Prin∣cesse being yet fuller of charity then sorrow, dis∣penced for the present with her griefe, to give him some instruction; and to that purpose cal∣ling him to her, began to question with him about his name and businesse: The Pilgrim in a kind of amazed reply told her, that as his name scarce deserved any remembrance amongst those that enjoyed happy conditions, by reason of his many misfortunes, so for his businesse, he should be loath to impart it to any, before it did reach the eares of the Princesse Cloria to whom it was di∣rected, whose aboad as he was informed was not farre off that place. Truly answered the Princesse
if you meane that happy condition by my selfe, you are as much mistaken in your opinion as you were in your way; however perhaps I may prove so fortunate to your intention, as to helpe you to the speech of that Lady you mention, although I must tell you, this passage is not open to all tra∣vellers, being onely kept for the Princesse private recreation, and such company as are confined with her in the Castle: At which words the poor Pilgrim fell upon his knees to aske pardon for his fault, though he protested he was altogether ig∣norant that any prohibition, had forwarned pas∣sage into those private walkes reserved for the Princesse pleasure; however his journey into Ly∣dia was chiefly intended to her presence. The Princesse quickly commanded him to rise, assu∣ring him, that as the limitation of those fields did not belong wholly to her jurisdiction, she being her selfe a prisoner also under authority, so if she were an absolute commandresse (as he did imagine) she was so well acquainted with the re∣verence due to his sacred habit, that his free abso∣lution would soone have been procured at her hands. At which words the Pilgrim began to weep, and notwithstanding her earnest intreaty, would by no meanes rise from the ground where he kneeled, which made Cloria wonder, though not more at the businesse then at his passionate carriage. Wherefore, after some few circum∣stances, finding no importunity of hers was able to remove him from his setled humility, she told him she was the Lady to whom the intention of his travels was directed. When the Pilgrim had
received this information, he beseeched her a new to pardon his rude errour, since as he said, being lately come out of Syria, he could not be enformed of the dignity of her person, not ha∣ving any attendants about her to instruct his knowledge; and then wept againe as if his busi∣nesse had been nothing else, but meer expressions of sorrow; untill at last having wiped his eyes with a Handkerchiefe hanging at his girdle, he entertained the Princesse with this language: Most vertuous Princesse said he, be pleased to know, that it was my fortune to be in the City of Tyre, when young Narcissus was brought into the Towne mortally wounded by a ship of the same Towne, where by the courtesie of the Cap∣taine he was soon provided of convenient lod∣gings for his repose, and an assembly desired of the best Physicians of the place for his cure, al∣though his name and condition was concealed from all but those that had conveyed him thi∣ther: thus hee remained with some hopes but more doubts for many weekes of his recovery, untill at last a dangerous Feavour made every one in the house despaire of his safety: amongst which number it was my chance to be preparing my selfe for a voyage to Delphos, according to a serious vow I had made to the Gods for the ex∣piation of certaine offences. But he understan∣ding of my intention, and conceiving my best way would be to passe by the Kingdome of Ly∣dia in the journey, one day when the violence of his sicknesse gave him some more ease, then accu∣stomed, & that the chamber by hazard was freed
from all company but my self, by reason of a cer∣tain holy day neere the Towne, he desired me to approach his bed-side, where after I was seated, and that by many sighes, he had made me ac∣quainted with your unfortunate loves and his own condition, he conjured me by all the chari∣ty that ought to accompany my thoughts in so sacred a journey, that in my passage I would visit you in Lydia, where he understood you were newly arrived: and not onely declare unto you all the circumstances of his untimely death, with the assurance of his most constant love to his last end; but withall obliged me to deliver this Ring which he said was the deare testimony of the contract that had been between you; and present∣ly putting his hand in his bosome drew out a pa∣per wherein was contained that unwelcome token. When Cloria beheld the pledge of their unfor∣tunate loves now ended in the worst of periods, she looked upon it as if she expected a miraculous remedy, or a miserable distraction; till at last conquered by the very depth of her desperate imagination, she became exceeding pale, and scarce was so for any time before a more earthly colour, by little and little seemed to change that yet lovely white, which death it selfe a great while had no power to overcome. But alasse the procession was too wilfull, for not long after her dainty, though weake legs not being able to sup∣port the waight of her faire body, since her pure soule could contribute no assistance, she sunke downe to the ground, like a rich marble statue built upon snowy bases: which caused the poor
Pilgrim with a haste, composed of an amazed sorrow, and a desperate feare, to flye to her re∣liefe, cursing not onely his relation, but his very journey that occasioned it: his violent execrati∣ons had not power to breath the least shew of life into her sweet body, as if the gods were resolved to keep possession of so heavenly a spirit (not∣withstanding he continued the rubbing of her Temples with more then ordinary passion) untill he spake in her eares, that Narcissus was not dead, but falsly so alleadged by his malicious & wicked tongue; and for a testimony of his last affirmati∣ons (which he wisht might be confirmed by his perpetuall torment, as a punishment for his of∣fence) he sudden pulled off that deceitfull beard, that had so unluckily disguised his person from her knowledge. Cloria after she had for some time continued in her sad sleep, that faine would gently have sent her without noyse to a better ha∣bitation, she softly againe opened her eyes, that seemed something ecclipsed of their former brightnesse, and fixing them upon that object that onely had power to keep them from entertai∣ning an eternall darknesse, she used these low words: And is it possible that Narcissus still lives? or is it my flattering fancy that ever couzens me into new miseries? then shut them againe, as if either yet she was not absolutely perswaded of his truth, or had a mind to reprove him for his un∣kinde concealing of himselfe; But Roxana's arri∣vall, both afforded Cloria more remedy, and pro∣ved a meanes to beg Narcissus pardon, who was not able by any Rhetorick to excuse the sin, he
had committed against the Lawes of love, in bor∣rowing a disguised shape, to hide that which Cloria had onely a desire to see: however lovers quarrels although they are violent, yet never or very seldome are lasting; beside the sweet Prin∣cesse had no room left in her bosome for revenge, where there was already inspired so much joy; so that in a short time a perfect truce was not on∣ly made between them, though chiefly exprest in contemplation, wherein their hearts spake more then their lips: but after they seemed sufficient∣ly to have surfeited of their joy, Narcissus was perswaded to make a perfect relation of his own adventures: Wherefore, taking her faire hand, and gently kissing it twice or thrice, as a sworne testimony of the truth of his story, he began in this manner, whilst in the meane time the poore Princesse read a lecture in his looks, that appea∣red amply to instruct her thoughts. Most sweet Princesse said he, as I know not what accident, or rather I may call it a fate, se∣parated our ships one from another comming from Egypt, so no sooner were we out of sight of your vessell, but the winds, as if they intended a∣gaine to remember us of a meeting, though they seemed to deny the opportunity, began most furi∣ously to rage upon the waters; in so much as be∣ing tost from one billow to another, with a kinde of a rude uncertainty, we became at last in a man∣ner desperate of our own safeties: but then O you gods, how were my thoughts transported in your behalfe, knowing you to be in the same conditi∣on of danger and hazard? how many lives would
I have willingly sacrificed of my own, with what torments soever, but to have rendred you secure in my own thoughts, in some Haven or Harbour of quietnesse, free from the inconstant cruelty of the winds; and raging tempest that appeared re∣bellious to all our wishes? what infinite dam∣mages did I conceive the whole world would sustaine by your losse, since with you went away all vertue, honour, and beauty from the face of the earth? sometimes I would call the Marriners from their necessary imployments, to aske their opinions concerning your danger and condition, whilst they barbarous and ignorant wretches, ra∣ther minded their own present affaires, then gave me any satisfactory reply, as if they understood not the consequence of my demand, but rather a∣mazedly preferred their own safety, before those thoughts appertaining to your particular: which caused me equally to bestow both curses and prayers in your behalfe: The Princesse finding Narcissus in some sort transported with these imaginations, whereby probably she should be delayed from hearing the story of his adventures, with a pretty kinde of jeering smile, wisht him to leave off now any more care for her particular, since as she said he found her safe, and rather fol∣low that relation she expected from him, as a more necessary duty for the present; This made him quickly fall to his taske with fewer circum∣stances then formerly in this manner: A night and a day said he, having kept us upon the Seas in this storme, at last the skye cleared it selfe from its cloudy incumberance, which
made us perceive, that we were neare the Island of of Rhodes: wherefore finding our ship was much beaten with the Tempest, and most of our com∣pany unable to undergoe a farther journey with∣out some refreshment, I gave my consent to have the vessell put into the Haven, the rather because I hoped to heare some news of your safety in that City. The chiefe commander of that Island for the present is a great noble man of Lydia, who however he keeps a certaine correspondency with the Senate for his own more convenient security, yet in his heart he is an entire servant to the King your Father, which not onely made me think my welcome so much the better in his Country; but his wife being my most neare kinswoman, I was perswaded to make my aboad for some few dayes in that place, whilst in the interim we sent out many small vessels, to enquire after your conditi∣on: but however I could have been very well content, to have remained there longer, in regard of the vertuous and noble entertainment both of the Lord and Lady, yet upon the messengers re∣turne finding no advertizement could be given concerning your particular, with a certain kinde of melancholly rage I retired into my chamber, where I continued notwithstanding any perswa∣tion to the contrary, untill another ship was fitted for our transportation, in regard ours was held for the present altogether uncapable of another voyage, without a great deale of mending and reparation: within two or three dayes I took my leave of my kinswoman, and her Lord; though the gods knew in a very blunt manner, (my
thoughts being over burthened for complements) and presently directed my course to the Island of Cyprus, where I hoped you were; or at leastwise by my comming thither would be arrived; not∣withstanding I could not in my fearfull appre∣hension but doubt the worst, notwithstanding those in the ship, endeavoured by many circum∣stances, to confirme me in a certain belief of your safety, which made the journey something lesse tedious and distastfull: I conjured the whole company entirely to conceale my name, from any person whatsoever untill you were found: when we landed at Salamine I understood the Queene your mother and my father were both lately re∣moved from thence to Paphos, where again strict∣ly enquiring after you, and not hearing any news whatsoever either of your aboad or safety, after I had spent some time in tearing my haire, and u∣sing other fruitlesse complaints, I resolved in a disguise to seek you out in the country of Pam∣phylia; whither very probably I conceited the winds and the storm might have driven your ship, and by that meanes have committed your person to a new imprisonment, since that Territory is known to belong unto the King of Egypt: To this purpose having changed my habit (being on∣ly accompanied by a few of my attendants I could best trust) we put Egyptian colours upon the top of our vessel, as if we had onely belonged to the principality of Pamphylia: thus we sailed with all possible speed towards the confines of the lesser Asia, in regard we understand by certaine Mer∣chants of Syria remaining in Salamine, no newes
had been heard of you in that Kingdome, since your departure from the City of Memphis: but the gods perhaps intending by this diversion, to bring about other purposes according to their di∣vine and inscrutable decrees, before we approa∣ched the shore of Pamphylia by some howers sail, we were suddenly set upon by two vessels of Tyre, and presently commanded to yield our persons to their power and dispose, without dispute or contradiction, unlesse we would hazzard our selves in a contention most dangerous and despe∣rate. This language meeting my discontents and despaire, caused me to make a greater resistance, then was either convenient or necessary for our welfare, untill at last being wounded in many parss of my body, and not a few of the company slain or hurt, our ship was not onely seised upon, but my selfe carried to the Castle of the Town, where an Officer belonging to Philos commanded me to custody, for that Philos was for the present gone to Damascus; within three daies Philos re∣turned from Court, and not long after comming into my chamber, he quickly knew who I was: so bestowing upon me some few complements (I desiring him in the interim to conceale my name and qualisy) he presently gave order, for my respectfull attendance and necessary cure: also he appointed me to be removed to the best lodgings in his Castle, with a promise absolutely not to discover my person to any, but his own sister Artemesia, who, as he said to his knowledge, would contribute her best assistance to my reco∣very: in this condition (though extreamly af∣flicted
inwardly by reason of your selfe) I remai∣ned for at least a weeks space; when againe one day Philos came and feated himselfe by my bed side, telling me after some few complements, that as his sister had provided such rare simples for the practise of my Physitians, as could not otherwise be procured, by all the power and art of the great and rich Kingdome of Syria, so was she resolved shortly in person to give me a visit, if not daily accompany me in my distempers, when I should be rendred as he said more proper for the conver∣sation of ladies: then he made me exactly tell him the story or manner of our unfortunate separati∣on at sea; seeming extraordinary inquisitive, as well in what posture I left you at parting, as what my opinion was concerning your safety: Al∣though this relation with so many particulars, brought to my remembrance by the discourse, en∣creased my torments, like so many sharp daggers piercing my heart, with a thousand mortall wounds, yet I could not well deny the civillity, in regard that I was not onely in the Country of Syria, where I knew it would have been held a kind of a rude barbarisme in conversation, not to comply in all discourses whatsoever, notwith∣standing any discontent or passion, but that for the present, I seemed to be also entertained with the best expressions of love and kindnesse, could be imagined in his house: after I had made an∣swer to what he could possible require at my hands in that nature, I both desired and conjured him to send speedily, what ships he could spare out of his Harbours, to enquire after your welfare and a∣boade:
which being promised (some of the Phy∣sitians at the same time comming into the room) he necessarily left me to their dispose and directi∣ons. As I began to recover my health, I became eve∣ry day more then other perswaded, and satisfied concerning the certaine hopes of your safety, in regard we cold not heare of any shipwracks, that had hapned upon any of those coasts, or seas neer Syria, Pamphylia, or Cyprus, how diligent soever the messengers had beene in their enquiry: which in a short time so mended my condition, if not repaired my disability, that oftentimes I was not only able, but prescribed to walk into the garden, and other places of pleasure for my better recrea∣tion: And this was an occasion, that one after∣noon I was sent for by the Lady Artemesia (Philos being for the present somewhere out of the way, attending upon his necessary occasions) at my ar∣rivall I found the Lady her selfe seated at the up∣per end of the room with a Sampler in her hand, and a waiting woman attending by her, that fur∣nished her with those silks she had occasion to use; however at my approach she rose up, to give me a respectfull salutation, and that drew from me some complements in regard of the dainty work she had designed, which in truth appeared excel∣lent to my apprehension, being only the pretty banquet of the gods, where Juno sweld with over much jealousie because Ganymed was so neer her husband: but that which pleased most my opini∣on, was to see the angry lookes of Cupid, because his mother courted her deformed Vulcan in such
an assembly, whilst Mars appeared to be out of countenance at the action. After I had not only viewed but commended the artificiall hand, that had so lively described the delightfull story, Artemesia made me this reply; that it was no wonder if humane creatures were given so much to love, when the very gods themselves were trou∣bled with those passions. Truly Madam said I, although I cannot but allow of the passion, when it is ordained to produce onely noble effects, yet certainly the gods could never be subject to those imperfections, when for the most part their flames were unlawfull, as either preventing of other mens loves, or destroying the chastity of virgines, as the Poets mention: for my part said she, I am of opinion, although most of their actions des∣cribed by the wandring fancies of Poets, were but meer fictions, yet it cannot be but the stories of Perseus and Hercules, both sons to Iupiter were true, and consequently doe shew to our example, the lawfulnesse of the passion, when such Heros were produced: the one of a married wife, the o∣ther of a maid, to free the world from oppressi∣on and injury, since they appeared busied in no o∣ther imployment; who for their excellent quali∣ties and justice, have been since esteemed gods. This discourse I must confesse comming from a virgin, did something amaze me, yet we conti∣nued our disputation untill the time of the day, and Philos comming into the room, prevented any further contention, in a subject I as much de∣lighted in as her selfe. At which expression the sweet Princesse smiled, as if some cause had been
given her of jealousie, however she told him, al∣though his story began to be suspitious, yet she had so much justice in her resolution, as to at∣tend the end of his discourse, hoping that his re∣lation at last would cleere all difficulties: but by my honesty Madam said Roxana, you will per∣chance be deceived in your confidence, when you may be sure he will never accuse himselfe what fault soever he hath committed privately; which words proceeded so sharply from the old womans delivery, that it might be easily conjectured, that in her youth she had been sometimes couzened in her love; or at leastwise was of that opinion: ne∣verthelesse Cloria bid Narcissus go on, protesting she would not doe that wrong to her own inno∣cent and noble thoughts, as to suspect him whom she had in her judgment esteemed worthy of her affections: At which declaration the poore Pil∣grim seemed to be transported with a new joy; and after he had given her humble thankes for the confidence she had of his vertues, that became en∣creased by that opinion, he took her white hand againe, upon which he imprinted a multitude of vowes able to drive jealousie out of the world, and then proceeded in this manner. But this interruption as I said, not onely put off the exercising of my wit, and perhaps Arteme∣sia's intention, but also carried us all to supper, where many lookes of the young Lady to invite my eyes to the like encounter, gave my thoughts more then enough suspition, and so consequently my minde a great deale of trouble all the night following; untill the morning brought into my
chamber an old woman, whom I had often seene in those visits her mistresse had bestowed upon me in my ficknesse, and boldly seating her selfe upon my bed, abruptly used these words: Of all the men in the world said she, I wonder at your stupidity, fince your youth and beauty should be such flames to love, rather to consume your quiet rest, then coldly thus to entertaine the more then offered affections of another Venus, whose perfections are only subjects of admirati∣on. Is it possible that so bright a starre as Arte∣mesia, hath not a powerfull influence in your dull soule? When the earth seemes to tremble at the greatnesse of her Uncle, which renders all people in a mauner willing to become his slaves, whilst you appeare loath to be his friend. Can you thinke these frequent visits that this faire and great Lady made to you in your sicknesse, and since her free conversation, proceed from ordinary respects, when the greatest Princes in Asia are not thought worthy of the favours without comming clothed with the pretensions of being her husband; And alasse, who can be esteemed so happy as to merit such a Title, however far above you in dignity, though I could wish she had chosen long agoe to have prevented her unhappy fate, by casting her eyes and heart upon such a subject: if you doe not yet understand this old Philosophy, at least∣wise believe the new logick I deliver that am her nurse, and consequently should know her mind. Let it suffice, if you list you may be happy beyond Kings; but if your perverse fortune intend you not such a blessing, certainly no lesse a curse then de∣struction
will accompany the disaster; since there is no meane to be expected, between possession in love or ruine by hate; And after some time left me to be accompanied only by my own imagina∣tion, which soon represented unto me these con∣siderations. First the dangerous consequence of being in the custody of Artemesia's brother, who had the commodity as well to destroy as to speak the word; and next the rage of the whole family if they should conceive themselves dishonoured by the refusall. Yet deare Cloria said he, my not to be conquered loyalty to you, was sufficient to resist, though not to prevent all difficulties. At which expression, the Princesse only with another pretty smile, bid him go on in his story; but the first said he, most troubled my thoughts, since Philos love to his sister as I believed, would easily be perswaded by my death to make a greater di∣stance between our affections, when he should finde my constancy could not be removed by his milder art, rather then hazard Artemosia's honour; but for the second, although I supposed the whole family would hold it for a supreame indignity, to have their kins-woman refused by my neglect, yet the revenge could not well be executed with∣out the discovery of the Ladies passion: but I re-resolved as my best defence, neither to take no∣tice of the old womans discourse, nor of her Mi∣stresses courtship, untill I were yet prest by some new overture, not to be waved without a pe∣remptory reply, and then to shew my courage in our loves; fince the Ladies passions, I supposed would not break out to any dangerous violence,
untill she became absolutely desperate in her hopes. After I had drest my selfe, and was enter∣taining my thoughts in a retiring place belon∣ging to my lodging, I became suddenly invited by a messenger sent by Philos, to accompany him to a certaine place belonging to his Uncle Philostros, not above foure houres voyage in a Coach; where the great favourite had im∣ployed abundance of wealth, with more in∣dustry, to render it an habitation both curious and stately, as being the place not only of his birth, but bearing the name of his family. The first object that presented it selfe to our eyes, was a beautifull Towne, though more in the quality then in the quantity of the houses, built in such a just uniformity, that it became a question to my imagination, whether the order or the materials should have the greater preheminence in my opi∣nion, since the one in a pleasant prospective plea∣sed the sight, as the other in a mature considerati∣on satisfied the understanding: for as Cypres trees being mixt with the severall buildings, afforded a most delightfull variety, so the richnesse of the stone shewed it was designed to be lasting; both which being joyned together, the whole could not chuse but be admirable, in so much as I had much adoe to get my lookes off those rarities, un∣till greater wonders appeared ready to entertaine me, which was the Palace it selfe seated in a con∣venient ascent, built all of Tuscan work, with such exact skill, that the Architectures of the wonders of the world, might have been present at the designe: It was framed into a perfect square,
each angle supported by a goodly Pavilion, eleva∣ting their guilded heads above the rest of the Fa∣brick, whilst two Galleries of either side joyned by a portall of severall coloured Marble, inclosed in a large Court that only at the further end made a brave Tarras, paved artificially with Moysayck work, and bounded by raile and baller of Corin∣thian Brasse, where upon both sides the staires up∣on double pedestalls of Porphir, were placed the two statues of Saturne and Jupiter: The outward Court round about the walls seemed to be crow∣ned with Urrnes, mixt with halfe statues of the an∣cient Grecians, whilst the entrance being open at the top the architrave freeze and cornish were cut off in the middle, and finished with Cartooses in∣stead of meeting. The gate of either part was supported by Jonick pillars, two behind and one before, which made a returne in the building, and foure guilded Lions upon low pedestals seemed to guard the passage. After we had traversed these beautifull inclosures, we were let into the gardens for the more conveniency of shade, since the day already began to be enflamed by the Suns violence, which for the more curiosity were ordered into severall discents, supported by huge Arches of white Marble, and in many places so covered with excellent Fruit trees, that they see∣med a farre off, to be painted over with delight∣full Landskips of woods, whilst the Birds and wa∣terworks inclosed in the vaults sent forth a plea∣sing murmur to the aire. The first garden al∣though it were lesse then all the rest, because it might afford a better prospect upon the other,
was divided into foure squares, each conteining a magnificent fountaine, the one having the brazen statue of Hercules with his club in his hand, invi∣roned about with a Christall lake, wherein were Fishes so gentle by education, that they waited in the water to be fed by those that viewed the cu∣riosities. The superfice of the pond was formed into twelve angles, and raised three foot high by a certaine calle of cut stone, that resembled a hedge, whereupon each point was put, one of his labours artificially cast in mettle. The second water worke represented the naked figures of Dia∣na and her Nymphes in white Marble; however so shadowed by a dainty grove planted by Art for that purpose, that their whole shapes could not perfectly be discovered, though there appeared enough for delight and admiration, whilst poore Actaeon without the trees in a green plat of ground seemed to be torne in pieces by his own houndes, according to the judgement given against him by the revengefull goddess, though his friends in every place out of the bushes, appeared to haste to his rescue. The third fountaine was only of Peri∣mus and Thisbe, with the tragicall event of their loves. And the last figured the fates of Hero and Leander, where her Tower being built in a cer∣taine other lake, which received its current from the first, made a kind of confused, though little Sea, wherein the compassionate Nymphes by exact expressions, were apprehended to bewaile the lovely Youths death, whilst his distracted love, cast her selfe from the battlements of her own lodgings, to accompany him in his buriall.
But that which most delighted my senses (because it afforded a pleasing prospective between divers rowes of even set Trees) was a certaine banquet∣ting house, built after the forme of a round Tem∣ple, with large windowes of bright glasse, divi∣ded by guilded pillars, notwithstanding it had a portall, to give it entrance, of many transparent columnes, or at leastwise they so appeared to my view at a distance; the materials that built it, were yellow minerals, enterlaced with shells of mother of Pearle, so that the structure resembled a Tower of gold garnished with jewels; and be∣ing sheltred over head in every place but before, by united cypresses, it represented to my imagi∣nation, a rich Tabernacle in a stately Pavillion; since the Trees were so tall, that they gave it ra∣ther a shady lustre, then a darke coverture. Scarce had I contemplated this pleasant object, but that Philos invited me to a neerer taste of the beauty, it being to be past over by a Bridge silver'd over, since the house it selfe was seated in an Island made by the winding course of a naturall River, though many artificiall streames from it, seemed to contribute some assistance to the running Brooke. At our arrivall (having spent a quarter of an houres time in descending the severall sorts of staires, that carried us into the lower Gardens) we might encounter with our eyes, at the first opening of the doore, the Lady Artemesia, newly come out of the water, scarce having covered her modesty with a Lawne smock; neither did our surprisall seem to hasten the accommodation of
that light coverture to the best advantage, as if she were so farre from being ashamed to be taken in that posture, that she rather exprest a desire to have her beauties still seen; her haire was at full length, though curiously curled, which preten∣ded to designe, and not to accident, since two waiting-women in Nymphs attire, held a great Looking-glasse before her, whilst she carefully drest her face with certaine black patches, cut into the forms of Flies, and other small creatures, for the better ornament of her lookes: her legs were bare, onely she wore upon her feet a paire of rich embroydered pantobles: This, as neere as I can remember, was the state we found her in. And very neere certainly you were, said Cloria, that you could discover so much. At which words Narcissus began to blush, protesting also with a pretty violence; that he was so farre from liking her in that posture, that he was as much displeased as ashamed at her immodesty. Well, well, replied the Princesse, goe on in your story, without these impertinencies, since none laies any fault to your charge. Which command was too peremptory from his faire Mistresse, to con∣tinue him in any longer disputation; so he pro∣ceeded. But however, said he, although she put on no bashfull amazement in her countenance, yet with a disdainfull frown she seemed to entertaine our company, which was a sufficient injunction to cause us speedily to retire; and that gave occa∣sion to Philos (since we had already travelled enough over those walkes) to command us to be
conducted up into the house, where we might be more conveniently shaded from the heat of the day; and that quickly brought us into the Gal∣leries, where excellent pictures, not enough to be esteemed, and rich cabbinets beyond valuation, gave our thoughts and eyes an abundance of im∣ployments, untill a delicious dinner called us into another room, where we found Artemefia, scarce seeming to be the same woman we left her in the Garden; having not onely put off altoge∣ther her choler, but also being trimmed up with so exquisite a neatnesse, as if she had been prepa∣red for her Nuptiall Feast; which confirmes my opinion, that all those postures were designed of purpose, to make me think she was admirable in every shape, as well when nature played the care∣lesse wanton, as when art became the curious painter. Bvt in conclusion, a few complements set us all at table, where lovely pages like Gany∣meds fill'd our Wine rather in Diamonds then Christiall glasses, whilst our fruit seemed to be fetcht from the Hesperides, all so excellent, that could not be imitated, much lesse equalled; yet that excellency was elevated, I will not say aug∣mented by ravishing Musick, both of voyces and Instruments, that with a gentle harmony, rather bewitched then burdened the eare; which con∣tinued untill direction was given to take away the cloth, that the room might be emptied of all attendants, to give us the greater liberty for our private conversation, a custome in that Country for the better recreation, since they used not to remove presently after dinner: however we all
continued for some time in a perfect silence, they perhaps expecting what I should say of my noble entertainment, and their uncles greatnesse; and I, not being over willing to administer occasion of discourse, till at last Philos himselfe brake out in this manner. Sister, said he, although I must confesse we have largely tasted of your bounty, though more of your neat curiosity, a property I must acknow∣ledge, that better becomes youthfull Ladies; yet it should seem before dinner, you were too care∣lesse of your retirednesse, in suffering strangers to be eye-witnesses of those beauties which you have designed onely for him that is to be your husband, as rich Jewels that are to be lockt up in close Cabinets, not to be exposed to the vul∣gar view. Brother, answered Artemesid, with a spightfull haste, although it be true that it was contrary to the intention of my innocent mo∣desty, in that posture to be surprized by your wandring intention; yet certainly I am lesse asha∣med of the accident, when I consider you beheld nothing, that either I may be deprived of, or ea∣sily can be equalled by other Ladies of my yeeres; onely all the feare I have is, lest the scandall may prove offensive to this worthy stranger, that I have so great ambition to content, that I should beshrew any occasion that might render me sus∣pected in his opinion, since the interest of my blood and conversation I know must alwaies keep me safe in yours: I must confesse this complement, or rather strange expression of Artemesia, put me in some
confusion; considering of one side; if I gave her no answer at all, it might be interpreted an un∣gratefull rudenesse, having received such exqui∣site entertainment, pretended onely for my dis∣vertisement, after my long sicknesse; and of the other part, what reply soever I could make, pro∣ceeding from accustomed rules of civility, would of necessity engage my words to the acknow∣ledgement of her perfections, which might en∣courage some other passionate progresse of that love I so much disliked: however, at last I fell upon this resolution, to involve my answer into such a riddle, that either could not be well under∣stood, or being so, it might imply a double sence, which I delivered in this sort: Madam, said I, your beauties resemble the innocency of the first Ages, that thought vertues were not to be hid from the ignorant world, nor imperfections to be mask'd by any art, whereby the rude multitude might alwaies have a book open, to learn know∣ledge, and practice goodnesse, which was the best way to avoid ill, when naked truth was the one∣ly written character for their instructions. This reply, although it did not for the present well satisfie, because it seemed not to flame by the stroake of the flint, that had produced sparkles, as they believed, to set on fire the youthfull Tin∣der of my heart; yet of the other side, it left not an absolute despaire in their opinions, that at last I might be warmed by their motions: neverthe∣lesse, for that time the coldnesse of my answer, changed the subject of our discourse to other talke, that I confesse, I approved of; which with
many varieties, continued us untill the evening warned us to depart, and brought us to our old habitation; where, at our arrivall, we found a Messenger newly come from Damascus, attending to certifie Philos, that his great uncle Philostros was taken suddenly with a dangerous sicknesse, insomuch as many of his Physicians very much doubted of his recovery; but however he con∣cealed the news from all the house, yet the next morning very early, it caused him to take his journey, leaving me in the interim onely to be accompanied by his gallant sister; who having the raines absolutely in her own hands, let her passions runne with a full careere; for finding that all these trials had not wrought at all upon my affection, or got the least ground of my con∣stancy, since the burning coales brought by Cu∣pids diligence from his mothers luxurious Al∣tars, had not yet thaw'd my icy thoughts. Ar∣temesia fell to work new stratagems, so that one morning, I being in a private Library belonging to my lodgings, where commonly I spent some houres in the day, in conferring with those books I most desired to read, and viewing the Maps of severall Countries for my recreation; of a sudden I might heare the dolefull voyce of a certaine per∣son, divided from my knowledge by a partitian wall at the end of the room, which quickly made me curious enough to be informed of the nature of the complaint: wherefore approaching neerer and leaning my head close to the division, I be∣came instantly satisfied, that the noyse proceeded from no other then from Artemesia, which did
not a little increase my wonder, since I conceived her much beyond all misfortune: however I was resolved to be fully instructed, and to that pur∣pose setling my eares to an entire attentivenesse, in distinct words I heard this language. O unhappy Artemesia, said she, is it possible that thy owne beauty is of so poor a valew, that it hath not the power to attract the least regard from a youthfull eye, which hath been accusto∣med heretofore, to inflame all the hearts of Sy∣ria? or is thy Uncles dignity fallen in the estima∣tion of all the world, since a stranger in thy pow∣er as a prisoner contemnes both? O you gods of love and honour said she, permit not our family to be disgraced though you be determined I shall perish, since I cannot perswade him I must hate my selfe; and by consequence become a destroyer of us both; for as I am resolved not to breath on∣ly to suffer, so must not he live chiefely to try∣umph; with much other goodly stuffe of this na∣ture, which I leave to repeat, because I will not prophane your most chaste eares, with all the particulars of her violent and ridiculous passion; however I was forced to dwell with my conside∣ration upon two points in her mad expression; the first was, that she seemed to declare me a pri∣soner, which untill then I never understood; though I must confesse, I found my liberty often∣times restrained under the pretence of a loving care of my health: And the other that appeared more terrible, her seeming resolution, either to enjoy or to destroy. Which made me when I had heard enough, to retire to my own chamber; but
many dayes I had not continued there, before I perceived by the apparent neglect of the whole house, Artemesia not sending for me according to her custome, that I was held for no other then a prisoner, being every night locked into my lod∣ging by an officious Groom. All which was done as I understood to bring downe my proud and Icy heart, to comply with her desires; her nurse in the interim giving me many items of her in∣tention; besides, I might behold every day out of my chamber window, the rich and glorious triumphes of my insolent Mistresse, when shee mounted her Chariot to take the aire for her re∣creation, or performed some other visits for her pleasure. And that the splendor might more ap∣peare to my thoughts, as intended affronts, con∣temning my low condition & captivity, she caused an ordinary way to be made by my doore, where she daily past with mirth in her countenance and scorn in her language; to shew she had not on∣ly forgot her old love, but the very remembrance I was in the house; whilst in the meane time the foresaid nurse would now and then give me a vi∣sit, as it were covertly out of pitty, to comfort up my thoughts against her Ladies rigour; however I very well knew her intention was but the better to discover my resolutions; neverthelesse, with all which humours I was content to play, to a∣void any further incumbrance of her Mistresse offered affection, not doubting but at her bro∣thers returne I should be able to procure my re∣leasemtnt, the only happinesse I aymed at, though my endeavours were not of force to prevent this
following mischiefe; for Artemesia finding that no artifice could make me entertaine her love, or adore her person, since the heavens knew I had a brighter deity to worship, which kept me from all superstitious Idolatry, began to be enamoured with her own revenge, and so resolved to make me become a Martyr before my time: wherefore one day comming into my chamber, when I least looked for her company, her own pride as I thought, having forbid her entrance, bearing in her hand a short dagger, as in her countenance a rough tempest, saluted me with this desperate language: Villain, said she, dost thou think to carry the Trophies of my dishonour into thy own Country, to adorne the chariot of thy Mistresses triumphes, with those spoyles thy disdaine hath purchased in this Castle, to the disgrace of our whole family? and with that struck at my naked breast, being newly unbuttoned by reason of the heat of the weather, with such a womans vio∣lence, that I must confesse, my quick prevention had fortune enough to avoyd the danger of the stroake, though not so much power as to hinder her rage; for finding I had not only defended my selfe against her intended and malicious fury, but endeavoured to become an absolute conquerour over her mad passion, by striving to dispossesse her also of her weapon, with a spleen more infer∣nall then humane, because she could not hurt me, she resolved to wound her selfe, whereby I might be esteemed the greater criminall, to take off that blemish which hung upon her reputation by her too violent love; but the stroake proved more
deadly then perhaps she imagined, for it not only pierced her arme, where she onely intended it, but by reason of the sharpnesse of the point, en∣tred a great depth into her naked side, which with the effusion of a great deale of bloud (that at last called up most part of the house to her assi∣stance) left her dead in the view of all the specta∣tors. This sad disaster, as you may imagine, suffi∣ciently inraged the whole company, and concei∣ving me either the actor, or the instrument of the Tragedy, with all violence haled me to a closer prison in the Castle, whilst according to the cu∣stome of those parts, my processe was to be made the next morning by the Justice of the Towne, before the body could either be buried or imbal∣med. This accident gave my confused thoughts sufficient imployment; however I made a great question whether I should confesse my name, or conceale my condition, finding by my citation, I was only called the ungratefull stranger, which gave me some opinion that my quality was not generally knowne in the City; believing as the one would not at all help to lessen the crime pre∣tended against me, but rather give the more suspi∣tion of a hidden designe, in that I durst attempt a murther of that horrid nature, which an ordinary person would never have performed, so the other might in some sort helpe to hide the shame to our Family, in being called to a publick defence in a case of such a wickednesse: wherefore I determi∣ned not to reveale my selfe, untill some apparent necessity procured it. At my arraignment, there was alleadged a∣gainst
me besides the breach of the rules of hospi∣tality, how that it was impossible any other could commit the murther, since Artemesia was found alone with me in my chamber; and it was not to be supposed she had killed her selfe. On the con∣trary, I pretended that being a meer stranger in those parts, it could not be imagined I should harbour so much malice in my breast, as to be∣come the murtherer of one that had treated me in my sicknesse with abundance of humanity; besides I said, the weapon which had given Arte∣mesia her deadly wound, was found by all the company in her own hand: but the businesse be∣ing thus to and fro violently disputed, Arteme∣sia's nurse was sent for to give further testimony of my carriage towards her Mistresse during my aboade in the Castle, which could not chuse but give in the opinion of all there present, a great deale of light in the disputation; however, the malicious old woman imagining her declarations might afforde me some assistance, refused to come, pretending she was necessarily imployed in the Funerall of her dead Mistresse, being locked up with the body in her private chamber; though the truth was, she thirsted after my life to save the honour of Artemesia, and the whole family, since by that meanes I should not have the opportunity to divulge her preposterous love; so that at last I was not only found guilty, but condemned pri∣vately to lose my head within the Castle court; fearing belike in my last speech I would publish some passages, that might render the people satis∣fied of my innocency, and Artemesia's lascivious∣nesse,
Thus finding all my honest Rhetorick, could not prevaile in my just defence to secure me from condemnation, I resolved to declare my person, hoping that although it might not prove of sufficient force to divert my judgement, yet neverthelesse it would be a motive to protract my execution untill Philos returned from Damascus; which declaration happily me with my expecta∣tion: For after the Judges with much amaze∣ment had entertained the knowledge of my con∣dition, being the son of him who was esteemed so intimate a friend to the Kingdome of Syria, they not only presently signed my reprieve, but conveyed me with all the respect their laws would give them leave, back againe to the prison, where I remained untill Philos returne, who brought with him the newes of Philostros death and buri∣all, though foure dayes time was spent after his arrivall before he offered me a visit, in which space I had liberty enough for consideration what would be my fate: At last he came and saluted me with this discourse to my no small adn i∣ration. My Lord said he, I must not onely desire you to forget all your ill usage in this Castle, but to interpret the reasons, to have proceeded from a womans unruly passion (for I cannot give it a bet∣ter Title) without my privity, which my future actions, and my present discourse shall testifie, if either you will believe my words, or pardon my intentions. Be pleased then in short to know, for my resolution is to make unto you a particular confession, and after commit my selfe unto you
goodnesse and mercy, that when you and the faire Princesse Cloria were at Memphis with Orsa∣mes, it was my fortune to be conquered by the power of love, proceeding not only from the ex∣cellency of her beauty and conversation, but as I may say was thrust upon me by such a forcible and precipitate fate, that could not to be contra∣dicted by the power of any reason or temper; in so much as I must tell you, in regard of those passions, I could neither eate, sleep, nor rest with convenient satisfaction; so that I conceived my selfe obliged for my preservation, to contrive a project with the Lydian Ambassadour then re∣maining at Memphis, which was to interrupt your passage at Sea going into Cyprus, whereby the better to make a separation between your love, and that which the Princesse bore you, that both mine, and my sister Artemesias might succeed in the places: And however the gods prevented ra∣ther the manner of the execution, then the effect of our designes, by contrary stormes and acci∣dents at Sea, yet I must now enforme you, that as your selfe by fortune were taken by our ships, which hath since produced this late dismall mis∣hap concerning my sister, so the Princesse Cloria, by chance falling upon the Coasts of the Island of Creet, is now delivered into the possession of the Senate of Lydia; and they as I am enformed, from those Ambassadors of our Country that are at Sardis, intend with some violence to bestow her in marriage upon her Consin Cassianus Prince of Iberia, whereby the better to fortifie their preten∣tions and Titles against King Euarchus her father;
however they seemed for a long time to play with my hopes, as if they only intended her for my satisfaction, belike imagining that such an ex∣pectation would alwayes be sufficient to continue our family faithfull to their purposes, and so consequently make my Uncle Philostros ever wil∣ling to imploy his power with Orsames for their advantages; but he being now dead (which newes they have already received in Lydia) they publickly disclaime from having any such inten∣tion, as believing now we can no more contri∣bute profitably to their designes: wherefore as my thoughts and resolutions intend a present retire∣ment in some place of religion, to seek pardon of the gods for my many violent and unjust ambiti∣ons, so did I very well know, their mercies in no kind were to be obtained, without such a particu∣lar declaration of my own faults, which I have now made unto you: as I can no way doubt of your charity and compassion in my behalfe, ac∣cording to the noblenesse of your nature; so may you be pleased to take what free liberty you please for your departure, with a promise also on my part to be ready to assist you with my best services, either in your loves to the fairest Prin∣cesse, or upon what other occasion soever that may make you better honoured and esteemed in the world. After he had delivered thus much, I must confesse I was so well satisfied with this dis∣course; not onely in regard of your safety, but also in respect of my own releasement, that Philos imagined as I then thought by my present actions and expression, that I meant to run away from him,
for suddainly taking me by the hand, he said he had a few more words to deliver unto me, that concerned his sisters proceedings, since he held it most necessary his own innocency might be clea∣red; for that in no particular he protested, was he guilty of my last usage. As I cannot deny said he, but that I kindled the first sparkles by my commendation of your person and worth, that afterward flamed so violently in my sisters bosome; so of the other side, I never expected it should have broken out to such an o∣minous passion, whereby you were to be injured without measure, as my sister destroyed be∣yond example: But as the Gods have their secret workings in all humane things, we must with pati∣ence and reverence submit all our endeavours to their pleasure, which will for the most part keep us from extravagant and wicked actions; since however sometimes we might faile by misprision, yet by a small repentance we should againe be brought into our accustomed temper, when as letting loose the reines of our desires without moderation, we are borne into a vast Sea of con∣fusion, that produceth nothing but prodigious destructions, as it fared with Artemesia, who was resolved because she could not obtaine suddenly what her own thoughts perhaps esteemed lawfull, to convert that passion to so strange a hate, that of necessity would not onely render the object of her wishes nothing, but her selfe miserable with∣out hope of ever being able to enjoy what she so much longed for; however her old nurses coun∣sels, although they did not contribute to her pas∣sions,
yet they produced those projects that cau∣sed your ill usage; for finding you were not by any faire meanes to be wonne to my sisters desires, she advised her to assay the contrary, to try if that course could terrifie you to consent: All which Artemesia confessed before her death, her body a∣gaine reviving after it was brought into her pri∣vate Chamber, as also with many Teares and fighes entreated your pardon, which I thought good to acquaint you with, that her unfained re∣pentance might procure your charitable forgive∣nesse: And with that taking me by the hand a∣gaine with terres in his eyes, he desired me as a testimony of a perfect reconciliation, I would vouchsafe the paines to visit the dead Corpes be∣fore the Funerals, which shortly were to be per∣formed. Although I went with him as fully contented in my minde, as he seemed oppressed with sorrow for his sisters death; yet I could not chuse but have a noble compassion at the remembrance of the Ladies hard fate, especially for that the cause was only for over much loving me, but at my arrivall instead of imbracing the dead body, to my won∣derful amazement, I was saluted with these words from living Artemesia. My Lord said she, that you may not think you converse with dead, (though changed) Artemesia, you must first know, that after I had performed in your Lodgings that unparalleld action of my mad rage, bathed all over with mine own bloud, I was carried into my chamber, whilst you unknowne to me was in danger to have suffered
unjustly for my fault: And being there by the carefull industry of mine own Physitian, with∣out the privity of any, but such as were intrusted about my person, I was not onely recovered from my trance, but before my brothers arrivall put out of danger of death; however, I desired the businesse might be kept secret from the know∣ledge of all but my intimate servants, since I was resolved to quit the world by a more religious way, not being willing to support the shame of so detestable a fact: yet considering that an ab∣solute repentance could not be, where there wants an intention of full satisfaction, I was de∣sirous with my own mouth, to make this decla∣ration before I enter into the strict rules of my pennance, by which I humbly and sorrowfully beg your pardon, wishing a perpetuall prosperity to the chaste loves between you and the Princesse Cloria. And this, my Lord, being all I have to say to you, I desire you will have no more re∣membrance of me, then meerly what charity instructs your pious thoughts. And with these words she drew close the Curtaines of her bed, not willing to be seen, or any more spoken withall. These things, I must confesse, rather appeared to my imagination visions then actions, untill with as much honour as could be devised, I was set free by Philos, who also courteously offered to accompany me with his best service in my journey; but because I was resolved to visit the place of your aboad in a disguize, not onely for that I knew you were in the custody of your
enemies; but also in that I had a desire to under∣stand by the way, the secrets of the Senates inten∣tion concerning Cassianus love, which I must confesse gave my thoughts some trouble, I refused his offer. As this discourse seemed to give a singular content to the lovely Princesse, demonstrated by many visible signes, both in her eyes and blushes; so Roxana, who had all the while, with a most exact attentivenesse, given eare to his severall relations, uttered this language, with a kind of a formall gravity: Truly my Lord, said she, you have not onely gallantly now cleared all our doubts and feares, but also in my opinion have carried your selfe in your difficult adventures, more like a valiant Martyr, then a constant lover, which I must confesse deserves both praise and re∣quitall: and yet Governesse, said the Princesse, we must not commend him overmuch, lest he expect a greater reward then we shall be willing to afford him. Deare Cloria, replied Narcissus, I cannot but confesse my own covetousnesse, since no lesse a present can content my thoughts, then your admirable selfe, which is a Jewell beyond the price of the whole world: But said Cloria, the chiefe property of Jewels, are to be looked upon at a distance; wherefore, if you will be sa∣tisfied onely with that liberty and moderation, perhaps I shall without much difficulty grant your request. Yet Madam, replied Roxana, it is most necessary he make choice of some other apparrell, better to become his person; so may you have both the conveniency now and then to
meet in these walkes without suspition, untill the confusion now in the Kingdome afford you a greater liberty. But Narcissus most earnestly entreated to be entertained at a neerer distance; however without fruit, in regard both Cloria and Roxana apprehended, that his passion to see Cassianus sometimes received as a suitor, though but with appearing complements, would pro∣voke him to some actions, which might either prejudice their liberties, or discover his person; for that neither of them could yet be over-con∣fident, of Cassianus intentions and fidelity con∣cerning the old Flamin, although he had not since their late discourse, either shewed any man∣ner of discontent, or so much as troubled them with visits. Narcissus, when he saw he could not by any means prevaile in his desire, as if he had been at the instant possest with some Poeticall fury, began this complaint in verse; which the Princesse, being excellent also in that faculty, as quickly answered extempore. Narcissus. Most dearest Love, recall thy hard decree, that seems both rigorous to thee and me; The coldest rocks, though cover'd all with Snow, upon the Sunnes approach begin to thaw. Cloria. But vertue must not so admit a flame, to be it selfe end angered by the same; As appetites doe kindle false desires, discretion must oppose t' allay the fires.
Narcissus. O doe not so prophane a holy name, by scruples that doe onely vertue staine; Long since I have your word, yours is a debt, wherefore unjust the payment to neglect. Cloria. Yet 'tis extortion, not a lawfull due, to take by force, and never rightly sue: When contracts name no time (you know) we may defer the payment to a longer day. Narcissus. But its unjust for to defraud a law, onely by sleights, that faine would over-awe Prformauce: No Cloria, you ought to know, The race being wonne, the prize you must bestow. Cloria. I partly grant your argument; howere you must not be the judge, my parents beare The greatest share in government, since I am theirs, and borrow but my liberty. Narcissus. Surely that Tye's dissolv'd and free, when they have neither power to give, or we to pray; If the exigence be such to them and we, no reason that our right should hindred be. Cloria. You still mistake; I doe no right refuse, but for prevention onely physick take, To temper heady sense, which well I see, looks chiefly at it selfe, and minds not me. Narcissus. O heavens above, when did you ever read, of such a temper, which you seem to plead?
Have not the gods approv'd the influence, that your philosophy would make but sense. Cloria. Such false Deities as you example were, but onely Poets gods, whose lust and feare, Render'd their Nuptials rapes, vice their designe, and did but cozen fooles with names divine. Narcissus. Where shall we seek to finde Religion then, if not in love of either gods or men? This paradoxe observ'd, will surely turn the world into a Chaos, and men to burn. Cloria. Rather such loves were nought but sensuall dreams, that made their thoughts a Chaos of extreams; Still craving more, without the harmony of soules, that onely us can satisfie. Narcissus. Alas, deare soule! although your rhetoricke, would fain perswade my trembling heart that's sick, To what you please; yet 'twere hypocrisie, for me to seem to like your tyranny. Cloria. Nere did a tyrant practice temperance, my innocence seeks onely to advance, The lawes of love and honour, those being left, marriage is a thraldome or a theft. Narcissus. How should I plead for love, much lesse contend, when you in love will not become my friend? But leave me with tortures the fruit to catch, that you with crafty slights from me doe snatch.
Cloria. Tis passion not craft, that injures love, and from your selfe not me, your torments move, Which ought be checkt, least our expected joyes in future times prove but confused ioyes. Narcissus. At leastwise I must call that temper cruell, that starves my flames for want of fitting fuell, Since I can neither quench those fires that burne or warme my selfe which way so ere I turne. Cloria. There is no meanes so good to still a flame, as for to cast on milke upon the same: Calme then your thoughts, and be content to beare the just decree, which passion will not heare. Narcissus, Certainly faire Creature you feele no paine, that wooes me thus my passions to refrain; For those that tortures taste upon the rack, cannot be blamed if they some courage lack. Cloria. Yet such as faile in their owne constancy, imply a guilt, and doe as faulty dye; When others that their tryalls overcome, doe save their lives, and gaine a lawrell Crowne. After the Princesse had thus perswaded Narcis∣sus to be contented, finding the time of the day gave them no more opportunity, she rose up to returne to the Castle; however assuring him as often as she could without danger to her selfe she would frequent those walkes for his satisfacti∣on; This being the decree all the favours poore
Narcissus could obtaine further of the wilfull Princesse was, only one parting kisse, in recom∣pence of all his travells; which being obtained, she and her Governesse went home joyfully dis∣coursing of their good fortune, which continued Cloria's thoughts in such a paradise all the night following, that scarce did her faire eyes entertain any rest at all; Thus as I say, shee took paines to please her imagination, whilst her body wanted that sleep it necessarily required; which was an occasion that after dinner the next day she cast her selfe upon her bed, something to supply the defect of the night past; but presently upon her waking her Dwarfe told her, that a young handsome Priest at the gate, humbly desired to be admitted to the speech of her highnesse, having as he said, businesse of great consequence to impart unto her. This sudden intelligence gave Clorias thoughts some trouble, doubting a disasterous adventure, the rather for that her newly being wakened from the Ideas of her chiefe delight, it seemed to inter∣rupt her apprehension with a contrary feare, of being dispossest of what she had enjoyed by her flattering fancy; however she called Roxana to accompany her in the expectation, commanding the little messenger not only to usher in that stranger, that seemed so importunate, but after∣ward himselfe to wait in the outward roome, be∣cause she would have none privy to the businesse, before she and her Governesse were informed of the contents. But no sooner did Cloria view this new intru∣der, but but she knew him to be him whom she
most desired to see, her young servant Narcissus, who had borrowed the habite of one of Apollos Priests, in a Temple where he lodged the night past amongst the woods, to keep him from every ones knowledge but her own, and her intrusted Governesse Roxana: neverthelesse the rigid old woman began to raile downe right at his pre∣sumption, vowing with his too much passion he would destroy thē all; this gave Cloria occasion to laugh heartily, seeing her poor servant with inno∣cent looks, to undergoe the cholerick reproofe of Roxana, without replying one single word to her hasty language, yet his patience not only by lit∣tle and little procured him his peace; but after a long conference with his compassionate Mistresse, by the free consent of her Governesse, who at last became perswaded, he was entertained for a hous∣hold servant; however the sweet Princesse seemed unwilling to prophance his sacred robes with any hypocrisie. But one day Cassianus comming to visit the Princesse, the gods know with what an envious jealousie Narcissus underwent this ceremonies; sometimes he had a will to have interrupted his passage at the entrance into her chamber; o∣ther while againe he thought to have alleadged she was asleep, and could not be disquieted in her rest; and last of all he began to have a resolution to quit his borrowed habit, and challenge him for his boldnesse, in pretending in his presence to his right: And a thousand other fancies entertai∣ned his imagination, almost in an instant, when there was no more time left him for these consi∣derations;
but whilst Cloria was advertized of Cassianus arrivall, and he admitted into her chamber; whither Narcissus followed him with greedy steps to be a curious eye witnesse of his be∣haviour: And when he saw Cloria with a gentle modesty admit of her Cousins salutation, she be∣ing not willing to give him any discontent, by reason of the old Flamine that was at his mercy, his colour began to change in his face; one while the beautifull red seemed to claime an interest in revenge, notwithstanding all the prohibitions of his sweet Mistresse: then againe the faire white had the prerogative, and pretended feare to Clo∣rias commands; so that in this manner they ne∣ver left combating in his lovely countenance, untill he was rid of the occasion of those disor∣ders. Not many dayes after Cassianus had performed his unwelcome visit, the Senate belike jealous of the Princesse safety, in regard the King her father had been strangely rescued from their power by that Army that not long before they esteemed their Subjects, suddenly commanded not onely those servants to be removed from their accusto∣med attendance that had been about her person, but her selfe and Roxana to be conducted to a stronger Fort, there to remaine with better secu∣rity, and more honour as they pretended, until the present distractions of Lydia could in some sort be pacified; in which number poor Narcissus be∣came also prescribed, which converted his past content into an unexpressible rage; some time blaming the heavens for not punishing the cruel∣ty
as he interpreted it, of the unjust and barba∣rons decree, then againe he absolutely fell out with himselfe, that he had not ability beyond humane force, to prevent the execution of such a pernicious command. But alasse, his vaine pas∣sions were so farre from defending the Princesse Cloria against that violence offered to her person, that he had not so much liberty as by one deare kisse to take leave of her white hand, amongst the rest of her traine, who were admitted to that sor∣rowfull honour: for the rigid guard finding by his distracted lookes, and extravagant words, that he had not patience enough in his breast, to com∣ply punctually with their strict commission, quickly discharged him from his ordinary atten∣dance, before they disposed of the rest of the ser∣vants. This accident soon retired Narcissus into the neighbouring woods, there to complaine on∣ly to Rocks and stones of the greatnesse of the Princesse injury, and his owne misfortunes, in which place he remained in his wilde passion, un∣till want of food and lodging, constrained him to turne his thoughts to consider his present necessi∣ty, and to that purpose resolved to seek some ha∣bitation, where he might receive entertainement, untill he could further dispose of his determina∣tion; since he found these fruitlesse sorrowes and distracted expressions, neither eased his griefe or profited his love. Wherefore after he had travel∣led three or foure dayes in the vast Forrest, with such provision only as he could get in poore and contemptible Cottages, as he past through a thick wood, which seemed to obscure a certaine Plaine
that lay beyond it, his melancholy eares of a sud∣den were saluted with a certaine kind of rude musick, that appeared also more confused, for that it was at many periods accompanied with the loud acclamations of common people. As this seemed a strange adventure to his imaginati∣on, after such an absolute silence for so many dayes in his solitary perambulation, where dole∣full ecchoes appeared to have beene in a manner his only companions; with the uncouth fall of waters from high and unaccessible precipices; so the unexpected newnesse againe of probability of humane conversation, put on a little his desire to be curious, though scarce was he willing to allow himselfe any content at all, since she that was the delight of his soule, had been forcibly separated from his sight; neverthelesse prosecu∣ting his intention, he directed his steps towards the place where he heard the noyse, through the intangled Bryers, and almost impassable bushes, which sufficiently moderated his haste, and pro∣tracted his march, yet at last with much paine, he arrived neere the outside of the wood, where he might perceive through the branches of the trees, in a spacious Plaine, a great many of Countrey people gathered about a little Altar, raised six steps above the ground; at which stood an old Priest offering sacrifice to the god Pun, as appea∣red by his statue placed upon certaine bases com∣posed of rough stone, and with more unpolished workmanship. This discovery invited Narcissus to attend the issue with silence, and the rather for that at every full point, and stop of the Priest in
his devotions, the multitude suddenly took hands in a joyfull agreement one with another, and danced many rounds, about the Image in a rurall manner, to the only Musicke of their untunable voyces, though a certaine ditty, which he could not understand by any words they uttered, appea∣red to expresse the intention of their mirth, though onely knowne to themselves in respect of the rudenesse of the language, and the harshnesse of the delivery. When Narcissus had a long time enterteined his wonder with the sight of this extraordinary pastime, desiring also to satisfie his understanding of the reason of their assembly, he approached nearer the company, with an intention to enquire of some standing by, not onely what the occasion might be of that solemnity, but how he should the readiest way find out the next convenient Towne to give him reception; And the oppor∣tunity fitted well with his desire; for the Priest having performed all the rights and ceremonies belonging to his office, was newly retired some distance from the multitude, to a small rising banke; as well to repose himselfe, as to be∣hold with greater conveniency the continued sport, wherein he seemed to have more then an ordinary interest, which made Narcissus quickly addresse himselfe to him with this courteous language. Father said he, I hope it is the custome in these parts, especially amongst those of your profession, not to take ill any curiosity of a stranger, that seekes civilly to be enformed as well in the man∣ners
of the Countrey where he passeth, as of a convenient place that may give him entertain∣ment: And that I may prevent your demand which I make no doubt will seem necessary to your judgement, be pleased to know that I am by birth of the Island of Cyprus, and intending a pil∣grimage to the Temple of Delphos, am by chance fallen into your company. The Priest seeing himselfe saluted by a young man, though in his own habit of such an excellent beauty, and so perfect a shape, presently not only rose up from his seat, to give him the more re∣spectfull welcome, but told him for his lodging the night to come, since the time of the day per∣haps might prevent him of a better conveniency, he should hold it an extraordinary honour, that his own poor habitation might performe the ser∣vice: and the rather as he said for that their pro∣fessions seemed to agree by the outward resem∣blance of the Robes. Narcissus was not much displeased with the offer, as well because he found himselfe something weary by reason of those extravagant and uncertaine journeyes he had made, as also that he might hope by this op∣portunity to get further information concerning his own resolutions, that yet he had not fully de∣termined. Wherefore after he had returned the Father a civill thankes for his favour, with an in∣timation he was willing to accept of his charita∣ble kindnesse, they both sate downe together up∣on the bankside, to behold the finishing of those rurall delights, that passionately seemed to im∣ploy the Countrey people, which gave occasion
to Narcissus to demand the reason of that extra∣ordinary mirth, that possessed the thoughts of the whole company. The Priest after he had a little smiled to thinke of the strangers apprehension, told him, since he perceived his curiosity went so farre as to be satisfied in those petty affaires, he would take the paines to let him know the origi∣nall that produced the effects, which as he said was the more proper for his entertainment; since the occasion at the present detained almost all Asia both in expectation and wonder; however he feared his story might be too tedious for his patience. But Narcissus seeming rather passionate at the satissaction then distasted at the offer; the Priest retired something further into the woods, to be more out of the noyse of the people, where after he had setled the strangers expectation to a silent attentivenesse, he began this discourse. Sir said he, you must be pleased to know that our King Euarchus grandmother called Minerva, (by whose right he came to weare all those Crownes he was once possessor of, and might still have enjoyed in a prosperous measure, if his for∣tunes had been equall to his goodnesse, or his Subjects loyaltie answerable to his own eminent worth) was a Princesse of such excellent vertues, that it had been a controversie between art and nature, whether had more bountifully contribu∣ted to the adorning of her royall person; how∣ever, she only raigned in Mysia, a Country not on∣ly barren in production of the fruits of the earth, but luxurious in the unfaithfulnesse of the peo∣ple, though her birth justly claimed the inheri∣tance
of this rich Kingdome of Lydia after our Queen then raigning here; I say this admirable Princesse had a base brother also, named Leonatus, who wanted not ambition enough to desire the Crowne of Mysia, though he were not furnished with sufficient vertues to merit such a dignity; and to this purpose left nothing unattempted that might either advance his own esteem or deprave his sisters actions; and to that end insinnated him∣self by all meanes possible, not only into the good opinion of the Lords, but much more into the fa∣vour of the common people; in which interim the young Princesse being furnished with youth and beauty, was perswaded by the chiefe nobility to thinke of a noble husband that might accom∣pany her in her conversation, and give the King∣dome a hope of posterity, two essentiall parts as they pretended of her own happinesse; in prose∣cution of this desire, there was presented unto her view a handsome Lord of this our Countrey of Lydia: in conclusion the nuptials were quickly solemnized to the appearing content of both par∣ties; and the rather for that the then Queene of Lydia was well satisfied with the choyce, not doubting to maintaine by this meanes a continual and strong interest in the Kingdome of Mysia, since she had married to the Princesse one of her own Subjects. But now Leonatus began to play his part; for finding this conjunction proved a bar to his pre∣tention for succession, he thought it his best way to establish himselfe notwithstanding, a certain pow∣er in the government, and to that purpose strived
by all meanes his malicious will could instruct, to gaine the good opinion of the young King, whereby to set him at difference with the Queen, who began to be a little distasted, to see his wife take upon her so absolute authority, he only bea∣ring the name of a Prince; which at last grew to such a height, by the underhand provocation of wicked Leonatus, that one day when the Queene (being great with child) was retired into her pri∣vate chamber, to conferre with a certain Secretary of State, most imployed in the Kingdomes af∣faires, her husband of a sudden rusht into her pre∣sence with his sword drawne, and there before her amazed eyes slaughtered her poore servant. However this was an act of some horrour to the great bellied Queen, and so consequently might be thought sufficient motives of her lasting indig∣nation, to see her selfe and authority so affronted by one she had lately raised from being a Subject to be her husband; yet religion and good nature proved so powerfull in her noble disposition, that upon the Kings sorrow and submission, she was content both to forgive the injury, and forget the dishonour by a perfect reconciliation. But Leonatus not weary yet of his own wickednesse, though despairing of his further ability to retain his interest with the young King, since the Queen as he thought had so absolutely circumvented him in that project, of a sudden stroake into friendship with certaine factious Priests, that had newly brought in a religion into Mysia, that taught this dangerous Doctrine; That Princes deserved no longer to governe, then whilst they con∣tented
the People. Which opinion you may very well imagine, took feelingly with the multitude, in so much as in a short time the Queen had im∣ployment enough, to defend her person from re∣proaches, as her Kingdome from civill warre; This exceedingly tormented her thoughts, untill the birth of her young sonne againe revived her spirits: however Leonatus still prosecuting his horrid designes to supplant the Queen in her just right, whereby to bring the government of the Kingdome under his own jurisdiction, one night secretly caused not only the young King to be cruelly murthered in his bed, in execution of his revenge, because he had quitted his party, but al∣so laid the bloudy slaughter, by way of private aspersions, upon the innocent and religious Queen, the more to bring her in hatred with the com∣mon people, who seemed already sufficiently poy∣soned, by the late pernicious doctrine brought in∣to the Countrey by the turbulent Priests: Al∣though these crafty practises had not as yet pow∣er to shake, or rather absolutely to destroy her grounded authority, which had been cast upon her by so rightfull a succession, yet by little and little they so wounded her reputation, that they made her desire to have a faithfull companion, to assist her in her government; which politick Leo∣natus perceiving, judging it a love passion in the Queen, put on some of the nobility underhand to perswade her, not only presently to marry, but to take for her husband a valiant Gentleman his intimate friend, who a long time had pretended unto her love, however he was not without some
suspition, that he had been an actor in the Kings death; with these baites I say Leonatus so farre intangled the Queenes innocency, that she was wonne by perswasion to make this election, being councelled thereunto by the chiefe nobility, set upon her to that purpose, though she first caused a decree to be past by the unanimous consent of all, that this Lord had been no way guilty, of the false aspersion his enemies had cast upon him, concerning the Kings murther. No sooner were these nuptials solemnized, which was the thing Leonatus desired, but secretly he admonished the new King to flye, assuring him as his friend, that either he would be suddenly slaine by many that had conspired his death, or publickly be appre∣hended and brought to his Tryall by the consent of the whole Kingdome; so that he, whether knowing himselfe faulty indeed, or fearing the power and injustice of his enemies, since emulati∣on amongst his equalls had procured him a world of envy, quickly followed his advice, and pri∣vately without the Queenes privity, quitted his Country and Fortunes. Leonatus conceiving now he had compassed the hardest part of his projects, sent secretly into Lydia to possesse the Queen there, with an assu∣rance of Minerva's guilt, since she had married the murtherer of her first husband; too apparent∣ly, as he pretended, discovered by his strange flight: at the same time also, by the help of his factious priests, he raised tumults against her, in her own kingdome, whereby she became impri∣soned, because she would not quit her govern∣ment.
This you may believe, gave the poore Queen sufficient imployment; insomuch as being wearied by continuall troubles, and invited to the Court of Lydia by her kinswomans promi∣ses for her better and quiet protection, she was content to resigne the Crown to her sonne, and accept of those offers she esteemed reall. But alas, no sooner was she arrived within the bounds of this kingdome of Lydia, but contrary to her expectation, wherefore amazed in the execution, instead of being admitted into the Queens pre∣sence with love and honour, she was commanded as a prisoner to a Castle not farre off; whilst in the mean time her young sonne was committed to the tuition of Leonatus her worst enemy; how∣ever with this pretention, that as soon as she could cleare her selfe of those aspersions and ac∣cusations that her subjects brought against her, she should enjoy those respects at Court which had been largely promised her; though in the interim she must be content with her fortune, since the State of Lydia thought it not fit for one in her condition, bespotted with the opinion of so black a crime, should have any correspon∣dence with their Queen, as 'twas pretended, of so bright a vertue; when the gods know, it was either the too much cleernesse of her own good parts, or the rightfulnesse of her title, being of a con∣trary Religion, that was the onely obstacle of her happinesse. But whilst Minerua under-went for many yeeres a hard imprisonment in Lydia, since the Queen her selfe was so farre from easing her of her bonds, as she would never give eare
to her complaints; the King her young sonne began to approach to mans estate, and that ma∣turenesse in age, gave him a feeling of his mo∣thers oppressions; but her enemies in Mysia be∣ing also backt from the States in these parts, who had an intention all they could to suppresse his greatnesse, that he might have no power to claim his right in the kingdome of Lydia, gave his thoughts and actions not onely continuall in∣terruptions, but at last imprisoned his very per∣son in his own kingdome. Notwithstanding all this, the wise King bore these insolencies with unexampled patience, knowing that as it was not in his power to free himselfe from their ty∣ranny by any Kingly pretention; so of the other side he hoped that factions amongst themselves would at last purchase his liberty. In this state he continued, untill his Guard found that it might be prejudiciall to his Titles in Lydia, after the old Queens death, to keep him thus as a pri∣soner, whereby they might also be debarred from a plentifull share of the gain, when Lydia by suc∣cession should fall to him; upon these considera∣tions, they of a sudden, not onely released him, from his confinement, but every one of these men themselves strived who might be most in his fa∣vour; when as he not onely as a good natured Prince, forgot all his injuries, but became suffi∣ciently pleased to be at liberty, upon any termes. But the old Queen of Lydia, drawing now to her last period, both of life and Kingdome; con∣ceiving it was reason sufficient for a just jealou∣sie, to have the heire apparant so neere her juris∣diction,
whom she imagined looked upon her continuance; like a young blossome, that strived to thrust out the ancient and withered flower from its stalke, began suddenly to question the poore Princesse (her selfe also being almost worn out by her hard usage) about her correspon∣dence with those forraine powers, who were of her kindred; And not content with any answer the truth of her proceedings could make, called her to her triall before ordinary Commissioners. As these might be evident marks of Minerva's ruine, so were they not undiscovered by the sharp apprehension of the wise Lady, though her spightfull fate, would not afford her preser∣vation, notwithstanding her excellent endow∣ments: yet as she had good cause, she excepted against those partiall Judges designed for her de∣struction, by all the pretentions that a free Prin cesse, or an opprest woman could alledge, though the Queen seemed as deafe to her just and reaso∣nable request, as her enemies were violently bent to satisfie their cruelties; untill in the end she was forced to desist from her importunities, and stick wholy to the confidence her goodnesse had me∣rited in God mercies. This not onely brought her to a judgement-seat, prepared with some outward circumstances fit to entertaine her dig∣nity, but to a condemnation prepared with cere∣mony, to bewitch the understanding of the com∣mon people, who rather desired to behold strange spectacles, then to be delighted in just actions; and in this May-game, as I may call it, of the worst cruelty, when the form of Law was
onely made use of to hide bad intentions, was this brave and religious Queen, as a period to all her fortunes, sentenced to lose her head. Not∣withstanding this condemnation, the Queen of Lydia for some time deferred the execution, con∣ceiving her own honour could not but suffer abroad, in the opinion of all other Princes, her equals, as her kinswoman in person did at home, under her jurisdiction. But ambition, jealousie, and revenge, at last got the victory over all her other vertues, by the malicious and crafty per∣swasions of Minerva's enemies; who believed, they could not be safe as long as she lived; since it was probable, if ever she came to weare the Crown of Lydia, she would alwaies be mindfull of their disaffections; these reasons procured the Queen underhand, to signe a warrant for Minerva's death, which by the Lawes of the Countrey could not else be taken away by any power; and with this authority a messenger presently was sent to the chief officer of the Pro∣vince, to give Minerva warning of her approa∣ching doom. When the sad Princesse beheld this bloudy character written with the royall hand of her neerest kinswoman, it was a question whether amazement or courage governed most in her noble thoughts; for as of one side she could scarce believe, that the Queen had been drawne to an act so prejudiciall to the honour of her Sex, so of the other side, she entertained the newes with a gentle smile, as a wished period of all her miseries, onely with three or foure deep sighes, she desired these requests of those commissioners
that had authority to see the sentence put in exe∣cation: First, that she might have all her ser∣vants about her at the time of her death, to beare true testimony to the world, that she neither stag∣gered in her religion, nor derogated from her sonnes honour: next that the Queen would be so charitable, as not onely quietly to suffer those that attended about her person in safety to quit the Kingdome, but to pay them their due wages, if not reward them according to the just service she had received: and lastly, that she might have a Priest of her own profession, to comfort and in∣struct her in her last suffering. To the first, they onely answered, that as they could not give her leave to have all her attendants about her for feare of tumults, by reason of their multitudes, so were they willing to allow her some few to satisfie her desire. For the second, they promised to be inter∣cessors to the Queen in her behalfe. But for the last, they absolutely refused her request, preten∣ding it would be a dishonour to the religion pro∣fessed in Lydia. With these answers Minerva re∣tired into her chamber, the better to prepare her religious thoughts against the next daies combate, where she remained all that night with so con∣stant a zeale to the worship of the gods, and so cheerfull a demeanor in the perswading of her servants to patience, by contemning of all world∣ly prosperity, that it was easily to be perceived, she rather entertained death as a kind friend, that intended to put her in possession of a better life, then as a fierce enemy that set before her imagina∣tion frights of a horrid destruction; Thus she con∣tinued
her imployment, untill the early morning, and watchfull cruelty brought to her chamber doore the instruments of her destruction: This warning was sufficient to make her prepare with Majesty, to act the last scene that should render her famous to posterity. Wherefore with a plea∣sant look, as if she intended to laugh at deathes worst shape, when she came out she bid the com∣pany good morrow, and then proceeded to the Scaffold with all the circumstances belonging to her dignity, that was covered over with blacke Velvet; where being set in her dismall Chaire of State, she told the spectators, that as they must not expect many words from her, in regard her sister the Queen of Lydia was not present, to whom she would only have directed a discourse; so of the other side, she wisht them all to beare witnesse, that she constantly expired in that religion she e∣ver profest to the world, for which she both did, and was joyfull to shed her best bloud, which be∣ing said, by one and one she took leave of her ser∣vants, who being over prest with griefe and teares were scarce able to performe their last though constrained duties to fit their glorious Mistresse for her execution; And with another sweet smile holding up her white hands to the omnipotent gods for mercy, not long after without the least unquiet motion, she received that fatall stroake that sent her soule to an eternall habitation. When this unexampled Tragedy became spread over Asia, which gave sufficient occasion of large discourses, it could not but with speedier wings flye to her Sons Court, with all the particular
circumstances of her death, where it rested untill an Ambassador from the Queen of Lydia was sent in some sort to lessen the fact, as being absolutely done without her privity, as he pretended, to which purpose some of her principall Councel∣lors had been punished: but this Balsame a long time had not power to heale the deep wound this apprehended cruelty had made in his dutifull bo∣some, untill his people finding that Myssia was not able to contend with Lydia in any revenge, and that the smallest attempt offered by way of force to vindicate his honour, might interrupt his quiet and peaceable succession to a Crowne so rich and flourishing, which ere long he could not by course of nature but expect, since the Queene was both old and decayed, not only disswaded him from any hostile evasion, but also counselled him to entertaine a firme correspondency with the State, he was to possesse; and the rather, for that the Lydian messenger threatned him with a legall deprivation from his royall right, by the consent of the whole Kingdome, by whose judg∣ment as he said, his mother had been condemned, if any way he stirred violently to disturbe the peace establisht in both Countries. These reasons I say render'd him as well satis∣fied in shew as in effect, who was esteemed ex∣treamly peaceable if not slothfull in his nature; which was the occasion, that as he could never be brought willingly to enter upon any actions of glory, so did it make him for the most part as it were a captive, to the pressing importunities of his covetous, and insolent Country men the Mys∣sians,
who scarce would be satisfied with any gaine or preferment whatsoever he could bestow upon them: But to be short, at last the old Queen of Lydia dying he without any contradiction, quickly took possession of her Kingdoms, in which government he continued with all the prosperity in the world during his life; but that finished, the Crownes of Lydia, Myssia, and Creet, descen∣ded by a just right upon his hopefull Son and Successor Euarchus, then newly married to Hya∣cinthia, Orsames sister, our now Queen, who en∣joyed also those possessions ( must needs say) with as much happinesse (untill these last stirres) as it was possible for mortality to expect. But the Myssians who as I said before received golden liberalities in the time of the old King, (he being a Prince that knew no way how to be provident) when they found that Euarchus nu∣merous issue, and the Queenes necessary expences did in a manner drowne all their expectation; first, began to mutter in words against the ac∣customed vanities of the times; and lastly they found fault that only smooth faced boys enjoyed, as they said, all the credit of the Court, when Souldiers and men of valour wanted both coun∣tenance and meanes to live, the King being so bewitched to his own ease, and his wives content, that he could not be drawne to helpe his own brother in law, against the oppression of the King of Armenia; by which warre many might be im∣ployed that now wanted subsistance: nor was there wanting in Lydia it selfe many factious spi∣rits, that not only received encomagement by this
bold language, who also coveted state preferment in the government of the Common weale; yet these begun discontents lay hid in the cinders of some duty, untill new taxations of the Subjects gave more desperate distastes; besides, the acci∣dentall arrivall of Prince Cassianus in Lydia after his Fathers death, stirred up the pride of one Di∣mogoras to a new spleen against the King, by which means he believed he should be the sooner imploy∣ed. But that which seemed most to contribute to Euarchus prejudice, was the sudden arrivall of an old Myssion Captaine out of the warres of Arme∣nia called Lycius, who having gained in those services good store of wealth, sued to the King to have himselfe rewarded by Titles of honour; which being denyed him by some neglect, as also Cassianus request for a competent assistance, a lit∣tle protracted, this insolent Commander quickly flew from the Court with execrations in his mouth, and malice in his heart; and comming into his own Countrey omitted no diligence that could withdraw the people from their lawfull obedience, which he had the better opportunity to effect, since he found not only the nobility am∣bitious, but the Priests violent. The one he per∣swaded with brave spirits againe to looke upon the courage of their Ancestors, who had by force of Armes torne priviledges from their King; the other he admonished to cast their thoughts upon the recovery of that religion now almost lost, that had formerly chaced their former Queen both from her Kingdome and life; and for the com∣mon people it was sufficient ro plead to their ima∣ginations
liberty; by whose perswasion the nobi∣lity not only raised a power absolutely to con∣temne the Kings authority, in their own Country of Myssia, but also led a great Army into Lydia, whereby to compell Euarchus to summon the great Councell of the Kingdome. To be short, when this eminent assembly was met, as it was designed in the City of Sardis, which was also assured to be made a free Towne (as much as to say, as not to be compelled to any o∣bedience to Euarchus and his posterity) the chie∣fest discourses that were made there, were in dis∣grace of the Kings actions, and almost all the Acts that past were to destroy his authority: All which the milde King suffered with a world of pati∣ence, hoping that time, after they had wearied themselves with their violent passions, would let them see their own mistakes, or the gods at least∣wise would defend his innocency: however these unexpected proceedings not only continued, but their rage grew to such a height against his person whereby as 'twas thought to bring him into the greater contempt amongst the common people, that by divers tumults countenanced in the multi∣tude, he was at last forced from the City of Sar∣dis, whilst the Senate in the interim iustituted a strong guard of Souldiers of the Towne Forces, to wait upon their Councels, because they would shew to the Subjects, greater markes of Soveraign∣ty in their Assembly, then in the Kings dignity. But whilst many were brewing their own pas∣sionate designes with uncredible insolency, being chiefly supported by the votes of the common
people, who were perswaded they should recover by their authority an absolute liberty, the poore King with a very small traine retired to the City of Theatyra: where however, contrary to the expectation of the Senate, who believed that their discountenance, was sufficient to render him a∣bandoned by the whole Kingdome, he not onely received better welcome, but was entertained with the generall commiseration of most of those parts, who bitterly complained of his hard and as they thought unjust usage; and the rather did this pitty prevaile for that by his eloquent and fluent Pen, he seemed fully to beat back all the as∣persions his enemies sought daily to cast upon him, which brought as I say to his Court multi∣tudes of gentry and nobility, both from the City of Sardis and other parts, who vowed perpetuall faithfulnesse to his person, with other essentiall services. These encouragements by the perswasion of his trusty Councellors, made him imploy his best in∣dustry to raise Souldiers, whilst in the interim he sent to the Queen, whom he understood was in the Island of Cyprus, to procure him Armes, by the credit she had purchased with the Duke of that Country, since the Senate had already seized up∣on all his Magazin and ships: After which he went from one Province to another, to feele the inclination of the people; yet as he found most of them for him in their words when he was amongst them; whether out of the inconstancy of their own natures, or unwilling to be at any charge to maintaine new troubles; as soone as he left them
personally, they were for the greatest number car∣ried from their former professions, so that he per∣ceived the successe of his whole fortunes, was chiefly to depend upon the gallantry of the better sort. And truly this expectation did not deceive him; for in a short space, beyond all beliefe they so furnished him with moneys, besides their own attendance; that he became master of a brave Ar∣my commanded by his nephew Prince Thyasmus, who was newly arrived in his Campe from the Armenian warres. The Senate, who before had raised Forces to contend against the Kings intentions, according to the intelligence they had received not to be sloathfull in their affaires, quickly created Dimo∣goras generall in the designe, whom they knew was a man never to be reconciled to his Sove∣raigne, by reason of the spightfulnesse of his own violent ambition; no sooner was he establisht in his office, but he was commanded to march, as they pretended to separate the King from perni∣tious Councels, and bring him safe to Sardis, there to be better governed; to which purpose that City had plentifully furnished money, concei∣ving their prosperity depended upon their Prin∣ces ruine. This resolution was quickly knowne to Euar∣chus, and not long after considered by his Coun∣cell that it was high time to advance with the whole Army, to try the fortune of a battell with the Senates Generall, since the King wanted pro∣vision, and could not expect supplies of money to furnish out the necessary expence: with this de∣termination
after two or three dayes march, they met the Senates forces upon an ample Plaine, spacious enough to have desided the controversie for the worlds Empire: the conflict of a sudden grew so desperate, that it was a question whether they sought more to satisfie their own spleenes, or to gaine a beneficiall Victory; which however was prosecuted for some houres with doubtfull fortune; for although the Kings horse comman∣ded by Thyasnius in person, at the first charge de∣feated their enemies, in so much as for many Fur∣longs, they had the chace of their Troops, yet the Foot Forces in their absence, that for the most part wanted armes, had sufficient imployment to sustaine the fury of the Senates Souldiers, being better provided: which however was bravely supplyed by the noble valour of the King him∣selfe, in so much as he sustained the violence of the tempest, untill his own horse again came into his rescue, though with such a slaughter of his poor Subjects, that it created a passionate com∣passion in his royall breast, although the determi∣nable fate of his Crowne might very well have given a full imployment to his thoughts: Upon Thyasmus appearing with his victorious Troopes, Dimogoras retired with his worsted Forces, and the night hindred further prosecution for the pre∣sent, which as I may say, enviously shaddowed the Kings glory, who else could not have been defrauded as 'twas thought of a most absolute Conquest to his immortall honour, if not to his Kingdoms prosperity. However he resolved the next morning early,
againe to set upon his enemies, who were retired for their better safety, within the protection of their secure Trenches; but contrary to his ex∣pectation Dimogoras (belike fearing Euarchus in∣tention, and unwilling to hazzard the Senates for∣tunes in one doubtfull adventure) had made use of the darke coverture of the night, to convey himselfe and his whole Forces, to a strong Towne not farre off, remaining under his jurisdiction: Neverthelesse, so much opinion this halfe Con∣quest got amongst the common people, that many Cities presently returned under the obedieuce of their lawfull Prince, whilst in the meane time, the King made Philadelphia the chiefe residence of his Royall Court, where againe he began to rule like a Monarch, and suffered his other Generals in many parts of the Kingdome, to prosecute his commands with such prosperous successe, that in a short space he became in a manner master of all Lydia, though the great Towne of Sardis seemed still with most obstinate pride to contemne his power, being more in love with that passion, that made them hope to be a free City, and the cove∣tousnesse to obtaine that money they had disbur∣sed, then mindfull of their own safety and obedi∣ence. The King who began to thinke now the difficulty of his affaires were past all danger, be∣gan a little to play with the weaknesse of his ene∣mies, in so much as his Souldiers became neg∣lected in their discipline, as the commanders li∣centious in their course of life, which certainly contributed extreamely to all his misfortunes: for being provoked either by unwise, if not Traite∣rous
Councell, or put on by his own just spleen, to see himselfe in the height of all his Victories disobeyed by weake Forces, suddenly besieged a small City that lay in the very heart of his new Conquests, conceiving his enemies wanted power of refistance, or at least ability to bring him any incommodation, which made his Troopes lesse carefull to prevent correspondency; But the Towne finding it could not hold out long against so strong a siege, gave private intelligence to the Citizens of Sardis, who apprehending the losse would absolutely turne to their ruine, since the King would be sure, as they believed, after to im∣ploy the rest of his endeavour in their subversion, when he should have finished the designe in hand that only opposed him, of a sudden sent out un∣der the command of Dimogoras the Souldiers of Sardis it selfe, that untill then were never known to remove many Furlonges from the smoake of their own chimneyes, to try if it were possible to raise the Kings siege; and with as quick an expe∣dition as they were able, marched towards the Campe, imagining that the successe of this voyage was to determine their fates, whether to remaine free Citizens, or become conquered slaves. Euar∣chus when he heard of this new and unexpected supply, so much contrary to his imagination, however rumours thereof had formerly come to his eares, thought it his best course, rather to fight with them in the open Fields, then in con∣tinuing in his Trenches, to hazard the danger of being starved for want of provision: with these purposes, after he had quitted the Walls of the
Towne, he advanced towards their quarters, with a hope to set upon them in the plain Champaine, since he conceived he had much the advantage of horse, though his foot was of a farre lesse number. But though the King omitted no industry to com∣passe his designe, yet being betrayed by the com∣mon people in his intelligence, who ever favoured the Senate more then their Soveraigne, Dimogoras got some dayes journey towards the City of Sar∣dis, before Euarchus knew of his remove; the de∣signe of the Generall being no other, now he had freed the City from danger, but to get againe safe with his whole Army to the place from whence he came: The King as he was enraged with this secret escape, so was he resolved if it were possible to fight with him upon any termes, since the con∣trary as he imagined, would prove in the opinion of the multitude of no lesse a consequence, then a Victory obtained by his adversaries: To that ef∣fect, as soone as he had overtaken his enemies by tedious marches, he set upon them with despe∣rate inconveniences, not only for that they had locked themselves in inclosed Countries, but ne∣ver came out of their Trenches to skirmish, by which meanes the Kings Cavalry proved of no service; so that as I may say by reason of these unfortunate disadvantages, Euarchus after twelve houres fight could pretend but to a very small Victory; which successe returned Dimogoras to the City of Sardis with some honour, in regard that however he had not beat the Kings Forces, it might be said upon the matter he had worsted his designes.
Neverthelesse, although this gave the Generalls party not only encouragement for the present, but hopes in abundance in the future; especially for that the Kings Souldiers every where; began both to be negligent and treacherous; more seeming to rely upon the supposed justnesse of the cause, then resolving constantly to defend it by any haz∣zard, yet the Senate at Sardis doubting some∣thing their own fortune or successe, notwithstan∣ding what policy soever they could use in the Kings Campe, resolved againe to bring in the Myssians into Lydia with a powerfull Army: To this purpose they made a contract with them, not only to pay them a very great sum of money, both to defray their charges and reward their en∣deavours, but also promised to establish in the Kingdome of Lydia it selfe, the same manner of worship of the gods as was practised in Myssia: As this seemed in effect to be the whole agreement between them; so the Myssians wanted not in their meaning, underhand designes, which was to beare at leastwise an equall share in the govern∣ment of both Kingdomes, whereby the better to satisfie their pride and avarice; for the latter which as 'twas said they would have sold the gods themselves, if they had been upon the earth ven∣dible. By this meanes againe Euarchus became invol∣ved in new troubles; for presently after the Mys∣sians having made this unhandsome accord to the Kings disadvantage, notwithstanding their so many vowes and promises to the contrary, there was imployed at the same time an Ambassadour
from the Kingdome of Syria to Euarchus, not only to perswade him to entertaine a new Treaty and friendship with his Senate sitting at Sardis, but also absolutely to break all correspondency and friendship between himselfe and the State of Egypt; which being condescended unto by the King he undertooke, as well to keep back the Myssians from entring Lydia, as to settle an abso∣lute peace in all the rest of his dominions: whe∣ther these were only brags or no is altogether un∣certaine; rather may it be thought, either the Kings Fate or unhappy Councell, thrust him on upon those wayes, that were most prejudiciall to his affaires: in conclusion he did not only deny the Ambassador the least entertainment of these propositions, but at the same time also was per∣swaded to publish a declaration against the City of Sardos; though at present it seemed to con∣tend with the Senate, about the payment of that money promised to the Myssians, in recompence for their expedition into Lydia. This I must needs say, so much exasperated the Towne, that pre∣sently they went on with their accord by the ge∣nerall consent of all: when these summes were received, presently the Myssians marched into the Country with a huge Army, whilst another was sent with Dimogoras against the Kings own per∣son: As by this meanes Euarchus was constrained to divide his Forces, so he sent the greatest part of his Army along under the command of Thyas∣mus his Nephew, for the necessary raising of the siege before the City of Theatyra, where the Mys∣sians were already incamped, however their
power was encreased with such Troopes, as the Senate had commanded to joyne with them in that service: Prince Thyasmus upon his approach (whether being as I may say too precipitate in his conduct, or that he was betrayed absolutely in his intelligence) when he came neere the Towne, thinking either to surprize or defeat the enemy in an instant, of the contrary suddenly he became involved in a most desperate Ambuscado, which in a manner destroyed the persons or the courages of his whole Army, though in truth the Myssians performed the least part of the service: But the King being followed and furiously attempted in his march as I said by Dimogoras, he kept himself and Troopes (though fewer by many in number) upon such sure and couragious grounds, that the Generall at last was brought into so many despe∣rate inconveniences, by reason of his want of con∣duct and providence, that although Euarchus at that time fought not one stroake, he was forced to compound for the lives and liberties of all his Souldiers, which was an occasion that presently turned out Dimogoras out of his office, whilst in the interim there was put into his place one Farezius, whose melancholly valour in a very short time prevailed exceedingly, for that the Myssians had caused the King to divide his Forces into so ma∣ny severall commands, that he could not conve∣niently maintaine a considerable body together under any Captaine, to be able to contend with power sufficient: wherefore after some Councell taken with his best friends, the King resolved himselfe in person, to endeavour to stop the fury
of this new and prevailing Generall, that seemed like an outragious Torrent, to carry all before him, whether he marched against Townes or Armies. The King besides the inflammation of his own naturall courage, was put on to fight with Fa∣rezius, as 'twas thought upon these reasons: first to prevent a conjunction between him and the Myssians, who were as yet at some distance: next to continue a life in his own party, that seemed something to decline his assistance in many pla∣ces of the Kingdome, in regard of the others ex∣traordinary successe: And last of all, for that both money and other provisions failing, he began to contract many necessities in his army: It was not long before they both met upon a large Plaine in an open Countrey, that afforded roome enough for an equall contention, if the Fates had at all proved indifferent in the encounter; The first charge was given with fury sufficient by both sides, however the Kings horse without any known cause whatsoever of a sudden gave back, and not long after most shamefully turned their backs, though the foot with incredible gallan∣try, still continued the fight with honour and safety: Euarchus upon this (however not being so much amazed as displeased) presently rid a∣mongst the flying Troopes; as it were calling both gods and men to witnesse, concerning the justnesse of his cause, and the unfainednesse of his intentions; withall perswading them either to shew more courage or lesse disloyalty: not onely in his words, but by his own unexampled cou∣rage,
evidently expressed before their faces, he conjured them to fight, or at leastwise to stand their ground at some distance, whilst he and the rest exposed their lives to the fury of the enemy; calling them sometimes his country men and subjects; otherwhile he termed them no better then unworthy slaves, that precipitately followed their own destruction and captivity; when as they had a faire occasion offered them to be both glorious and happy: but at last seeing nothing would prevaile, he looked up to heaven with tears in his eyes, beseeching that the gods would take pitty on him in his necessities, at leastwise prove propitious to the Monarchy of Lydia, that see∣med absolutely to depend upon this dayes adven∣ture: Thus between praying, fighting, and per∣swading, he continued, untill he saw most of his Souldiers either taken or slaughtered: so that at last, being constrained with a very few number in his company to quit the Field, he left his Campe to the courtesie of the enemies mercy, whilst by obscure passages he got againe safe in person (though much in his thoughts dejected) to the strong Towne of Philadelphia, where not long after by the whole power of Farezius, he was be∣sieged with the rest of his Court, friends, and family. As this, said he, was the proceeding of that fatall day, so may I suppose by the dispersing of the most part of the company, it will be also time for us to retire: so taking Narcissus by the hand, he promised he should have the rest of his discourse at home.
His house was seated at the end of a small town, only divided by a pleasant grove of wood, that encompassed a round Temple, built with Jonick Columns; within which was the statue of Apollo: when they had performed some few devotions, according to the manner of the country, amongst other Priests of their own order that remained in the place, the old father led him to his habitati∣on; being entered into the Parlour, he presently shewed him the picture of Euarchus, which for some time he had kept as he said in an obscure corner of his house, though now he seemed to expect more freedome; whereupon he began to read a lecture concerning his life and disposition: which gave him an occasion to discourse in this manner: The father of Euarchus our now King, being a Prince wholly given as I may say to his own pleasure, only studied wayes to keep himselfe du∣ring his life in a quiet security: & to this purpose he not only brought up his sonne, after the death of his elder brother in learning and domestick exercises, under the protect of his own eye and ju∣risdiction, but when he came to yeares of con∣sent, he endeavoured with some violence, to marry him to the King of Aegypts daughter, by whose greatnesse he thought to establish his owne re∣gall power the better in Lydia, perceiving his subjects were apt enough upon all occasions, to kick against his authority: But finding the Treaty was protracted, he sent his son in person with an intimate favourite of his, into Africa to court the young Lady: To be short the journey produced
no effects at all answerable to his desires: for the two favourites of each Prince clashing together, although a certaine day was appointed for the marriage, yet the match broake, though upon what grounds I neither know, or can well dis∣pute: after this breach Euarchus made presently his addresse to Hyacinthia our now Queen, being sister to Orsames King of Syria, esteemed a most mortall enemy to the greatnesse of the Kingdome and Monarchy of Aegypt: no sooner was this match concluded, but the old King dyed, leaving young Euarchus to inherit in outward appearance, as much glory and prosperity, as was possible to be enjoyed by mortality upon earth; and so con∣tinued for many years, untill these late unhappy difference obstructed his felicity: which truly I must the rather bewaile, in regard that he is a Prince given to no manner of vice: however per∣haps some will say, he is more beholding to na∣ture for his inclination, then to resolution for his temperance, unto which I must needs answer, that as the world ought not to take any notice of the inward thoughts of man, when people receive a generall commodity by the outward expressions of vertues; so of the other side, when good and laudable actions are accompanied with an entire justice in appearance, it is unpossible but either the gods have placed such upon earth, to become rare examples for imitation to others, or else have or∣dained them to be extreamely beneficiall to them∣selves; so that both wayes deserve singular coun∣tenance and preservation: and this without any partiality, may be said to be the right character
of the disposition of Euarchus: now for his active parts, that are and have been obvious to all the world; no man can accuse him of cruelty or pride: his deare affections to his wife and chil∣dren, are beyond the patterne of all his predeces∣sors: his activity and solicitation almost not to be imitated: his moderation in Dyet and Appa∣rell, scarce equals any of his subjects: if his par∣cimony can be imputed to him for a fault, let his numerous issue, and the small extent of his own revenues, make for him at leastwise a probable, if not a sufficient excuse: besides, and over and a∣bove these specified vertues, I must commend his discreet valour, and entire patience, since as in the one he never declined any engagement, when the necessity of his fortune, did any way stand in need of the demonstration of his courage, so did he never yet appeare overcome by passion, when he tasted the greatest bitternesse of what affliction soever: with these words the Priest, as if he had been transported with the very apprehension of his suffering, seemed to end his discourse both in tears and sighes; and certainly had so continued for a long space in a certaine kinde of extasie, if an old woman and a little youth (the whole family with himselfe of his private habitation) had not interrupted his sorrowfull contemplation, by bringing into the Parlour Wine and other junkets to entertain Narcissus, who notwithstanding, after he had tasted sufficiently of that civility, put him in mind againe of his promised relation in the field, which was to make an end so farre of his in∣formation, concerning King Euarchus fortunes,
that he might be instructed in the reasons of the joyfull assembly of the people, dancing about the Altar and Statue of god Pan. The Priest, after he had acknowledged in some sort his own digressions from the matter intended, he let him know that as it was no part of his mea∣ning to deprive him of his due, according to his own obligation, so he desired him to excuse his passion in the Kings behalfe, occasioned only by the sight of the picture that suddenly brought into his mind a certaine kind of representation of his heroicall vertues, proceeding from his nature and education: whereupon presently leading Nar∣cissus into his Garden furnished him with many dainty flowers of all sorts, in wch curiosity he see∣med to take an extraordinary delight, at last they both seated themselves in one of the Arbours, neatly contrived to defend the inward part of the habitation from Phoebus oppression, which affor∣ded a sufficient conveniency for discourse, and that joyned with the opportunity, quickly entered him into his new relation after this manner. Euarchus said he, being as I told you retired to Philadelphia after the Battle, as soon as he came into the Towne, he went presently to his Garden without speaking one word to any person, al∣though many Troopes followed him with passion to know some particulars concerning his fortunes, the rather for that they conceived themselves al∣so to be sufficiently interested in his fate; There he walked with a quick pace according to his custome, sometimes casting his arme abroad, and otherwhiles againe beating his breast with no
small violence; then would he look up to the heavens, as if a little he accused the gods determi∣nations, to suffer him that intended nothing but justice and goodnesse, to be so cruelly persecuted by his owne Subjects, without any known cause whatsoever; so that in truth the whole company with teares in their eyes, began more to consider his inward sufferings, then their own outward state and condition: thus I say he continued, un∣till Prince Thyasmus, his unfortunate Nephew (who not long before had retired thither with his beaten and scattered Troopes) came also with a few Attendants into the Garden: when he had saluted the King with a sad look (walking with him in that manner two or three turnes) he at last humbly desired him to let the company under∣stand a little of his unfortunate passages, since they could not be worse as he said then they imagined them to be, and for ought they knew they might be better then they supposed: the King went pre∣sently and seated himselfe upon a Bench, whilst all the company flockt about him, though he only made a discourse to them in this nature: Gentlemen, said he, you now behold Euarchus tumbled from his Throne: it is apparant the gods are displeased with our actions; neither doe I well know what will become of this unfortu∣nate Kingdome, for however they punish and de∣monstrate their indignation oftentimes by evill and wicked instruments, yet they never shew their displeasure and indignation, but where of∣fences are apparant enough to deserve that cha∣stizement: whether these faults (for which for
the present we are scourged) abound most in my own Court, or the poyson hath too much dilated it selfe over all my dominions I will not say; on∣ly sure we are, that sinnes of all sorts are encreased in such a measure, that it is probable the gods no longer could abstain from demonstrating the very height of their fury and wrath; I could be con∣tented to suffer for you all, so that would be suffi∣cient to pay the score of our obligations, we owe the heavens justice for our crimes; but I feare me we are designed to be more generally involved, whereby to satisfie the divine exasperated indig∣nation, who can be no more cozened in its know∣ledge then restrained in its power? In my opinion the best way is, instantly to take asunder by way of profitable consideration all our particular acti∣ons and thoughts; and so by wholsome, and true repentance if it be possible to give some stop to the furious Torrent of our misfortunes, before they come to such a Sea of confusion, that necessa∣rily a generall destruction must follow: when I consider the pride, covetousnesse, and dissimulati∣on of my own family, I am partly convinced in my thoughts, that the ills we have suffered, whol∣ly proceed from that originall: againe, when I look upon the disobedience, luxury, and atheisme of the whole Kingdome, I may suppose from the peoples impieties have come our misfortunes: If I have been too blame for either, I must rather implore the gods pardon for my omissions, then overmuch accuse my own intentions that made them so; since however my nature may be too passively indulgent in such particulars, yet my
disposition was not at all, prone to give them al∣lowance and approbation: I must confesse I can∣not altogether free my selfe from every imputa∣tion, that hath been cast upon my government; for it is no small fault to be remisse in punish∣ments, where crimes may be encouraged to exam∣ple; though much more to be countenanced in oppression: And where inferiour officers are per∣mitted though not commanded to be unjust, the Prince ought to beare a share in the active part, for that he had the power to have restrained the mischiefe; which perhaps is the occasion of my present suffering with the rest of my Subjects, and what more indignation the gods have in store, I cannot be certaine to prevent; only I am confi∣dent, without a deep examination of our inward thoughts, the conscience will not be sufficiently understood, whereby to be cleere in any kinde to purpose, however our principles may be right and good, for without it, neither sorrow nor satis∣faction can follow of any considerable value to blot out the remembrance of such evils, and so consequently a continuation of the punishment due to the nature of our offences will not be ta∣ken away. It is not enough to say our enemies want justice and legality in their prosecution, for that they may be made for the present only de∣vine revengers, though themselves be reserved for a higher and more exemplary torments: for how∣ever actions of prosperity and successe, be not al∣wayes markes of favour and approbation, yet ought they justly be esteemed testimonies of di∣stast against those Nations, and such persons that
unfortunately are rendred Subjects of misery and chastizement, since none ever suffers without a cause: when revolutions happen (if we would but seriously enough looke after the reason) in the generall we should find, matter sufficient to convince our beliefe, that we are not totally inno∣cent almost in any particular; when as the gods are oftentimes accustomed to preserve the whole, for their sakes, that may pretend justly to any thing extraordinary: No my friends, this King∣dome hath been for some yeares past, involved in too much superfluity, to expect long a continua∣tion of their felicity; which no doubt made us too unmindfull from whence proceeds originally all good and commodity: when peace and tran∣quillity exceedingly abound in any region, with∣out being at all bridled and restrained, by volun∣tary temperance and consideration, there is no∣thing to be expected soon after but captivity or destruction, to recall againe mens thoughts and actions to moderation, necessary for a new settle∣ment and preservation: this world was created but as the tryer and touchstone of our dispositions for the better establishment of our eternall condi∣tion hereafter, since otherwise certainly it had not been made at all: In this consists the only mi∣stake of mankind; that we look at present as essen∣tiall acquisitious belonging properly to our per∣sons, without any relation to the future, when as they are I say intended either as accidentall bene∣fits, or naturall consolations, necessary in some sort for our temporary subsistance: if we be great, mighty, and prosperous, we expect ease,
pleasure, and observance, as meere duties that should attend us, instead of making our thoughts thereby become more gratefull, humble, and soli∣citous in all our endeavours, not only to augment vertue and purchase grace, but to distribute our endeavours also by charity and reason, to those that are more indigent upon earth: what a King or commander hath in honour and power, should be imployed in care and industry for the generall good: and if a begger or inferiour per∣son wants in riches and prosperity, it ought to be supplyed by being free from hazzard and pertur∣bation: by which meanes all sorts of people may participate in a kinde of an equality, according to the intention of their first creation; since the gods certainly intended no absolute difference but what their inscrutable decrees have determi∣ned in the future, answerable to the endeavours of every one in particular: for however the things belonging to this life sometimes may vary by way of accident in the world, yet the reasonable and more noble part of man, should be alike free in every one of us by the same rule of estimation and pretention. This consideration makes me at present looke upon my selfe and you in this com∣mon misery, with the same eyes of pity and com∣miseration: wherefore being determined to call my own thoughts to a most strict account, what I have acted, and how I may suffer; so would I have you also examine your consciences, wherein you have offended, and in what nature you may be remedied; by this meanes, if it be yet possible to procure some mercy from the gods in our
pressing necessities; These I say are intentions not onely most pious, but extreame safe: with these words he instantly rose from his seat, and retired into his private chamber, that not onely forced teares but occasioned discourse from most of the company. But whilst the King, and the Inhabitants of Phi∣ladelpha with desparing thoughts, were busily im∣ployed about the better fortifying of the Towne, against the expected siege of Farezius, who every day was looked for which his Troops to attempt the same (though most part of them intended, rather to mend their conditions by yielding at last upon milder termes, then entertained in their hopes any probability of prevailing against his Forces) of a sudden the Myssians fearing lest they might be deceived in their expectations, both in the money they expected from the Senate, as also concerning an equall share in the government of the Kingdome of Lydia, for that they had procu∣red, to themselves and nation in the Battles, ra∣ther contempt for the little valour they had shewed, then any way gained credit in the Warres, besiedged another Towne belonging to the Kings party, not yet reduced under the Senates juris∣diction; where however they had continued for some weekes, yet at length they were beaten off both with losse and disgrace; in so much as then not knowing well how to play their Cards with any advantage, they began as their last refuge, not onely publikely to dispute the Kings Titles, whom as they pretended the Senate had oppressed beyond their intentions; but imployed the inte∣rest
of a certaine Ambassador of Syria in their Army, to perswade Euarchus, if it were possible to make an escape from the City of Philadelpha, whereby to put his person into their hands, pro∣mising in the interim his hopes, both present safety and future prosperity, as people being (as they said) his own native country-men, who in∣tended his condition nothing but good and ad∣vantage by their assistance according to his owne desire. The King having received this comfortable message, which pretended a lucky Omen as he imagined to the rest of his occasions, notwith∣standing Farezius had newly besieged Philadel∣phia, one day he called me privately into his Bed∣chamber: when he had made fast the doore with a certaine kinde of extraordinary earnestnesse in his countenance, according to the manner he used in any thing he went about (being in truth a Prince, that is not only sollicitous in his thoughts but indefatigable in his paines and actions) he told me, that as he had a secret of much conse∣quence to impart unto me, so was he affraid left it should come to the knowledge of any that were not intended to be imployed in the businesse, doubting he had so many Traytors attending a∣bout his person, that it was impossible almost, for any designe to be put in execution, without the Senates privity and knowledge: wherefore though he were sufficiently confident of my fide∣lity, by reason of the long experience he had had of my service, and the tryall he had experimented of my honesty and religion, yet for that one or
two more were necessarily to be used in the same adventure, he resolved to exact from me, not only my faithfull promise, but a religious oath, con∣cerning the performance of my trust tending to his commands: after I had assured him by verball protestations, that I would be ready to lay downe my life in any thing his Majesty should think me capable, either of acting or suffering for his ad∣vantage, he made me presently kneele downe be∣fore the Statue of Iupiter, which he had alwayes standing in his chamber: and where most com∣monly he made his own morning prayers: there most solemnly I renewed those undertakings: af∣ter which he discovered unto me his designes, which was in a disguised habite as my servant to passe through Farezius campe in my company, and so privately to convey himselfe into the Mys∣sian Army, whither as he told me he had beene lately envited, with assurance of their assistance towards his prosperity and protection: although I must confesse I was not much enamoured of the project, knowing the base esteemed falshood of that people, yet lest the King might suspect any unwillingnesse in my disposition, to hazzard my person in his service, I durst neither open my thoughts, or deliver my opinion, although per∣haps I might have shewed him some reasons, that would have procured alteration; however I knew of the other side, his straights and necessities were sufficiently pressing in regard of the siege, to cause him almost, to venture upon what desperate de∣signe whatsoever: in conclusion I undertooke to provide within three dayes space, both horses
and other conveniences to that purpose, whilst the King in the interim writ a Letter with some few directions to his Nephew Prince Thyasmus, whom he had lately made Governour of Phila∣delpha, which was to render the Towne to the enemy after such a time mentioned, with the best conditions he could make for himselfe, a consi∣deration also being had both of his Court and friends: besides he directed other writings to his eldest Son Arethusius, who remained then in the farthest part of the Kingdome, attended by some few Forces of his own, to transport himselfe with all expedition to his mother the Queen, to whose commands he wished him to be obsequious in eve∣ry thing that concerned all their affaires; she be∣ing in truth not only a Lady he loves beyond mea∣sure: but whose birth and interest may procure him assistance. To be short, within three daies time I had pro∣vided all things necessary for the Kings journey: To this purpose he was clothed after the manner of the Grecian slaves, who are accustomed to be imployed about servile works in the field; onely he had over his under apparrell, a blew mantle with short and large sleeves: he wore upon his head a high bonnet in colour red, with three or four feathers taken from a cocks taile: upon his legs were fastned certaine black buskins of lea∣ther, with buckles; betimes in the morning we issued out of the Town both on hors-back, my servant riding before a great bag that was oyled all over to prevent the prejudice of raine, since I had put some necessary accommodations for
our voyage therein; however nothing at all that could be any way suspicious, although it might be our fortunes to be taken by the enemy, which in truth so fell out accordingly: for passing through the first watch, we were not onely com∣manded to stand, the souldiers presently deman∣ding of us from whence wee came, but also as suspicious persons we were carried before an Officer of the Army to be examined: I did not deny but that I came out of the Town of Phila∣lelpha; however I told them, that as I was onely there by accident, to visit some friends and dis∣patch other necessary businesses, with certain schollers that lived in the Academy, who med∣led with nothing but what concerned their stu∣dies, so was I againe repairing to the City of Sardis, where for the most part I remained, be∣ing by profession a Priest that observed the Mys∣sian rights in my ordinary sacrificing to the gods. This smooth tale I had hoped would have freed me presently; yet they kept us all that day and the next night, with a pretention the gene∣rall was not at leasure, without whose discharge and allowance (as they said) we could neither passe, or be at liberty: tis true, their chiefe in∣tention was to get money from us; but I must confesse I durst not overbountifully offer them any, in regard it would have given the more occasion of jealousie and suspition: Neverthe∣lesse, notwithstanding they seemed to detaine me as a prisoner, yet I got leave for my servant, to be in some sort free in the camp, whereby to have the conveniency (as I pretended) to provide
some accommodation necessary for the horses, who in that office performed his duty so dili∣gently, that I must tell you he was constrained all night to lie in the open field, without any coverture whatsoever over his body, though in truth it proved to be a very tempestuous season: in this manner we were perplexed between feare and suffering, however I must confesse I little doubted the Kings discovery; not onely in re∣spect of his habit, but that he had also shaved his beard in a most antick fashion. In conclusion the good humour of the Generall the next day, or rather the Souldiers finding there was but lit∣tle to be got from us, not onely discharged me from my further attendance, but gave a Passe for me and my servant to travell freely to the City of Sardis, without any let or hindrance from any of their party; which proved to be of no small conveniency unto us in all our journey: for although the protection onely mentioned that Town, where we least intended to goe, yet as soon as I was out of the camp, I so finely men∣ded the writing with my own pen, that I made it most aptly serve for every place and region; in so much as by reason thereof in our journey, we were neither letted nor troubled to any pur∣pose, having a discharge presently amongst all manner of Officers of theirs, as soon as we pro∣duced the paper, when as without doubt other∣wise we had been infallibly taken and imprisoned, since those parts where we travelled, were be∣come extream suspicious by order from the Se∣nate, in regard of the Declarations of the Myssians,
of purpose so commanded, the better as they thought to prevent all entercourse and corre∣spondency between the Kings party and the peo∣ple of that Nation. In this manner at last we arrived in the Myssian camp, and with a great satisfaction (I must needs say) to the Kings thoughts, however his reso∣lutions were not presently to discover his person; so that retiring into a little Village not very farre from the Army, he sent me (after I had taken some small refreshment) to enquire for the Syrian Ambassadour, upon whose score he rather see∣med to have put his undertaking this dangerous adventure, then upon any absolute confidence he could have in the Myssians fidelity, in regard that they had already so often deceived him with their faire promises and false actions; it was my part, in complements to tell him as much, after I had made him acquainted with the Kings ar∣rivall. As the Ambassadour appeared somewhat amazed at the newes, so did he not stick to assure me, that he knew his Majesty would be received by the Army with all honour and safety, and presently went along with me to finde him out. The King after some few civilities, used this language to the Ambassador. Sir, said he, as you now see me in a posture far below my birth and dignity, so the gods, to let us know we are but men, have for the present sui∣ted my person according to my misfortunes, whereby to comply the better with my necessi∣ties; this I hope is sufficient to shew what a de∣sire I have to put my selfe into the hands of my
native Countreymen: if either the considerati∣on of my past benefits, bestowed upon them in the generall, or any compassionate reflection upon my unfortunate state, at the instant are motives suf∣ficient to work upon humanity, I shall be safe here, and may be prosperous hereafter; where∣fore, as I would not have them to worke upon my miseries for poor and contemptible gaine, so shall not I remember them any more of their for∣mer ingratitude and disobedience: but rather let us both unite in such a constant conjunction, that as by their means I may come againe to be King, so will they ever by such an act of kind∣nesse oblige me to govern for their benefit: they cannot but consider with what little probability they can hope for any establishment in Lydia, but by my means, when as already the Senate doth not onely disvalue their actions and proceedings by most disgracefull and contemptible speeches, but now that they have brought (as they believe) their affaires to a prosperous issue (whereby they have no more need of their assistance, and so con∣sequently would be rid of the trouble) they not onely dispute with them the Titles and reasons of their own interest, but even deny them the payment of their just due, for all those services they have performed for their advantages in Lydia. As the Ambassadour did not make any great reply to the Kings discourse, but in a few com∣plements, concerning his own services, so did he presently conduct him to his house for his better accommodation; where he gave present order
to have him furnished with apparell and other necessaries, whilst in the interim (as it was sup∣posed) he acquainted Lycius the Generall, and the rest of the Officers of the Army, with his ar∣rivall in the camp: After two or three daies time the Ambassadour not onely exposed the King to the view of the people, but delivered him into the protection of the souldiers; where however Lycius and some of the principall of the Nobility, entertained his presence with an extra∣ordinary outward humility; yet neverthelesse with certain kind of sad and distrustfull looks and countenances, they performed their duties and respects in kissing his hands, and using other ceremonies, as if they were not any way privy, much lesse consenting to his journey; the King, notwithstanding he seemed not to take any no∣tice of their actions in publique, but of the con∣trary gave testimonies of joy and gladnesse, at the apprehension of his happy fortune; yet in private, by many words and sighes, he expressed his own doubts, and opinion concerning his fu∣ture entertainment; the rather, in regard they presently set a strict gard upon his person, though pretending it to be done for no other end but for his greater honour and safety: however his hopes became something better satisfied, for that they admitted freely to his conversations, not onely many of his houshold servants that were come from Philadelphia, after the Town was surren∣dered to Farezius, but some of those Priests also of his owne faction, that were under the juris∣diction of the Flamins.
In this manner the King remained for divers weeks, delighting his thoughts with such recrea∣tions, as had been almost made customary to his nature, by continuall practice from his infancy, which made not a few wonder, how he could seem pleased with such triviall things in the height of his vexations and discontents. Again, it was spightfully laid to his charge by his adver∣saries, that he had no great prejudice in being tumbled from his throne, when as he appeared not to have apprehention enough to be sufficient∣ly sensible, of what consequence the losse of a kingdome was: but probably either he had so much wisdome, as to reflect upon the uncertainty of all worldly things with a right consideration, or was endued with such a supream goodnesse in his disposition, as perswaded him to beare his afflictions with no ordinary temper and paci∣fication. In the interim the Myssians were not idle, to play their game to the best advantage, both with the Senate and the King: for as of one side they made the Senate believe, they had a mind to dis∣pute the Kings injuries and sufferings, both out of honour and Religion; so did they alwaies tell the King, that he must give satisfaction to the demands of either Kingdome, before they could become instrumentall in his establishment; which drew on their consultations to the length of many weeks expectation, the Senate urging the delivering of the Kings person into their posses∣sion, out of right and justice, in regard they had been onely hired in the warres and service of
Lydia, by their money; so that consequently they were obliged with a punctuall decorum to observe their commands in every thing: of the other side Euarchus party affirmed; that he be∣ing King of Myssia, as well as Lydia, the Myssians ought to have as particular an interest in his per∣son and preservation, as the Senate of Lydia, in prosecution of which, they were to see him again restored to his Crown and dignity, notwithstan∣ding any desire to the contrary: but whilst these disputations lasted, as I may say, with some see∣ming bitternesse of either side, which as 'twas thought, would instantly have caused a cruell and bloudy warre between both Nations, one Argilius a Nobleman of Myssia came suddenly from his own Countrey into the Campe, who from the very beginning of the stirs had been a main opposer (by reason of his own covetous∣nesse and ambition) of the Kings interest in that Nation: intending thereby more absolutely to govern all the affaires of that kingdome him∣selfe: when he arrived he presently went to the counsell of the Army, where he made this oration unto them. Gentlemen said he, I understand you are now assembled about these consultations, that may be∣long to the Kings particular concernments; part∣ly proceeding from the earnest solicitation of the Syrian Ambassador: and partly in regard Euarchus is now present amongst you in the Camp: In my opinion it is more just and convenient, in the first place to look upon the gods worship: in the next to mind our own preservations: to this purpose in
my judgement it ought to be considered, why we took up Armes at all in the beginning to oppose our Prince, if now without any other condition whatsoever we should lay them downe, and againe restore him to his ancient dignity without con∣ditions? I pray, remember we have made a so∣lemne protestation to the gods, as of the other side a confederation with our friends: and if we breake with both, no doubt but heaven and earth will accuse us as well of perjury as indiscretion; since we should seem, neither to reverence sacred things as we are bound, nor preserve humane ob∣ligations as we ought: may you not remember, we took from our King his power for no other reason, but because we thought him not fit to raigne over us, accompanied with his stubborne and wilfull crimes; and shall we presently restore him to that State againe without amendment? are we not tyed by promises to the Senate of Ly∣dia, faithfully to performe their businesses in these Warres, whilst we are under their pay and ju∣risdiction? and shall we detaine the very object of their intentions against their minds, as a pro∣tected person by our Army, who was the onely booty they aymed at to purchase by our endea∣vours? O horrid injustice and more pernitious indiscretion, since in the one undoubtedly we exasperate the gods anger, as in the other we ap∣parantly endanger our own safeties; for as they cannot but revenge, their own dishonour in the highest fury of their wrath, in regard of our per∣jury, so justly may the people of Lydia over-run our Kingdom, for not performing those conditi∣ons
we contracted for, before we entered their Countrey; which however may be a Warre of some long contention and dispute; yet the effects must needs be bloudy and expencefull; whereas, if we go hand in hand with our friends, (I meane the great Senate at Sardis) we shall not only pre∣serve such an amity, as probably will make both Nations happy, but for the present fill our coffers with sufficient gold, to render us in Myssia, equal∣ly rich with other Countries of Asia. By releasing the King I say without their con∣sents, we give him only power and conveniency, instead of being gratefull for the benefit, to punish us for having been at the first the chief occasion, that made him at all stand in need of such a kind∣nesse: This disposition of his hath bin sufficiently experimented in his necessities, when as he wil not so farre gratifie us as to put the Flamins out of the Temples: These reasons being considered I say, let us presently dispatch messengers to the Senate of Lydia, with full power and commission from this Army, not only to Treat of conditions, but to conclude with that Councell, concerning those conditions and Articles which shall be thought fit to be offered to the King to confirme, either be∣fore he be restored to his Crowne, or released from his imprisonment: so shall we be pious to the gods, just to our friends, and beneficiall to our selves. Although there was much contradiction, and strong disputes concerning this oration of Argi∣lius; yet in regard Lycius the generall, with many others of his faction in the Councell, were against
the Kings desires; An absolute determination was presently there taken, to send Argilius with some other Commissioners to the City of Sardis, whereby to conclude such propositions, as should be held most advantagable as they said for both Nations; Though it was well knowne the Mys∣sians had only an intention to good themselves; not only in the payment of that money, which they expected from the Senate, but in regard of their secret intentions by Euarchus suppression, to have an equall share in the government of the Kingdom of Lydia: but however they concluded, to put in execution their resolutions with all ex∣pedition, yet they still kept the King in hopes by faire promises of his restoration, as well to couzen and deceive his expectation, that he might not entertaine new thoughts, or fall upon other Counsels, as that he might not be irreconcilably distasted with their actions, if they should misse of their agreement with the Senate of Sardis, who they doubted might be something unwil∣ling, to part with those vast summes that were de∣manded; which fayling, they intended to make use both of the Kings Titles and countenance, to prosecute their other designes, either in Lydia it selfe or any other part of Asia, as there should be occasion. The propositions they offered to the Senate were these: First, that the solemne protestation formerly agreed upon should be taken by every person of both Nations without exception, out of which not the King himselfe to be exempted: secondly not onely the jurisdiction but the very
name of the Flamins to be absolutely abolished, and no other rights and manner of worship of the gods, to be used but according to the customes of Myssia: Thirdly, that both Euarchus and his po∣sterity so farre to be disinabled in their authority, that each Senate in both Kingdomes might be suf∣ficiently confident of their power, whereby to be freed in their own opinions from all danger and suspition in the future: Fourthly, that such sums of money should speedily be payed to the Myssians as was promised for their satisfaction; and Lastly, Commissioners to be chosen out of either Coun∣trey, to whom the common transaction of affairs should be equally committed. Although these two latter Articles were some∣thing disputed, yet it was not long before it was agreed, that these conditions being presented and the King refusing to subscribe them, he should be detained as a prisoner, and not acknowledged for a Prince: Argylius and the rest returning to the Campe, (where the King to be short refusing his subscription and consent) within a very few weeks, imployed for the circumstances necessarily belonging to every performance, Euarchus was by the conduction of some Troopes of horse, de∣livered into the custody of Farezius, who present∣ly conveyed him with his own Souldiers, to a faire house formerly belonging to the Kings of Lydia: Of the other side, both Argylius and Ly∣cius, marched into their own Countrey of Myssia, with money and triumph, as if they had deserved immortall fame, for their disloyalty, which for the present must end my dolefull story, since the
time of the day envites us to take part of a slender supper, according to the warning of the little Bell I heare: however before you goe to bed, I engage my selfe, to furnish you with another rela∣tion, much more pleasing to my thoughts, that occasioned the late meeting of the people in the Fields, with such expressions of joy as you be∣held: so taking Narcissus by the hand, he led him into a pretty roome, where they found two or three dishes of meat newly set upon the Table, attended onely by the old woman and the youth. After they had given thankes to the gods, within an hours space they ended their supper; the cloth being presently taken away, and some few other discourses of delight fittest for digestion past over, the Priest againe began this new relation. Euarchus said he, being thus entered as I told you into a new captivity (though farre more no∣bly used) was constrained to attend the comming of the commissioners of the Myssians to Sardis, for the further disposure of his person and affaires: but in the interim the Souldiers, whether contra∣ry to their custome and vocation, reflecting prin∣cipally upon the miseries and afflictions of the King, or rather being willing to make that the ground or pretentions for their future intentions, to quarrell with the Senate, about their owne dis∣contents, in seeing the Myssians esteemed and themselves neglected, not onely by degrees began to use the King gently, but openly to complaine, that themselves were so farre from receiving re∣wards for their services, as that they had not been justly paid their wages: when as the Myssians as
they said, received great summes of money, for doing nothing else but running away, and be∣traying their King: also they seemed exasperated, to have them countenanced in setting up their manner of worship of the gods, throughout all the Kingdome of Lydia, to the enslaving as was urged of the Nation in the free liberty of their conscien∣ces; when as the people according as had bin pro∣mised them, could not exercise their own manner of worship: besides they seemed extreamly to re∣pine that Myssian governours should be joyned with those of Lydia it selfe, in the management of State affaires, that belonged properly onely to the Nation: neither did these discontented dis∣courses end in this manner; for they daily assem∣bled in private Counsels, to produce something for their advantages, though they yet knew not very well what either to demand or act: however these proceedings were soone brought to the knowledge of the Senate, who being jealous also of their own intentions, were a great deale the more fearfull of any dangerous accidents; so that presently they sent messengers to the Army, though as 'twas said with intentions to perswade, yet with authority to command the Souldiers to a better obedience: but as these officers were ex∣treamely deceived in their expectations, concer∣ning their own power and interest in the Campe, so were they forced with expedition to returne to those that sent them, with some terrour in their countenances; As this for many dayes, caused sometimes distracted Counsels, otherwhiles more peremptory discourses, so was it not over long
before the Senate, was saluted with a declaration from the Souldiers, wherein they not onely taxed them, with want of justice and extreame ingrati∣tude to the Army, that had fought so many Bat∣tels, and shed so much bloud for themselves and the priviledges of Lydia, but also presented their considerations with these following proposals, wherein they wisht to be speedily satisfied: first, that they might with all expedition not onely be paid their just dues, but in a convenient time be farther rewarded according to their deserts: Se∣condly, that no part of the Army should be dis∣banded without their owne consents: Thirdly, that such lawes and decrees might presently be established, to assure the people of Lydia of their convenient liberties; and Lastly, that the wor∣ship of the gods according to the Myssian rights, might not be imposed absolutely upon any per∣son or condition: These demands being sent to the Senate by messengers of their own, that before never expected to be contradicted, much lesse cir∣cumscribed by any power whatsoever, began to thinke, that it would be now their safest way, rather for the present to endeavour to temper the Souldiers passions, then further either to tempt or hazzard their fury; To this purpose they re∣turned back their messengers, with faithfull or at leastwise fained promises, that speedily they should receive satisfaction, according to their hearts content: Neverthelesse the Army finding after some weekes expectation, that the Senate endeavoured, rather to deceive their expectations by sowing underhand and private factions among
the Souldiers, then that they intended really to performe in effect, any thing that was actually for their good, after they had as it were chosen Fa∣rezius as their Captaine Generall for their privi∣ledges, as well as the Senate had chosen him for the Warres, not only seized presently upon most of the Magazins of the Kingdome, but also sent some Troopes to take the King out of prison where he remained: Euarchus being a little ama∣zed at this new and sudden attempt, as he could not well interpret their meaning, although 'tis probable he might like well enough of their acti∣ons, so at the first, did he make some stand at their proceedings; yet at last being perswaded of their faire intentions, and having of the other side assu∣red them of his affection, they instantly carried him in a certaine kinde of triumph through most part of the Kingdome of Lydia, untill at last they lodged him in a brave Castle of his own, where he now remaines (as it is believed) with a great deale of satisfaction; And the rather, for that (it being so given out) they doe not only in an ho∣nourable manner, suffer him to exercise his own rights concerning the worship of the gods, with a free admittance of all companies to be entertai∣ned, with what conversation he pleaseth, but have lately envited him to send for the Queene and all his children, who shall be as they say joy∣full witnesses of his being againe established in his Throne and dignity: and however they be something suspitious of the practises of the Com∣missioners of Myssia, and those belonging to that faction, least they might perswade the Kings heart
from the interest of the Souldiers, yet the better to give him satisfaction, concerning the opinion of his own liberty; neither they or any else are debarred either from his presence or communica∣tion; whilst of every side they have promised the common people a happinesse according to their expectations, both in their manner of worship∣ping the gods, as well as belonging to all other priviledges, that can possibly any way appertaine unto their future condition: which in truth I must tell you was the only occasion of our assem∣bly this day; Not only to thanke the gods in the generall for this appearing happy change, but also a little to exercise their ancient decorums in their rurall sports, in regard they had been for some time debarred from such sports, by the rigid severity of the Myssian customes; which as I told you have been brought into Lydia, by the Priests and others of that Nation, that at last was impo∣sed upon the people, as an absolute injunction by the authority of the Senate: This being what I can say for your satisfaction, concerning the pre∣sent affaires of the Kingdome, wherein I feare me I have too much offended in the generall by my long discourses, though upon the matter I do not see how they could have been well omitted in any particular, so I hope you will now give me leave to end. After that Narcissus had thanked him for the paines he had taken, and the favour himselfe had received, (having past away some time longer in other discourses upon the same subject) the Priest calling his boy to take the lights, he conducted Narcissus into his chamber,
where after a while, with some Court-comple∣ments, he left him to take his rest, promising in the morning to shew him the Liberary, as one of the best curiosities he could present him withall. It was not very early the next morning, that the Priest interrupted Naroissus, conceiving be∣like that his travell required something more then ordinary rest, though in that he was much deceived; for he was not accustomed to let passe much time, without thinking upon his deere Cloria: when he came into his chamber, he in∣vited him, according to his promise to the sight of his Library. As in that place they turned over many books of divers kinds, so beholding a∣mongst other things, Maps and Spheares of the world, they fell in divers discourses concerning the opinions of some in the Primitive age, that did not believe there were any Antipodes; as also, others again, that thought the Sunne stood still, and the earth turned round; besides, a third sort of people which would not believe, but that there was another world in the Moon. This gave occasion to the old Priest to say, that as he would not much trouble his thoughts with the dispu∣tation of those questions, since it could no way concerne either his present or future being, so was it an unanswerable argument for the immor∣tality of the soule, that the Sun being of so vast a greatnesse, & of so excellent a clarity, no way to be known or imagined, of what matter it was made of, could not in all reason but be created for a thing more worthy then it self; & that not appea∣ring
in this world, of necessity it must be the reaso¦nable soul of man, and nothing else, which was at first ordained to be the object of such an inten∣tion, in regard that onely remaining here, pre∣tends to eternity, and so consequently more worthy then all other things. From this dis∣course, they fell to a disputation about the pri∣viledge of Armes and Learning, which of both ought to have the greater prerogative in peo∣ples esteem: Narcissus said, that as action was more Noble then contemplation, since the one did but think what the other performed; so in probability arms was to be preferred before let∣ters, in that it created really the subject for the others imployment: besides, he said that action did not onely nourish it selfe, but gave life to other things, as namely History, the worlds looking-glasse, and times recorder: againe, the undergoing of dangers and difficulties, as he said, was a means to warme mens apprehensions, and desires with Noble flames; whilst Learning, in a more obscure way, did but hold it the best honour it could merit from posterity, to remem∣ber truly what other people did worthy of com∣mendation; however perhaps it selfe was onely contented to lie drowned in a certain kind of sensuality, pleased with an imagination, that coveted but to know those things perfectly, which it never intended at all to practise; since the dignity of Crowne and Empires depended not upon the information of who possessed them, but in having the free dispose of such glories themselves, for the most part not to be compassed
and enjoyed, but by active valour; when as books did no otherwise then make relation of those passages, like Generals in triumphant Chariots after the battel, shewing to the people what was deserved in the field; or rather representing an excellent Comedian, appareld in most glorious attire, that playes to the life without wounds, the part of him that acted nobly and dangerously against his enemy. Books I must confesse, said he, are commodious pictures, to teach present times by predecessors examples, what men ought to doe in their own persons; whereas by activity and armes, we are put in possession of the honour it selfe: The one, as I may say, being onely the shadow, that may in some sort satisfie a soule not sufficiently knowing or inflamed; like old people that repeat with delight their old stories in their youth, when they have no more power or will to act to any purpose: whereas the other continues us enjoying our own vertues, like a plentifull and flourishing Harvest, producing variety of new fruit to the industrious Husbandman. He fur∣ther said, that Letters were onely usefull in seasons of quiet, whereas armes could onely se∣cure and protect learning at all times, to make it become profitable, for that mens unruly and preposterous courses, and actions were to be restrained and regulated, more by power then per∣swasion. This being said, Narcissus with a gen∣tle smile, gave the Priest also occasion to shew his reasons. The Priest told him, as he hoped without of∣fence he would give him leave to be of a con∣trary
opinion, however he honoured sufficiently the profession of armes, so with a courteous smile he began the question also in this manner: although I will not deny, said he, but my selfe to have been a souldier in my youth, yet I cannot but stand for the priviledge of the pen, according to reason and justice; wherefore as contemplation doth not destroy the exercise of the body, so of the other side, books render a man more capable to act with advantage, without which attempts would not be much profitable, since mans life is too little a space to learne sufficiently, what were best to be done in many things: he said further, that Military discipline it selfe, could not subsist to any prevailing purpose, without those rules and orders which were before thought upon, and learned by method and instruction; for that it is not onely the running precipitately into haz∣zards and dangers, that ought to render a person deservedly admired, though sometimes blind∣fold fortune, crowne the action or attempt with successe; but rather when as by a knowing va∣lour, we have either prevented a mischiefe or procured a victory, deserves estimation: A pru∣dent and valiant Generall, said he, goeth not so much into the field to hazzard and destroy, as to preserve and overcome; which certainly cannot be so well effected, as by least slaughter, and most policy; for although Monarchies and Countries are oftentimes conquered by force of armes and power, yet seldome without stratagems and pru∣dence can they be long & quietly enjoyed, for want of good established lawes to maintaine them in
peace and security; Warres he affirmed resem∣bled furious windes and stormes that overthrow buildings, and productions, but order and quiet like good builders or provident husbandmen, make up againe the breaches to fairenesse and commodity: even as a rough and harsh hand may quickly disorder the strings of instruments for want of sufficient skill, but it must be skilfull Artists that makes them sound delightfull to the eare: A disorderly commonwealth said he, may sometimes necessarily be chastized with the sword, as dangerous putrifactions, which are to be cut away from the rest of the members, to save the whole body from perishing; yet good and know∣ing government must be alwayes applyed as a salve to render the rest againe whole and sound: in conclusion, said the Priest, a State or Kingdom may stand without Warre, but without learning it cannot possibly subsist, since armies themselves that are esteemed the very instruments of glorious acquisitions, must, to preserve their own being, much more to purchase them considerable suc∣cesse, be obliged punctually to observe those rules prescribed them in times of peace: To this dis∣course Narcissus only replyed, since he had so well defended learning by learning, he had no reason any more to endeavour by the sharp lauguage of his tongue to destroy the excellency of the subject. These and the like discourses at last carrying them to dinner; which being finished and the cloth taken away, of a sudden the Priest was whispered in the eare by the little youth: Nar∣cissus civilly removed from his place to give them
the more freedome of speaking: when he had done, the Priest told him that he was sent for by one Creses, a young Nobleman of Lydia, unto whom he had been formerly beholding, not only for the saving of his Library, but for many other courtesies, during his being imployed in the Se∣nates service; who was just now (being come out of Syria) arrived in the Towne hard by, from whom he doubted not as he said but to have some relations of consequence, to which purpose he did intend to bring him along with him to sup∣per: He farther enformed him, that he had for∣merly enjoyned him to write the passages of these Times which gave his studies some daily exer∣cise: with this he took his leave of Narcissus; wishing him to thinke upon what imployment he pleased in the interim, either in his gardens or a∣mongst his bookes. Narcissus after the Priest was gone, as he reflect∣ed upon Creses arrivall, who might bring newes out of Syria as he hoped towards the establishing of Euarchus in his Throne, by which consequence he doubted not, but the sooner to come to the period of his own love, so of the other side did he resolve, upon his quitting suddenly the Priests house, to put himselfe underthe command of the revolted Army, not knowing which other way to doe his sweet Princesse any considerable ser∣vice; especially for that the King her father see∣med now to be only under the care and protection of the Souldiers: The next consideration that came into his minde was, by what meanes he might with the least suspition provide himselfe
with horse and armes to that purpose; since he durst not discover his intention to the Priest, for feare of the more notice to be taken of his quality and condition: The whole afternoone in a man∣ner he spent in these considerations, untill the old Priest returned with Creses in his company; who yet had not enformed him of any newes at all concerning his Travels, by reason they had nei∣ther privacy or conveniency, in regard of the many visits and other complements they received from the Townsmen: As soon as Creses entered the room, the Priest made him acquainted with Narcissus, who was one as he said that belonged to the Countrey of Cyprus: whereupon Creses re∣plyed, that as his person merited in outward ap∣pearance, the best respect that could be given by all civill people of any Nation, so was he ex∣treame happy in the encounter, for that his Tra∣vels perhaps might furnish him with something out of his own Countrey, if lately he had not heard from thence, of some consequence: after that Narcissus had returned him a sutable com∣plement, both the Priest and himselfe seemed somewhat passionate to heare his relation, which quickly carried them all three to a convenient feat in the garden, where Creses without much circumstance used this discourse unto them, whilst their supper was preparing in the kitchin in the interim. As it is sufficiently known said he, how unfor∣tunately the Princesse Cloria (after she was deli∣vered out of the Castle by my selfe) was carried back againe to the Senate, by the Treason of cer∣taine
Souldiers fled from the Battell which Prince Thyasmus lost to the Myssians, so will I only begin my relation from my own quitting of Lydia upon that occasion: to which purpose you must know, that it being my intention in the first place to visit our Queene Hyacinthia, to informe her fully of all occurrences in Lydia, since I was ren∣dered by reason of that accident, altogether un∣capable of other services any way beneficiall, ei∣ther to the Princesse or her selfe; finding upon my arrivall in the Island of Cyprus, that the Queen was newly parted from thence, I had some leasure granted me to be enformed of the late strange newes of that Island, which were delive∣red me in this manner: the passages I am the more willing to relate for the satisfaction of this stranger. The Dukes daughter of that Countrey named Eretheria, one day walking by chance by the Sea side with one attendant onely, neer a certaine kinde of religious house where she was retired for her devotions, of a sudden casting down her eyes towards the bottome of the rocks, she might see something lye, that however so farre off she could not perfectly distinguish; Neverthelesse continu∣ing her lookes fixed for some time upon the ob∣ject, which she thought according to the fancies of her imagination, not only to be a body that had been cast up by the Sea, but that it also ap∣peared to have some motion in it: so that there being in that place certaine steps cut in the stone, that afforded conveniency enough for descent, she resolved her selfe in person to make the experi∣ment,
whereby the better to satisfie her curiosity: where being arrived with her maid servant, she soon perceived a handsome young man lying up∣on the sands, with a piece of round Timber un∣der his body, as it were infolded within one of his armes, whilst the other lay at some distance: This prospect however it something startled her thoughts, with a little kinde of horrour, yet her courage more prevailing then the naturall feare∣fulnesse of her sex, as she approached neerer, the youth seemed to have some motion, and this gave both her apprehension and charity a Sub∣ject as she thought to work upon: wherefore presently sending her attendant to call some Fishermen at a prety distance that were mending their Nets, she caused them presently to transport the youth to a small house by the water side, who in the interim began to recover more and more life: To be short, within a while she applyed so many remedies with her faire hands to his di∣stempers, that in a few dayes he recovered from the greatest part of his danger, though not altoge∣ther out of the troublesomenesse of his sicknesse; which kept him in his bed for a very long season, though in a manner daily visited by the faire and charitable Eretheria; not yet having yielded an account to any of the accident by Sea, that was the occasion of his being cast in that sort upon the shoare: But finding at last, that he not only had gained a competent strength for what expression soever, but also that that faculty restored to him was at present necessary to be used for his advan∣tage, one day when Eretheria came according to
her custome to visite her sick patient, the roome being freed by accident from all company else, the youth to her no small amazement prosecuted this discourse. Alasse sweet Eretheria said he, what serve these outward remedies you apply to my weake body, when you leave my heart still subject to a dange∣rous and painfull disease? these words seemed so strange to the eares of the young Lady, that with a certaine kind of amazed look, she only entertai∣ned his expectation for some time; but at last ap∣prehending a few sparcles of love might proceed from her frequent visitations, that hadimboldned the youth to higher ambitions, then any way his condition could merit, or she admit of, had drawn from him these extravagant expressions; turning her countenance instantly into a frown, she told him, she was of opinion that his distracted spirit, by reason of his long sicknesse, had caused him to very ridiculous fancies instead of using fit∣ting respects: To which he suddenly replyed; no, no, most deare Eretheria, know that I am not mad by these new distempers, but long since wounded by your bewitching beauty; so that as the guilt justly belonges unto you, so ought you also to take upon you the blame: for you may be satisfied if you please, that your patient is no other but your unfortunate servant Eumenes, pre∣served as I may say miraculously from the rage and violence of the Seas unkindnesse, to be more again tormented and endangered by your cruel∣ty: This was enough to have put Eretheria be∣yond all degrees of wonder and amazement, since
Hyacinthia our Queen had brought newes of his and Prince Cassianus miscarriage, as she had been enformed by an unfortunate shipwrack in her company: but when againe she had computed inwardly in her mind the time of the accident, and the finding of his body lying upon the sands, to agree punctually together, it rendred her abso∣lutely certaine in her beliefe, that he was no other then the right Eumenes: besides both his voyce and countenance, though much changed by reason of his sicknesse, at last lively came into her appre∣hension: so that after shee had a long time rested silent, as if her consideration laboured to digest her thoughts into a method, or rather seeming to labour inwardly by the force of many passions, she at last broake out into these expressions, wherein both her words and her teares were sufficient witnesses of her extraordinary distemper: O you gods said she, must I be an instrument to protect murther, under the pretence of using charity; much lesse certainly ought it be imagined, that I should imbrace such a love without my fathers consent; who undoubtedly can never be pleased with an election of these oppositions; And with that flew out of his chamber with some violence: This gave Eumenes considerations sufficient im∣ployments, since he was not only in despaire that Eretheria would never entertaine his affections, but doubted whether or no she might not deliver him up into the hands of justice: but againe re∣flecting upon the noblenesse of her nature accom∣panied with so many rare perfections, he could not believe so pure a whiteness of disposition like
the rich Ermin, would suffer it selfe to be defiled by any provocation to false-hood: Neverthelesse the griefe to be left in that manner by the faire Eretheria, as it were confounded in a vast Sea of confusion, when as before he had raised his hopes to some pitch of probability, by reason of the opportunities he enjoyed with those respects he had received from her after the tilting, continued his distempers a long time upon him; which also became extreamly augmented, in regard that Ere∣theria absolutely forbore her accustomed visits: that caused her belike in the interim, more close∣ly to retire her selfe amongst the holy Virgins, in the place where she then remained; either being struck perhaps with the sensible feeling of the youthes sufferings (withall a little jealous of her own honour) or the more conveniently to avoid the importunity of such suitors, that her father had proposed to her choyce: however not to de∣taine me over long in the relation, or  in the hearing, by laying open all the circumstances, that might appertaine to so passionate a story, Eumenes, after he was in a sort perfectly recovered of his sicknesse, found means by a certaine disguise he borrowed of a young Novice belonging to the order, not only to procure admittance into the conversation of Eretheria (who not being abso∣lutely profest, he might the more conveniently doe) but in a short time after he had one day dis∣covered himselfe to her knowledge, with teares, sighes, and other services, obtained some kind of entertainment in her favour: Neverthelesse in the interim she conjured him, by all those affecti∣ons
that he could expect from her condition, so to conceale his person from the knowledge of any, that her father might never suspect either his pre∣tentions, or that he was living: Eumenes although he thought himselfe sufficiently honoured, that his beautifull Mistresse, would in this manner al∣low him the freedome of her chast conversation, yet considering he was not much neerer his jour∣neyes end by the favour, then the Suns revoluti∣on, that did but rise and set, to prosecute the one course without alteration, conceived himselfe to be in a manner in the same predicament as tor∣mented Tantalus; her permittance being onely remedies to keep his thoughts alwayes in an ap∣petite, without tasting of that fruit which he so much coveted: however his hopes were suffici∣ently encouraged to keep despaire from seizing upon his soul: Thus I say he continued enjoying though he never enjoyed, untill the unexpected death  the Duke her father, gave Eretheria full liberty (as she thought) to dispose of her selfe without contradition; At these words Narcissus began to grow pale, in so much as the Priest asked him how he did? but he reflecting upon the ne∣cessity of concealing himselfe, in regard of the Princesse Clorias desires, where as she only upon those conditions, was content to allow him her conversation, and besides considering that the demonstration of any passions could not againe call his father to a new life, told them, that as a little quame had something overcome his stomack so was he for the present pretty well recovered: wherefore desired Creses, without any more in∣terruption
in his behalfe to prosecute his story, which made him quickly returne to the matter in this manner: Eretheria said he, being thus the absolute possessor of her own liberty, as by de∣scent the only heire to her fathers fortunes, since her brother Narcissus had miscarried unfortu∣nately some time before at Sea, as was generally conceived throughout the whole Island of Cyprus was presently perswaded by the States of the Countrey, to make election of some Noble and worthy husband, that might be capable to exe∣cute that charge and command, that belonged formerly to the Duke her father; for that by rea∣son of her sex, she could not entirely of her selfe enjoy the office; being willing as they said, if it were possible, to continue the jurisdiction in the same bloud, in regard of those extraordinary benefits the Island had received by the govern∣ment of the late Duke her father: As Eretheria could not but accept of these propositions, that pretend to so much love to her selfe and family, after she had returned them a gratefull acceptance of their kindnesse, with all the fitting expressions she could use to that purpose, within a very few dayes, Eumenes was produced to the considerati∣on of the people, as the person she most desired to affect, which without any great opposition was approved of in the generall, as being a man who had not only borne a long affection to the Prin∣cesse, but upon all occasions had demonstrated a sufficient courage and judgement, worthy of any imployment: As in this manner he was created both Prince and Governour at the same time, so
I left the Island of Cyprus, providing not only for the Nuptials of the young couple, but for the Fu∣nerals of the old Duke: whilst my occasions and passions carried me after the Queene Hyacinthia into Syria, being thither retired as I heard after the death of Philostros, who during his life had absolutely obstructed her passage and intention: where being no sooner arrived, but as the world had bin turned into nothing but wonders, I found also Orsames dead, and his Queen newly brought abed of two sonnes, which afforded the Kingdom of Syria an equall share both of joy and sorrow: This notwithstanding so farre protracted my de∣signes, that as I had but little conveniency to pre∣sent the State of our Lydian affaires to Hyacinthia with all the particulars concerning the Princesse Clorias fortunes, so had she lesse hope her selfe to determine of any thing speedily, in regard of the unsettlement of businesses and governments in Sy∣ria, by reason of those new changes that had so lately hapned: so that for some time I was con∣strained to quit the City of Damascus, and to re∣tire my selfe to a more private place of habitati∣on, finding at Court how unwilling they were to entertaine any occasion of charge and expence; the rather for that Prince Arethusius the Kings el∣dest sonne, was only to be furnished out of his mothers pension and allowance: but long I had not continued in my voluntary retirement, but sudden intelligence was brought to Court, not onely of the generall revolt of the Senate of Ly∣dias Army from their service, but also that it was reported they had taken King Euarchus out of
Prison into the Souldiers protection: as this gave all our thoughts, fresh hopes of something spee∣dily to be acted for his good and restoration, so am I at present sent to him with Letters from the Queen, though to what effectuall purpose I can∣not tell, for that I find not only her selfe, but the whole State of Syria to be extreamely addicted to the Myssian interest, which as I suppose the Army will never willingly consent unto, in regard they have already so publickly and violently declared to the contrary; having made it the chiefe occa∣sion of the quarrell between them and the Senate, which in effect is all I can say either of my jour∣ney or imployment: Then turning himselfe to the Priest he told him, that he must intreat his company to Court: and this presently carried them all three to supper. When they had ended, the Priest told Narcissus, that although he feared his occasions would con∣straine him for the present to take a journey to Court, whereby to have the happinesse againe to see his old master the King, and so by conse∣quence not to be longer in a capacity, to doe him that farther service in his own house he desired, yet he hoped they should have the honour of his company along with them, where he durst under∣take his reception should be equall with either of theirs, in those contents they should receive by so fortunate an occasion. Narcissus after he had thanked him, as well for his past favours as his present offers, assured him that as he could not but be extreamely joyfull at the opportunity he should have by that voyage,
againe to behold his great master in some proba∣bility of being restored to his ancient right and dignity, so did he wish him unfainedly to believe, that notwithstanding he could most willingly participate of his good luck in personally accom∣panying them to Court, whereby to be an eye wit∣nesse of their entertainments, yet such were his pressing occasions (especially in regard of those accidents that had lately hapned in the Island of Cyprus) that he was obliged to make what hast he could possible into his own Countrey, where notwithstanding he should study what requitals he should be any way able to performe in lieu of those civillities he had received by his meanes in the Kingdome of Lydia: These complements with other discourses continued them in commu∣nication, untill the time of the night caused them all to retire into their severall lodgings: and the rather was the hast more necessary, for that the Priest was to make some convenient preparation for the next dayes journey. When Narcissus was come into his chamber, and being there onely accompanied by his folita∣ry thoughts, instead of sleep he fell upon these melancholly considerations: First it came into his minde, that he had not alone lost a deare and loving father, whose wisedome would have been a continuall support unto him in all his difficult affaires, but by that unreparable losse, he was also in danger to be deprived of the best part of his esteemed hereditary honour, and command, by the marriage of his sister with Eumenes, fince in his roome he was elected chiefe governour of the
Countrey, in regard of the generall opinion was amongst the people of his death: yet againe not∣withstanding this possession, he had some hopes by the affection of the Inhabitants to be restored to his right, when they should by his personall appearance, be made fully acquainted with the mistake of his death without either bloud or trouble, since as he doubted not of the naturall affection of his sister Eretheria, so would he not suspect the noble disposition of Eumenes: but when he reflected upon the lustre and sweetnesse of Crownes and Dignities, being once enjoyed either by ambitious and high spirits, he concei∣ved there might be more difficulty in the attempt then ordinary, and so consequently an occasion given of contention and slaughter, not possible to be ended between them without destruction to one or other: besides he doubted for the present which seemed most to trouble him, that these sudden changes, might so far alienate the thoughts and affections of the Princesse Cloria from his parsicular, that she might be induced in the inte∣rim, to entertaine the addresses of Cassianus, that were most violently as he knew proposed to her choyce by the powerfull Senate of Lydia; And as he imagined would be the sooner entertained, in regard of the King her fathers present necessi∣ties, who by that meanes might hope the easier to come to the possession of his rights, especially when all opportunities were afforded, either for courtships or solicitation; and probably could not long be resisted, by reason of her constrained condition, that obliged her without prevention,
to endure all assaults and affronts to that purpose, that should from time to time be attempted upon her person: As these last considerations most strugled inwardly with his uncertaine thoughts, not knowing well whether he should leave Lydia or not, so did he begin to thinke, that there being no Army in the Field that was in action, and not knowing how to be admitted to Clorias presence, it would be too little purpose longer to continue in the Kingdome; and therefore resolved pre∣sently to goe for Cyprus; where he seemed not to doubt, but that the people (if not Eumenes him∣selfe) finding him alive contrary to their expecta∣tion, would soon be perswaded to reason in his behalfe: And to this purpose being setled in his fathers command, he should be not only able to bring assistance to King Euarchus occafions, but also contribute much to his dangers releasement; whereas the contrary would both confirme the opinion of his being dead, and in some sort ac∣cuse himselfe of too much sloath in his own na∣ture, for not appearing activer in those concern∣ments of his own that belonged so exceedingly to his honour and welfare: with these resolutions he quickly fell asleep. In the morning the old Priest came to Narcissus to take his leave with these complements, that as he had hitherto been ashamed, that his own disa∣bility to render him those services due to his worth, had made him want he feared such enter∣tainment as was fitting in his poore habitation, and much more since he was now forced to leave him by the accidentall journey, he was constrai∣ned
to make to Court in the company of Creses, so if he pleased to designe any longer stay in the Kingdome of Lydia, he should take it for some part of satisfaction to his fortunes, that he would resolve to make use of his house in his absence, a place should be alwayes ready he assured him, to afford him the best conveniency it was able for his aboade: which he refusing with the like comple∣ments, they both presently descended into the Hall, where they found Creses ready prepared to take horse: After they had eate a bit or two, and performed some other few ceremonies belonging to their departure, they quickly mounted their Steads. The Priest and Creses had not travelled many Furlongs together, ere they met with a most even and direct path way; and that commodity as it should seem invited them both to a new discourse, since the Priest seemed extreamely unsatisfied as yet, why the State of Syria, and much more the Queen Hyacinthia, should be so unwilling to en∣tertaine a correspondency with the Army, that had delivered the person of Euarchus out of Pri∣son, though passionately desirous to retaine an in∣terest with the Myssians, that had apparantly be∣trayed him thither, according to the common opinion almost of all Asia. Father, said Creses, as I have already made unto you a relation of my voyage into Cyprus, with some part of my proceedings in Syria, so having for the present so faire an opportunity, I shall en∣deavour to let you know my thoughts, in many other particulars that I have not yet mentioned:
To this purpose you must understand, that how∣ever the people of the Island of Crete, seem to pro∣fesse the same worship of the gods with the State of Syria, yet cannot they obtaine the free exercise of their religion, either from King Euarchus or his Queen Hyacinthia: though Euarchus by the Court of Syria hath been prest not onely to signe all the chiefe articles of the Myssians, but also e∣ven to subscribe to their tenents in matter of Do∣ctrine, notwithstanding they be altogether destru∣ctive to Kingly rule or the religion of Syria: As this gives me not so much encouragement in my journey as I could wish, in regard the Souldiers will not be willing to allow of any interest but their own, towards the placing of the King again in his Throne, so the Commissioners of the Mys∣sians as I heare, are extreamly busie about the Kings person, to the no small discontentment of the army, that hath him now under their juris∣diction: the Queen when I parted from her at Damascrs gave me expresse order, that however I might complement with the Souldiers, and draw from them all the advantages that possibly I could, tending to her husbands service, yet I must be sure as she told me in the first place, to possesse the Myssians with an opinion, that Euar∣chus chiefe trust must still rest in their fidelities and assistance, though he be forced for the present to comply with the Army, that delivered him out of the hands of the Senate: but here I make no doubt but you will aske me why the State of Sy∣ria, much lesse our Queen Hyacinthia, should be so wedded to the Myssians particular? when as
probably they can never be brought, to be hearty in the Kings affaires, since not only in the begin∣ning of these times they opposed his authority, with all the craft and violence they could possibly use, but at last as I may say delivered him betrayed and bound hand and foot, into the hands of those that were esteemed by himselfe his greatest ene∣mies, when as he had chosen for his protection, rather the Myssian Army then the Senate of Lydia: And this expression of ill nature and treachery, was only to obtaine the payment of a small sum of money, not to be valewed in regard of a Kings ransome: so that I say it may be supposed, they have some other hidden mystery in their thoughts against his prosperity, which perhaps the State of Syria wil never be able sufficiently to understand, whilst it be too late to repaire the Kings losses onely procured by those people: for it is well knowne, during the time they gave Euarchus the best hopes concerning their affections and fidelity, they were then by their false instruments, con∣tracting with the Senate for his speedy imprison∣ment; a plaine demonstration of their harsh and cruell intentions towards his particular; for that when they most betrayed him, they profest them∣selves then his faithfullest servants; as it were smothering him in a bed of roses, and killing him with deceitfull language: whereas of the o∣ther side, these Souldiers that have not onely the Kings person, but his authority under their ju∣risdiction; and so by consequence may either shorten his life or preserve his dignity, notwith∣standing they have heretofore alwayes declared
themselves mortall enemies to his interest, and proceedings, as never having any dependency up∣on the Court or his affaires, yet now appeare to the outward view of the world, to be his greatest friends, either being converted and altered in their opinions, or more compassionate and just in their dispositions: which certainly cannot but extreamely augment the Kings obligations, if they performe any thing remarkable according to their professions; but as I will not trouble you with my thoughts, what may be the issue of their intentions or actions, so must I a little discourse unto you, what may be the suppositions of the Sy∣rian State, that seemes so much to countenance the Myssians before the Souldiers; and to say the plaine truth doe more favour them then any other people, that have seemed most affectionate towards the Kings interest. First you may suppose, that they thinke the Myssians, not onely in regard that most of the gen∣try and Nobility, have either command or im∣ployment in the Army or Warres of Syria, but the common people and inferiour sort, have such a dependency upon the Nation, by reason of cer∣taine priviledges granted them time out of mind, by way of a free Trade and commerce amongst them, that it is unpossible for them to quit their interest, for any other benefit that can be proposed to their consideration: And the rather for that the Court maintaines alwayes some Ambassadour or Agent in their Countrey, both to direct their acti∣ons and designes, and to inform the State upon all occasions of their proceedings; which joyned
with the large pentions are bestowed amongst their rulers, and other eminent persons of Myssia, will prove as they believe necessary ties and obli∣gations to retaine their fidelities constant to the Syrian ends; And so consequently can they never attempt the destroying or lessening of Monarchy, but as they shall direct and approve of: besides most of the factions now prevailing against Euar∣chus authority in Myssia, are composed either of Lords or Priests, who are most commonly not so envious to royalty (or at leastwise as they may believe more to be perswaded by reason) then ex∣travagant people, that have learned no rules ne∣cessary to government and order, by any manner of fitting education; wherefore not so much to be feared in their courses and prevailing jurisdicti∣on, if they should be suffered something too much to prosper in either proceedings against their King: Secondly, it cannot be doubted, but that Monarchy in the generall, is a great deale more conducing to the commodity of the Myssians, then a common government, either in Lydia or Myssia; and therefore not probable they should joyne in such a strict amity with the Senate, as absolutely to destroy the prerogative, and Kingly jurisdiction of Euarchus, since by that conclu∣sion, they would neither be able to temper their own factions at home, amongst the Nobility and persons of greatest quality, nor have any hope to receive benefit from other Princes abroad in their occasions: and whereas many may be perswaded to believe, that by agreeing in those designes, for the absolute overthrowing of Monarchy in Lydia,
they might in time come to be equall sharers in the government of both Kingdomes; and so con∣sequently participate alike in the profit and gain, being the chiefe (if not the onely) thing their co∣vetous dispositions looke after, such thoughts are meere fancies and chymeras: for certainly the Senate understanding well the poornesse of the Country of Myssia, and not being ignorant of the secret intentions of the people, withall how in∣sulting and encroaching they are in their natures; will be sure to take order, they shall have no more interest in the affaires of Lydia, then is intirely necessary for their own service and commodity: so that when the Myssians shall find their aymes to faile in these particulars, it is to be imagined that they will not onely be perswaded, upon the least endeavour of the State of Syria, to fall off from the Lydian faction, but even to make a War with that Nation it selfe, for the establishing againe of their King in his ancient glory and command; and to that effect adhere either to Syria or any other Nation that may assist them in those pro∣ceedings: onely this doubt in some sort may be made, that Argilius and Lycius, who so unwor∣thily have betrayed the Kings person for a sum of money, will never by their good wills trust themselves any more under his power, for feare of revenge answerable to their deserts; And they be∣ing the most principall men of the Countrey, it is to be suspected, they will have so great power and influence, over the actions and determinations of the rest of the Inhabitans in the generall, that they can never be brought in any kind to own the
Kings interest to purpose, notwithstanding all the labour and industry of the Kingdome of Syria: But to this I shall only make this answer, that however these people prevailed in the Myssian Ar∣my for the selling of the Kings person, against the thoughts and wills of many, yet that very action of theirs, hath procured them since so much ha∣tred in their own Country, that it may very pro∣bably be believed by the State of Syria, there must of necessity arise daily new factions amongst them, neither want they intelligence at the present, that assures them that an Army will sud∣denly march into Lydia from Myssia, in King Euarchus behalf: which advertizement I suppose is sent, them by their Ambassadour there remaining: Last of all I may adde that the Court of Syria may imagine, the Souldiers who have now the King in their possession, having no other relation but to their own wills and uncertaine principles, will prove from time to time as inconstant in their resolutions, as they have been heretofore desperate in their fortunes, and be rather in the generall inclinable to affect equality, then con∣tinue long contented to be governed by Kingly authority, or to say the plaine truth willing to be under any jurisdiction whatsoever; witnesse their falling off from their command both under the Senate and their old Generall: be∣sides it is esteemed a maxime among their te∣nents, to have scarce dependency upon any power, neither in those things that belong to the gods worship, or concerning other their humane acti∣ons, pretending by such constraint, an absolute
freedome cannot be enjoyed, either in minde or body; so that however the King may seem a lit∣tle to revive by their proceedings, yet I can assure you in Syria, there is a great doubt made of the reality of their actions: but whether these opinions be grounded, either upon the perswasions of the Myssians, or upon other more solid though secret reasons, I will not take upon me at present to de∣termine, but rather shall expect, both with hope and patience the issue, in the interim apply my selfe to my direction and commission, as well in keeping a correspondency with the Souldiers as with the Myssians: by this time again the way be∣gan to be something uneven, so that they could not well prosecute any farther discourse. At night they tooke up their lodging; not a∣bove halfe a dayes journey where the King remai∣ned, and not much farther distant from the City of Sardis, where encountering with a jovial com∣panion master of the house, as appearing also faithfull to Euarchus in his intentions, after they had accommodated themselves to their minds in their chambers, they desired their host with an equall indifference to let them understand, as well the newes that concerned the proceedings of the Senate, as that which belonged more properly to the Army, since as they said, they could not chuse, but be of a nature something more remar∣kable then ordinary, in regard of the late trans∣actions of both parties, which seemed at present to put most of the Kingdome to a kind of a vast consideration concerning the issue: the rather were they curious of this information, the bet∣ter
thereby to tast the inclinations of the people. Truly gentlemen, said the Host, as I must not take upon me the understanding of either of their proceedings and determinations, when as perhaps they are not very well acquainted with their own intentions themselves, so shall I to supply that de∣fect enforme you if you please, of those discourses that have lately passed in the Senate, concerning the Kings government, notwithstanding the Soul∣diers have him personally at the present under their jurisdiction; who to say the plaine truth, use him with that civility and respect, that it gives his friends more then ordinary hopes, of his speedy restoration againe to the honour of his Crowns and Dignity; however the gods onely know what the issue of their determinations may be: some of the Senate would have no King at all, pretending that it would be too miserable a condition for all sorts of people, to be Subject both in their persons and estates to an entire Mo∣narch, not suffering them so much as to aske a reason concerning any thing that should be done amisse, although their purses and paines were forced, upon all occasions to pay for the honour, and the pride belonging to the dignity: whereas a common government as they say, gives a cer∣taine kinde of encouragement pleasing, in some kinde or other to all sorts of people, as having an appropriated share in every action, that concerned the good or ill of the Commonwealth: others againe of a contrary spirit pretended, they are a∣fraid, that if the government should be absolutely changed to a popular State, though it might
seem in outward appearance, to have more free∣dome, it could not neverthelesse but be of lesse se∣curity, in that it would be alwayes Subject to faction and confusion, in regard of the inconstan∣cy of dispositions, and therefore are rather of opi∣nion, that the government remaine in the same nature as it doth, with some necessary restrictions to their King: A third sort made some doubt, how to finde out wayes to limite a Monarch in any kinde, by what lawes soever could be establi∣shed to that purpose, it being almost impossible to take from a Prince altogether the sword of Justice & power, and yet suffer him still to remain in the condition of a governour; which in effect would be no other, then a common government var∣nished over, with a glorious Title to no effect, leaving the whole as subject to faction and confu∣sion, as if there were no King at all; in that he should want the authority, although he were ho∣noured with the name necessary to that purpose: there were others that suddenly started up in the Senate-house, who imagined they had thought upon a way, to remedy all inconveniences; which was to have onely a King by election, either of Euarchus family or some other: but the proposi∣tion was quickly answered with these doubts: that if the Prince intended, should be elected out of the same bloud, if not according to the direct line of succession, it would endanger a new slaughter and faction, through the whole King∣dome, by reason of severall ambitious interests; of the other side, if he were absolutely chosen out of another family, as no doubt but there would
be many opposers, in the very election it selfe, so not possible to have any, of an extraction illustri∣ous enough, to warrant his kindred from being a burthen to the Commonwealth in their mainte∣nance and support; which probably would prove a sufficient inconvenience to the people; for that oftentimes justice would be sold, & other oppres∣sions committed, only to supply a needy and indi∣gent family: in conclusion, however many see∣med willing againe to restore Euarchus, and his posterity to their ancient rights and dignity, yet fearing in regard of their own proceedings, that they might be strictly called in question for their past actians, they utterly desisted from that resolu∣tion: & notwithstanding these severall and violent discourses, for that time they setled upon no de∣termination whatsoever; only at last they ordered, the government should remaine as it was at pre∣sent in the Senates power, though bearing still the name of Euarchus, until farther confideration: I must tell you, as these were the manner of dispu∣tations in the Councels at Sardis, both before and since the revolt of the Army, so now by their favours as we suppose, they must aske leave of the Souldiers, before they settle either a government in themselves, or take it away from others; And the rather am I induced to this beliefe, for that the common people, appeare not yet much scan∣dalized at the late revolt; but of the contrary, as tis thought, would be extreamely satisfied with the Souldiers proceedings, if they should speedily againe turne the streame into its right course; however in that I shall say the least that may be,
untill I be more instructed in the constitution of the world: with these words he ended his dis∣course, and presently tooke his leave; pretending some other company in his house, needed also a∣nother part of his entertainment. This information of the Host, gave Creses and the Priest occasion, to fall into a more serious dis∣putation, concerning the nature and property of Monarchy and other governments, according to divers opinions and judgements, with the severall benefits and inconveniences belonging to them: The Priest would needs take upon him the de∣fence of the Kingly part; whilst Creses was to be content with the more inferiour degree: both notwithstanding grounding their discourses, from the hopes they had, that the Souldiers would shortly againe restore Euarchus to his Crowne and government: The Priest first began in this manner: As Monarchy in the generall, said he, hath been held by writers, to be the best and most absolute way of government, so ought it as well be gran∣ted, that a Prince by descent and inheritance, is the freest of all others from burthen and inconve∣nience to the people; since the making up of new families upon every exchange, and the many dan∣gerous factions would arise by reason of electi∣ons, would at one time or other, either hazzard or ruine the Commonwealth; for that all ambiti∣ons, could never be supprest totally in every per∣son, with the only consideration of the common safety: but that I may more particularly make good my argument, I shall endeavour from cer∣taine
principles of Divinity, nature, and institu∣tion, to prove my affirmation and opinion: In the first place according to the example of the divine providence, there is but one God that made and now rules the heavens, since if there were more, none could be absolute, much lesse omnipotent in any kinde, and so consequently the government, should still be subject to variation, both in part and in the whole; for as divers persons must have severall wills, so that of necessity, would con∣found commands and distract obedience, where∣by executions, could not chuse but be protracted to the rending of all actions and endeavours, of no considerable force and validity to the convenient and orderly rule of the world: wherefore we see, subordinate offices are appointed in every degree, by this great and all powerfull God; every di∣stinct orbe being so involved one within another, untill they all become governed by the first moti∣on, onely to avoyd equality and confusion: so that we may easily perceive by that decorum, that there is an entire necessity of one governour: As for example, there is but one Sun that governes the day, as another light shines in the night, nei∣ther of which being accompanied with any of e∣quall authority or influence; as it were both pre∣tending, to a certaine manner of absolute Monar∣chy in their severall kinds of motion and lustre: in the second place, by the very rules of nature we have experience, that some one in every species pretends above the rest to dominion and juris∣diction: as for the purpose, the industrious and painfull Commonwealth of the Bees, have al∣wayes
one to goe before them, whose person and voyce they onely obey and follow, with a seeming care and extraordinary obedience: The silly Ants in like manner, have their Prince amongst them, who seemes by his absolute authority, only to go∣verne and direct their labours, tending to unity and benefit in their small and innocent Common∣weal'h: so that these being creatures no way gi∣ven to exorbitancy of will as men are, if it be ne∣cessary for them to have but one governour, much more for us who are given in a manner to nothing but malice and pride, whereby to be kept in or∣der and regulated in our dispositions; which certainely cannot long be without the authority of some single power, that must not be equalled or contracted by any other: we see if two strange Bulls be but turned loose together in any pasture, their contention one with another never ends, whilst one of the two have gained the absolute mastery over the other: with what extraordina∣ry hatred and malice will two little Cocks of the game, persecute one another in bloud & wounds, untill the one of them have obtained the victory by the others death and ruine? Ney example me if you can, any two Males of any generous kinde whatsoever, that will endure the others society, without an absolute subjection to his power and courage; as it were never but striving till one have procured the entire jurisdiction of the place; as if nature by no meanes could admit of an equality in government; whereas of the con∣trary, the Females, as being not at all ordained for rule and command, are seemingly contented with
the society, and company of their fellowes: which shews in my opinion a certaine kinde of necessity in all governments of one onely Monarch, not on∣ly to avoid faction and confusion, but to unite desires and industry, towards the welfare and be∣nefit of any Commonwealth; since without such a knowne power and command, it is almost im∣possible, to bridle and keep in order at all times, the unruly fancies and exorbitant desires of mankind: whose very nature or inclination, doth swell as it were with nothing but appetites of contention: Lastly concerning the very institution of govern∣ments upon earth: the first certainly was Monar∣chy; for as in the beginning a man in his own private family, appeared to be the onely absolute Prince to be obeyed, so dominions and King∣domes, became no other way established in the in∣fancy of the world, but by the uniting together of severall housholds, either by accident or con∣quest; And though sometimes people meerly out of necessity, to keep themselves the better in peace and quietnesse, were forced to chuse and forme commonwealths, yet we scarce read of any juri∣diction to be enterteined (at leastwise to be con∣tinued for any considerable space) but where one single power chiefly if not absolutely commanded over the whole; as if the multitude by the very light of nature, being led thereunto by the meere dictates of reason, without any manner of science or experience, were constrained to believe, that no other government could be safe and lasting; however their Lords not seldome proved the cruellest Tyrants could be imagined: as I cannot
deny, but by reason of the exorbitancy of perni∣tious and wicked Princes, a State hath beene changed from a private to a popular Common∣wealth or government; yet scarce did I ever heare of any, but that both began and ended in Kingly authority; as being still by some accident or o∣ther, constrained to that election or conversion, either in absolute power, or mixt representation, as if some kinde of necessity, required such an establishment to render it lasting, and convenient to the people. Neverthelesse said Creses, it is a most miserable condition for the people, to be in a continuall subjection, under the power and command of ei∣ther an impotent or an exorbitant Prince; for though he should know what were best to be done, yet his perverse nature and disposition, would not suffer him to put it in execution. And if he knew not how to governe, he becomes led by the pride and covetousnesse of others: Again, put the case government might fall into the hands of a mad man or a fool, what remedy then could be expected, whereby the people might in any kinde have the least hope of redresse? since by the Lawes and rules of inheritance, he were to continue still without prevention and obstacle; which of necessity sometime or other would hap∣pen; & consequently cast the government into the hands of such as he should chuse, that probably were not farre from his own temper in any thing: in like manner, it must be the same during the time of the Princes infancy, being by that meanes rendred altogether uncapable either of governing himself or others.
Tis true answered the Priest, the misfortune to a Kingdome is not small when either of these happen: but however as no private interest can be so destroying as generall confusion, so can it not be but much safer for a Commonwealth, to be under the jurisdiction of one vicious or im∣potent Prince (who tis likely will be glutted by his excesses, or may be assisted in his Councels) then for it to be wholy governed by many disa∣greeing heads, and factious dispositions, that di∣rect severall wayes in their intentions and con∣sultations, which of necessity must distract all profitable determinations, and at the best cannot but protract, if not absolutely hinder those execu∣tions tending to peace and prosperity; being scarce to be avoyded in a common government, where opinions and interests are severall in the rulers: besides, it is well knowne that in such Councels, secrets of the most highest nature (for that they are committed to many) are subject to be revealed if not betrayed. But according to my sense and beliefe said Creses, such a Magistracy might be created out of the whole, that when good and necessary funda∣mentall Lawes were agreed upon, might easily governe with secrecy and moderation to the be∣nefit of the people, who would be pleased suffi∣ciently, in having the name of the election of such Ministers. If you meane said the Priest, that this juris∣diction should be eternall, it were a great deale worse and more dangerous in matters of Tyranny and injustice, then to be under one single Pritce,
by inheritance, since he might dye, and by that meanes, his successor might againe bring ease and remedy, but the other assembly being once in the greater part corrupted, it were unpossible ever to expect any redresse at all; for that those that should happen to succeed, would come to their places but one by one, and consequently could not have voyces in number sufficient to counter∣vaile the opinions of the rest, remaining in the Councell or Magistracy: besides if any should have received injury, or endured oppression by the casting voyces of the whole assembly, to whom should he flye for remedy and redresse? since every one singly would put off the blame from himselfe; pretending not to have authority and power sufficient, without the generality of that congregation, to repaire the injured person; which seldome or never could be procured: whereas being wronged or oppressed by a Prince, or any of his Officers or Ministers of State, it would be no great difficulty, to make the particu∣lar complaint understood at one time or another to himselfe; And more facile it would be a great deale, for the Monarch or governour speedily to afford the remedy, either in that, that concerned his own person, or belonging to any of his Com∣missioners; for else he should be forced to take upon him the blame, before the face of all the world; whereas the others actions, (that is to say concerning the particular) would be so involved in the darke, that it were almost impossible to make it appeare where the fault lay but in the ge∣nerall assembly; who without an infinite labour
could not be brought to understand, much lesse to redresse the grievance: And if you meane this magistracy or supreame authority, should be only temporary, and so consequently be made subject upon all occasions to the election and questioning of the common people: what a world of incon∣veniences would it bring? not only by continuall factions and disorders, in the chusing these new Magistrates, but in the very spight and heartbur∣ning, would be occasioned thereby amongst the people, being carried on to this election, by a certaine conceived greatnesse in their own opini∣on, that might render their rude ambitions ex∣treamely unsatisfied, if they should be at any time crost in their choyce; with a thousand other in∣conveniences that I cannot mention. Yet said Creses, alshough it should be granted, that in those particulars you have mentioned, Monarchy were to be esteemed the most conve∣nient government of all others; however it can∣not be denyed, but that the common people are in that slavery under such a jurisdiction, that they cannot possibly have hearts sufficiently af∣fectionately to render them entirely industrious, towards the profit and good of the Common∣wealth in the generall, in regard that however they toyle and take paines in abundance, they can never attaine to any places of dignity or res∣pect in the Kingdome, either to content their thoughts or advance their esteem; whereas in a popular state, the meanest is in the same capaci∣ty of preferment, as the highest borne person in he Countrey.
Although this be true said the Priest; yet the defect proceeds not from their naturall unhappi∣nesse, but from their disabillity or want of know∣ledge in regard of their deficiency in education, which inconveniency and defect, they will as well suffer in a popular government, as in a Kingly authority, since no worthy person what∣soever is debarred from preferment in a Monar∣chy, if his industry and parts can merit the ho∣nour and advancement; and although he should in any kinde misse of his expectation, yet it would not grieve him so much to be under the juris∣diction of the Nobility, that are by birth and ex∣traction above his condition as to finde himselfe much subordinate and inferiour, to those of his own ranke and quallity: to be esteemed of all others most irkesome to humane nature: so that you see it is but meere fancy, that engenders these considerations and opinions: besides there are other inconveniences and omissions appertaining to a popular government; as for example, it seldome or never preferres or rewards worthy persons according to their deserts and merrits; when as for the most part smallest crimes and de∣fects are punished by most fearefull and horrid severity; proceeding either from envy or jealou∣sie, which is the occasion that oftentimes, when Generalls, Commanders, or States men have pro∣cured a sufficient interest and esteeme amongst all sorts of people, whereby to be able to contend, doubting their own safeties from the Magistracy, they enter presently into such rebellions that ei∣ther turne the Commonwealth into a Tyrannicall
Monarchy, or occasion at the best so much bloud and slaughter, that every Subject thereof hath reason enough to feare his own losse, if not ge∣nerall destruction; whereas a Prince being of so eminent a condition himselfe, not to be equal∣led by any of what quallity soever, hath no cause to be envious or suspicious: againe the Prince hath a more neere interest in his Countries good then all his subjects besides by way of personall honour; wherefore a greater benefit or losse at∣tends him in every thing, that is acted, since he creates not only the officer that commands or executes, but enjoyes the profit or disprofit of the successe, whereas the people in a Commonwealth receive it but in the generall, no one man being able to appropriate any publike action particu∣larly to himselfe; which is a principall motive to enduce the Prince to attend earnestly the pros∣perity of the government, because he may be said truly to esteeme it his own, which no other prison can doe in what constitution some ever, if there be others in equall authority with him; for to joyne interests, will never take so much the fancy and opinion of the owners, as those which are singly appertaining but to one onely. Well said Creses) although I see upon any termes you will needs have a Monarchy, to be the best government, yet neverthelesse I must not have a Prince altogether unlimited, as it were threatning a kinde of a fearefull apprehension of Tyranny to his people; by which meanes they would be hindred from endeavouring industri∣ously, either the common good or their private
welfare: but rather I should wish a king, in some sort bound by lawes fundamentall, established by a lawdable constitution at the first; however not to be so strictly chayned up, that he were left no any power or prerogative at all, without his Sub∣jects leave, or be so let loose to his owne will and pleasure, that he might injure, and oppresse his people as he list: that is to say, to have the go∣vernment to enjoy such a mixture in the whole, that the Subjects might not be over-bold, to ap∣proach his presence without an awfull reverence, or he to be puffed up with a vaine opinion (by reason of his dignity) that the Kingdome or com∣monwealth was bestowed upon his condition, more for his own use then the good of his people, nor I neither said the Priest: whereupon being called away to supper they suddenly broake off the rest of their discourse. The next day about noone they arrived at Court, or rather was it to be called a campe, since the Souldiers seemed to beare all the sway, not∣withstanding others had a civill liberty allowed them, to be admitted upon every occasion need∣full into the Kings presence. When Euarchus was enformed not onely of their arrivall, but that Creses had brought him letters out of Syria from the Queen, he with a great deale of passion sent presently for them into his presence: upon their enterance they found him seated in a kind of a confined Majesty, Farezi∣us being on his right hand not farre from his per∣son, and a little below him stood one Hercrom∣brotus his Lieutenant Generall, a man that seemed
to carry not only designe, but policy in his coun∣tenance: about them, were placed many com∣mon souldiers in the nature of a gard; however expressing more then ordinary freedome both in their lookes and demeanor: Creses after he had performed his wonted reverencies, approached the King with a humility answerable to his Titles, though not his condition; presenting him with the Queens letters, which Euarchus hastily taking out of his hands read them with teares in his eyes, and then asked him sundry questions both of his wife and son Prince Arethusius; wishing withall he might once more have the happinesse to enjoy their company in Lydia: whereunto Creses soon replyed, that he did not doubt but that the gods ere long, would to that purpose be favourable to his pious intentions: Truly said the King turning at the same time to Farezius, this brave comman∣der, doth give me more then probable hopes to this effect: but Farezius made him no other an∣swer, then by a kinde of humble bending of his bo∣dy, seemed to intimate a willingnesse in any thing to comply with his desires. Having for some time thus discoursed together in publick, the King (also taking notice of the old Priest with more then ordinary affection) he led Creses into an out window in the same roome, that was sheltred from the view of the common people, by large Curtaines that reached to the ground, where after they had continued for the space of an houre in private conference, the King calling unto him Farezius used this language, with such a look, as might procure compassion
from the cruellest Tyrant in the world. Farezius said he, as I have sufficient experience of your civilities, since it was my good fortune to be absolutely under your jurisdiction, so can∣not I but presume upon the continuance of these curtesies, finding your nature to be both noble and constant: wherefore to this purpose I would have you know, that it is not alone my own de∣sire at this present, to have some comfort and consolation by the sight and conversation of my children, kept so long from my possession by the power of the Senate sitting at Sardis, but also have received conjurations by these Letters from my wife remaining in Syria, if it be possible so farre to procure my own information concerning their particulars, that I may give her a true ac∣count both of their comportment and education, whereby the better to satisfie her motherly affecti∣on, and naturall inclination: when the King had ended this supplication, so farre (as I may say) be∣neath his dignity, though consonant in some sort to his condition, Farezius after a short pause re∣turned him this answer. Although I must confesse your Majesties desires, are grounded upon all the principles both of na∣ture and morallity, yet you must be pleased like∣wise to know, that at present I finde my owne power and interest so farre weakned in Sardis, by the prevailing faction of the Myssians, that I dare not be over consident of any request I shall make in your behalfe; especially for that I am neither assured to continue still the Senates Gene∣rall, or can procure those Senators to be punished
that with so much violence, exclaime howerly at that attempt of ours concerning your release∣ment: but neverthelesse if you please that Creses now in communication with you, may be im∣ployed as a messenger to demand these conditi∣ons, I shall procure him as large a commisson as possibly I can from the whole Army to that effect, and being denyed by the Senate any of our just desires, we may adde your authority to the wil∣lingnesse of the Souldiers to force them from the opposers: as these motions were quickly imbra∣ced by the Kings apprehension and consent with many thankfull expressions, so Creses wanted nei∣ther courage nor loyalty to take upon him the execution to the best advantage both for Euarchus service and the armies profit. When Creses arrived at Sardis, and had with some eloquence and more judgement delivered his message, being againe retired for about halfe an houres space, he received these answers to eve∣ry particular from the Senate: first it was told him that whereas it was desired, the Kings chil∣dren might not only performe their naturall duty to their father by a speedy visit, but might also for some considerable time remaine in his compa∣ny and conversation (however they conceived it against the rules of State policy to have any single person pleasured before the publike good) yet that Farezius should see how much they valued his request, the Senate had determined the children might make a journey to that effect, upon assu∣rance given for their safe returne after some few dayes of saluation: againe whereas the Generall
seemed to desire a continuation of his power and command under the Senates authority, they not only granted him his owne demand, but wisht Creses to assure Farezius, that as they had never any intention to out him of his office, contrary to his own consent, so would they ever be most sen∣sible of his brave and gallant services: but for the proposition that concerned the accusation of some of their fellow Senators, they conceived it a derogation to the high places they held in the Commonwealth, to have them so much as sus∣pected, much lesse to suffer them brought as guilty Malefactors before another Tribunall then their own, being persons (as they said) whom they had found most true and faithfull to the common in∣terest: Neverthelesse they condescendedby way of perswasion, to cause them voluntarily to leave the Kingdome for some small time, whereby the better to allay the rage and discontents of the Souldiers, untill they could be fully satisfied in their endeavours and fidelities; these answers did but in part give content to Creses expectation; especially for that the Senate seemed, not only as he conceived, to put on a kinde of more then ordi∣nary insolency in their demeanors, but withall did not so much as take any notice at all of Euar∣chus dignity, or that they intended any of those respects for his sake. Though Creses with a great deale of indigna∣tion had attended their deliberations, yet he was content with some humility, to beg leave to visit the Princesse, which being obtained, he found her seated in a melancholly roome, that had no
more light bestowed upon it, then what was meerely necessary, for the performance of those services due to her condition, her person being shut up in a black Couch, so obscured with divers Curtaines, that scarce could her rare beauty be otherwise discovered, then as the faire Moone, shaddowed by too many blacke clowds; howe∣ver, now and then as the Princesse moved, there appeared bright and gentile rayes of those per∣fections, which could not be altogether hid; in this manner being admitted to kisse her white hand, with many sighes, and not a few teares, she asked of her fathers health, with some other cir∣cumstances; but the uncompassionate guard would not suffer her to be so punctuall in her questions as she desired, untill at last Creses was separated againe from her presence by those watchfull spyes, that had the neerest custody of her person, who belike as guilty men, feared Treason in their very lookes, since no words were uttered but what they understood; so that he was conducted to the Castle gate onely by Roxana's ample complements, instead of her Mistresses more full expressions. But however the Senate had made these large promises during Creses his presence; yet after∣ward upon other considerations, they not onely denyed the Princesse Cloria accesse to her father, being unwilling belike to hazzard so pretious a Jewell out of their custody, but those Senators accused of Treason, with the City of Sardis assi∣stance, within a very few dayes beset the Senate house with multitudes of their faction, not onely
denying to stand to the former Orders of giving Farezius possession of the Castle of the Town; but also professing, not to consent to their own ba∣nishment, alledging that the Generall rather de∣served to be punished as a Traitor; for having made so unjust and insolent a demand, then themselves to be judged for any crime, and were not onely liberall in their language, but caus∣ed the Senate to disannul their former De∣crees. The news of this inraged multitude was quick∣ly brought unto the knowledge of the whole Ar∣my, and so consequently to Farezins, who after he had for some houres consulted with the rest of the Officers, resolved to march towards the Walls of Sardis; where after a short siege, and no great slaughter, the proud Inhabitants yield∣ed absolutely to his mercy, whilst the chief Ma∣gistrates of the City, issued out to give him friend∣ly entertainment, finding he had the greater par∣ty in the Town. In this manner, with a most magnificent Triumph, they brought him to take possession of that command, that before with some obstinacy they had refused, and afterward most ceremoniously conducted him to the very Senate, in which place he was received with new honours. Cloria having notice given her of the Gene∣ralls intention, to visit her, began to consider with what reception she should entertain his pre∣sence, since he appeared to her thoughts not one∣ly one, who had lately conquered the whole Kingdom by his prosperity; but seemed at the
present to graspe the very fate of her Father, and therefore believed she was not to receive him in her accustomed sad posture, least he might inter∣pret it either a contempt of his power, or a sor∣row for his fortune; so that she commanded her Chamber to be adorned with Hangings of green Velvet, belonging to the Kings Wardrope, im∣brodered with compartments of gold, wherein was wrought the severall armories of her ances∣tors of both sides, divided by certain colours of rich cloth of Tissue, interwoven with such variety of beautifull flowers, that it seemed the Princess had placed her self in a delicious Garden, to give Farezius the more delightfull welcome; which was increased by her own sweet counte∣nance, seated upon a bed of the same Livery: though the infide differed in invention, however it exceeded in curiosity, wherein with artificiall needlework, was designed the story of Venus and Adonis with that lively art, that the blushing an∣ger appeared in the boyes cheeks, at the lascivious carriage of the Queen of Love, whilst in other places he seemed to have put on a smiling coun∣tenance, that he had broke from her forcible imbracements: but that which was admirably expressed in death it self, accompanied with a lively sorrow, was the amazed grief of the God∣dess, when she beheld her slaughtered Servant, ly∣ing in his own blood, torn with the rude Tusks of the salvage Boor, and his dejected followers, seemingly confounded at the object: Nor was it little less pittifull, to behold his poor Doggs here and there dispersed, as if also they apprehended
their own losse, by their Masters destruction. Over the Chimney was a large Picture of most excel∣lent workmanship, wherein was set forth the ba∣nishment of proud Tarquin, by his enraged Sub∣jects. As soon as Farezius entred the room, he paws∣ed a while (being surprized with an intire amaze∣ment) before he approached the Princess, as if he apprehended some fear of sacriledge in attempt∣ing such an appearing deity; but being invited by a gentle smile, that afforded not onely a great∣er encouragement to him, but added new grace, to her own beauty, he advanced with slow steps to perform those reverences due to her dignity, which at last brought him to that distance, that gave her conveniency to aske him concerning her Fathers State; in which demand she put on such a look, that shewed she desired something (though in words she begged nothing) that easi∣ly lay within his power to grant. But the Gods seemed too cruel to make her a mendicant, whose perfections deserved rather to have sufficient au∣thority to command all hearts: However, the Generall, as if at the present he understood little else but admiration, for a long time answered not her questions, which gave occasion to Cloria again to redouble her passion, with other inter∣rogations upon the same subject; so that Farezi∣us at last breaking through his amazement, told her that he was in as prosperous a condition, as the unfortunate affaires of the Common-weale would permit, wherein he had imployed his best service with all loyalty.
This answer scarce gave satisfaction to the Princess, since she conceived Farezius had de∣signed his whole endeavours for the present esta∣blishment of the King in his ancient dignity; and therefore turn'd away from his sight with a few gentle teares in her fair eyes; which being per∣ceived by the Generall, he humbly besought her to put off all sadness from her heart, for that he did not doubt, but prosperity would succeed to her Father, according to his merit, and her own wishes; however the issue as he said, must be at∣tended yet with some patience, since first the Souldiers were to be paid, who had spilt their blood freely for the liberty of their Country; and the common people in like manner must be satisfied, that had hitherto paid for the purchase. But what the sweet Cloria would have answer∣ed to this discourse could not be known, since Farezius occasions call'd him suddenly away from her presence into the City, not so much to receive those Triumphs prepared for his further entertainment, as to procure money for his Army. Though the Generall continued some vio∣lence against the rich Town of Sardis in impri∣soning their chief Officers, as also in causing those Senators which he had formerly accused to be sent into banishment, yet the affaires of Eu∣archus became no whit more amended, since he was not onely still detained as a Prisoner, though with something a greater liberty and freedom, but the Senate was permitted to press his pati∣ence, with those former propositions they had
sent by Agyllius prejuditiall to his Crown, and in truth to the absolute taking away of all his royall authority; which gave occasion of many discourses amongst all sorts of people: some said that Farezius was in love with the Princess Cloria, and by that means endeavoured to force the Kings consent to the mariage, whom he thought else could not be brought to yield to such unequall Nuptialls, much less would his Daughter be won to give up her person to those disadvantages, who had been courted by all the great Princes of Asia, with multitudes of glori∣ous offers. Others again believed, the contrary faction began to prevail, and had by some means either bribed Farezius to their party, or out∣witted his designs. Neither wanted there a third Company that imagined, the people grew wea∣ry of their own sufferings, by reason of the Ar∣mies free quarter, suspecting the Generalls power & intentions only to make himself & his Souldi∣ers mighty, without looking upon their liberties and prosperity. For a testimony of which as they supposed, the Nobility carried the chief sway in the Senate House, contrary to their desires; how∣ever, certain Trybunes were chosen in the Army, to preferr the rights of the ordinary Souldiers and common people. Whilst these thoughts, or rather fancies were tost to and fro, almost in every mans bosom; for that the whole affairs of the Kingdom were at a stand, and Euarchus seemingly no nearer his en∣largement then the first day he was imprisoned; nay farther off in most opinions: Roxand one
morning, according to her custom (being trou∣bled with more feares than ordinary; for that the Princess her Mistriss, appeared to her imagi∣nation, not a little concerned in the business, since it was not improbable, some sparkles of love joyned with Farezius ambition, might be obsta∣cles against the Kings prosperity) came to enter∣tain her self, within certain groves belonging to the Castle, which were ordered into many de∣lightfull walks, that here and there crossed one another, for the more conveniency of the Com∣pany, that should frequent them for recreation; where long she had not remained, disputing with her doubts and hopes, but she met accidentally with Creses, who seemed to be there with the same intention; they both appeared pleased at the incounter, whereupon Creses quickly asked her after some short salutation, what she thought of the strangeness of these times, so much chang∣ed contrary to both their expectations, when as they looked rather for the King to have been royally received in Sardis, then to have been still continued a prisoner, much less to be pressed with new propositions, dishonourable to his per∣son, and destructive to his authority. Truly my Lord, answered Roxana, as my thoughts are in a Wood about the actions of the times; so no doubt but som mystery waits upō the issue, howe∣ver I must confess my fears outgoe my faith, in any good they mean the Kings power, since both the delayes used, and much more these Articles pre∣sented, are no good Omens to Euarchus prospe∣rity; but take off rather that glory which Fare∣zius
should have obtained to himself, if he had made the Kings restoration to his rights, his first and chiefest work, since by his power and au∣thority, the rest of the necessary affairs of the Kingdom, would in all probability have been better and surer setled, when they should have carried with them both Law and Justice. You are in the right Madam said Creses, wherefore if I may not be thought over tedious to your pati∣ence, I will discourse to you some things which I have not only heard from the Kings own mouth, when I last waited upon him; but other obser∣vations I took when I was in Syria, by which you may make what conjectures you please. So taking the old woman by the hand, he led her to a little banquetting house, not far off for the more privacy; where, after they were both seat∣ed, he made unto her this Relation. Madam said he, first you must understand, that Euarchus the King is opposed in his just govern∣ment, or rather legall authority, by four facti∣ons, that for the present seek to undermine one another, all having absolutely in their hearts, cast off their obedience to the Kings Person and Pre∣rogative. The Senate strives with violence to maintain that jurisdiction, it hath extorted from him; as the Mysians endeavour out of a high covetousness, to be sharers in the Government and Riches of this flourishing Kingdom. Neither wants the Army pretentions, by reason of the ser∣vice they have done in the late Warres, to claim reward and subsistance. And last of all, the weal∣thy City of Sardis, in regard it hath for the most
part furnished the Souldiers and Councell with money, requires to be made a free Town; that is to say, to depend upon no subjection, but what Magistrates created by themselves shall prescribe. This contention of all sides, is the chief occasion as 'tis thought, that makes every thing at a stand, whilst in the mean time, the people seem to cry out, being overburthened with oppressions and payments, which in the end certainly cannot but turn to an absolute confusion, since there is scarce possibility left to satisfie all parties: And thus much shall suffice for the common state of things. Now concerning the proceedings of Syria, which I have most from the Kings own mouth, be pleased to understand, that when he was for∣ced to assemble this great Councel, that hath proved so unfortunate to his happiness, there was sent into Lydia from Philostros an Ambassa∣dor, as Euarchus imagined for his consolation and assistance, against the violent proceedings of his Senate; but presently after his arrivall, he was so far from complying with the Kings occa∣sions, that he kept a frequent correspondence, with those persons that seemed most to oppose his authority; in so much, as the King was con∣strained at last with some violence, not only to forbid him any longer attendance upon his per∣son; but earnestly to desire the State of Syria, to recall him home from all further imployment in Lydia, which setled the thoughts of Euarchus in some quietness, whilst his own victories over his disobedient subjects, and the death both of
Philostros and Orssames, gave the King more then probable hopes of a finall and happy successe in his enterprize, which was againe in a very short time, to reduce all Lydia under his lawfull juris∣diction: but belike the State of Syria following the same maximes of government, under the young son Orsames had left behind him, contrary to all humane expectation, sent presently after the death of Orsames another Ambassador to Euarchus, not only anew to invite him to breake the League which he still continued with the King of Aegypt, but to allow his contesting Senate to be a lawfull and continued Councell by his absolute approba∣tion; thinking belike, that it would better con∣duce to the affaires of Syria, to have Euarchus power limitted, then to suffer him to remaine in his high prerogative: but these demands the King most violently and disdainfully refusing, the Ambassador not only with some seeming discon∣tent took his leave, but as it was thought invited the Myssians againe into Lydia, which hath been as you know the reason of Euarchus overthrow, since the Senates single power, had never probably prevailed against his fortune and successe; how∣ever, the businesse did not yet rest; for after the King had notwithstanding strugled with infinite difficulties, to make good still his declining cause (his son Arethusius Forces also being destroyed in many set Battells, who after fled into Syria to the Queen his Mother) Euarchus was forced to put himselfe under the protection of the Myssians Ar∣my; yet with so little benefit to his affaires, that in a short time after he was delivered in person
into his enemies hands, who treated him with all manner of hardnesse, untill the Army took him violently from that jurisdiction: As this Madam, is the sad particulars I can relate unto you, of the Kings misfortunes and captivity, so may you very well make conjecture of the consequences. Roxana after she had thanked him for his dis∣course, wherein as she said, he had made her ac∣quainted with some passages, she never understood before, yet he should oblige her much more if he would be pleased to deliver his opinion, what might be the intentions of the Syrian State, in thus desiring to lessen, or rather to outward ap∣parence to overthrow the Monarchy of Lydia, since the example seemed of a dangerous conse∣quence for its own government, for that those Subjects might also fall upon the like pretences. Truly answered Creses, what I can say of that Theame is, that either they thinke it more con∣venient for the glory of Syria, to reduce all King∣domes but their owne, into Commonwealths, whereby theirs may appeare to Asia the onely Empire: or they have an intention to make a conquest of ours, by reason of those multitudes of divisions, they see arising amongst our selves; or perhaps they ayme to set up Prince Arethusius in his fathers Kingdome, because he is of the Syrian bloud, whereby they believe they shall purchase both honour and friendship. But if I thought I should not prove over harsh in my unpollisht language, whereby too much to injure your patience by my tedious relation, I would discover yet a story, though acted long
time since, that in my opinion, hath been the ori∣ginall of the sad effects of this last Warre: it will prove the longer, in regard it toucheth the proceedings, not only of the Kingdome of Lydia, but the Countries of Syria and Myssia, that for∣merly have been all three interwoven in dangers, slaughters and civill broyles, by the spightfull proceedings, and factious maximes, of a certaine Priest called Herenzius. Roxana glad to entertaine any conveniency, that might instruct her farther, in the Mysteries of these unlucky times, although many things she had read of Herenzius violent spirit, told Creses, that as no language proceeding from his lips, could prove tedious to any eare how ignorant soever; so did she not doubt, but the consequence of the present affaires, required rather ample sto∣ries, then short descriptions, which gave him a sufficient warrant to use his own pleasure, both for the manner and matter of his discourse, untill his endeavours produced this following relation. You must know said he, that this Priest Heren∣zius some yeares since, when all the world seemed to yeild obedience to the great Flamine of Delphos, as the only Oracle upon earth to prescribe the manner of the worship of the gods, suddenly star∣red up in the Kingdome of Syria, who by reason of an ignominious punishment he had undergone (as twas reported for a hainous offence committed against humane and divine Lawes) began violent∣ly to fall out with heaven and earth; in so much as in the first place, he quarrelled with the forme of the service to the Gods then used; and in the
latter, he denyed Kings and Princes obedience, or rather loyalty from their naturall subjects; To this purpose to execute his malice against all authority, because he had suffered by it; and withall thinking againe in some sort to recover his lost reputation, in doing notable actions, how wicked soever, of a sudden flew to a certaine Towne upon the confines of Arabia, whose peo∣ple had newly, not only disobeyed their Flamine but cast off their government to his authority, which quickly gave him admittance, with his Doctrine, since they knew his opinions suited with their designes; yet being rather friendly enter∣tained, then perfectly established by their wel∣come, his insolency and pride in a short time, ba∣nished him againe from the City, seeing he could not shew temper in his first entrance; and so re∣mained untill the feare of the inhabitants, of com∣ming once more under their old government, for that they understood their Prince prepared for a siege, constrained them, not onely a new to desire his company, whereby to be assisted by his Councell, but were forced to binde themselves by a solemne oath, to submit absolutely their wills to his institutions: with these conditi∣ons he became fully possessed of that power, that gave him opportunity, both to governe as he plea∣sed, and instruct as he listed, untill he had fitted all their thoughts, for the impressions of his de∣signes by the eloquent language, and cunning practices he used, which in a short time so pros∣pered, that many disciples were found of such towardly dispositions, instructed by his princi∣ples,
that he sent many of them also into other Countries, to poyson the peoples loyalties, since obedience is the most assured tye, that probably warrants the safety and prosperity of Kingdomes. But these men having as I said, taken their jour∣neyes with these intentions, the first prevailing progresse they made, was in the Countrey of Myssia, where finding some discontents already ingendring between the young Queen then raign∣ing grandmother to Euarchus: and some factious and ambitious Nobility, soon introduced their new and dangerous opinions, into the hearts of the common people, by which meanes the Lords became also so powerfull by their assistance, that the poore Princesse in a short space, was forced to quit both her Kingdome and Life, a Tragedy too pittifull now to be related, whilst the Rebells took possession of her authority, from which u∣surpation proceedes Lydia's miseries, since by a continuance of the same desires in those people towards her posterity, they have now filled this Kingdome with tumults, troubles, and bloud, the better to make good their own jurisdictions so unlawfully purchased in former times: but how∣ever, these opinions of deposing of Kings, and al∣dering the worship of the gods, prevailed entirely in Myssia, by reason of those crafty and factious actors that Herezius had sent; yet his Doctrine found not so ready acceptance in the Kingdome of Lydia, for that the Queen then raigning, endea∣voured against the violence of all their endea∣vours, both to conserve Monarchy, and main∣taine their Flamines, though the State altered
many Tenents in Doctrine, untill the late agree∣ments of each Nation to oppose Euarchus in the same designe, contrived an accord to extir∣pate in effect both King and Flamines: This may passe my discourse of the Kingdome of Syria, that hath not only formerly borne part in the suffering, by reason of these opinions sowed in the world, but hath been a principall occasion to give the Myssians protection, by whose power Euarchus hath been chiefely destroyed. To which purpose you must understand, that although Herezius other messengers, could not so easily beate downe the strong Walles of Monar∣chy, established by so many ages in Syria, against the power of great Armies alwayes kept in pay by that Nation, yet oftentimes they filled the whole Kingdome with most lamentable slaugh∣ters, to gaine enterance for their opinions, and freedome for their Doctrine; in so much as the Prince himselfe then governing, finding the Tem∣ples overthrowne, his Countrey spoyled, and his Subjects destroyed by the fury of the contention, was forced at last, so farre to give way to the He∣rezians religion in Syria, that they had not only granted them, a free exercise of their consciences throughout all his dominions, but many fortified Townes were delivered into their hands; where∣in they put their owne Garrisons, to secure better this agreement, which both afforded him peace, and seemed to give them satisfaction for the pre∣sent: however, every yeare almost after notwith∣standing these benefits, produced new stirres by that faction, to the disquieting of the Kingdome,
that gave sufficient cause of vexation to many good Princes, since they could not be assured of the loyalty of their obliged Subjects, nor of the continuation of their owne prosperities, when neither graces could win them by reason of the spleen they bore to Monarchy, or power could compell them in regard of those Forts they had in their custody. But to be short, before the great and wise Fa∣vourite Philostros, durst take upon him the huge worke he intended, which was to suppresse the gloriousnesse of the Aegyptian Empire, he imagi∣ned he could not be absolutely safe at home, and so consequently not fitted for so large a conquest, as long as he should leave behind him in his own bosome, so eminent a danger as those he esteemed lawlesse Subjects in Orsames Kingdome, know∣ing they would upon all occasions, be ready to joyne with forraigne Forces, to overthrow their owne Kings government, and therefore resolved first, before he undertooke any new designe, to subdue their power, to the absolute obedience of his great Masters jurisdiction, as in times past it had been to some of his predecessors; to which purpose he not only suddenly besieged the stron∣gest Towne they had in Syria, but within a short space, left them never a Fort in the whole King∣dome, that was not constrained to deliver up the Keyes of its Gates, to the will and pleasure of for∣tunate Orsames, who began to grow great in the opinion of the world, by the conquest of his own Subjects, that were accustomed to give sufficient imployment to other Kings.
However, after that Philostros had made this speedy progresse in glory, as well as in security for his Masters; parant advantage, both in quiet∣ting his Subjects at home, and terrifying his ene∣mies abroad, which proved mighty advantages for those designes he had contrived in his politick braine, because it was not convenient, and scarce safe to continue desperate discontents in so dan∣gerous a body, that had vastly spread it selfe tho∣rough most Countries in Asia, whilst his thoughts and endeavours were otherwise to be imployed; he began by little and little, to smooth his brow towards that sect, and at last not only assured them of his absolute forgetting all faults past, but made many of them chiefe officers and commanders in that Army Orsames provided, to goe against the Aegyptian Forces, wherein he craf∣tily procured a double commodity to his affaires, the one in winning a party he had good cause to suspect, and the other in rendring them ingaged in the quarrell, he intended against Sorastros; be∣sides he was most assured, that they would fight with spleen against that religion by nature they most hated, since the Aegyptians of all others were held obsequious to the rights and ceremonies of Delphos, which also was a meanes to binde the Myssians to the affaires of Syria, since no Nation or people in Asia, professed more violently the same worship of the gods introduced by Horen∣zius, and exercised by his followers in Orsames dominions, which were not onely reasons to tye Philostros to that sect, by all the favours he could procure it in his own Country, whereby to make
them serviceable in the Warres, he had with So∣rastros, but by that meanes gave countenance to the Myssians against Euarchus: their lawfull Prince; which by consequence afforded the Senate of Lydia conveniency also to suppresse his power, that they might not seeme to goe lesse in juris∣diction in mastering their King, then those peo∣ple they had bought with their money, onely to doe them service, so that by this meanes the Fa∣vourite gave worke enough at home to Euarchus, that he should not have the opportunity, although he might have the wil to assist the King of Aegypt, which the pollicy of every Nation requires ac∣cording to some opinions, when a Prince is not able to make good his party against another pre∣vailing Monarch. This Madam as I say, hath been the fate of these mighty Kingdomes, only troubled by the cunning industry of one factious and ambitious Priest, as if the Gods had sent him into the world to let man see his owne frailty; and the rather for that Euarchus not many yeares agoe, appeared so glorious and fortunate in his government, crow∣ned with a flourishing prosperity, in wife, chil∣dren, peace, and power, that he was not only the absolute envy of all Asia, but seemed to carry in his hand the arbitration of the world; being now cast downe into so low, and I may call it misera∣ble condition, by a little faction of his own peo∣ple, that he is not only denyed to be a King, but deprived of the comfort of all that ever was his, with an addition of a sharpe and lasting captivity, according to the discretion sometimes of his
meanest Subjects; whilst in the interim, honour, love, justice, and gratitude seeme to be laid a sleep in the deep Center of the earth, other Princes on∣ly watching to their own preposterous spleen, not considering how soon it may be their fortunes, to fall under the same Fate, for that all men natural∣ly covet liberty; with these words he rested si∣lent with his armes acrosse, as if yet his imagina∣tion, went higher then his tongue was able to ex∣presse. This discourse gave the old woman also some leasure to shed a few teares, in confidering the Kings misfortunes, But as he was proceeding farther, they were both interrupted by the sudden arrivall of the little dwarfe, who told Roxana, that he had been a long time searching her all over the Parke, to informe her, that the Princesse was newly descen∣ded into the garden to take some recreation be∣fore dinner, and desired earnestly her company, to impart something of consequence to her know∣ledge; This gave Roxana no more opportunity, then civilly to thanke Creses for those informati∣ons he had given her, professing againe she was instructed in many things she had never heard be∣fore, that might afford light as she said, to her comportment and conversation, since she was dai∣ly to dispute with some enemy or other in Euar∣chus quarrell; and withall desired him he would be pleased, to put on a resolution often to accom∣pany her in that place, not only for her better in∣formation, but for her Mistresses consolation, which you may be sure was a tickling motive to invite Creses to the service, being perswaded, the
Princesse should partake of his discourse; and love speakes the most effectuall language, though it want never so much probability to enjoy, Roxana when she came into the Garden, shee found the Princesse retired into a close walk, de∣fended by interwoven branches of green leaves from the Sunnes oppression, which also obscured her in some sort from the fight of her attendants; so that the old woman had occasion given her by that retirement, to believe new accidents had cau∣sed the solitude: Wherefore approaching at a neerer distance, she might perceive a paper in Clo∣rias hand, whilst she stood still lifting up her faire eyes to the heavens, then againe cast them downe upon the ground, and in this posture ad∣vanced two or three steps, with a kinde of a vio∣lent motion; this continued Roxana the lon∣ger before she discovered her being there, untill the Princesse turning that way, she was necessarily invited to present her selfe; however she had not come neere her by a few paces, but Cloria with a deepe sigh, instead of other expressions, cast her the paper she held, which the old woman present∣ly reading, found it spake this matter: MAdam, As I should not for a long season, have omitted those services due to your person by many visits, that my love and your vertues required, if the distempers of these times, had not proved pro∣hibitions beyond my ability to resist, since I durst not contend with the power of the Generall, whose will I found absolutely obeyed: so now having an unex∣pected occasion to give you advertisement, I cannot a∣gaine
but present my deere affections to your sacred selfe, hoping that my former love is not altogether out of your remembrance, not onely since the Senate begins anew to possesse themselves of their ancient authority, but that the King your father is lately fled from the protection of the Army, though by whose meanes, or to what region cannot yet be learned by any exami∣nation. Your most humble Servant, and faithfull Lover, CASSIANUS. Roxana after she had read the Letter, stood still sometime in a Muse, untill at last passionately she broake out into these words: Truly Madam said she, as I cannot but smile at the former part of the writing, so must I needs wonder at the lat∣ter, since it seemeth as preposterous, Prince Cassia∣nus should after a long silence, attempt your love, when hee remained quiet during the Generals supposed greatnesse, as it appeares stranger to my thoughts, the King hath now removed his Quarters, when he was supposed secure in Fa∣rezius protection. But alasse said Cloria, I rather marvell whither my Father can possibly be fled to purchase more hopes, for that all the King∣dome is probably out of his jurisdiction; there∣fore I should be glad to flatter my selfe with some opinions, that the designe was undertaken upon good grounds. As I cannot promise that answe∣red Roxana, yet certainly the King being so wise, would never have ventured upon such a dange∣rous attempt, without long consideration and assured friends to conduct him to his journeyes
end; but if I may rove according to my wilde imagination, either he is gone into Syria, since I cannot believe he would any more trust his person with the Myssians, who have divers times deceived him: or is invited into Creet by his Subjects there in Armes against the Senate, the better to make good their cause against the new Lydian Forces, preparing to bring them speedily under subjection. The gods will be done said the poore Princesse, but I feare the worst; These discourses brought them to the rest of the company in the Garden, to make them also sharers of the unex∣pected newes. Roxana the next morning had scarce leasure given her to welcome the day, when she was ad∣vertised by a messenger sent from Creses, that within two houres space, he would attend her if she pleased, at the banquetting house amongst the Woods, not only to finish out the rest of their dis∣course, but also to let her know other passages worth her acceptance. The old Matron concei∣ving, it was some intelligence more particular concerning the Kings departure, sent him thanks, and promised with all diligence to wait upon the summons, which she performed a pretty while before Creses arrivall, that gave her opportunity to examine her own imagination; but it was not long before she was interrupted by his appea∣rance, which with a few ceremonies seated them both together as the day before, whilst Creses used this language. Though I may suppose (said he) you have heard something of the Kings departure from
under the protection of the Army; yet perhaps you have not as yet been enformed of the reasons and particulars of his retirement; or rather I may call it an escape, since he was perswaded it would be for his better safty: Roxana confessing, she knew nothing of the manner much lesse the cause, though common fame had brought the re∣port to her eares; Creses gave her this farther ac∣count of the passage, according to the relation he had from an officer intrusted in the service as he said. The King said he, being not only suspitious of the security of his person, by reason of the many divisions of opinion in the Campe; some desi∣ring a Prince, others none; especially considering the diversity of humours amongst the common Souldiers, who generally laboured for an univer∣sall equality, as also being credibly enformed that unlesse he would presently condescend to those propositions formerly sent unto him, with the addition of some priviledges demanded that were more destructive to his Crowne and dignity, he should infallibly be murthered, he was constrained to this sudden retirement: however I must tell you these rumours were given out as 'twas belie∣ved, only to fright him to seek another station, where he might be againe imprisoned with some colour and better security, as pretending his in∣tention was to escape out of the Armies juris∣diction and power: so that the poore King fin∣ding causes enough for a suspition, acquainted two of his servants both with his feares and in∣tentions, who to be short, perswaded him to fly
to an Island upon the borders of Caria, where re∣maines as governour a valiant commander, though formerly imployed by the Senate, yet at the present was conceived to be wholly at the dis∣pose of Farezius and the Army: this Captaine they assured him would be entirely faithfull to his designes, though upon what grounds I can neither informe you or satisfie my selfe, since the consequence proved otherwise: for no sooner was the King arrived under his jurisdiction, but he entertained him not only with a sad and sowre countenance, but after he had secured his person in the Castle, and sent away his two officers, he presently gave information to the Senate of all the proceedings, desiring further directions in what manner he should be treated; though he carries still in his demeanour, a kinde of a reve∣rence to his dignity: all these passages as I told you before, I have from one of those persons new∣ly returned, that accompanied him in the journey, with this advertizement also that before the Kings departure from the Campe, he left in his chamber under his own hand, the reason of his feares and his escape: all which Madam I may say is in such a mist, that no lesse a knowledge then some divine Oracle can informe us concer∣ning the certainty of the mystery: only we may be confident that Euarchus hath imployment e∣nough for his courage and patience: At these words Roxana wept againe with the very sence of the Kings dangers and miseries: Nay said Cre∣ses, his suffering of all sides are so extreame, that notwithstanding he hath sent to Farezius and
offered to accord every difference and interest in the Kingdome, being heard; yet neither the Ge∣nerall nor Senate will entertaine the motion, or allow him that priviledge, fearing belike he should speak too much reason to render his Sub∣jects satisfied, whereby they might be endangered to lose that authority which now they possesse without contradiction. But said Roxana, why doe the common people desire violently no King, since Euarchus shewes such testimonies of his goodnesse? Truly said Creses, as that opinion in the Generall is erronious, since all be not of that faction, so of the other side, there be too many that wish an universall equality, not considering the confusion it would bring upon the whole Kingdome, being as it were bewitched with an ignorant pride; for most of them by such a parity, would be in more slavery then they are now, since they could never be capable of any command, and necessarily must obey those that would go∣verne with more rigour, though elected from a∣mongst themselves: besides they are now so weary of the Senates rule in the same posture, ha∣ving had some experience of their managing af∣faires hitherto, that they believe their owne cure can proceed from nothing but desperate change, which is incident to all distempered minds; since they that could not be well under Euarchus pea∣ceable government, wherein they enjoyed all wealth and prosperity (though no doubt but there was some abuses) certainly now will not rest satisfied when they shall feele nothing but want, oppression, and instability; besides many
feare that things are not yet at the worst, when so many contrary interests with violence seeme to contend. These discourses brought them both at last in dispute, whether active valour, or passive courage were the greater vertue, in that Euarchus seemed to possesse them in a high kinde. But Creses who had a dainty wit, defended the latter with these arguments: first said he, before we can well consider what hath been the Kings suffe∣rances, we must rightly state his misfortunes, which will appeare to be the greater, when it is well knowne to the world, he hath alwayes shew∣ed courage in the Warres, by venturing boldly his person upon all occasions, as also eloquence and judgement both by his Pen and language, when those faculties of Art and Nature were thought necessary and usefull; a plaine demon∣stration that he wants not sense and knowledge fully to apprehend his own oppressions: and the rather may it be so thought, for that those who have most gaiued by his favours, the ungratefull Myssians, with some others of his owne Court, have been the chiefe Instruments, or rather I may say the only cause that have deprived him not only of the priviledge of his royall Crowne, but of all the personall happinesses he enjoyed in his prosperity; besides his want of liberty now at last to make up the full Catastrophe of his misery, none almost giving eare to his complaints, or pittying his captivity: though they have separated him from his beloved Queene, in whose beauty and vertues he took an unspeakable felicity, as also the comfort of beholding his sweet children, be∣ing
a reall part of himselfe, which the gods and nature have ordained to man as a humane right; accompanied with the detention of his revenues that should maintaine him and them: besides prosecuting him with as many slanders as they can invent. This Madam as it may be supposed, being the true condition of Euarchus misfortune, it may easily be conjectured, his sufferings are equall, if not goe beyond example, and yet his noble heart holds out still to endure as you see, what malice can invent without breaking; who notwithstan∣ding offers love, mercy and patience to his whole Kingdome and worst injurers: things being in this posture I shall proceed to the making good of my promised argument; which is, that passive courage is a greater vertue then active valour; if my discourses doe not seeme too tedious for your more necessary imployment. As I must call the Kings constancy a noble for∣titude, since he hath neither Subject of hope, nor object of diversion, so certainly is it the highest magnanimity for a Prince to suffer patiently and without confusion from his own Subjects that owe him duty and gratitude; for those men that hazzard their lives freely in desperate services, ei∣ther ayme at victory or conquest, by which they intend to purchase gaine or glory, which enflames their blouds with continuall agitation, that scarce gives leasure to reflect upon the dangers, much lesse time for cold and apprehensive considerati∣on; and yet we see such have for the most part need of noyse of drums and sound of Trumpets to
waken their courages, or lay asleep their feares, to continue them better in action, whereas suffe∣ring hath nothing to helpe or comfort it, since the minde is still prepared to entertaine the misery it sustaineth, with a pale expectation of the same or worse, when as I say it is known it must be en∣dured without hope, having no diversion: like a person sick in the night, wanting objects of va∣riety, thinks that season longer and his torment greater by much then in the day time; for where the minde is kept high by ambition to compasse something it coveteth, it hath power enough in that interim to hold up the body from falling to its proper center the earth, where naturally it in∣clines: but being without comfort, if a man doe not make strong use of his noble part his soul, to maintaine his courage and resolution, the suffe∣ring or captivating of flesh and bloud, will ren∣der a man quickly totally overcome, and that is the reason that long and tedious persecutions have destroyed more competent spirits, then sharp and violent tortures, since they were prepared for the one with expectation, and only weared by the other with continuance. We know that old men strive more greedily to preserve their lives that short time they are to live, then young men in their most flourishing yeares; because diversity of prospects operates so much in youthfull bosomes, by reason of continuall activity, tending that way, that they have not leasure to settle their imagina∣tions upon horrid apprehension; when old peo∣ple have so much time to think (wanting power of action) that the object which is naturall ap∣peares
often before their eyes to fright them, and so fares it with a person that only suffers, in com∣parison of him that doth both suffer and act to∣gether: wherefore that person hath need of a dou∣ble courage, because there is nothing to accom∣pany his thoughts of variety or diversion; for certainly it pleaseth a man rather to contend for his life, though he know he shall be deprived of it, then to lose it without any strife at all; which seemes to be the case of Euarchus, since they will not so much as permit him with reason to dis∣pute his rights, but force him unheard to deliver up his Crowne: and more grievous a great deale is his condition, in that he appeares to be left of all those friends that have been most obliged to his goodnesse. What is the reason that a delin∣quent upon the Scaffold is accustomed to have his eyes banded before the stroake of death, to take away from him the apprehension of the blow which he knowes he shall receive? When a vali∣ant Souldier in the Field without shaddow will charge against a thousand weapons, with as much certainty of destruction, but because the ones acti∣on frees him from the others terrour: All which shew, that a sad expectation of an ill, augments the suffering, when a diversion by imployment of the body, or busying the senses by diversity of ob∣jects, take away that apprehension that makes any danger or misery excessively horrid; as for exam∣ple, men for the most part are put to torture in uncouth places, where there is nothing but si∣lence, or low whispers, to render the sufferer more sensible of the paine, by the quieting of the imagi∣nation;
and so it fares with such as passe through darke places, being afraid of every small rustle, when in the day time, the same way perhaps is pleasant; so that as I say without doubt, all smart, griefe, and discontent is encreased by want of action and too much leasure for consideration; for I must conclude, that it is a great deale easier for a person to dye fighting in the Field, though he should be cut in sunder in a thousand pieces, then to endure a long and tedious captivity, which is Euarchus present condition; in so much as at last if he should in some sort yield to this cruelty, I must not finde fault with his courage, but if he gaine the victory, I shall esteeme him a miracle of nature. As I must not said Roxana, goe about to dis∣prove your arguments grounded upon such rea∣sons, and more delivered by the knowne autho∣rity of your excellent judgement, so of the other fide, I could wish the King had some Counsell to assist him in these difficulties besides his own ca∣pacity and courage, since it is impossible but hu∣mane nature at the length will be tired with over much suffering, and by consequence faile for want of true information: there is no contradicti∣on of your opinion said Creses, but such is the crafty spight of some, that they will permit none to be about the Kings person that dares loyally afford him any profitable consolation, because they may the sooner bring him to consent to their desires: Yet replyed Roxana, it is not well known what those desires are, since they never durst for all I could ever learne, publickly declare their in∣tentions,
but doe as it were in a dark mist endea∣vour to possesse the people, that the King refuseth something he is obliged to grant for the good of his Subjects; by which meanes they strive still to maintaine their credits and opinions amongst the common sort. It is so Madam said Creses; howe∣ver since you are fallen upon that point, I shall let you know, how farre the King hath yet condis∣cended to their demands, whereby the better to dispossesse the People of that beliefe they are per∣swaded to have in the Senates integrity, though I verily thinke, they now more feare their power, then trust their intentions; for whereas not many dayes agoe, they proposed to Euarchus to have the power of the force of the Kingdome for twen∣ty yeares both by Sea and Land, the King hath yielded to grant them that jurisdiction during his life, though not for that terme, which appears now to be the greatest difference between them, since the Senate seemes not content with this offer: whereupon the Myssians have lately put out a furious declaration against the Senate pres∣sing the King to such unreasonable conditions: In good earnest answered Roxana, I cannot tell, whether I have more cause to smile at the see∣ming ridiculousnesse of these proceedings, or be amazed to see men growne so foolishly unreaso∣nable, since Euarchus appeares to my understan∣ding, to be willing to part with more from his own hopes, then what the Senate requires; for that if he grant the power of the Kingdome out of his hands during his life, it gives more assurance to the Senate that he intends no more to raigne,
if he had quitted his power for so many yeares only, since he might have some thought to over live that prescribed terme; againe for the Myssians I wonder most of all at their new loyalty to their Prince, when they have been as I may say, the on∣ly cause that hath made him no King, though now anew, they seeme to desire to re-establish him in his ancient authority, which certainly cannot be but upon other designes of advantage to themselves, more then for Euarchus prospe∣rity. Truly Madam said Creses, in the generall it is as you say, but yet there are so many mysteries hid under these proceedings, that they are capable to deceive the sharpest judgement, if some light be not given by information: Wherefore you must know that both Euarchus and the Senate know very well, that the consequence of all the Affaires, chiefly depend upon the assurance of the safety of the Kings person, since he can never hope to be againe re-established in his rightfull authority, but either by the humours and inconstancy of the common people, who when they finde the Kings absolute oppression brings no prosperity to them, will probably become exasperated against the Se∣nates proceedings and power, or by an unrecon∣cilable difference betweene the Senators them∣selves, who may most command when they shall finde no other jurisdiction to oppose them: both which in all likelihood will conduce to the Kings benefit, if he sit quiet sometime under his inju∣ries, which I conceive to be the reason that he hath in outward appearance yielded so much to
their demands. And for the Myssians perhaps by this opposition they would perswade the world to a beliefe of their integrities, as if at the first they consented not to the Kings hard usage, whereby to obtaine a greater party, not only in the Kingdome of Lydia, if they have an intenti∣on to dispute their own profit: but in other Countries if they meane to make Warre upon our people, because they cannot be sharers in the go∣vernment as they hoped, the only cause certainly of the now seeming quarrell; so that in my opi∣nion Euarchus hath done like a wise and politick Prince, in seeming not to contend, where he was sure not to prevaile, especially since by the dis∣pute, he might have endangered those hearts that will now be of his side, if the occasion be offered, either out of pitty to his sufferings, or our of hate to the Senates government; And besides, it is to be considered, that no act he shall passe in this condition of constraint, can binde either himselfe or posterity by all humane and divine lawes, if his Sword ever become more powerfull: in the meane time, the Senate will seek to preserve the Kings life and person with their best care, since their own authority falls entirely by his death, which as I say is the reason they desire more a terme of yeares in the continuation of thier re∣quired government, then the determinable fate of the Princes life, because they may have al∣wayes the liberty to presse him to new conditi∣ons, if they finde by experience they have not yet obtained sufficient, since they shall not need to feare the vexations of his person, may bring any hazard upon him.
I cannot deny said Roxana, but these reasons are sufficient to render me wholly satisfied in my doubtfull opinions, but the gods are only capable to foresee the event of things. And with that loo∣king upon the Sun, she perceived the time of the day called her to the attendance of the Princesse, which made her for the present take her leave. Upon her arrivall she found Cloria only accom∣panied by her Lute in a small withdrawing room belonging to her own chamber, where none but her selfe had permission to be admitted: not long after she had saluted the Princesse, she discovered she had been weeping, by the red circles about her eyes, that gave the old woman occasion fur∣ther to be inquisitive after her imployment; un∣till she spyed this complaining ditty lying written before her upon the Table, that quickly gave her satisfaction of the occasion, though her excellent voyce and rare skill rendred the Musick heavenly. Is Justice could some favour finde, Or were not rather truly blind; Ambition sure durst never weare, The spoyles of such a vertue heare, When every houre Doth need her power To set both Crownes and Kingdomes free. For love I see is but a flame That onely beares a constant name; And is by interest as a wave, Tost here and there as others crave, If objects seeme
Of more esteeme To summon sense unto the call. But whatsoever dwells more high, Shoote but your Commets from the skie, Against the hate that mortalls beare, To such as lawfull Scepters weare, And wee'l adore For evermore That action as a Di Yet whilst that fate and pride contend, Whether shall conquer at the end, The Gods themselves have cause to feare; A revolution of the Spheare, And then like we May Martyrs be In the vast Chaos of the fall. But the Princesse after she had made an end of her Musicke, began with many complaints and more sighes to blame absent Narcissus for his too much negligence in his love, since in all this time of her last restraint he had not found as she said some disguise to visit her person, though he might want the power to procure her liberty; which she continued with a certaine passion, un∣till Roxana not only chid her for those sad ex∣pressions, that as she told her had destroyed in part the ravishing delight of her song, but seemed un∣just in accusing her servant, that had in so many dangerous adventures shewed alwayes the entire constancy of his affection, who was no doubt at
the present retired into some region, where he might best advantage her service. However Cloria was willing upon any hopes, to be satisfied with the proceedings of Narcissus, and much more with his intentions; yet could she not but tell Roxana, that although she was pleased to be his advocate that seemed to have a powerfull perswa∣sion in her beliefe, yet were the loves she feared from Farezius, and the importunities she expected of Cassianus, in her apprehension, arguments suffi∣cient to make her think Narcissus wanted much diligence, at leastwise violence, that he did not endeavour to scale the very Walles where she re∣mained a prisoner, rather then to endure her to be so injured. Truly Madam answered Roxana, as I cannot tell why you should expect miracles instead of services, so have you no cause to doubt the importunities you mention, since I am not certaine Farezius love was ever presented to your liking: either from himselfe, or any of his instru∣ments; And for the Addresses of Cassianus, you have been already so accustomed to refusals, that I conceive you have not any other hard part to play then to continue the same course still. Be∣sides, you may well remember by Cassianus own Letter, that his affections are not so hot, as to presse you upon over great inconveniences; and therefore, in my opinion you may very well quiet your thoughts concerning his courtships. O Roxana said the Princesse, you are much de∣ceived in both these particulars, for as to my knowledge (which I have understood since I saw you last) Farezius hath already intimated his de∣sire
to my father, whom you may be sure will comply almost in any thing that concernes the Generall, So doth Cassianus labour the Senate underhand, to be propitious to his love, since as he sayes, their own honours are ingaged in the issue, for that the world takes notice of their pro∣testations, which are to see him established in a prosperous condition both in power and affecti∣on: And the rather as retends for that they formerly sent for him, according to their professi∣ons, to see them put in execution. Roxana re∣plyed, as there be many reasons of sufficient force to make me give way to your opinions, since your own beauty, honour, and vertues are loadstones attractive enough to intangle all the world in an intricate labyrinth of love and desire, notwith∣standing what difficulties soever, yet it cannot but seeme most strange to my thoughts, that Fa∣rezius low condition, though his fortune hath been eminent, should aspire to such a supreame excellency with any hope to enjoy. Hold your selfe content woman said the Princesse, there is no limitation of selfe-love and ambition, when they have once taken possession of a proud heart, though covered with never so meane an extracti∣on; And you know that Farezius is a gentleman, which joyned with his former successe in the Warres, and his present command now in the Ar∣my, cannot want perswasions to make him at∣tempt any enterprize for his own glory, especially since the King seemes meerly to depend upon his assistance, or allowance for his future prosperity; and being so, what counsell can you give me ei∣ther
to prevent his violence or instruct his passion, since I dare not be too bold, in hazarding my fa∣thers fortunes by provoking the Generalls spleen by a harsh and disdainefull deniall. In good sooth said Roxana, I am very glad to see, you have learned some temper since you were in the possession of Osiris, where as you may re∣member, I had much adoe to perswade you to entertaine reason, or tinue you in patience, wishing then, you had harded a thousand deaths rather then have dissembled your love in any kinde; but perhaps Narcissus is now farther from your remembrance, though neerer your person. No by all the immortall gods answered the sweet Princesse, my affection is as pure and constant as it was in Osiris Court, if not encreased by the ef∣fects of more tryalls to render it absolutely judi∣tious, only the consideration of my fathers present captivity, and future danger makes me so farre willing to dispence with my own deare love, as to maske it over with some hypocrisie, for his sake, which formerly I was unwilling to purchase with the assurance of my own life, when I remai∣ned in the City of Memphis; only the considera∣tion of a necessarily jealousie in Narcissus breast, when rumours shall bring such reports to his ab∣sent eares, I must confesse something deterres my resolution, from any dissimulation at all in love, though no way prejudicially to his right or my own honour. Indeed Madam said Roxana, I doe not now only, begin to love you for your wisdome, but will endeavour to put a project into your head,
that may both keep your father safe, and perhaps destroy your enemies, at leastwise it will protract if not divert your violent prosecution; certainly governesse answered the Princesse, if you prove as good as your word, I shall esteeme it the greatest piece of service that ever your wits produced, since in my opinion, it not only equalls all others in benefit, for that the King as well as my selfe is concerned in the businesse, but out goes the rest in difficulty, considering how many powerfull adversaries you have to deale withall. Well then said Roxana, sit still and heare my propositions, and afterwards prepare your selfe without resist∣ance to put them in execution, though never so much against your appetite; if not returne me such arguments as may convert my judgement as well as satisfie your own fancy: Cloria told Roxa∣na that her injunction was so reasonable, that it was not to be contradicted by any that had com∣mon sense, or was not desperate against their own good, promising withall to be punctuall in her obedience, as a principall duty she esteemed her selfe bound unto, in regard of that charge she had had ever since her infancy over her, and then the old woman began this discourse. For these two Suitors said she, that seem like∣ly to trouble your patience, and the Kingdomes quiet, since the one commands the Army, as the other is possest of the hearts of the Senate, I make no doubt, but you may oppose their owne interest one against the other, if you can dissemblingly but entertaine the love of ei∣ther; by which jealousie certainly there must
needes rise discontents and factions towards your safety and fathers advantage; for if you entertain the addresses of Cassianus, the Souldiers will think their Generall undervalued, who appeares now to the publike view to carry upon the point of his Sword the absolute power and strength of the whole Kingdome; And if you accept of Farezius Courtships, no doubt but the Senate will esteeme their own authorities dishonoured, since they have proposed Prince Cassianus to be the subject of their chiefe care: Besides, if Farezius should faile in any thing he attempts, many of the com∣mon people would conceive with some violence, that the Senate hath an intention to couzen them out of those priviledges, they have been promised when their greatest patron shall be debarred of his own desires, and if Cassianus should misse of what he hath hitherto expected by the Senates liberall offers, the Nobility might very well imagine, that the people and Army endeavoured to be∣come their Masters, which would not be lessened by other jealousies already growing between the two factions, since the Nobility doth not onely with all the secret policy they can, seek to curbe the insolency of the common sort, who strive for nothing more, then to bring down all dignity to an universall equallity, but the multitude have already so farre declared their dislike of the Lords proceedings, that publikely they have required to have the authority of their jurisdiction taken a∣way, and made lyable to the peoples allowance, who now enjoy their priviledges by inheritance from their Ancestors, purchased either by their
own merits, or the Princes grace. And last of all, though the factions of the two Rivalls should not enflame at the particular disgrace of either Cassianus or Farezins, yet certainly their owne Swords in a private combate would be very like∣ly to decide the quarrell, which would give you a faire pretence to refuse the Survivor that should covet to imbrace you with hands imbrued in bloud. Governesse answered the Princesse, although I should be very glad to be an occasion to raise any faction for my own present advantage, and my fathers future prosperity, yet I cannot deny but I am most extream sorry to heare of new troubles, whereby the Kingdome should be engaged in more slaughters. You are very pittifull replyed Roxana, but I pray consider, whether it be not better to procure the discomposure of those that have sought all this time by their authority to establish another government, destructive to Mo∣narchy, whereby of necessity a generall confusion must follow, for that it is not probable so many interests can be satisfied, or give occasion to pre∣pare Lydia for the conquest of forraigne Forces, since it is impossible your fathers many children would be content to sit downe quietly with the perpetuall losse of their owne Birth-rights extor∣ted from the King by his unruly Subjects, during their minorities, and able enough certainly they will be to contend for their dues, seeing all the Princes of Asia are interessed as well in the exam∣ple as in their bloud. No, no Madam said she, ra∣ther dispence with your unprofitable commisera∣tion
then be carelesse of future safety, for it will be much better now to destroy these unlawfull designes by a little civill Warres amongst them∣selves, that would but purge the Kingdome of its corrupt humours, ingendred by excesse in pride and prosperity, then in the times to come to ex∣pose all conditions to a perpetuall slavery, under a Tyrannicall government, gained by the power of lawlesse Souldiers, brought in by other Princes not acquainted with the natures of our people, much lesse senfible of their sufferings, since they will only consider their faults past, and not looke upon their miseries present, for they would ra∣ther judge them by the manner of subjection of their own Countrey, then by the sweetnesse of the Lydian Lawes: Wherefore I say you must thinke, whether of the two Suitors you will make the object of your choyce, to render the other jealous of his actions and your favours, whereby some sudden difference may arise between the factions to bring the sooner confusion into the Kingdome, which certainly is the readiest way againe to establish your father in his right, since the noyse of forraigne power at present, will not only be an occasion the better to unite them to∣gether to the Kings disadvantage, but at the best, hazard the destruction of all property and go∣vernment, since the Sword will be the principall Arbitrator of every mans right, and the victory a change of his condition. Truly Roxana said the Princesse, as I cannot in my own reason esteeme your discourse apocry∣phall, so of the other side, you cannot deny, but
that I have been ever willing in all my necessities to follow your Counsell, and therefore since you have prescribed the Law; certainly the election will be easie; for considering that Farezius hath not yet publikely pretended to my love, at least∣wise by any expressions to my selfe, me thinks it would appeare some injustice for me to refuse Cassianus Courtships, who hath already as you know a kinde of an ingagement from my own mouth concerning the old Flamine, though he be since destroyed: besides his bloud, Titles, and condition, more suite with my honour and pro∣fessions, in which the Nobility of the Kingdome will have the greater share, whose dignities cer∣tainly if it were not for particular ends, would preserve Monarchy; whereas the people and com∣mon Souldiers endeavour nothing more then to destroy it from the face of the earth. Why then Princesse said Roxana, if you be so resolved, I must give you your lesson; but first I will tell you of a third Suitor, who also as best deserving must have some imployment, and that is Creses; one whose affection might merit a re∣quitall with your love, if your other engage∣ments, and his own disproportion were not ob∣stacles beyond removall: however, it is your part to trust his fidelity, and reward his trust, especi∣ally since his endeavours may bring you advan∣tage as well as himselfe preferment. Wherefore I will designe him to this office though he be not yet privy to my intentions, which is presently to make a Journey into Syria, where the Queene your Mother, and the Prince your brother both
remaine, to expect the pleasure of that State con∣cerning your fathers affaires, by which meanes he shall more particularly be able to informe them concerning the Mystery of your resolutions that may render the assistance they shall be willing to lend more advantageable, and the rather for that I understand the Countrey of Syria, still en∣tertaines an Ambassadour with the Myssians, whose force certainly will conduce much to our projects, if they can be made faithfull to Euar∣chus good, since the least power will infinitely strengthen the faction that shall shew it selfe for the King or his sonne; and in the Journey I in∣tend Creses shall visit the Cretans see whether they may also be wrought to joyne with our par∣ty here at home, which is not improbable, since peace and settlement in Lydia will be an over∣throw to their prosperities, for that those people by this Kingdome are esteemed no other then pernitious rebells: And let Creses alone to act his part when he is sufficiently enformed of our de∣sires, whose sharpe wit and excellent language, cannot be equalled by any messenger can be sent, which are fortunate properties to our purpose; besides his intire love to your sacred selfe, will be alwayes sure to continue him absolutely faith∣full, which afterward must be rewarded, either by your fathers fortunes, or the Queenes interest in Syria. Without doubt Governesse said Cloria, you have hit upon a right plot, and the rather for that I heare by a late edict sent from the Senate (as it should seeme upon the Kings flight) they have not
onely banished out of the City of Sardis, all my fathers friends in generall, but Creses in particular, as conceiving him extraordinarily interessed in the Kings counsell and affaires, for that he brought as you know to the Senate the first propositions of his and the Armies desires. Then Madam said Roxana, your next worke must be, anew to invite Prince Cassianus, by some hopes of your acceptance of his offered Love, which may conveniently be grounded upon the late Letter he sent you, that you have not yet an∣swered, as also upon your discourse to him, when he shewed both affection and diligence in sa∣ving the old Flamines life at your request, in which service you exprest so much liking to his person and vertues, that you profest him the next person in your thoughts to Narcissus engagement, whom he will not be perswaded is living: and I shall be very glad still to continue him in that er∣rour, untill the designes we have in hand may happily be brought to some fortunate issue, by which meanes Farezius may be spoyled of the peoples affections, and bereaved of the power of the Army, that now seemes to carry him up be∣yond all other authorities, and so consequently enflames his thoughts above opposition, in what he shall propose, much lesse wish; though truly for my part I believe, he hath a strong faction against him, not only by the Nobility by reason of Dimogoras disgrace, and many of the chiefe Se∣nars fearing their own power, but also in divers Provinces where he hath so long a space quarte∣red his Souldiers without removall, though their
own desires in taking away the power from the Lords and destroying the Kings regality, yet hin∣ders them from complaining. Well, well said Cloria, as we must leave time to discover these hidden mysteries, so will I addresse my selfe to put in execution what your wisdome hath prescribed, and to that purpose must enjoyn you to remaine here in my absence, untill an houres space give you releasement; in which inte∣rim I shall endeavour to contrive a Letter to Cas∣sianus (in answer to his he sent me the other day) convenient for our designe. But scarce had the Princesse remained in her private Cabinet the time limitted by her words, but she brought forth a Letter imprinted in a faire character, but writ∣ten by a much fairer hand, which she giving to Roxana to reade, it spake this language. COusin, Although I can no way doubt of your af∣fection, by reason of so many protestations you have made upon all occasions, able to convert any misbeliever from the strongest opinion to the contrary, since otherwise honour as well as religion, should ex∣treamely suffer by so much falshood; yet whether that love or no be of so noble a quality as to merit my re∣gard, is scarce a question, when you dare not before the face of any enemy, own these professions you have so often uttered: Alas, alas Cassianus, to what a mi∣serable condition am I brought, when he that my heart would pleasure, is afraid to receive the favour, because he that I have no will to love, is pleased to be angry? What dazeling beames proceeding from Fa∣rezius greatnesse, have power to captivate the soule
of so Illustrious a Prince, whose antient bloud hath filled the veynes of all the mighty houses in Asia with lustre and renowne? If I be growne lesse in vertue then I was, when you first made those large tenders, you ought to expresse wherein, that I might defend my reputation; but if your inconstancy proceed from fan∣cy, or want of courage, you cannot expect I should re∣maine the same, CLORIA. When Roxana had read the Letter, she told the Princesse, that as she did approve the manner of her writing, since it wanted not force to stirre up the coldest courage to that violence which was necessary for their purpose, so did it not give much advantage for future engagement; but however Cloria was not able to heare her words without letting fall a few gentle Teares, not only to shew, that her heart consented not to the hypo∣crisie, but her soule melted at the remembrance of her absent love, though she meant no way to prejudice his interest; and in this sorrowfull po∣sture, gave her governesse commission to send a∣way the paper; whilst she her selfe quickly retired into her own chamber, at leastwise to content her thoughts with those hopes she had been perswa∣ded to entertaine by Roxana's discourse, though not many dayes did she spend in diversity of con∣templations, before she received this answer from Cassianus, MOst admirable Princesse, as I cannot but con∣firme my former protestations by a thousand
other new oathes, not onely to re-assure you of my fi∣delity in those pure affections I firsi offered upon the Altar of myheart to your sacred perfections, but must conjure your beliese by all the powerfull spells of ho∣nour and justice, to be confident that neither the feare of Farezius greatnesse, or doubt of my owne safety, could give the occasion to lessen those respects so justly due from my love to your worth, since I not onely hold the Generalls person of too low a consideration for my thoughts, which are alwayes imployed upon that high subject your excellent selfe, but my life to be of too small a value to be lost in any thing that can possibly be named your concernment. No deare Madam, it was nothing lesse then the horrour my imagination ap∣prehended to suspect your unvaluable person might be in some danger by the unjust jealousie of the proud Ge∣neralls feares, to see you adored by any interest, and withall no small doubt, least your royall fathers rights might againe be restrained by his rage, when he should perceive a forraigne Prince of his own bloud, began new addresses without his leave to any of his posterity, since I believed Farezius aymed alone at the honour to doe the King justice: but now finding he hath not onely changed the opinion with his fortune; but that I have a releasement by the powerfull war∣rant of your pen, the gods shall not with-hold my fury from performing those services wherein I will esteeme death a purchase, if the faire Cloria doe but own the Sacrifice of offered CASSIANUS. The Princesse could not chuse but reade this Letter with a little kind of trembling, as if she
feared what she did not doubt, since the worst she was to expect, as she thought from Cassianus, was to comply with her desire; but it is the nature of all passion, to produce new violences, whether in those things we wish or others we would not have. And so it fared with sweet Cloria, who in a man∣ner dreaded what she had designed to be, because it came. But after a lovely smile had taken pos∣session of that countenance, that for a while put on some distraction, she told her governesse, that although their plot in all apparance had thus far well succeeded, since she perceived her Cousin was wonne to be sufficiently valiant; yet she made some question how she was to entertaine his pre∣sence, when he should make his addresses; for if she should as she said, give him but ordinary wel∣come, he might againe fall back from his seeming fury against Farezius; and if too well, he might expect some greater engagement then was con∣venient for her to grant. Truly Madam answered Roxana, make no scruple to let him have as much as you can spare upon the old score, since my Lord Narcissus appearance at any time, will ab∣solutely blot out the obligation, which you know were the first conditions you treated upon in sa∣ving the old Flamines life. I but said Cloria, I should be very sorry any suspected testimony did remaine, that so much as intimated my thoughts could ever be perswaded to another choyce. In good sooth said the old woman; your conscience is so tender in matters of love, that I believe when you are married to your servant, you will make a doubt, whether he be the same man or no, and by
that meanes call your affection in question to the raising of some desperate jealousie between you. At these words the Princesse smil'd, but was pre∣vented in her reply, by the information she recei∣ved, that her dinner waited her pleasure. It was not long after this discourse before Cas∣sianus himselfe in person came into the Princesse Lodgings, not only in confirmation of the truth of his Letter he had sent, but as it were according to his profession to obraide Farezius suspected, if not pretended love, although Cloria for that pre∣sent, was so busied by reason of some imployment in her chamber with her maid servants, that Roxana was constrained with some complements not only to give him entertainment, but to make her Mistresses excuse, which at last seated them both in a withdrawing roome belonging to the Princesses lodgings, and that conveniences drew on many discourses; amongst which Cassianus was perswaded by the old womans desires, to re∣late the passages of his own fortunes, with the rest of the Princes of Armenia, pretended to be injured by the usurped power of Artaxes their great King, which he delivered in this manner, as a greater motive by Roxana's meanes to per∣swade Clorias affections. You must know said he, that after the valiant King of Seythia had lost his life in the Armenian Warres in defence of the Princes rights, who were esteemed oppressed by Artaxes power, a story most sufficiently known to all, my selfe came into Lydia to demand assistance of Euarchus my Un∣cle, to recover againe my conquered Country of
Iberia, detained from me by Tigranes Duke of Colchis. Orsames also at the same time began his Warres against our oppressor with the same pre∣tentions, since Philostros his powerfull Favourite judged it a worke full of piety and justice, how∣ever he knew there would be much bloud spilt in the quarrell, fince as his master was mighty, Ar∣taxes was obstinate, and both ambitious; And to this purpose, not onely prosecuted his designe with much violence against the King of Armenia, but in a short time Orsames gained many Coun∣tries, so that at last, he brought Artaxes to be willing to accept, if not to demand a publike Treaty; whereby as twas pretended, Asia againe might be reduced to its former happy condition, by the effects of a generall peace, since the discom∣posure of such mighty interests, seemed to thre∣ten the whole world with a fatall destruction; and to this effect, all the injured Princes were called to shew forth their accustomed priviledges, in a City upon the Confines of Syria and Armenia, which was a place chosen as most indifferent for that effect: where their Commissioners then mee∣ting, and yet remaining with more disputes, then hopes of agreements, gave occasion to the Senate of Lydia, to invite me to flye to their protection, as well for present subsistance, as future hopes, since it appeared these two powerfull Kings, only beheld their own ambitions as the chiefe object of their considerations, though they pretend a more charitable intention in their actions. But my Lord said Roxana, as I doe not desire to trou∣ble my thoughts with the rights of other Princes
that have little relation to our affaires, but as they may concerne your particular, so in re∣gard they may prove over tedious for our inten∣ded discourse, since the Princesse her selfe will be likely to surprize us before we have finished, I must intreat the honour only to be made acquain∣ted with those things, that shall belong to your owne Titles; and the rather for that I have heard some disputes formerly to that purpose, which I was not very well able to answer, and should be very glad to be better provided against other ar∣guments of the same nature. Truly Madam answered Cassianus, as it is im∣possible for me to sever in all respects the interests of other Princes from my own, so I will endea∣vour to avoid what unnecessary discourse may prove either tedious or impertinent; after that Roxana had acknowledged the favour by a few complements, he related these particulars. Although I am confident said he, that you are competently informed, that my dead father was dispossessed of his fruitfull Countrey of Iberia for taking up of Armes against the power of Ar∣taxes King of Armenia, yet may not be perhaps sufficiently instructed how Tygranes became pos∣sessor of our Countries, Titles, and Honours, wherefore be pleased to know, that after my said father was driven forcibly from the possession of the Crowne of Mesopotamia, (which he had re∣ceived by the free election of that people, who found themselves oppressed by the Lawes Artaxes had imposed upon their consciences; as well as many of the Nobility deprived of such Lands be∣longing
to the Temples, in their possessions, which their predecessors had left them, though formerly taken away I must confesse by violence from the Flamines) and my mother forced to flye to her friends charity for succour and safety, the King of Armenia with the assistance of Tygranes riches, prosecuted so farre his begun good for∣tune, that in a short space he not only quieted the stirres in his dominions, but advanced his power into Iberia, which being without any support, but what few Forces Euarchus his father, then King of Lydia had send to defend his daughters right, quickly became master of what strong pla∣ces he pleased, untill at last he was Lord of the whole; and being in possession he not only paid that debt he owed to Tygranes with part of my Lands, but bestowed upon him in requitall of his other good services, all our Titles and honours which for many lasting ages had remained in our family, as being the next of kinne. As this cruell injustice killed my father with griefe, so after some yeares it brought to our assistance the fore∣named Scythian Prince, as one sent from the Gods in our apprehension, to teach Artaxes a new law of obedience to the fortunes of so great a courage; however this date of life became determined by the envious destinies, and we left only to demand ayde of Orsames power, to finish that work that we thought so happily begun to the advantage of the injured Princes; in which number I was to be reckoned the chiefe, since most eminent both in wrongs and honours: As I may say my particular cause bearing the very name of all the rest: In this
signe, the Syrians continued a large progresse within Artaxes Countries, untill the King him∣selfe was forced in a manner by the consent also of Sorastros King of Aegypt, to that generall trea∣ty I formerly mentioned; which notwithstan∣ding all the while hath only produced disputati∣ons, instead of conclusions, for that the War con∣tinues still with violence to the ruine of the whole Kingdome, without the benefit of any in particu∣lar, began at first by the obstinate pride of Ty∣granes, that would not restore those rights belon∣ging to my selfe, which probably might have gi∣ven satisfaction to the other Princes of our facti∣on; however lately Tygranes being also oppressed by the burthen of warre in his owne dominions, begins to be more plyant to our desires, and to this purpose many arguments are alleadged of either side to give colour to the unfortunate acti∣ons of Souldiers, who are maintained more to fatisfie the ambition of the two mighty Kings, then to put us in possession of our rights. Tygranes affirmeth, that as the King of Armenias gratitude bestowed upon him in recompence of his services done the Crowne, those honours and Lands that belonged to our Family, so the money he hath laid out in the Warres, makes him a lawfull pur∣chaser of that benefit; and therefore in all equity cannot be deprived of them without a full satis∣faction, according to the damage he hath sustai∣ned by those actions. The State of Syria againe pretends, that unlesse my selfe be restored to my former dignities, the combination which is made with the injured Princes, must of necessity be
broken, and so consequently their Kingdome of Syria dishonoured in their agreement; and we further adde, that although Artaxes might have some colour of displeasure against my father, for taking upon him the Crowne of Mesopotamia, and defending the possession in his life time by force of Arms, which however is a Title disputa∣ble, yet my self ought not to be esteemed any way guilty of the fault being an infant; and therefore too much injured by such a losse, when instead of enjoying the greatest principallity of all Ar∣menia for dignity, I am left naked of honour and subsistance, whilst others of lesse quality triumph with those spoyles that should adorn my person. In conclusion, not to detaine your ex∣pectation over long with diversity of relations, although the Kingdome of Syria vowes never to lay downe Armes without a full restoration of the Princes rights: yet many Ministers of that State did underhand conclude a league with Tygranes to my prejudice; which shewes particu∣lar interest hath the chiefe preheminency in this Warre; but since, upon new breaches, the Duke again is fallen off from that agreement: in so much as the difference may produce better effects; and the rather doe I hope it, for that Tygranes hath lately offered to procure the King of Arme∣nia to grant me equall honours to those my fa∣ther hath lost, as himselfe will be content to deli∣ver up the possession of the Countries belonging to my right, if a generall peace in all Asia may by that meanes succeed; provided he be compe∣tently satisfied by the State for those damages he
hath susteined by the Warres; in which posture continue our present affaires; without either moving backward or forward, to the amazement of the whole world. Truly my Lord answered Roxana, it seemes to me, nothing more is demanded in the Kingdome of Armenia then what you have been pleased to mention, since your interest is the bases, upon which the only occasion of the Warre hath been builded. It is true said Cassianus, however some differences in points of religion that the Scythians stand upon, is a kinde of an obstacle also; yet it is thought, the State of Syria can when it pleaseth, moderate that particular: but the truth is, that those contentions that depend upon Aegypt and Syria, are of so much consequence to this Treaty, that it absolutely hinders not only the progresse, but successe of all the rest, whose ambitions as 'tis thought can never be satisfied; untill one of those States perish from its appearing greatnesse; by which meanes the other may appeare to the world more absolute. By this time the Princesse Cloria came into the roome, which for the present not only broake off their discourse, but gave warning to Cassianus to present himselfe to his most glorious Mistresse, as the chiefest deity his heart pretended to adore; however, she, as if nature as well as art had taught a more beseeming quicknesse then ordinary, for∣tified with those instructions she had received from her Governesse that gave her confidence, preven∣ted her kinsmans addresses with these words: Cousin said she, if my necessary imployment
hath made me seem rude in that entertainment your kinde visit merited from me, I must desire you, rather to interpret my omission to the pre∣sumption I had in those tyes that have united us in bloud, then any fault my governesse hath com∣mitted in my education, upon which score I am bold to aske your pardon, for your over long stay in expecting my company. Cassianus finding himselfe saluted in this manner, not only con∣trary to custome, but his own expectation, since formerly all her discourses were rather markes of civility, then testimonies of affection; stood some time amazed, as if his imagination could not be satisfied in that truth which his eares heard utte∣red; But after he had a little put off that pleasing distraction that anew captivated his senses, though in a trembling posture, he returned her this answer. Truly Madam said he, if the greatest Empe∣rour in the world had been so bountifully repay∣ed for whole ages of attendance upon so beauti∣full a goddesse, certainly he would have made no question of his satisfaction, but rather have given his whole domination of the earth for such a purchase; much lesse must I esteem my selfe in∣jured that only live by your pleasure. O my Lord answered the Princesse, since your expressions flye so high a pitch, I shall begin to think it necessary to defend my reputation against your comple∣ments; but yet upon better consideration, I am of opinion it is much safer to confesse my selfe o∣vercome by your courtefie, then venture more blowes in counequall a combate, where your wit
will be sure to have the victory: And with these words taking him by the hand she led him into a faire Balcony that had a large prospect over the goodly River of Pactole, where long they had not remained (the Princesse in the meane time casting her eyes downe the River, upon whose bankes was seated that pleasant house of her Fa∣thers that first gave Cassianus entertainment when he came into Lydia) before she used this language, though a sweet shower of teares opened the pas∣sage for her words: I cannot said she but with some griefe remember the innocent times that gave both you and me meeting in yonder place, when my Father seemed to triumph in glory, that is now unfortunately metamorphosed into a Garrison of Souldiers, who perchance neither honour dignity, nor know goodnesse, much lesse practise vertue. Indeed said Cassianus, as I must confesse those respects I then received from your most noble Fa∣ther, and my affectionate Uncle were farre be∣yond my poore deserts, which gives me more oc∣casion at present to lament his condition, in being Subject to such a cruelty, that no power of mine is able to redeem, yet I cannot also but remember my own losses at that time, since even then I quit∣ted the liberty of my soule, that untill this pre∣sent I could never recover againe; though I have sought all wayes of redemption; and unlesse you prove more mercifull then the Kings oppressors, I shall not only remaine in as great a captivity, but have cause to accuse you of the like Tyranny, though I dare not be so bold in my complaints.
But yet Cousin said Cloria, I must make a great deal of difference in the nature of your sufferings, though I should grant the quality; for as the King hath by all meanes possible strived to give his oppressors satisfaction, provided it may not be against the right of his Successors, and good of his people; so you of the other side violently ayme at your own content, to the injuring per∣haps of anothers Title. Alas Madam answered Cassianus, was I not your first and last lover? the silent rocks can give sufficient testimonies of the one, when at that famous hunting, I retired under their protections, only to make my complaints, and the whole Senate can witnesse the other: by my importunities; wherefore no interest is to be esteemed equall to my pretentions, either in af∣fection or right. Alasse, alasse answered the Princesse, you never let me know those powerfull affections before o∣ther respects had taken full possession of that heart which became also in some sort a prisoner not to be released, who perhaps might as well have been your Captive, if your omissions had not proved most unfortunate to your purposes. And whereas you say, you are my last lover, I beseech you doe but consider Farezius intentions, and looke upon his actions, and you will finde both violence and power hath discovered a later sceane, then what you moved in, when you saved the old Flamins life, so that I must tell you, that unlesse punctually you observe the condition according to your former agreement, which was never to presse my love to any conclusion, if Narcissus were living,
to whose living, to whose memory I must still observe that decorum, I vow by the gods never to entertaine any motions from your addresses, much lesse give any consent to a future marriage; besides you must performe those actions that may render you capable of satisfaction, as my selfe freedome in granting; which can never be as long as the Generall hath opportunity to prevent and power to constraine. Wherefore in briefe, you are to study some opposition answerable to his greatnesse for both our advantages, whereby the better to merit my love, as to shew your selfe worthy the name of a Prince of so great an ex∣traction. These discourses of Cloria could not chuse but nettle the ears of Cassianus towards the resolution of sufficient ambitions; since hitherto he concei∣ved himselfe to have been over sloathfull, as well in her love as his own honour; so that standing some time in a deep muse, as if he intended to fetch his determinations from his very soule, at last he broake out into this language: Most faire and wise Princesse said he, as already I have pro∣mised my best endeavours with the expence of my deare bloud (in which you have the dearest interest) in your service against the proud Gene∣rall; so I must be prescribed by your directions to such limitations and performances as I am to observe for feare, that else my actions may either endanger your safety to be more valued then the worlds Empire, or ruine your Fathers hopes, whose sufferings cannot be exampled. Therefore I beseech you let me know how farre your plea∣sure
may travell in that journey I intend to make against the pride of ambitious Farezius. Cousin said Cloria, as I shall leave my Gover∣nesses experience to treat with you about the particulars, so of the other side, I am content to give you these assurances of my affections, that after Narcissus you shall have the next place in my consideration, provided you think of my Fathers sufferings, and be mindfull of your own honour, since without him I cannot give away my selfe, and without your reputation you are but halfe a Prince. Upon these conditions you shall find my Lodgings ever ready to entertaine your visits, so they may be seasonable and not scandalous, which I believe are favours sufficient to nourish your hopes, according to those expressions you received under my hand in that Letter, your see∣ming neglect of my condition forced from me, which is all for the present I have to say upon this theame, unlesse it be to adde to your considerati∣on, how is it possible you can either reape fruits from my affection, if Farezius continue great? or what probability have you again to recover your lost Country of Iberia, if all regality be supprest? since in the one his greatnesse may perhaps con∣straine me to an unwilling consent for my owne preservation, as the other by this meanes may so fill Lydia with popular desires, that your birth and bloud, much lesse dignity shall finde no en∣tertainment in their considerations. Wherefore I say, joyn your thoughts only to such designes as shall be contrived by the Nobility with the State of Syria; wherein the Myssians seem also to
have a share, in regard the Lords governe all in their Country, and by that meanes you will best please my desires. Although Cassianus could not disprove the Princesse Rhetorick, for that it taught him a duty belonging to his quality, which he had not hi∣therto altogether followed, since he more looked upon his own private concernments, in comply∣ing with his Uncles enemies, then those rights that belonged to the dignity and honour of Prin∣ces, of which number himselfe was eminent by bloud and alliance: yet in regard of those hopes that Cloria gave him by her faire language, and good entertainment, he was sufficiently pleased with her discourse, for that it spake at leastwise liking, if not love to his eares: however, it seemed mixt with some reserved conditions, which he was content only to interpret bashfull assurances, though the gods were privy to other intentions, that could not be altered; wherefore as if joyfully assured by the Princesses words, and impatient of more delay to put in execution what he was enjoyned after he had returned humble thanks not only for her free expressions, but the confi∣dence she had in his services, with some other complements belonging to his love, and fit for the season, kissing her faire hands he tooke his leave, vowing the absolute performance of all her com∣mands to the uttermost of his power: but being gone, the Princesse used these words to Roxana, fearing belike her own dissimulation was too great a crime. Doe you believe said she, that the gods will be
content with my hypocrisie, in making this poor Princes affections, a stale to our other purposes, since you know my vertuous engagements are so farre from suffering me to become his wife, that my heart dares fcarce think of such a perswasion in any kinde; and as little should I be willing such a report should reach the eares of absent Nar∣cissus, who perhaps will accuse my constancy for having only deceived, in that nature for his better advantage: no no Roxana be confident, as plaine dealing is best in all morall actions, so certainly in love the contrary procures either hate, jealou∣sie, or despaire, which may produce effects dan∣gerous, if not destructive. After the old woman with a kind of smile had heard out her Mistresses discourse, she returned her this answer. As I cannot deny said she, but dissimulation in it selfe, is a flattering vice that steales upon many dispositions with certaine possible if not probable signes of lawfulnesse, because they are contented to be perswaded by their imaginations, they meane no hurt in their intention, which notwith∣standing I must confesse, destroyes all morall con∣versation; yet in all respects of the contrary, for a person to uncover his breast upon every occasi∣on, without leaving himselfe a defence against his crafty enemy, were a madnesse capable to ruine his fortunes as often as the opportunity presented the meanes. Wherefore Madam, in the generall I can only give this rule, when a body is left at li∣berty whether he will speak or no, let him rather hold his peace, then so much as intimate a fals∣hood by his words, or in friendly conversation
appeare not candid and satisfactory: but if in deepe examinations that may produce great con∣sequences either of good or hurt, for my part I am of opinion, all art possible may be used to avoyde the determination, provided a direct untruth be not admitted; or the damage of a third party su∣stained by the concealement. But Roxana said the Princesse, for that you in∣tend this discourse for my satisfaction, I pray let us apply it to my case with my Cousin, whom you see I have wonne into a beliefe of what I ne∣ver intend. Tis true said Roxana, however it doth not appeare you have engaged your selfe ei∣ther by words or actions; and therefore it is not any thing you have done hath constrained or per∣swaded his beliefe; wherefore it ought only to rest upon the fault of his own fancy, if he prove deceived in his expectation hereafter. Besides, it may be considered, that as he hath been some part of the occasion of your suffering unjustly, so is it fit he should endure a little pennance for that of∣fence; and put case it may be granted that you have after a manner deluded his thoughts by the Letter you wrote him, wherein you seeme to en∣vite his addresses to a new Courtship, yet it can∣not be esteemed false, for that you may have a resolution to entertaine his affection, if my Lord Narcissus (whom the Gods defend) should mis∣carry. I but there Governesse, replyed Cloria lyes hidden the deceit, since my resolutions are fixed never to make any other choyce in life or death. Why then answered Roxana, at the worst you doe but like an honest person in danger to be rob∣bed,
that takes some liberty to make thieves fall out, whereby to be the better secured: And see∣ing that Cassianus cannot be prejudiced by the practice, but on the contrary reape benefit, for that his fortunes seem to depend upon regallity and Nobility, which the rude multitude would destroy; I see no reason why you should possesse your thoughts with such scruples. Well, well said the Princesse, as you are my Governesse, in this doubt I will perswade my conscience to ob∣serve your principles; however, the gods may punish us both for our over-much boldnesse, thus to play too freely with those injunctions that con∣cerne religion; or at leastwise may have some relation to it; however, I cannot deny, but that there is a necessity in my dissimulation at this present; and the rather am I content a little to practice the faculty, for that I know Cassianus can sustaine no prejudice by my intentions. Notwithstanding these and other reasons which Roxana used at divers times, proved sufficient motives to retaine her mistresse firme in prosecu∣ting their designes; yet understanding by Creses amongst other discourses, that the Duke of Cy∣prus was dead, she could not in some sort but be doubtfull of the safety of Narcissus, for that they had heard nothing from him since his separation; however, she was extreamly carefull to keep these thoughts from entering into the bosome of the already too much troubled Princesse, though in the interim she omitted no opportunity whereby to instruct Cassianus in that part he was to play by their appointment against Farezius.
Cassianus as I said, having received both com∣mands from Cloria, and instructions by Roxana, consulted oftentimes with himselfe as well as with her how he might best put them in execution, un∣till at last he fell upon this resolution; that as Dimogoras his trusty friend, had been most injur'd by the preferment of Farezius, having outed him of his place and command in the Army, so would he be the fittest person to be communicated with all, concerning the likeliest way to prosecute his designes, according to the directions he had recei∣ved: To this effect he intended to make him ac∣quainted with the hopes he had lately received to obtaine the favour of the Princesse Cloria in his pretended love; The rather for that he knew he was not only a man who had a principall inte∣rest among the Nobility and chiefe Senators, but was also extreamly beloved in the Army, by most of the common Souldiers, that were not abso∣lute creatures of Farezius: wherefore one mor∣ning before Dimogoras was gone out of his cham∣ber, Cassianus came unto him with a smiling countenance, and this language in his mouth: Dimogoras said he, as it were something imperti∣nent againe for me, to reiterate the multitude of my obligations to your endeavours, since they are not only generally knowne to all the world, but divers times have been acknowledged by my expressions in particular: so my businesse at pre∣sent is to make you acquainted anew, both with my thoughts and intentions concerning some late passages: I came into Lydia as you know by your procurement to prosecute my affections to
the faire Princesse the Kings daughter when she was taken prisoner by the Senates Fleet in Per∣game. Tis true my courtships in that nature, were something retarded, if not absulutely laid aside untill the present, by reason of a certaine corres∣pondency between her, and Narcissus the Duke of Cyprus sonne: This gives me occasion to tell you, that however I found her then backward to my wishes; either proceeding from her flattering fancy that Narcissus was living, or conceiving her own condition was much more secure in the Senates custody, then at present under the juris∣diction of the Army and Souldiers, or rather I may say being violently prest to some inconveni∣ences, by reason of the extraordinary greatnesse, (both in command and authority) of Farezius, who as it should seem pretends something vio∣lently to her love and affection; Now she is be∣come more tractable, and willing to entertaine those protestations of mine, whose effects I have ever consecrated to her service, since I had the honour to be entertained by the good will of the Lydian people: I need not trouble you much with the repetitions of your own received injuries by reason of the generalls greatnesse, notwithstan∣ding all those gallant services, which you have performed, in the defence and safety of the Com∣monwealth, neither shall I mention the conse∣quences thereby, that threaten a kind of destructi∣on, to all the Nobility of the Kingdome; for that I know your judgement, and their appre∣hensions, cannot possbly be wanting in this par∣ticular: only I must needs tell you that the Prin∣cesse
Cloria her selfe, extreamly wonders how it is possible, you should dispence so much with your honour and reputation as to beare those in∣dignities that have cast you from your authority and command, with such an extreame quiet paci∣fication? Are the Nobility said he of Lydia, so much degenerated in their soules and spirits, as easily in this manner to quit their honour, to the lowest conditions the people shall direct? what is become of the magnanimity of mind, once so frequently raigning in the breasts of the better sort of men in this Kingdome, that is now lost in a chaos of confusion with the rabble or common multitude? doth a little sensuall feare, bury all considerations of valour and gallantry in this Nation? people being only given to eate and drinke, without affectation of greatnesse or appre∣hension of disgrace: If it be so my Lord in the generall, my words will be as much in vaine to be uttered, as your life in effect will be miserable in the future: but I have more confidence in the cou∣rage of Dimogoras, both for his own sake and my good: This being said, Cassianus rested silent to heare what reply Dimogoras would make. Dimogoras I may say continued altogether mute for something a long space: his eyes sparkling out in the interim neverthelesse a certaine kinde of seeming desire of revenge, though his body o∣vergrowne with flesh and humour, appeared not to be much inclinable to action: but being wake∣ned to some determinate answer, by the importu∣nities of Cassianus (who belike himselfe had been strongly urged by Roxana, to be speedy in the
execution of her designe) at last he blutterd out this reply. My Lord said he, I must confesse, that both my selfe and the rest of the Nobility of Lydia accor∣ding to the Princesses apprehension, (whose Fa∣ther however I love not, nor ever shall) have wound their dignities and honours, into such a labyrinth of inconvenience, by complying so much with the violent, and confused humours of the common people, that we have in a manner suffered Farezius with the rest of his faction, to overthrow already the most essentiall part of our hereditary honours and priviledges; and by that meanes are become lesse powerfull, to act any thing with advantage either to our selves or o∣thers: neverthelesse perhaps, I may yet set on foot something of faction amongst the Souldiers, (if they have not wholly lost the remembrance, that I once commanded amongst them) that may per∣chance produce effects tending to those purposes you have designed: with these words he entered into some rage and passion, as it were out of the very apprehension of his own losse of reputation, in being so disgracefully turned out of his com∣mand: presently after this he tooke his leave of Cassianus, as pretending he would goe to the Se∣nate, to try his friends constitutions concerning those designes he intended: Cassianus was glad he had got thus much from his resolutions (for notwithstanding he did not at all doubt his affection, yet he might have some cause to suspect his activity) so that he determi∣ned himselfe also, to use the best interest he had,
both with the Lords and the rest of the Senators, whom he knew to be of a contrary faction to Farezius: withall he had upon all occasions free admittance into the Princesses lodgings, accor∣ding to her own allowance and Roxana's directi∣ons; which as it may be thought, sufficiently con∣tented his apprehension. It was not long before Dimogoras and the rest of the Nobility, raised considerable factions and mutinies in the Army, amongst the Souldiers, they also being enflamed by their want of pay, and not performance of other conditions promi∣sed them upon their first taking up Armes against the King, being since renewed againe to their hopes, when he was delivered out of prison, by some Troopes sent to that purpose, which sud∣denly called away both Farezius and Hercrombro∣tus to the appeasing of the stirs. Though Farezius, did with faire language and promising words in a short speech, seemingly pacifie most of their discontents, yet Hercombrotus, who was of a more violent and active nature, fin∣ding many of the Troopes continue still their mutinies, and insolencies against their command, suddenly flew in amongst those Souldiers with fury in his looks, and terrour in his countenance, where presently seizing upon two or three of those that appeared most refractory and disobe∣dient, he delivered them instantly over to officers to be executed and punished: After this he not only offered a free pardon to the rest, but also promised them a reall performance of all their just expectations, provided that from thence for∣ward,
they would continue obedient and con∣stant in their affections. After this, when both Farezius and Hercrom∣brotus were on their way againe towards the City of Sardis, an officer of the Army began this dis∣course to his Generall: Sir said he, by this late mutiny, you may see the danger not only of Di∣mogoras interest amongst the Souldiers, but the power he hath with those of the better sort of Se∣nators; from which originall, I suppose, hath pro∣ceeded in part these now appeased troubles in the Campe: of the other side can you possibly con∣ceive that after so many testimonies of disaffecti∣on from Euarchus the King, he will be ever brought to be either entire for the Souldiers ad∣vantage, or be weaned from that affection without reason, he hath alwayes expressed to be in his na∣ture, for his false and ungratefull country men the Myssians? in like manner, with what confidence can we any more trust the actions of the wealthy City of Sardis, when as they did not only refuse, to open their purses to our occasions in our grea∣test necessities, but denyed us enterance into their Towne, by the perswasion of those Senators that we have now sent to banishment? These things being granted to be true, the next consideration ought to be had of the remedy for future preven∣tion: In the first place, to compasse our designes, and procure our security, we must endeavour to joyne with a prevailing party in the Senate, or at leastwise make them so by the Souldiers power, who may passe an absolute decree, to have no more Treaties with the King, in regard that those
hopes and feares, doe not a little distract the whole Kingdome, from relying absolutely upon our commands and jurisdiction, as you know most necessary for the peoples safety: in the next place we are totally to suppresse the interest of Dimogo∣ras for the present, and the Nobillities priviledges in the future, which as I must tell you keep up such an opinion amongst all sorts of people, concer∣ning their greatnesse and stabillity, that it will be a very difficult matter, to act any thing either for the Kingdomes good or the Armies advantage: Lastly, we must not only drive the Myssian Com∣missioners out of our Country, who only wait occasions to suck up all the benefit to themselves and Nation, which the Lydians at any time shall either fight or toyle for, but in some terrifying way or other procure money from the Citizens of Sardis, whereby to give just and fitting content to those faithfull and loving Souldiers, that have fought so many bloudy Battels, and obtained multitudes of signall victories in their Countreyes behalfe, against their numerous enemies. Though Farezius by reason of his melancholly and silent nature, made no great reply at the pre∣sent, to those reasons that had been delivered, yet it was not many dayes after their arrivall at Sar∣dis, before an absolute decree passed the Senate, that not only there should be no more Treaties, or addresses made unto Euarchus, concerning any agreement either in the generall or particular, but it was also ordered, that it should be esteemed a crime of a most high consequence, for any per∣son so much as to make tender of any proposi∣tion
to that effect, to the rest of the Senators there assembled: which resolution was quickly pub∣lished over the whole Kingdome of Lydia by a formall proclamation. Of the other side Dimogoras finding, both his interest in the Army and his credit with the Sena∣tors did not any way suit with his ambition and expectation, upon the very apprehension (as twas thought) of these apparant disgraces, in a very few dayes ended his life in this world; however there were some that not only gave it out, but be∣lieved, that he had been poysoned, to prevent a farther trouble and danger to the Kingdome: This also gave occasion to Prince Cassianus with∣in a very short time after, to quit personally the Country of Lydia, as perhaps supposing, now his chiefe friend and Favourite Dimogoras was gone, and the rest of the Lords not being in a capacity to support his honour and designes, against the Souldiers, in the Princesse Clorias behalfe, it was to little purpose any longer to prosecute his pre∣tended love. Neverthelesse the Nobillity, with many other of the Senators of the same faction, prepared them∣selves to give the body of Dimogoras, most stately and glorious Funerals: To this intent, when the day came, all attired in black, they met the corps with a world of ceremony, and so conducted it through a multitude of people, to the place or∣dained for that purpose, where being placed ac∣cording to the custome of other Generalls, the flames quickly consumed the pyles whilst that which was immortall, had a farther account to
give, concerning his actions and thoughts during his life. When the Princesse Cloria understood of this strange and unexpected law, not only pronounced in the Senate, but published all over the King∣dome, she began now to repent her, of her too much beliefe given to the Kings enemies, not∣withstanding any perswasion whatsoever, she had entertained in her thoughts; and consequently had more cause a great deale to doubt her owne security, having no other defence left her but what she could gather from the faithfull and wise Councells of her intrusted governesse Roxana, which was the occasion, that one day having for the most part spent her whole store of passion, she used this kinde of despairing discourse unto her. Truly Roxana said she, as there might be noted at first, a strong jealousie amongst the Souldiers, by the strict gard set upon the Kings person, so this last action makes me feare, that there is some prevailing designe, as well against our liberties as his dominion, which we shall be scarce able to prevent by any industry or assistance; for as I can∣not rely much upon the Lords power, by reason they have altogether lost their authority, by se∣vering their interests at the first from their Princes prerogative, nothing but to comply with their own ambition and spleen; so is there as little to be hoped for, from the endeavours of this great and rich City of Sardis, considering their late carriages, when Farezius with his triumphant Army, not only entered their Walls without re∣sistance, but were content to receive his absolute
commands, without the least dispute, belonging to their long enjoyed priviledges, never as yet questioned by any former Prince or power; these representations being knowne and granted to be the effects of the late transactions, what probabili∣ties remaine, for the recovery of my fathers rights, though it should be opinionated, that we our selves were out of all danger personally; since the Kings party appears, not to have either abillity or will to doe him good; And Lydia being strong∣ly united under the present jurisdiction, what forraigne industry and endeavour soever, can worke any considerable effects to his advantage? considering the many brave Vessels and shipping that are alwayes ready for defence and resistance, upon the Carian and Ionian shoares, to oppose either sudden invasion or continued hostility. When Roxana had for some time rested silent with teares in her eyes, she returned her this an∣swer: Lady said she, you must then give me leave to blame your superstitious modesty (as I may call it) in not suffering your Uncle Orsames to have performed those ceremonies belonging to your Nuptials at Memphis; which perhaps in part if not totally, would have prevented these incon∣veniences. Indeed Governesse replyed the Princesse, al∣though perhaps you esteeme those decorums of fitting duty, which I shall be ever ready to render my Father and Mother, but bashfull superstitions, yet I can assure you, I shall never be so much wan∣ting to my own honour, as rather not a thousand times to venture my deerest life, then to give away
my selfe to any love whatsoever, without their inward consent and publike approbation: but let us for the present leave that subject, and only fall upon the consideration, or the meanes, where∣by the King may be redeemed from his miseries, which Rhetorick would not only farre better please my eares, but be a much more profitable discourse in my opinion, since in the other point, I am resolved still to remaine obstinate, notwith∣standing any perswasion to the contrary. Truly said Roxana, as I must needs confesse, the thing it selfe is difficult to bring about and the wayes more uncertaine to know how; so of the other side, I am so farre from believing the im∣possibility of the Kings restoration to his ancient dignity, that according to my owne thoughts I shall give you very probable reasons, whereby to perswade you to it, if my fancy doth not much out goe my judgement. For although I cannot deny, but that the Coun∣trey of Lydia being throughly united under a well setled government, with the addition of Io∣nia, and Caria, that afford so many considerable havens, furnished with multitude of shipping, is a condition scarce to be attempted by any power; yet considering the impatience of the peoples na∣tures, with the daily oppressions of them by the heavy weight of Taxations, a quick division will be wrought in the hearts of those, that must of necessity be wonne to the change of lawes, and government before the ancient constitutions (by which the Subjects have formerly lived happily for so many ages) can be totally taken away:
However for the present, perhaps either feare or hope exercises so farre mens thoughts, that hardly as yet have they leasure for consideration: but when as, I say, they shall finde this is like to be per∣petuall, they will with much violence desire a∣gaine their old subjection, though at first they were foolishly perswaded to seeke a new govern∣ment. And more especially if those two great Monarchs of Syria, and Aegypt once make that accord, that all Asia attends with a greedy ex∣pectation, which may soon be effected, since the King of Armenia hath already agreed with his discontented Princes, and also hath condiscen∣ded to give satisfaction to the Scythian Crowne, whereby to deliver his Countrey absolutely from that power, that hath so many yeares molested it with its armes. But Roxana said the Princesse, what will those agreements conduce to my fathers benefit, when every Prince regards only his own concernments? besides their extreame jealousie of one anothers glory will not suffer them to undertake any con∣quest joyntly: And put case they should accord constantly in their purposes, yet when the people of Lydia shall see themselves ready to be invaded by a forraigne power, they will certainly more strongly conforme their obediences, to this juris∣diction they now live under, whereby the better to prevent a new threatning danger. It is true said Roxana untill the Subjects be made more desperate in their sufferings, the peo∣ple will not be content to trust strangers with their liberty; but yet the assistance that is desired
from forraigne Princes needs not to consist whol∣ly in numerous Armies, but in small and frequent supplies both of men and moneyes, which joyned with the Kings party, and laying hold of the ma∣ny discontents already ingendred in the hearts of most, cannot but conduce exceedingly to the o∣verthrow of this new government. Besides there is another benefit that may be expected from other Countreyes, being at open difference with the Se∣nate of Lydia; and that is, denying their Mer∣chants the liberty of Trade within their domini∣ons, which at last must of necessity discontent and impoverish the rich City of Sardis, from whence the Souldiers are (if not mainteined) at leastwise supplyed upon all urgent occasions. But why answered Cloria may not these Prin∣ces, and especially the two great Monarchs of Ae∣gypt and Syria, as well forbid the free commerce you speak of in the time of their own differences, as when they shall be at peace between themselves, if they have any intention to right my father, as I have heard they doe pretend? Because, replyed Roxana, they are both so full of their own ambition, that neither dares offend the State of Lydia as yet, untill their Warres be at an end between themselves, least they might give too much advantage to each other by the assistance of so powerfull a Kingdome as this is. Then said the Princesse, there may be some hopes to better my fathers affaires, when these Kings shall thinke it good to put up their bloudy swords, and not before. I conclude not so Madam, answered Roxana,
for although these exasperated Princes against their own quiet should have neither temper in their actions, nor finde wisedome in their coun∣cellours, untill meere necessity should constraine their Subjects to seek peace with violence, which were too dangerous a president; yet it is to be hoped that the Myssians with the Cretan Forces joyned to the discontents of Lydia, by reason of diversity of Religions and interests would in time restore the King to his ancient dignity. Pish Roxana, replyed Cloria; for the Myssians, I have so little confidence in their assistance, that what countenance soever their actions put on, I can scarce be perswaded of their intentions, since they once sold my father to this misery he now undergoes; when they had a gallant Army in the Field to have redeemed both his person, and his Crowne; And for the Cretans, besides that they are of a different profession to ours concerning the worship of the gods; there are also so many factions amongst them by way of private ambiti∣on, that they rather goe backe daily in their own affaires, then shew any probabillity of helping o∣thers; And for the discontents of Lydia which you mention, with their diversities of Religions, I doe not finde upon all occasions, but they can very well lay downe their own spleenes, when there appears a necessity to oppose my fathers prosperity: Lastly, concerning the common peo∣ples sufferings, I am perswaded, they are resolved to endure any subjection, or almost bondage it selfe, rather then to be willing the King should recover againe his lost rights, by force and power
of the sword, without making first some conditi∣ons with his prorogative, notwithstanding he hath divers times, given them by protestations, what assurances could be desired from a just, and a religious Prince. Madam, answered Roxana, your opinion I must confesse is grounded upon a great deale of proba∣billity, considering how the Myssians not onely sold the King to the power of the Senate, but at the first beginning of these troubles came into Lydia to dispute your fathers rights: But yet if you please to consider, that the reason of their actions then proceeded from the extreame cove∣tousnesse of some eminent persons amongst them who finde now they can expect no more gaine (the Senate having already compassed their ends upon them) you will easily believe, that they are resolved to change the sceane for your fathers ad∣vantage, since by that meanes they may come to play a double game, and winne by the bargaine: Next concerning the Cretans although I must confesse their foolish divisions amongst themselves have not only much hindred the Kings affaires, and in a manner indangered the whole frame of their own designes, yet is there such a disparity betweene them, and the people of Lydia, not on∣ly in regard of the difference of Religion, but in that we have outed them formerly of much of their Lands; that they will dye to the last man, rather then suffer the Senate to beare rule over them: Thirdly, I must desire you not to dwell too strictly upon your beliefe, that the common peo∣ple of Lydia will so easily accord their difference,
and pacifie their discontents, upon the appearance of a strange Army; in regard it will only bring with it the right of the cause, with a promise of amendment; especially when they shall by a lit∣tle more experience finde, that their present grie∣vances have neither termination nor limitation; For I say, that as at the first they were perswaded to entertaine the assistance of the Myssians, whom they most hated, and feared of all other Nations, against their King, who oppressed them in no∣thing, however their fancies did injure their judgements, so will they as well accept of any forraigne assistance against the Senate, when they can no longer endure the burthen of their oppres∣sions: And last of all give me leave to tell you, that the divisions within the Army and Senate house, cannot but produce strange effects, since no spleen is so great, as what is in gendred by the same faction, when once they fall at odds, ei∣ther by reason of gaine or prerogative: But as she was further proceeding in her discourse, the dwarfe enformed them, that there was newly ar∣rived in the Castle hall a young Maid of an excel∣lent beauty, who desired with much earnestnesse, to be brought presently into the Princesse pre∣sence, as pretending she had some secret to disco∣ver, not convenient to be imparted to any other eare; he also said, that as her eyes sparkled forth a kinde of youthfull Majesty, so did her neglectfull dresse, seeme to have been disordred by her late journey, which made her appeare more Amazon like. This strange advertisement put them both into
a sollicitous consideration, as well concerning the person of the party, as the occasion of the ad∣venture; And many loving desires would gladly have perswaded poor Cloria, that Narcissus had borrowed another disguize, to have given her a new visit: but having more exactly examined her little servant concerning all particulars, she found the stranger neither in stature or countenance could agree with the proportion or features of her absent Lord: Wherefore after some more displeasing consideration, with a kinde of a sad voyce, as if her thoughts were troubled at the mistake, she commanded the Page to conduct the Maid to her presence. As soon as the damosell entred the room, with confidence enough, approaching neerer to the Princesse in an abrupt manner, told her though softly in her eare, that her new guest was no other but her brother Ascanius broake from his impri∣sonment under the Senates jurisdiction; where∣fore wisht her for some time to discharge her dwarfe, that he might more freely discourse to her his adventures. Cloria was so much confounded with a sudden joy, to have her sweet brother in her possession, whom she could not be permitted to see during their imprisonment; that her distractions could scarce finde a way, to put in execution, what her owne judgement, should have thought conveni∣ent at another season: But at last breaking through her pleasant amazement, she discharged her little officer; for however she was accusto∣med to trust him in her own secrets, yet she would
not notwithstanding use any priviledge to hazard her brothers confidence, least it might render him lesse assured of his safety: When she had passio∣nately demonstrated his welcome, by many af∣fectionate kisses, taking his white hand in hers, which seemed also to have a neere alliance in beauty, she desired him to make her acquainted with the passages of his escape, since as she said, they could not but be admirable, considering the strict guard the Senate was ever accustomed to set over the Kings children; in the interim Roxana curiously attended to understand the discourse that was to proceed from such dainty lips. Wherefore after Ascanius had saluted his sisters looks, with three or foure gentle smiles, in which he seemed lovely to congratulate his own fortune and deride his Goalers carelesnesse, he began this repetition, though first he excused himselfe, for many circumstances belonging to the story. My father said he, as he had commanded my bro∣ther Prince Arethusius for his better safety, into the Kingdome of Syria, there to attend the directions of our noble mother, so was he perswaded by the Myssians (in whose power he then remai∣ned in the Army) to get me into his own possessi∣on, whereby the better to secure (as they preten∣ded) as many as might be of the bloud royall; To this purpose he commanded me to make an es∣cape, and presently to repaire to his presence; however with this caution, that if I should be pre∣vented in the execution, I must not by any meanes reveale his desire; least the Myssians should be brought into suspition, who were then treating
with the Senate about their payment. But be their pretences what they would, I strengthened my duty and obedience, by all the thoughts my young yeares and lesse discretion could suggest, advantageable to the designe and the Kings command, which I must tell you scarce gave sleep to my eyes in the night, or rest to my body in the day, since truly I must needs say, my youthfull ambition became more violent then or∣dinary, to doe something exactly that might pre∣tend to care and wisedome. Yet not to trouble you with long repetitions, where the successe proved unfortunate, I was to my intollerable griefe taken in my escape, though more perplexed I must confesse, to be foyled in my first interprize, then sorrowfull at the conse∣quence of the losse: being apprehended I was by order of the Senate, exactly examined before such Commissioners, as their gravities ordained to be judges of my actions: However the gods so farre favoured my weake constancy, that neither tyran∣ny nor flattery, was able to shake my dutifull re∣solution, which so inraged their froward spleens, that they not only caused me to be shut up in a darke roome, but commanded some slight pu∣nishment to be inflicted upon my person, as a small combatant in my fathers quarrell, at which I ra∣ther laughed then seemed to feele: But not fin∣ding these petty sufferings could prevaile against my spirit, they ordered a great part of my dyet to be taken from me, as supposing belike my belly was easiest to be conquered, when truly I never esteemed meat the chiefe part of my considerati∣on;
especially when I was assured for their own sakes, they would afford me sufficient to sustaine nature: yet at last having tryed all other wayes to compasse their ends, without receiving any fruit from their labours, they withdrew from me those accustomed respects belonging to my birth and quality, which I cannot deny, but most wrought upon my disposition; for that I concei∣ved the dignity of my parents, as also your selfe sweet sister suffered in the omission. To be short, finding themselves wholly over∣come by the goodnesse of my cause, rather then by my courage, they began of a sudden to change (though not the theatre) yet the manner of their action; which was not only to sweeten their car∣riages towards me, but also to tickle up my young ambition, with hopes of being their elected King. For as they said, my father having totally abused his trust, and my eldest brother Arethusius being unkindly fled from their protection, they could finde none other so fit a person to undertake the government of the whole Kingdom as my self, if I would but expresse love in my nature and be ru∣led by their Counsels, for their intentions as they protested were never to destroy Monarchy: But I being enflamed with a new rage to heare them to scandalize my fathers goodnesse, & go about to withdraw my duty by their intentions, I answe∣red that as my father had been much too gentle a Prince for such people; so was their dissimulation no more to be believed concerning my selfe in these offers, then when they protested to the world to make Euarchus the greatest King of
Asia; And in the meane time had to the utter∣most of their power deprived him of his Crowne and dignity. This blunt and resolute reply of mine, belike gave them no further encouragement to proceed; for telling me, I was a pevish child, and could not be brought to understand my own good, they not only quitted my company, but by degrees suffered againe the streame to returne into its right course, to my singular content; which how∣ever continued me still a prisoner. Having past over so great a storme without shipwrack either of my own honour, or danger to my fathers affaires, I began to conceive good opinions of my judgement, and beginning like∣wise to be extreame weary of my captivity, since my yeares now required activity, I fell into many considerations of another escape; and had encou∣ragement to put it in execution, not only by daily rumours I heard of the discontents of the people, for that they found no inclination of the Senate to agree with the King; but also, for that I understood many of the Kings ships had lately revolted from their service: All which I say en∣flamed my thoughts to a new designe, and these inflamations of hope, desire, and passion, made me diligent to procure the good opinion of those that were intrusted with my person, as a necessa∣ry consequence to my intention. I oftentimes de∣manded of them to what end was it to use rigour in my imprisonment, when it might turn to their prejudice, if our side should hereafter prevaile; neither could it at all benefit them for the present
with their masters by any rewards, if they con∣tinued still in authority? These perswasions with other circumstances, took them off from the fiercenesse of their speed, especially when they had heard that Farezius was forced to send many of his Troops abroad, to re∣duce some Provinces againe to his obedience, that rather chose to runne into desperate dangers, then still to continue under the Senates power. These encouragements I say, made me beginne to frame those Embryons I had already conceived in my unsetled braine to some shape, proper for production; and to this purpose, descending from generals to particulars, I acquainted a servant I have now brought along with me, (whom I al∣wayes found faithfull to my intentions) that my resolution was, in this distracted season to gaine my liberty out of the Castle; and therefore wisht him to provide for my escape such necessaries as were convenient for a businesse of so great conse∣quence, that concerned not only my own safety, but my fathers prosperity, but in the interim to colour my designe, I gave it out that I intended to solemnize the birth day of my brother, by a publike Maske, to be acted for the delight of those Souldiers of my guard: When the night came (having all the afternoon before filled their brains with the fumes of excellent Wine, as their imagi∣nation with the expectation of the story of Jupi∣ter, flying from the ill natured rage of his cruell father) after they were all orderly placed in their seates, I caused the sceane to be discovered, which appeared to their view of so taking a quality,
that they had no leasure at all to attend their charge, so that I had liberty sufficient by their willing or carelesse neglect, to passe divers times without my accustomed attendants, through the Galleries into my private bed chamber, as preten∣ding I had some necessary office in the Play; but at last finding they were all either sufficiently se∣cured in their imployment of curiosity, or past consideration by reason of their over liberall diet, I more secretly retired into my Cabinet, where I had appointed my servant to attend with womans apparell: which robes being soon fitted to my person, so well suited with my imagination, that I carried my selfe with much confidence amongst the multitudes of company in every room, when I came into the common hall, my servant ushered me as some Masquer to the doore; where the Porter made no difficulty to give us passage, as believing it was a necessary duty belonging to his office, not to be at all jealous in such joviality, least his fellowes might have derided him for his ridiculous caution. But however, I got thus prosperously from the danger of all the Courts of guard, yet the last cen∣tinell either bitten with his servile attendance in the open aire, whilst his other companions in warme roomes enjoyed content, or being by na∣ture more suspitious then the rest of his fellowes, began strictly, not only to examine our intenti∣ons, but roughly to deny our passage, in so much as my fervant not believing it was safe to admit of such a hazardable contention, quickly drew out a short hanger he had by his side, and gave
him a blow upon the pate, that made him aske counsell of the ground for the rest of his procee∣dings, whether the wound was mortall or no, we left him only to consider, whilst we made our passage, free in the night season, through a thick wood not farre distant from the Castle, untill the breaking of the morning, constrained us to seeke refuge in a darke cave, where we continued all the next day for feare of discovery, since we doubted not, but my flight would soon be pur∣sued with open cry. When the skie began againe to be obscured for our advantage after the going downe of the Sun, we thought it best to take a new journey towards the City of Sardis, where confusion we supposed would secure us, untill we could finde a conve∣nient transportation for Syria; however our wea∣rinesse, & want of food compelled me the next day about noone, to take up my habitation in a small Cottage under a hill side, in whose dwelling there only remained an old man with his wife, having between them as the fruits of their long marriage one daughter, which by the way must occasion a pretty short story: We no sooner en∣tred the house, but being provoked by a sufficient appetite, we called for such provision as they had, promising a large payment, and they as willingly condiscended to our desires, in which office the maid seemed most diligent, not only in regard of her own good huswifery, but being exceedingly delighted, as might be gathered by her smiling countenance at my strange attire; in the house there was but two beds, the one where the old
people lay, and the other for the young wench; so that I was to take up my rest necessarily in the Girles bed, where I must confesse, I slept to my content, whilst my attendant made use of a bundle of straw in an out house for his lodging: but in the morning I might feele, not only one in bed with me, but the party to have her hand over my breast, whom by more consideration I found to be the young damosell of the Cottage; This I must confesse put me to some confusion, untill by a strict examination of her intention, I perceived it was only her own innocent curiosity, because she thought me a fine young gentlewoman: At which relation the Princesse could not chuse but laugh; the rather for that Ascanius, did with something a constrained earnestnesse, strive to de∣fend the wenches chastity, as if he had been jea∣lous also of his own honour: yet neverthelesse he was forced to confesse, the Maid did much questi∣on him, because he had no greater breasts; But having sufficiently cleared his reputation, and jested out the rest, he againe continued his dis∣course. Although said he, I had sufficiently satisfied her in all questions concerning my travels, yet I had much adoe to perswade her to rise from me; so much was she in love with my company, neither would she condiscend to my request untill she had againe imbraced me, bestowing three or foure of her kisses upon my lips; This being performed, and having yawned a pretty space, as a testimony of her youthfull lazinesse, she suddenly started out of the bed in her smock, that was not of the finest
cloath, where she remained still discoursing with me untill her father, and mother lying in the lower roome, gave her a call or two to hasten her speed, yet I had opportunity enough to enquire of her, not only the neerest way to Sardis, but of the conveniency of the next Town, where I meant to provide my selfe of some change of apparrell, since I durst not trust those, which brought me from the Castle. In conclusion, after I had imployed my servant a few dayes neare the place to buy other Robes; and bestowed my old apparrell upon the wench, for a gratuity of her kindnesse, in affording me so freely her company the first night, I not permit∣ting the second I tooke my leave lovingly of the old people, who truly had entertained me with an honest Countrey affection, so that presently according to our direction, we repaired to the Bankes of the River Pactolus, where we quickly hired a Barke, that without any suspition at all brought us to Sardis, which Towne sheltred us without discovery, untill we found another con∣veniency to convey us to your Castle, where be∣ing arrived, we are confident you will not be∣tray your guests, but rather advise us by your Counsell, how to prosecute further my affaires; since it is to be thought, they will make a sudden and diligent inquiry after my escape. At which words with a pretty smile the Princesse Cloria cast her eyes upon her Governesse, as if she ex∣pected from her experience the best direction for them both. Roxana, when she had drawne the lookes of
Ascanius upon her in a curious manner, since he had not been formerly acquainted with her con∣versation, and also mused according to her cu∣stome for some short space, she gave this advice. Truly, said she, as it is most necessary in the prime place, that my Lord Ascanius provide for his own security, since it is impossible but some speedy search will be after his escape, the Senate not being willing to part with so many of the Royall family out of their own jurisdiction; So Madam be pleased to thinke it convenient, that the Queen now remaining in Syria, may presently be made acquainted with this fortunate delivery of my Lord your brother from his imprisonment by some trusty messenger to be dispatched from our Counsels, which party may be (as I conceive) this faithfull servant, the companion of his Tra∣vels, whom he hath now brought along with him into this Castle, who cannot well remaine here in that he will rather prove a Subject of suspition then an officer of use, since the daily visits of this place by the Nobility, and other people of qua∣lity must of necessity bring his name in question. And for this beautifull runaway your brother, since he so well becomes a Maids attire, and hath so bravely given testimony of his own modesty, I see no reason why he may not still live amongst us, without danger to his own person, or preju∣dice to our honours, being entertained as your at∣tendant in your chamber, untill either commands out of Syria call him away, or you your selfe be removed from the jurisdiction of this Kingdome, by your happy marriage with my Lord Narcissus;
at which words the Princesse became as red as Scarlet, not dreaming her young brother should so abruptly have been made acquainted with her secret ingagement: But the fault was already committed, and Roxana had no time to aske for∣givenesse, wherefore something confounded by her errour, as well as she could she went on with her continued discourse. However said she, that we may not remaine al∣together ignorant of the proceedings of the Se∣nate, I shall industriously endeavour to instruct our little dwarfe, who wants no wit to make such inquiry abroad, as may be most convenient for our affaires, for whose truth and honesty I will undertake, with the engagement of my reputati∣on; This may give you a full liberty to enjoy with freedome each others company, a benefit that neither of you will repine at I am sure, since the fates have been hitherto penurious to both your conversations; with these words she rested silent in a kinde of a grave smile, expecting the young couple should signe their consents by some demonstration. After that Roxana had fully ended her dis∣course, the lovely paire looked upon each other, with such a sweet chearefulnesse, as if their own passions had no desire to enquire further after the depth of her reasons, since their hearts abundantly approved of the consequence of her designe, which was that they might enjoy the felicity of one anothers conversation; at last Cloria asked her brother, how he liked the wisedome of her Governesse, which gave him occasion to tell her,
that he did not now wonder how she had passed through the intricacie of so many dangerous ad∣ventures, having had so faithfull and discreet a Pilot to guide her, in the vast sea of such despe∣rate accidents. In the meane time this delighted company past away their howers in such conversation, as most tended to Euarchus wished prosperity, sometimes complaining of the unrelenting cruelty of the Se∣nate, that could so long detaine their just and mercifull King in a darke prison, instead of cast∣ing themselves at his feet humbly to desire pardon for their offences, otherwhiles againe they would entertaine their thoughts, with new hopes of his releasement by powerfull Armies sent into Lydia by all the Princes of Asia, in which number Nar∣cissus had no low ranke in the opinion of love∣partiall Cloria; neither seldome did they agree in beliefe, that the generall distractions of the King∣dome, would soon put an end to the differences without any other assistance, untill these diversi∣ties of fancies carried them one day into the gar∣den, where Clorias diligent servant in the view of other attendants, observed so carefully the directi∣ons of her charge; that she made alwayes election of those fruit that the Princesse intention did but only covet, and presented them to be made more beautifull by the touch of her white hand. In these entertainments I say they continued untill an ancient Lord of the Senate, who had not altogether put off his duty and affection to the Kings posterity, with a seeming joy that made him forget his accustomed ceremonies to the
Princesse Cloria, not onely suddenly entred the Garden, but made a kind of rude passage through the crowd of such as waited neere her person; and with a breathlesse voyce informed her, that, that very morning, as the Nobility were sitting in their own Councell chamber, divided by a par∣tition from the common assembly of the lower Senate, they were saluted in a tumultuous man∣ner by may thousands of people (having their leaders of much greater quality) with a petition, that not onely complained of the proceedings of the Army, but defired they might again speedily enjoy the liberty of their King, the freedome of the Lawes, and an establishment of their Religion, as they said absolutely obstructed from their pos∣session, by the licentious power of the Souldiers under Farezius command, whom (as they inti∣mated) they had formerly chosen to be their Captaine for some season, but not to be a tyrant against their priviledges for ever; vowing with∣all, that as they would not depart the great City of Sardis without a direct answer, so were they resolved to procure an accomplishment of their just requests, to the hazzard of their lives, and fortunes. O Madam, said he, how these brave begin∣nings, inflamed our soules with new courages: notwithstanding, we could not chuse in some sort, but reflect upon our own poornesse of spirit, or at leastwise dulnesse in understanding, that ne∣ver went about to put in execution what these people propound at present for their and our ad∣vantages.
Truely, replied the Princesse Cloria, although I cannot but commend these peoples understan∣dings, that appeare to have some sense and fee∣ling of their reputations yet must I a great deale more extoll their courages, that dare expose themselves to maintaine those small priviledges, which by a certaine kind of birth-right they have received from their honest and wise ance∣stors; when as you of the Nobility, of the con∣trary, seem altogether stupid in the apprehension of such honourable rights that appertain to your qualities, left you by the brave endeavour of your most Noble predecessors: who were at the first so spleenative indiscreet, in your passions against your Prince (though without any known cause whatsoever) that you were content to sacrifice your known own advantages, above the common all people, onely that you might but destroy him and his prerogative; not leaving your selves so much power as to be able again to recover your own dignities. These words and reproofe of the Princesse al∣most put the Nobleman out of his tale; but she finding him something out of countenance, en∣couraged him to the prosecution of his relation: Madam, said he, when we had thanked them for their prudent admonition (as we termed it) what our own duties should have remembred, we presently dismissed them, with other speeches and promises, that sufficiently contented them for the instant. After they were gone, I must tell you, we were sent to the other part of the Senate, sitting in another room distinct from ours; intimating
we desired some conference with them, whereby the people might be rendred satisfied in their seeming just demands: upon our meeting, many things were propounded to that purpose, as well concerning our selves as the souldiers; but what will be the issue of these proceedings, for my part I am not able to divine: onely we are informed, that the multitude will not depart from the City of Sardis, untill they have received such answer, as may in some sort give content to their thoughts: which either must settle the Kingdom in a probable posture for peace and quietnesse, or so inflame the Armies resolutions, that they will endeavour to become masters of the whole. With these words he abruptly took his leave, as if his apprehensions had been transported only by ima∣ginary conceipts. As soone as the Lord had quitted the garden, and the rest of the attendance being also removed some distance from them, the Princesse, Ascanius and Roxana, began to fall upon confiderations and discourses of the Kings affaires: sometimes their hopes were carried to assure themselves, that it was unpossible, but those confusions must needs produce effects to that purpose; since, as they believed, the souldiers of the Senate could not long agree, and then the common peoples desires of necessity would again bring him into his Throne: for they imagined, that however there might be obstacles & contentions for the present, in regard of the extraordinary power of the army, yet the souldiers at the last could not but admit of a King, more willingly then any other
Generall of their own ranke to command over them: besides they doubted not, but the Nobi∣lity, and the City of Sardis would joyne toge∣ther to establish Euarchus in the same honour and dignity as he was in before these late trou∣bles; since the consequences had already not a little impoverished the whole Kingdom, and what it would doe further if it should continue, might very well be feared, though as yet not certainly known; In that the dignity of a Court probably, would as well confirme the one in their heredi∣tary priviledges, as inrich the others by traffique and commerce; seeing it was chiefly the better sort of persons, that took off the commodities of the Merchants. These pleasant apprehensions invited them all three to take some delight, in a certaine beauti∣full and refreshing Grote, encompassed round about by an intricate Labyrinth, or Wilderness of flourishing Trees, that shaded it sufficiently from the eyes of people: in the middest thereof there was a Fountaine upon the borders, in which was contrived many sorts of Chaces by dogges and huntsmen; who by the turning of severall arti∣ficiall Cocks, seemed not onely to move in prose∣cution of their prey, but the hounds with open mouthes barked and made a noyse. The pretti∣nesse of the conceit, for a long space gave young Ascanius sufficient content: when they were weary of beholding of this invention, they went to the viewing of other rarities. There they might behold Andromeda, with the Sea Monster, com∣ming out of the water to devoure her, whilst her
sorrowfull parents stood upon the bordering shore, to behold that wofull and lamenable Tra∣gedy, occasioned as they thought by the too much severity and cruelty of the gods, untill Perseus the sonne of Dane, that was courted in a shower of Gold by Jupiter, descended from the skies upon his flying horse, and seemed to rescue the distressed Lady. There were also to be seen in that place, divers Artificers, working in their Trades, onely by the force and current of the wa∣ter: in like manner, others playing upon severall kinds of Instruments, both delightfull to the eare, and pleasing to the apprehension. Besides, Birds of all species, made of Glasse and other materials, that seemed to chirpe in a naturall way, though onely so contrived by the meere invention of men, to give the greater satisfaction to luxurious sense. After they had as it were glutted their contemplation with these delightfull vanities, the Princesse Cloria being better skil'd then her bro∣ther in the use of such devices, suddenly turned one of the pipes, which quickly over-spread young Ascanius, with a large Canopy of Water, that resembled a plentifull, though sweet shower from the heavens, in so much as he knew not at the instant, how to winde himselfe out of the in∣conveniency, untill he was forced to entreat his sisters favour for his redemption; neither did she altogether afford him that grace, since he became a little wet to purchase a convenient experience against another time. But Roxana, as if she thought her Mistresse had used something too much severity towards her young brother, be∣gan
a needlesse apologie for the action, when she might have known Ascanius could not be displea∣sed at any thing his sister did. When they had as it were dwelt long enough upon these watry pleasures, they again returned into their own lodgings, in which place the metamorposed mayd was most carefull to observe those decorums that belonged to her office, and attendance, least the contrary might have occasioned the endangering of his discovery: where they remained, I may say, entertaining themselves sometimes with hopes, and sometimes with feares, untill the dwarfes returne brought them more certaine in∣telligence, of many passages both from Sardis and other Regions: however because they desired to understand his information, in the most metho∣dicall way, in regard the circumstances as they apprehended, would give a great light to the in∣tentions on foot, they wisht him to tell his story and adventures in order, which he performed in this manner. After said he, I parted from this Castle, accor∣ding to your command I went to the very doore of the Senate-house, the best place as I thought for intelligence; where finding all those that stood without in a most confused distraction, both in their words and looks, it was not long before many of the chiefe Senators, of a sudden came out of the room; when presently they went with a great deale of haste towards another chamber, where I understood by the discourses of the multitude, they were designed to meet some of the Lords about a conference, concerning the
settlements of the disorders of the Kingdome. I being both bold, and little, and so consequently as I thought not much to be suspected, in the confused crowd thrust in along with them, where placing my selfe in a nook of the chamber under a hanging it was my chance to heare these severall discourses from them. The first sort of Senators that spake, thought it convenient, if not altogether necessary, again to settle the King in his ancient dignity, not onely in regard of the extraordinary cries of the com∣mon people to that purpose, but also for that there were so many severall factions within them∣selves in the Senate, not probable to be reconci∣led, with any advantage to the Nation: Others notwithstanding were of a contrary opinion, al∣leadging that it were better to hazard the ruine of the whole Countrey in a generall confusion, then to come any more under the jurisdiction of that Tyrannicall government, as they said they had with so much bloud already endeavoured to destroy: A third number of that assembly, see∣med in some sort to be willing to restore againe Euarchus to his Crowne in full lustre, but they doubted, least his unrelenting spleen might put him on, to call the Senate to a strict account for their past actions, and severity used both against his authority and person; wherefore wisht rather to have some of his posterity Crowned in his place, whom for such a benefit as they believed, would easily be perswaded to forgive and forget his fathers injuries: This proposition a long time entertained their fancies, untill they considered,
that not only Prince Arethusius was in the King∣dome of Syria, prosecuting the Queen his Mo∣thers designes, and my Lord Ascanius his brother had lately by flight procured his owne liberty without their consents, that absolutely beate back any more discourse upon that subject; how∣ever they thought it convenient, if not extreame∣ly necessary for the present, to give what satis∣faction they could to the discontented people, who belike attended in great numbers, about the City of Sardis to that purpose: yet it was consi∣dered with all, that if they should endeavour al∣together to please the multitude, without having their Swords ready drawne in their hands, whereby to be able to chastize them, if they should prove too unreasonable in their demands, they must expect dangerous and insolent affronts, in∣stead of quietnesse and obedience to their com∣mands: In so much as they thought it convenient in the interim that they entertained the peoples expectations, with good words and faire promi∣ses, to send privately to Farezius, wishing him to be ready to march with his Souldiers, to keep the multitude in due obedience to the Senates autho∣rity if they should continue these extravagant prosecutions of their designes, which in effect being fully resolved upon by them all, they quick∣ly broake up the Assembly. So that when they were in this manner dis∣persed and I had freed my selfe undiscovered from their companies, I thought it my duty, to gaine what other intelligence I could amongst the common people, since I conceived, much con∣sisted
in their constant and brave resolutions, to which purpose they seemed in some sort to have assembled themselves, with an intention to con∣tend against the present government, by some violent manner of prosecution, though for the better colour of their actions and intentions, they appeared only with petitions in their hands, in∣stead of other weapons of danger: With these thoughts I held it my best course to retire into the very heart or body of the City of Sardis, as well to feele the pulse and constitution of the Inhabi∣tants, as the likelier to be informed by their in∣telligence, concerning all other proceedings of the Kingdome: neither in this designe was I much deceived in my expectation, for sorting my con∣versation, with watermen and other inferiour people, I understood, that as the rich Citizens of the Towne, although they desire againe to have their King to governe over them, though with some restriction in his power, because they feare his revenge, since otherwise as they believe, they could probably expect nothing but a generall confusion, so of the other side it is apparant the multitude for the most part desire a change; not only in regard of the envy they beare to the Se∣nate, who more absolutely command over their persons and estates then the King ever did in his greatest glory, but also in regard, they doubt the Souldiers at the last, will come to be Masters of every mans fortune; which jurisidction of all o∣thers, they most detest in their natures and dispo∣fitions: As I was sufficiently satisfied in these in∣clinations of the people, I repaired to the publike
place of commerce for the whole City, where (in short) amongst the Merchants I understood, that not onely a great part of the Navy was revolted to the King (the Marriners being encouraged thereunto by some Senators which Fare∣zius the Generall had formerly sent into banish∣ment) but that the Myssians were also preparing a great Army, by the directions of the Kingdom of Syria, suddenly to invade Lydia, on the Kings behalfe. These newes giving my endeavours suf∣ficient encouragement, still to prosecute my de∣signe, for other intelligences, within three or foure daies afterward, I became certainly infor∣med, that the Senate being not able, or at least∣wise not willing to give the multitude satisfacti∣on, according to the desire of their petitions, they had in great numbers not onely taken up armes for their own defence, in regard they under∣stood that Farezius had directions, notwithstan∣ding the opposition of the Lords, to march to∣wards their assemblies with all his power, but they had also seized upon many Castles and Towns, towards their enterprize and assistance in the Kings name; with whom in like manner many of the Nobility joyn with considerable Forces. Last of all, you may be pleased to know, That Hercrombrotus, Lieutenant Generall to Farezius, is of a sudden called away with a great part of the Army, towards the confines of Lydia, neere the City of Smyrna, occasioned by reason of the revolt of some of his own Commanders, who are joyned with the power and force of the Countrey to oppose the Senates proceeding:
which in effect is the full information I can give concerning my imployment. When the Dwarfe had made an end of this re∣lation, the Princesse Cloria smiled upon her bro∣ther, not onely to see how well the boy had per∣formed his office, according to the confidence her Governesse Roxana had in his wit and fide∣lity; but withall in regard of the inward joy she felt concerning the King her fathers affaires, that seemed now to be in a better posture then they were, almost since the beginning of his troubles: for she imagined by the consequences, his subjects would be constrained for their own advantages, to place him again in his Throne, in a higher ca∣pacity of power then before. Ascanius of the other side, expressed also by his countenance the like gladnesse, in so much as after a little space, as if he had been in a manner transported with thoughts of delight and satisfaction, according to his youthfull conceptions, that were apt e∣nough to entertaine all Ideas of content and feli∣city, presently runne to his sister, and whilst both his arms were cast about her neck, he sealed, as well his affection as his joy upon her Ruby lips, by a multitude of sweet though more deere kisses: but she at last, either something apprehending the too much importunity of such affections, or else desirous to inform her selfe better of other par∣ticulars, told her brother in a jesting way, that as she could scarce dispence with the rigid rules of her own modesty, to have her virgin lips so assaul∣ted, although it were from an affectionate bro∣ther, whose innocent vertue was beyond all pos∣sibility
of scandall, so did she of the other fide exceedingly wonder, that his own change of con∣dition, which onely procured his safety, under the protection of the Castle, where for the pre∣sent they remained, had not wrought in his dis∣position contrary effects, to that quality wherein he was born, since now he was to esteem him∣selfe rather a servant to fortune, then a Prince by extraction: not a Prince, replyed Ascanius? the gods defend, I should ever harbour in my brest such poore and unworthy thoughts, notwith∣standing the injustice or malice of any fortune whatsoever: no sister, be you assured, that both for your sake and my own, I shall alwaies endea∣vour by my actions, to shew that I am sonne to Euarchus and Hyacinthia, and I doubt not but you will doe the like concerning your own par∣ticular: But yet, replied the sweet Princesse, we are obliged in some sort to yield to our fates, when we have not means sufficient left us to pre∣vent them; for if the Senate, by a certain kind of a tyrannicall power granted them by the hea∣vens (perhaps onely in correction of our offences) doe imprison and circumscribe our persons, what matters of consequence can our mindes afford us to our advantage in such exigencies? O say not so, answered Ascanius; for the mind is able to be a noble conquerour over all unfortunate disasters; since in my youthfull studies I have read of many brave persons, that in the highest expres∣sions of tyranny, and afflictions imposed upon their bodies, by their worst and greatest enemies, have at last in despight of all their cruelty, born
away the onely palme and Lawrell of victory; as it were confounding their very persecutors, with the extraordinary constancy of their own suffe∣rings. These, said Cloria, I must confesse are brave resolutions in words, if they can be as well practised by actions: for I must tell you, that flesh and bloud cannot easily put off all naturall incli∣nations; though I will not deny, but the soule may doe miracles, being ayded by divine consi∣derations; and oftentimes hath demonstrated wonderfull effects, meerely out of some extraor∣dinary sense, or inflammation of honour, both by Souldiers and Philosophers. Truly, said As∣canius, then it were very hard, being Kings chil∣dren, if we should not in our proceedings meet with some of these faculties to our benefit; when as perhaps contemptible slaves in former ages have aboundantly exampled to our knowledge and edification, such heroicall suffering. As they were thus discoursing, Roxana, who had for a long space kept a most formall and grave silence, thought it also convenient to shew her own wisdome; the rather, since her yeeres and experience, pretended to a certaine kind of prerogative amongst those of the younger sort of people. Truely, said she, as I cannot deny, but that this extraordinary courage you mention, is of a singular benefit to many sorts of people, in their pressing and difficult occasions; yet when with a wise (though not a base) complyance, we can avoyd both the inconvenience and hazard to our selves, with more ease and no dishonour, I see no reason, why we should goe about to
straine nature to no purpose? especially if we be not well assured to gaine a beneficiall victory by the contention; And if we faile in that we seem to undertake, we contract thereby a further mis∣chiefe and disreputation to our selves, then if we had not at all offered to contend against po∣wer and oppression at the first: besides oftentimes those resistances in the dark shall never come tru∣ly to the knowledge of the world, so that conse∣quently we faile then of that glory, our foolish and preposterous ambition aymed at by such re∣solutions: by which means we shall be rather enterpreted to be blown up with vain-glorious fumes, then seasoned with true fortitude: In time the best mixture must be so to moderate our acti∣ons, that as precipitately we put not our selves upon vain and needlesse sufferings, without ne∣cessity, so ought not we too much to yield to the inconstant stroakes of fortune and oppression, when either honour or religion calls us to a pub∣lique demonstration of our bravery and courage. But however these disputations might either con∣firme Cloria, or convert her brother, yet Ascanius finding the opportunity, for his own desired im∣ployment in the Kings affaires, he resolved as soon as possible he could, to seek occasion for his own speedy departure; which did not a little afflict the considerations of his sweet sister the Princesse Cloria, who began to contract a most singular delight in the witty conversation of her deare brother. Neverthelesse she resolved not to be so great a friend to her own passions, as to be∣come thereby an enemy to his honour, and her
fathers prosperity: so that this being after some consultation determined on all sides, Ascanius intended in some new disguise, like a boy belon∣ging to the Navy, to steale privately away to sea, under the protection of those officers that might afford him the conveniency, to repaire to those ships that had revolted from the Senates ser∣vice FINIS.
