To the Inhabitants of the County of Cornwall, A Letter of Thanks from King CHARLES I. Of Ever Blessed Memory, Dated SEPT. 10. 1643. from SÆ²DLY Castle. CAROLUS REX, WE are so highly sensible of the extraordinary Merits of Our County of Cornwall, of their Zeal for the Defence of our Person, and the Just Rights of Our Crown, in a time when We could contribute so little to Our own Defence, or to their Assistance; (in a time, when not only no Reward appeared, but great and probable Dangers were threatned to Obedience and Loyalty) of their Great and Eminent Courage and Patience in their Indefatigable prosecution of their great work against so Potent an Enemy, backt with so Strong, Rich and Populous Cities, and so plentifully furnished with Men, Arms, Money, Ammunition and Provisions of all kinds; and of the wonderful success with which it hath pleased Almighty God (though with the loss of some Eminent persons, who shall never be forgotten by Us to reward their Loyalty and Patience) by many strange Victories over their and Our Enemies, in despite of all humane probabilities and all imaginable disadvantages; that as We cannot be forgetful of so great Deserts, so We cannot but desire to publish to all the World, and perpetuate to all time the memory of their Merits, and of Our Acceptance of the same. And to that end, We do hereby render Our Royal Thanks to that Our County in the most publick and lasting manner We can devise, Commanding Copies hereof to be Printed and published, and one of them to be read in every Church and Chapel therein, and to be kept for ever as a Record in the same, that as long as the History of these Times, and of this Nation shall continue, the Memory of how much that County hath merited from Us and Our Crown, may be derived with it to Posterity. Given at our Camp at Sudly Castle the Tenth of September 1643.
