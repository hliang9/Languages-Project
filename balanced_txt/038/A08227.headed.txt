Now whilst I thus {reversed ;}in all Obedience of the Loue; walked in Pietas, I was combred very-much in my Thoughtes· and in the Solitarines of my inwarde Beeinge or Spirit / with the won∣derfull Woorkes of God / for to vnderstande in my Spirit {reversed ;}vnder the Obedience of the Loue; the Wonderful-actes of God. and in what maner-of-sort / God wolde accomplish his Woorkes and his vprightDan. 7. c.

Therfore must I yeat saye {reversed ;}as before; that God doth now in thissame Daye {reversed ;}through the o∣uerflowinge Grace of his Loue / and through the Omnipotentie of his mostholie Beeinge; bringe-fourth the Purest / out of the Most-vncleane / the Liuingest / out of the Most-deadlie / and the Sa∣uedest / out of the Most-condemned: and maketh e∣uenso of his cheefest Enemies / Rom. 5. b. his loueliest Frindes: also bringeth those that were most-fardest from Him, most-neerest vnto Him: and they which haue ben {reversed ;}ler. 2. d. 3. a. euen as vnfaithfull Members of an vnfaith∣full Espowsed-wife; most-vnfaithfull vnto Him / Those doth Hee now make faithfull / Ozeae. 2. a. and accept∣eth

WHo shoulde haue thought that an adul∣terous whoorish Wife / coulde by any∣meanes Ier. 3. a. haue obtained such a Grace at her Hus∣bandes handes / as that Shee (inasmuch as shee {reversed ;}with her whoorish Lustes and vnchast Desires; had turned her awaye from her Husbande / Ezec. 16. 23. and committed her Whordom with so many Straun∣gers) shoulde bee receaued againe of her Hus∣bande / for such a beloued Wife. and that Hee should let her knowe {reversed ;}in the Seruice of his Loue; so throughlie his Minde and Will: Yea / soIer. 3. a. b. to hange or addict his Heart & Loue on her againe / as if shee had neuer ben turned-away from Him. 5. Trulie / this is to be reconed for a speciall and an aboundant Grace / wherin men haue greatlie to wonder. For who should any-waye haue thought / that an adulterous Wife / shoulde in such-sort haue ben cleansed from her Whoordom· and made so faithfull and meete {reversed ;}in the Obedience of the Re∣quiring of the Seruice of Loue; for to bring-fourth all good Frutes? 6. NOw with this my Wonderinge heere∣at / I stayed mee in my Talke: but the Sight of myne Eyes / was euermore fixed on the great Reuelation of God: and I tooke good-heed / to all the heauenlie Sightes / that were shewed vnto mee. 7. But when I had a little heald mee still heer∣in / then spake Testimony-of-trueth vnto mee / and saide: Rest thyself now from all this Won∣deringe

For in thesame / God will yeat re∣ueale vnto thee and let thee see / manye secreat Thinges / Esa. 64. c. 1. Cor. 2. a. which haue neuer ben seene of Mans Eyes / nor heard of his Eares. 8.

Heerwith I thanked the Lorde with Ioye / for all thissame great Grace extended ouer all Peo∣ple that loue the Trueth: and I endeuoured myself for to doo euenso / as ther was saide vnto mee. The X. Chap. AFter this Sayinge of Testimony-of-trueth, I looked-about ouer all the Heauens / as ouer aEsa. 2. a. Mich. 4. a. very-great Moun∣taine. Also I looked downe al-ouer the vniuersall Earth. and beholde: On the Earth / ther were euery-wheare many littleEsa. 2. b. Hilles: as also besides that / many Valleis or Lowe-places. 2. Now as I looked vpwardes into ye Heauēs
I sawe by the Multitudes of manye Heauens / a very-mightie and stedfastEsa. 9. a.

Apo. 21. 22. a. neuer chaunged / and after the which also no Night ensued. 3. But as I looked downe on the Earth / I sawe and heard by all ye Multitude of little Hilles / alwayes a great Sounde of a Hurringe-noyze / withMath. 24. a. 4. Esdr. 13. d. 15. b. much Variaunce and Dissention: And that for the most-part / because that each-one of the little Hilles, wolde inforce him to be the best and lord∣liest on the Earth. 4. Also ther was by them all / verie-little Light. For those-same Lightes which they had by them / were all of little Light / and of small Power. and also verye chaungeable into Darknesses. And for that cause also / the Darknesses or Nightes / were theare much-more and longer / then the Lightes or Dayes. 5. After that I had once throughlie-vewed these chaungeable Lightes / and the Vnpeaceable∣nes and Stowtnes of the little Hilles on ye Earth / and considered well theron / I turned my Sight againe to that one very-greatEsa. 2. a.

I mourned greatlie ouer the Miserie of the Peo∣ple / that inhabited the Earth. For I pitied much their Hunger and Thirst.Ier. 14. a.

{reversed ;}in all his Searchinge-prouidence; ronne-to-an-ende / in the Knowledge of Good and Euell.

As I was now consideringe heeron / ther appeered vnto mee two Spirites / which also were well knowen vnto mee. The one SpiritGen. 3. a. was / Searching-prouidence, which did heere-tofore {reversed ;}through much Riches of the Knowledge; reioyce the Man / in his Vnderstandinge. 3. The other Spirit was / Thaccuser, which also in times-passed was a Iudge / in the Mans Vnderstandinge: and for-that-cause / he dwelt in the MansSap. 17. b. Rom. 2. b. Conscience. Wherthrough the Man {reversed ;}when-as the Accuser approued his cause;Luk. 18. a. waxed∣prowde {reversed ;}in his owne Righteousnes; very-often: Againe of thother-syde {reversed ;}when-as y• Accuser accused

MOreouer / As I was thus harkening with myne Eares / to their Sounde / so heard I that Searching-prouidence spake / and saide vnto the Accuser: 5. I haue dealt or conuersated mee for a longe-time / with the Man {reversed ;}in his Vnderstandinge; in the earthlie Beeinge: also gouerned him with al∣maner of Prudence and Ingeniousnes of y• Know∣ledge: Gen. 3. a. and therto {reversed ;}out of thesame Knowledge; taught him how to distinct or seuer the Good from the Euell: and haue yet farder / let him enioye or in∣herit thesame experymented Wisdom / as a Light. And ther was neuer yeat anye Vnrighteousnes founde in mee. For I am iust in all my Dealinges. For-that-cause also / my Authoritie-in-gouernment ought to be greater / then ouer the Mans Vnder∣standinge / in the earthlie Beeinge. 6. Heer-vnto answered the Accuser. and saide: I haue also no-dowt / ben alwayes as a Iudge by thee: andSap. 17. b. Rom. 2. b. accused the Man / in his Vnderstan∣dinge {reversed ;}when-as hee transgressed in any of all that which hee admitted as Good {reversed ;}through Thee; in y• Knowledg; as a Transgressour of the Good. and asscribed euenso the Right therin vnto thee. Wher-through thy Power & Gouernment {reversed ;}in the Mans Vnderstandinge; is becom so great on the Earth.
7. Then sayde Searchinge-prouidence: I holde not myself contented / with thissame Gouern∣ment on the Earth. For ther belongeth yet greater vnto mee / inasmuch as I haue preuayled by the Man {reversed ;}in his Vnderstandinge; with the Know∣ledge {reversed ;}against Gods Woorde / and the Obedience that God requireth therwith; and gotten as also kept theGen. 3. b. Victorye therin in him / on the Earth. 8. Inasmuch then as God hath alwaies inuey∣ed or set-vp himself against mee / on the Earth. and yet hath not ben able {reversed ;}hetherto; to preuaile against my Wisdome out of the Knowledge / So haue I now therfore made-vpp myself / out of the earthlie Beeinge / for to appeere {reversed ;}with my Wisdome; a∣gainst God, wher-by that I mought also get the Dominion / in the heauenly Beeinge. What will you laye?Esa. 14. a. b. I shall raigne aboue God {reversed ;}or at least∣wise / equall with God; in the Heauen also. 9. Then saide the Accuser: Thou hast {reversed ;}surelie; right therto. For what hath God brought-in at any-time / against thyne expert Wisdome / that hath perseuered on the Earth? Or2. Pet. 3. a. where appee∣reth that which hee hath promised? For Al-thinge remayneth still in one State. Therfore go-fourth now boldlie. Thy Title is right. And I also will not faile / in Accusation against God / to be alwayes by thee. For to thee belongeth the Dominion in the Heauen / like as thou {reversed ;}through the Light of thy Knowledge; hast thesame on the Earth. 10. Then saide Searching-prouidence: For to winne the Right / therto am I sufficientlie
grounded / and also of good courraige. Therfore I will now not spare to presse on-fourth to the eauen / and trye my TitleEsa. 58. a. in the Lawe / against God. I fore-see the mattier so {reversed ;}through the Sear∣inge in the Knowledge; that I shall preuaile / and that I {reversed ;}with my knowledgfull Wisdom; shall iudged worthier for to raigne / then God /1. Reg. 15. b. 1. Pet. 1. b. with he Requiring of his Obedience. For dowtles ther nothing / that can bringe-vnder or-yet surmount he Light of the prudent and expert Wisdom. For-hat-cause also / it is becom {reversed ;}aboue the Obedience f God; the Renowmedst and Excellentest / or the Best-esteemed / on the Earth. 1. Therto affirmed the Accuser: Thy Case is questionles; al-cleere. And it is also well knowen / y all earthlie Wyse on the Earth / that thy Light f expert Wisdom / is exalted {reversed ;}1. Cor. 1. b. by all worldlie Wyse and Scripture-learned; ouer the whole Worlde / aboue the Obedience which God requy∣th· healde for the Best and Truest· and counted o be the Excellentest: and that moreouer / by that ccasion / the scientiall or knowledgfull Wisdome ath gotten the Preheminence / amonge all those hat dwell on the Earth. For the1. Reg. 15. c. 1. Pet. 1. b. Obedience to he Woorde of God {reversed ;}which God requireth; is ith thesame (like as it appeereth on the Earth) hollie gon-vnder or depressed: In such-sort / that her is nomore regarde taken {reversed ;}or very-little; on the Requiring of the Obedience to ye Woorde of God. 2. Then saide Searchinge-prouidence: I n sure that God {reversed ;}for-asmuch certes as Hee is
not subtile in the Ingenious-prudentie / nether yet also any of all His / that serue Him; shall not b able to excuse him heerin against mee. And when-a I shall then {reversed ;}in the Lawe; excell Him with the Subtiltie of my Knowledge / Esa. 14. a. b. so may I also well {reversed ;}with right and honestie / before all the Worlde and he Wyse; take-in ye Heauē: and so then beare the Dominion / ouer all what is in Heauen and on the Earth▪ The XVII. Chap. WHen I had thus heard-throughli the Counsell and Enterprise of these Spirites / I wondered very-greatlie at thei Talke and Purpose. But yet I consi∣dered on their Enterprise: and looked what th Ende therof wolde be. 2. Now when they had thus helde their Counsel together and throughlie-concluded all their Mat∣tier / in what order they wolde handle thesame / the came they {reversed ;}with a Vehement-russhinge; vnto Hea∣uen / before God: And Searchinge-prouidenc made his Complaint / before God. and saide: 3. Ther is great Iniurie ministred vnto Me Searching-prouidence / on the Earth: For agains myne Office and my Righteousnes / ther is a other entred into myne Office: by whom both and also the Man {reversed ;}in his Vnderstanding; haue be constrained {reversed ;}oftentimes;Math. 12. c. Luk. 11. c. to suffer Distourbaunce▪ 4. Therto answered God. and saide: Be quie thou Searching-prouidence: Whosoeuer mini∣reth
Iniurie / against thee and the Trueth / let him thy Seruant: and beare thou ouer him thyne uthoritie. . Ther-withall spake the Accuser. and saide: Thou God thyself / art euen Hee which hast mini∣red the wronge / vnto Searching-prouidence: nd hast oftentimes {reversed ;}with thy Woorde; entred-in gainst him / into his Office. But-yetGen. 3. . Rom. 1. c. Searching-prouidence {reversed ;}hauing ingendred ye greatest Know∣edge / in the Mans Vnderstandinge; hath al∣wayes {reversed ;}with his subtile expert Wisdom / and with he Mans Ingeniousnes; gon-beyonde Thee. and reuayled against Thee and the Obedience which hou requyrest / or hath wonne the Victorie therin n the Earth / and also kept thesame. . Inasmuch now therfore as that Searching-prouidence / hath alwaies on the Earth {reversed ;}with the xpert or knowledgfull Wisedom / in the Mans Vnderstandinge; gon-beyonde Thee {reversed ;}O God; in hy Woorde and Requiring of the Obedience: and hat Thou hast not atchiued or brought-to-effect herwith / anything on the Earth / against the expert Wisdome and the Mans Ingeniousnes / through Searching-prouidence,A Sentence pronoūced rash¦lie in Partiali∣tye, is often founde false. So hast thou (I saye) ministred wronge against him. And for-that-cause {reversed ;}according to thy Woorde; thou shalt be his Ser∣uant: and hee shall also raigne or beare Dominion in the Heauen / life-as on the Earth. 7. THen saide God vnto Searching-proui∣dence: Inasmuch as thou with the Ac∣cuser / dost make a Complaint against Mee / and the
Accuser taketh-part with thee / so cannot therfo the Accuser iudge our Causes / accordinge to Trueth. For-that-cause / chuse thou a Iudge Heauen wheare-in I dwell: And I will {reversed ;}of other-side; chuse also One / on the Earth / fro whence thou with the Accuser art com / & whea thou hast the Gouernment. Both These shall the be our Iudges / in discising of all Mattiers / whi ether thou / or anyman els bringeth against Me wherin I should haue donne ether maintaine wronge. 8. Thissame which God spake / pleased Sear∣chinge-prouidence very-well: and hee chose Heauen for a Iudge / Testimony-of-trueth. 9. Then chose also God {reversed ;}of his part; on th Earth to a Iudge / The Memorye or Vnder∣standinge of the Man. And euenso both thes [Testimony-of-trueth and The Mans Vnderstandinge] were fore-seene and chosen / in Heaue and on Earth / for true Iudges / For to pronounce-fourth {reversed ;}now in the last Time; the right Senten∣ces of the true Iudgment of God: and also wha the Requiring of thesame Iudgment is of ye Chil∣dren of Men / on the Earth. 10. Now when that the Election of the vpright Iudges / was thus com-to-passe / then spake Te∣stimony-of-trueth, and saide: Forasmuch now as I am foreseene & chosen of Prouidence {reversed ;}which i com-vpp from the Earth / vnto Heauen / with Occasion of Contention against God; to a Iudge: and that also of the other-side / The Mans Vn∣derstandinge

For presentlie {reversed ;}in this Daye; wee will bring-fourth and pronounce the vpright Iudgment, ac∣cording to the Trueth: Also execute thesame / both in Heauen and on Earth / to-thende that it all mought go in his right Course / or be reduced into his right Order. 12. Therfore I will now appeere on the Earth, by the Mans Vnderstandinge. For I knowe that the Power / Hope / and Comfort of thesame on the Earth / is vtterlie awaye. The XVIII. Chap.

For I bring vnto thee a ioyfull Messaige. 2. Then saide the Vnderstanding: How is it possible that I should let thee in & receaue thee in∣to mee / inasmuch as I knowe Thee not?

For I myself / was Gods Eye / or the pro∣uident Cleernes of his Light:Gen. 1. 2. Pro. 8. c. Wher-through Hee sawe-into the vpright Fourme of all Thinges / ereuer that hee made thesame. And yet farder / to a more Certentie or Confirmation of my Right. 10. I myself haue also first foreseene the Man vnto God / euen-like as Hee made thesame: In like sort also / the Healp of the Man: insomuch / that GodGen. 1. 2. a. made it-all / euen-like as I ؛Prouidence{punctel} foresawe it-all vnto Him. For God coulde do no∣thing without Mee / because I was ye Sight؛the Highest and Pretioust{punctel} of the Bodye of God. For-that-cause I am also the Lorde / or a God, euen-like as God himself.
The XXIII. Chap. THen saide God. It is true: Pro∣uidence is the Eye or the Sight / and a pretious Member of my Bodye: and that I also {reversed ;}through thesame; haue seene-into Al-thinge {reversed ;}ereuer I made it; well and a-right: InGen. 1. 2. . like-sort also touching the Man / which I made {reversed ;}with Light / Trueth / and Prouidence; ac∣cordinge to my Beeinge {reversed ;}in all; like vnto My∣self / to-thend that the Man should liue in Mee / and I in him {reversed ;}with one Beeinge; for euermore. 2. Had now the Man with the Prouidence / remayned standinge in my Woorde / Light / or Beeinge: and not searched / for to knowe anythinge more / So should also then likewise my Light and Trueth / haue remayned still in the Man and in his Prouidence. Also the Man should not haue needed anye thinge more / for to search{reversed ;}curiouslie; after my Light or Trueth / in the Knowledge. For the LifeGen. 2. b. and also the Dyinge of the Death / was sett in sight / before the Man and his Prouidence: in such-sort / that ther was not anything wanting to the Man / for to haue lyued in my Goodnes of the true Light eternallie. 3. But now / when-as the Man with the Pro∣uidence / were fallen-awaye from my vpright Bee∣ing / and the Light of my Life / Gen. 3. a. and had taken-on to them the Searching in the Knowledge of the Good and of the Euell: and that it went so euell with the Man {reversed ;}by that occasion; continuallie /
So haue IIer. 25. a. 29. b. 35. b. sought vpon him {reversed ;}with my Woord; oftentymes / to procure him to the Obedience of my Requiringe: and haue euenso infourmed him / with my Light / To-thend that I moughtEsa. 55. a. Math. 11. c. ridde him from his Miserie· and bringe him againe vnto Mee / in the Light of my Life. 4. Howbeit / the Man / seekinge alwayes his Life and Light of Wisdom{reversed ;}through Searching-prouidence; out of the Knowledge / 1. Cor. 1. 2. b. could not so knowe nor vnderstand my Light nor Wisdom / nether-yet the Obedience / which I required of him through my Woorde. And is also by that oc∣casion {reversed ;}eauen vntill thissame Daye of the righ∣teous Iudgment; remayning in his Miserie: nether coulde-ther also anyman els / deliuer him therfrom. 5. Therfore I affirme / that ther is none other Light / Iohn. 1. a. but my Life: nor-yet any other Wisdom / but the Woorde of my Trueth:Psal. 33. a. Pro. 8. c. Iohn. 1. a. Wher-through I haue wrought all my Woorkes. 6. It is true: That which I haue made / I haue {reversed ;}out of the Prouidence which was of-one-bee∣ing with my Godhead;Gen. 2. a. made it-all well: but not through Searchinge-prouidence, as to search ther-after in the Knowledge / how it mought best☜ accorde or ioyne-together. but as I sawe-into the vpright Fourme therof / in my Beeinge. And ac∣cording to thesame Fourme / Gen. 2. a. it was all good / what-soeuer I made. 7. So is now therfore the Conclusion of this my Declaratiō / to prooue that I haue not brought-fourth
my Light and Wisdom / nor-yet my Woor∣kes / through Searching-prouidence in ye Know∣ledge. but as thesame stoode nakedlie before Mee {reversed ;}in my Beeinge; according to the Trueth. Wher∣with I expresse sufficientlie {reversed ;}and haue also before expressed and prooued thesame; that my Cause is right. and that I onlie / Esa. 43. b. 44 a. 48. b. am the Lorde and God. 8. SEarchinge-prouidence hauinge heald his peace heer-at a little-while / spake af∣terwarde. and saide: God is yet for-al-that vtter∣lie vngrounded in all his Declaration / for to keepe the Right and the Authoritie-of-gouernment a∣gainst Mee. 9. For / inasmuch as I am the Sight of God / and the Principalst of the whole Bodie of God (which thinge also God himself graunteth / and must needes graunt ther-vnto:) and that I with the Mans Vnderstandinge / haue alwayes {reversed ;}tho∣rough the Searching in the Knowledg; sought the Welfare of the Man / on the Earth· and brought-fourth euenso {reversed ;}out of thesame Light of the highlie-bosted knowledgfull Wisdom; so manifolde good Pollicies vnto Peace on the Earth / So will I now therfore {reversed ;}O yee noble Lordes; yelde-ouer my Mattier {reversed ;}which I haue heere in Cleernes / dis∣couered vnto your Noblenes; whollie into your handes / for toPsal. 9. a.

THe-whylst that this Trumpet was yeat thus a-sowninge / so were the Lordes and Iudges in a redines / for to pronoūce-fourth
the vpright Iudgment / accordinge to the Trueth / and to sett the Parties {reversed ;}to Concordable∣nes; at-peace: and spake both-alike together / first these Woordes: 2. INasmuch as that God hath made his Declaration / that Hee was from in Eter∣nitie· and in the Beginninge when-as Hee made him ye Man / onlie the Lorde / Gen. 1. 2. Exod. 20. Esa. 44. b. the Life / the Light / and the true Woord and Wisdom itself: and euen∣so foresawe it-all / what-euer Hee made. And that Prouidence hath also declared / that hee first fore∣sawe all thinges {reversed ;}according to the vpright Fourme therof; vnto God: and that GodGen. 1. 2. a. made all the∣same accordinglie / So knowe wee very-well / that all thesame is good. and that ether-other / in the∣same Cause of his {reversed ;}when-as they both were yeat of vnifourme-beeing / and stood vndiuided in one Bee∣inge; hath well {reversed ;}for the first; good right. 3. But now / heere-betweene ther is a secreat Middel-wall entred-in / the which {reversed ;}or what the∣same is; is not perhappes seene or espyed by euery∣one. For wee note / that in the Beginninge of the Creation of Man on the Earth / ther was by God☜ and by all his Kingdom / and by all the Mem∣bers of his Bodie / great Peace and Concorde. Howbeit after-that / when-as God had made the Man {reversed ;}on the Earth;Gen. 1. d. 2. b to an Imaige of himself {reversed ;}as a Life / of his Life / a Light / of his Light / and a Pro∣uidence / of his Prouidence: and also out of hym / the Vnderstandinge / to an Healp of thesame Bee∣inge; so became-ther aGen. 3. b. Ephe. 2. b. Middel-wall betwixt God
and his Imaige / like-as it in this present Day ap∣peereth before Vs. Through which Middel-wall (which also may well be a Misvnderstandinge / wherby the one cannot vnderstande the other a∣right) ther is likewise entred-in euery-wheare on the Earth / so great Variaunce and Iniquitie· and so manifolde Deceiptes and Falshod. 4. It is true: God hath heer-vnto / bestowed alwayes great dilligence / er. 25. a. 29. b. 35. b. Heb. 1. a. through his Messen∣gers / for to plucke the Man with his Woorde / to the Obedience of ye Requiring of thesame Woord· and to his vpright Beeinge / wherby hee mought be ridde from the Iniquitie· and liue in all Loue and Peace. 5. In like-maner: Prouidence hath also be∣stowed alwayes great dilligence {reversed ;}through Search∣inge in the Knowledge; with the Mans Vnder∣standinge / for to bringe the Man into good Or∣der: and for-that-cause also (to-thende that the Man should liue peaceablie on the Earth· and be deliuered from the Destruction of the Iniquitie) hath brought-in many requisite Pollicies & Lawes. Howbeit / the Man is not in all those-same {reversed ;}Rom. 3. c. Gal. 3. b. Heb. 7. b. euen til-vnto thissame Day of the righteous Iudgment of God on the Earth; releassed from the Iniquitie / nor brought vnto ye Peace: nor-yet also theGen. 3. b. Esa. 59. a. Eph. 2. b. Mid∣del-wall {reversed ;}wherthrough all Iniquitie is proceeded; made-knowen / wherby the Man mought haue ben broughtEph. 2. b. vnto Peace and Concorde· and the true Righteousnes / haue gotten the Victorye on the Earth.
6. Forasmuch now then as that this Middel-wall / hath not ben rightlie seen-into by Many∣aone: and that also by that occasion / the one could not vnderstande the other. and the Iniquitie hath preuayled in Victorie / and that the Loue is like∣wise therthrough / waxen-colde with Many / So hath also the Man {reversed ;}and almost it-all what dwel∣leth on the Earth; consumed his tyme {reversed ;}till vnto thissame Daye of the true Iudgment of God;Esa. 59. a. Math. 11. c. in greeuous Miserie / and plucked much Dissention and Iniquitie on his owne necke. But now in this∣same New Daye (wher-through all1. Cor. 4. a. thinges must euen-now becom manifested) the FayleGen. 3. b. Esa. 59. a. Eph. 2. b. and Middel-wall {reversed ;}which is the Occasion of all Ini∣quitie & Variaunce; is nakedlie appeered in Sight and rightlie made-knowen / vnto Vs ؛Testimo∣ny-of-trueth and holie Vnderstandinge{punctel}. The XXVI. Chap. AFter these Woordes / the Lordes and Iudges spake yet one other Sayinge / before the last Sentence. and saide: 2. FOrasmuch now as that y•4. Esd. 5. a. 14. b. Math. 24. b. Iniquitie / together with the subtile Falshod / and the most-wylie Heartes / are so exceedinglie multi∣plied euery-wheare / with the Man on the Earth / and that the Occasion of all this Iniquitie / is not knowen vnto eueryone: and that moreouer God and Prouidence, and eueryone that loueth the Righteousnes / wolde most-gladlie se the Salua∣tion
and Welfare of the Man / and the Peace on the Earth: and yet neuertheles / ther is greatMath. 24. b. Va∣riaunce entred-in: and that therto eueryone that loueth the Righteousnes / hath now goodwilling∣lie 2. Cor. 10. b. geeuen-ouer himself / in our Woorde & Coun∣sell of the Wisdom· and sett all thinges in our Handes (to-thende that all this Controuersie / andGen. 3. b. Ephe. 2. b. the Meane wher-through the Iniquitie hath so multiplied itself / as also the Iniquitie herself / should be remooued or vtterlye rooted-out· and so al-thinge beGen. 1. 2. restored againe / into hys vpright Fourme) / So harken heere now therfore vnto this our Saying and Requiringe. For euen after-that / wee will pronounce-fourth an vpright Sen∣tence of it all. 3. For that euery-one mought now {reversed ;}in this∣same Daye of the righteous Iudgment of God; be preserued from theEsa. 47. b. Perrels of great Damaige both to Soule and Bodie / so let not anyone {reversed ;}from thissame present Daye fourth;Math. 7. a. Luk. 6. d. Rom. 2. 14. b. take vpon hym for to blame or accuse the one the-other / as touching his Offices behalf. nether-yet also that the Ini∣quitie and Variaunce is growen to be on ye Earth / by anymans Fault: Nether shall also anyone {reversed ;}the one against the-other; esteeme or geeue-fourth him∣self Phil. 2. a. for great {reversed ;}ether high-of-reputation; for his knowledgfull Wisdoms cause: nor desire in such respect / to be the Lorde / or to beare the Lordship. But that which Wee pronounce to an vpright Iudgment or Sentence / shall eueryone doo / and not omitt to accomplish thesame.
4. Eueryone shall from this howre-fourth / endeuour hym for to enter-in or com theare with his Beeinge / The last Sentence. wheare hee and his Beeing was in the Beginning / er-euer GodGen. 1. a. Rom. 6. a. b. made the Man on the Earth: and assemble hym euenso againe / to his vp∣right Beeinge [namelie / into thesame State / as his Beeinge was in his Peace / er-euer God made the Man on the Earth.] And all what eueryone had then / and all whatsoeuer is flowen or issued with Hym / out of thesame former Beeinge / all that shall hee bring-in againe {reversed ;}with hymself; to thesame Bee∣inge: Math. 16. c. Luk. 9. 14. d. Also forsake all that which is not of thesame Beeinge / or proceedeth not ther∣from. 5. Beholde / and haue now all / a good regarde to this last Sentence: for in the Fulfillinge of the∣same /2. Cor. 3. b. Ephe. 2. b. all Middel-walles / Dissentions / and Ini∣quities {reversed ;}which are growen to be euen from the Be∣ginninge / and haue brought-in all Variaunce and Disturbaunce; shall not choose but remaine with∣out the Man / and passe-awaye to nothinge / inas∣much as thesame Iniquities / are not of the vpright Beeinge of God nor of the Man / nether-yet pro∣ceede ther-from. 6. When now then thissame is thus accompli∣shed
by eueryone / so shall it be well seen-into and knowen by eueryone / what hee isGen. 3. b. of himself. Also what Seruice or Office ther belongeth to him for to minister or vse: and which is also his Glorie / whervnto hee hath right. For hee shall then inherit all thesame / and liue therin peaceablie. 7. O God, Heer-in shalt thou first haue the Fore-goinge: Settinge thy-self in the Fourme of thesame Beeinge / like-as thou hast ben from in Eternitie / and like-as thou wast in the Be∣ginninge / er-euer thou madest the Man / on the Earth. 8. Forasmuch then as that thou art an heauen∣lie Beeinge / Iohn. 1. 4. c. 6. b. 10. 12. 17. Heb. 1. a.

And all what cometh to thee ther-of / that-same shalt thou receaue / and set or ordaine it in his vp∣right Ordinaunce. 9. In such like-sort / shalt thou also {reversed ;}O Proui∣dence; sett thyself in the Fourme of thesame Bee∣inge / like-as thou hast ben from in Eternitie / and like-as thou wast in the Beginninge / er-euer God made the Man / on the Earth: And all that which was than by thee / and all what is flowen-fourth with thee / out of thesame Beeinge / that-same shalt thou plucke againe vnto thee / into thesame Bee∣inge. And all what cometh to thee ther-of / that shalt thou receaue: and euenso shall then that-same also enter-in with thee / to his right Ordinaunce.
10. LEt eueryone respect-well this vpright Sentence of the righteous Iudgment / which Wee heere-now {reversed ;}in the last or newest Daye; do pronounce-fourth according to ye Trueth. For it concerneth eueryone / 1. Cor. 15. .  so-well the earthlie and naturall Beeing / in His / as the heauenlie and spi∣rituall Beeinge / in His. For this is nowDan. 7. c. 4. Esd. 7. d. the Last Iudgment / wher-vnto the Loue and her Seruice reacheth. 11. For-that-cause / O thou earthlie and natu∣rall Beeing / thou shalt also endeuour thyself / for to sett thee {reversed ;}accordinge to the Requiringe of the Woorde of the Lorde and his Seruice of Loue; in the Fourme of thesame Beeinge / like-as thou wast in the Beginninge / er-euerGen. 3. b.
