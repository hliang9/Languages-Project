A Song in the Comedy calld Sr. Fopling Flutter Set by Mr John Eccles Sung by Mrs Hudson & exactly engrav'd by Tho: Cross. Caelia with mournful pleasure hears my soft, my soft com- -plaints of Love; mingles her wishes Sigh's and tear's & vow's —her heart I move. But when to the blest, the blest hour I press the willing, willing Maid denies; and thô a passion she confess, yet her lov'd, yether lov'd Martyr dye's. Duty forbids my tender suit, When ere she bids me love; That guardian flame defends the fruit, The nodding bow wou'd give. Ah! might I with an am'rous Pray'r Attone her Fate and mine We'd both enjoy, but to my share Fall all the load of Sin.
