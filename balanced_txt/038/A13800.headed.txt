Cantus. SONGS OF 3. 4. 5. and 6. parts. BY THOMAS TOMKINS: Organist of his Maiesties Chappell ROYALL in Ordinary. LONDON: Printed for Matthew Lownes, Iohn Browne, and Thomas Snodham. Cum Priuilegio.
TO THE RIGHT HONOrable William Earle of Pembroke, Lord Herbert of Cardiffe, Lord Par and Rosse of Kendall, Lord Marmion and St. Quintin, Lord War∣den of the Stanneries in the Counties of Deuon and Cornewall, Captaine of his Maiesties Towne and Castle of Portsmouth, and the Isle of Portsey, in the County of Southampton, Lord Lieutenant of the Counties of Wilts and Somerset, Chancellor of the Vniuersity of Oxford, Lord Chamberlaine of his Maiesties most Honourable Houshold, Knight of the most Noble order of the Garter, and one of his Maiesties most Honourable Priuie Councell. My very good Lord; THough it may seeme a presumptuous and improper thing for me to present your Honour with a Song, who are daily busied in the great and waighty Counsells and affaires of the King and Kingdome: Yet haue not my thoughts been wound vp to this height, without an ap∣pearing reason to my selfe, of excuse, and pardon at the least, if not of fittingnesse, and hope of acceptation. For though your Lordships imployments be daily, yet hath the Day many houres, and if you should bestow all of them on sad and serious matters, you might shorten them, and depriue vs too soone of the benefit both of your Counsels and Actions. Besides, (if I may presume to giue your Lordship any account of my poore selfe) I first breathed, and beheld the Sunne, in that Country, to which your Lordship giues the greatest lustre, taking the Title of your Earledome from it, and euen therefore haue alwaies (I know not by what secret power of naturall affection) euer ho∣noured and wished your Lordships prosperity. To which considerations may be added that goodnesse of nature, eminent in your Lordship, which was euer a friend to Musicke, and the knowne vertues of your minde, which seemes to be best in tune, in those who loue Musicke best, as being least distracted with low cogitations, and your often frequenting and fauourable attention to the Musicke in the Chappell, which vseth sometimes to raise the soule aboue her Companions, Flesh, and Bloud; as also the place you hold vnder his Maiesty, which consequently renders you, a Patron and Protector of Musicke. Concerning the Songs, if they shall be found answerable to the desire and affection of their indulgent Parent: I beseech your Honour to consider, that as there are few men absolutely perfect, saue onely in contemplation; so neither is more clearenesse to be ex∣pected in the Riuers, then in the Spring, nor more perfection, in imperfect mens contem∣plations, or workes of this kinde. For the lightnesse of some of the words, I can onely pleade an olde (but ill) custome, which I wish were abrogated: Although the Songs of these Bookes will be euen in that poynt, sutable to the people of the world, wherein the rich and poore, sound and lame, sad and fantasticall, dwell together. Lastly, I doe againe most humbly beseech your Lordship to pardon my presumption, and to accept of these my imperfect offers, who will offer my prayers to God for your Lordship, that you may enioy a happie and blessed Harmony in the whole course of your life, (betweene your selfe and your friends, your body and minde) to the end that you may haue content (which is the best kinde of Musicke) here, and the Musicke of Angels hereafter. This is, and shall be, the prayer of Your Honours most humbly deuoted in all obseruance and duty, THOMAS TOMKINS.
To my Brother the AVTHOR. YEt thou wert mortall: now begin to liue, And end with onely Time. Thy Muses giue What Nature hath deny'd, Eternitie: Gladly my younger Muse doth honour thee, But mine's no praise. A large increase it has That's multiply'd through strong affections glas. Yet is thy worth the same, and were no other Though as a Iudge I spake, not as a Brother. This comfort haue, this Art's so great, so free, None but the good can reach to censure thee. IOHN TOMKINS.

CANTVS. MVSICA SACRA: TO Sixe Voyces. Composed in the Italian tongue BY GIOVANNI CROCE. Newly Englished. IN LONDON PRINTED BY THOMAS ESTE, the assigne of William Barley. 1608.
To the vertuous Louers of Musicke. THese Sonnets, composed first most exquisitely in Italian by Sior. Francesco Bembo a Gentleman of Italie; were so admired of Giouan. Croce, one of the most excellent Mu∣sitians of the world; as well for their Poesie, as Pietie (the Substance of them being drawen from those seauen nota∣ble Psalmes called Penetentials; indited by that Sweete Singer of Israel, inspired of the holie Spirit) as that hee thought it worthy of his skill in Musicke, to apply them to this Harmonie of Sixe parts; as well to honour their Author and his Compositi∣on, as to giue a profitable Delight vnto the vertuous. And my selfe often obseruing the generall applause giuen these Songs when I haue heard them soong, (though somtimes without the words) thought it would be verie gratefull to many of our English louers of Musick, if they were translated, or imitated in our tongue: the rather, because through their want of vnderstanding the Italian, they are depri∣ued of a Chief part of their delight. For albeit that the verie concent of the Note may sweetly strike the outward sence of the eare; yet it is the Dittie, which con∣uayed with the Musicke to the intellectual Soule, by the Organs of hearing, that doth touch the hart, and stir the affections eyther to Iocondnes, or Sadnes, Leuitie, or Grauitie, according to the nature of the Composition: in which respect (especi∣ally) the articulate voice of man excelleth all other voices, and Instruments in the world. Besides I supposed, that the Scarcetie (not onely in our tongue, but in all other vulgars) of Musicke in this kinde, whereby men may be edified and God glorified, would make these the more acceptable; and peraduenture be a motiue to some of our excellent Musitians to dedicate their diuine skill to the Seruice of God, in Songs of this more Sanctified kinde In which respects; and for that I was en∣couraged thereto by some, Skilfull in this Arte: I haue aduentured to publish these (otherwise destinate to priuacie) vnto the view of the world: Although I am not Ignorant that in this curious age, it is likely to run the ordinary fortune (euen of more exact labours) vpon the Shelues of ridged censure: But the Gentle, will winck at small faults where they spie them: As for the Supercilious Critick if (after he haue compared them with the Originall) he dislike them: he may please him selfe, and doe them all better: But doe Yee accept them with a Sèrene browe, and vse them to the glory of God, and your Laudable and Christian delight. Fare yee well. Your well-willer R. H.
FIRST SONNET Ex Psal. 6.

Altus. SONGS OF 3. 4. 5. and 6. parts. BY THOMAS TOMKINS: Organist of his Maiesties Chappell ROYALL in Ordinary. LONDON: Printed for Matthew Lownes, Iohn Browne, and Thomas Snodham. Cum Priuilegio.
TO THE RIGHT HONOrable William Earle of Pembroke, Lord Herbert of Cardiffe, Lord Par and Rosse of Kendall, Lord Marmion and St Quintin, Lord War∣den of the Stanneries in the Counties of Deuon and Cornewall, Captaine of his Maiesties Towne and Castle of Portsmouth, and the Isle of Portsey, in the County of Southampton, Lord Lieutenant of the Counties of Wilts and Somerset, Chancellor of the Vniuersity of Oxford, Lord Chamberlaine of his Maiesties most Honourable Houshold, Knight of the most Noble order of the Garter, and one of his Maiesties most Honourable Priuic Councell. My very good Lord; THough it may seeme a presumptuous and improper thing for me to present your Honour with a Song, who are daily busied in the great and waighty Counsells and affaires of the King and Kingdome: Yet haue not my thoughts been wound vp to this height, without an ap∣pearing reason to my selfe, of excuse, and pardon at the least, if not of fittingnesse, and hope of acceptation. For though your Lordships imployments be daily, yet hath the Day many houres, and if you should bestow all of them on sad and serious matters, you might shorten them, and depriue vs too soone of the benefit both of your Counsels and Actions. Besides, (if I may presume to giue your Lordship any account of my poore selfe) I first breathed, and beheld the Sunne, in that Country, to which your Lordship giues the greatest lustre, taking the Title of your Earledome from it, and euen therefore haue alwaies (I know not by what secret power of naturall affection) euer ho∣noured and wished your Lordships prosperity. To which considerations may be added that goodnesse of nature, eminent in your Lordship, which was euer a friend to Musicke, and the knowne vertues of your minde, which seemes to be best in tune, in those who loue Musicke best, as being least distracted with low cogitations, and your often frequenting and fauourable attention to the Musicke in the Chappell, which vseth sometimes to raise the soule aboue her Companions, Flesh, and Bloud; as also the place you hold vnder his Maiesty, which consequently renders you, a Patron and Protector of Musicke. Concerning the Songs, if they shall be found answerable to the desire and affection of their indulgent Parent: I beseech your Honour to consider, that as there are few men absolutely perfect, saue onely in contemplation; so neither is more clearenesse to be ex∣pected in the Riuers, then in the Spring, nor more perfection, in imperfect mens contem∣plations, or workes of this kinde. For the lightnesse of some of the words, I can onely pleade an olde (but ill) custome, which I wish were abrogated: Although the Songs of these Bookes will be euen in that poynt, sutable to the people of the world, wherein the rich and poore, sound and lame, sad and fantasticall, dwell together. Lastly, I doe againe most humbly beseech your Lordship to pardon my presumption, and to accept of these my imperfect offers, who will offer my prayers to God for your Lordship, that you may enioy a happie and blessed Harmony in the whole course of your life, (betweene your selfe and your friends, your body and minde) to the end that you may haue content (which is the best kinde of Musicke) here, and the Musicke of Angels hereafter. This is, and shall be, the prayer of Your Honours most humbly deuoted in all obseruance and duty, THOMAS TOMKINS.
To my Brother the AVTHOR. YEt thou wert mortall: now begin to liue, And end with onely Time. Thy Muses giue What Nature hath deny'd, Eternitie: Gladly my younger Muse doth honour thee, But mine's no praise. A large increase it has That's multiply'd through strong affections glas. Yet is thy worth the same, and were no other Though as a Iudge I spake, not as a Brother. This comfort haue, this Art's so great, so free, None but the good can reach to censure thee. IOHN TOMKINS.

ALTVS. MVSICA SACRA: TO Sixe Voyces. Composed in the Italian tongue BY GIOVANNI CROCE. Newly Englished. IN LONDON PRINTED BY THOMAS ESTE, the assigne of William Barley. 1608.
To the vertuous Louers of Musicke. THese Sonnets, composed first most exquisitely in Italian by Sior. Francesco Bembo a Gentleman of Italie; were so admired of Giouan. Croce, one of the most excellent Mu∣sitians of the world; as well for their Poesie, as Pietie (the Substance of them being drawen from those seauen nota∣ble▪ Psalmes called Penetentials; indited by that Sweete Singer of Israel, inspired of the holie Spirit) as that hee thought it worthy of his skill in Musicke, to apply them to this Harmonie of Sixe parts; as well to honour their Author and his Compositi∣on, as to giue a profitable Delight vnto the vertuous. And my selfe often obseruing the generall applause giuen these Songs when I haue heard them soong, (though somtimes without the words) thought it would be verie gratefull to many of our English louers of Musick, if they were translated, or imitated in our tongue: the rather, because through their want of vnderstanding the Italian, they are depri∣ued of a Chief part of their delight. For albeit that the verie concent of the Note may sweetly strike the outward sence of the eare; yet it is the Dittie, which con∣uayed with the Musicke to the intellectual Soule, by the Organs of hearing, that doth touch the hart, and stir the affections eyther to Iocondnes, or Sadnes, Leuitie, or Grauitie, according to the nature of the Composition: in which respect (especi∣ally) the articulate voice of man excelleth all other voices, and Instruments in the world. Besides I supposed, that the Scarcetie (not onely in our tongue, but in all other vulgars) of Musicke in this kinde, whereby men may be edified and God glorified, would make these the more acceptable; and peraduenture be a motiue to some of our excellent Musitians to dedicate their diuine skill to the Seruice of God, in Songs of this more Sanctified kinde In which respects; and for that I was en∣couraged thereto by some, Skilfull in this Arte: I haue aduentured to publish these (otherwise destinate to priuacie) vnto the view of the world: Although I am not Ignorant that in this curious age, it is likely to run the ordinary fortune (euen of more exact labours) vpon the Shelues of ridged censure: But the Gentle, will winck at small faults where they spie them: As for the Supercilious Critick if (after he haue compared them with the Originall) he dislike them: he may please him selfe, and doe them all better: But doe Yee accept them with a Sèrene browe, and vse them to the glory of God, and your Laudable and Christian delight. Fare yee well. Your well-willer R. H.
FIRST SONNET Ex Psal. 6.

My very good Lord; THough it may seeme a presumptuous and improper thing for me to present your Honour with a Song, who are daily busied in the great and waighty Counsells and affaires of the King and Kingdome: Yet haue not my thoughts been wound vp to this height, without an ap∣pearing reason to my selfe, of excuse, and pardon at the least, if not of fittingnesse, and hope of acceptation. For though your Lordships imployments be daily, yet hath the Day many houres, and if you should bestow all of them on sad and serious matters, you might shorten them, and depriue vs too soone of the benefit both of your Counsels and Actions. Besides, (if I may presume to giue your Lordship any account of my poore selfe) I first breathed, and beheld the Sunne, in that Country, to which your Lordship giues the greatest lustre, taking the Title of your Earledome from it, and euen therefore haue alwaies (I know not by what secret power of naturall affection) euer ho∣noured and wished your Lordships prosperity. To which considerations may be added that goodnesse of nature, eminent in your Lordship, which was euer a friend to Musicke, and the knowne vertues of your minde, which seemes to be best in tune, in those who loue Musicke best, as being least distracted with low cogitations, and your often frequenting and fauourable attention to the Musicke in the Chappell, which vseth sometimes to raise the soule aboue her Companions, Flesh, and Bloud; as also the place you hold vnder his Maiesty, which consequently renders you, a Patron and Protector of Musicke. Concerning the Songs, if they shall be found answerable to the desire and affection of their indulgent Parent: I beseech your Honour to consider, that as there are few men absolutely perfect, saue onely in contemplation; so neither is more clearenesse to be ex∣pected in the Riuers, then in the Spring, nor more perfection, in imperfect mens contem∣plations, or workes of this kinde. For the lightnesse of some of the words, I can onely pleade an olde (but ill) custome, which I wish were abrogated: Although the Songs of these Bookes will be euen in that poynt, sutable to the people of the world, wherein the rich and poore, sound and lame, sad and fantasticall, dwell together. Lastly, I doe againe most humbly beseech your Lordship to pardon my presumption, and to accept of these my imperfect offers, who will offer my prayers to God for your Lordship, that you may enioy a happie and blessed Harmony in the whole course of your life, (betweene your selfe and your friends, your body and minde) to the end that you may haue content (which is the best kinde of Musicke) here, and the Musicke of Angels hereafter. This is, and shall be, the prayer of Your Honours most humbly deuoted in all obseruance and duty, THOMAS TOMKINS.
To my Brother the AVTHOR. YEt thou wert mortall: now begin to liue, And end with onely Time. Thy Muses giue What Nature hath deny'd, Eternitie: Gladly my younger Muse doth honour thee, But mine's no praise. A large increase it has That's multiply'd through strong affections glas. Yet is thy worth the same, and were no other Though as a Iudge I spake, not as a Brother. This comfort haue, this Art's so great, so free, None but the good can reach to censure thee. IOHN TOMKINS.

TENOR. MVSICA SACRA: TO Sixe Voyces. Composed in the Italian tongue BY GIOVANNI CROCE. Newly Englished. IN LONDON PRINTED BY THOMAS ESTE, the assigne of William Barley. 1608.
To the vertuous Louers of Musicke. THese Sonnets, composed first most exquisitely in Italian by Sior. Francesco Bembo a Gentleman of Italie; were so admired of Giouan. Croce, one of the most excellent Mu∣sitians of the world; as well for their Poesie, as Pietie (the Substance of them being drawen from those seauen nota∣ble Psalmes called Penetentials; indited by that Sweete Singer of Israel, inspired of the holie Spirit) as that hee thought it worthy of his skill in Musicke, to apply them to this Harmonie of Sixe parts; as well to honour their Author and his Compositi∣on, as to giue a profitable Delight vnto the vertuous. And my selfe often obseruing the generall applause giuen these Songs when I haue heard them soong, (though somtimes without the words) thought it would be verie gratefull to many of our English louers of Musick, if they were translated, or imitated in our tongue: the rather, because through their want of vnderstanding the Italian, they are depri∣ued of a Chief part of their delight. For albeit that the verie concent of the Note may sweetly strike the outward sence of the eare; yet it is the Dittie, which con∣uayed with the Musicke to the intellectual Soule, by the Organs of hearing, that doth touch the hart, and stir the affections eyther to Iocondnes, or Sadnes, Leuitie, or Grauitie, according to the nature of the Composition: in which respect (especi∣ally) the articulate voice of man excelleth all other voices, and Instruments in the world. Besides I supposed, that the Scarcetie (not onely in our tongue, but in all other vulgars) of Musicke in this kinde, whereby men may be edified and God glorified, would make these the more acceptable; and peraduenture be a motiue to some of our excellent Musitians to dedicate their diuine skill to the Seruice of God, in Songs of this more Sanctified kinde In which respects; and for that I was en∣couraged thereto by some, Skilfull in this Arte: I haue aduentured to publish these (otherwise destinate to priuacie) vnto the view of the world: Although I am not Ignorant that in this curious age, it is likely to run the ordinary fortune (euen of more exact labours) vpon the Shelues of ridged censure: But the Gentle, will winck at small faults where they spie them: As for the Supercilious Critick if (after he haue compared them with the Originall) he dislike them: he may please himselfe, and doe them all better: But doe Yee accept them with a Sèrene browe, and vse them to the glory of God, and your Laudable and Christian delight. Fare yee well. Your well-willer R. H.
FIRST SONNET Ex Psal. 6. LOrd, in thy wrath reproue mee not seuearly, Nor punish me in thy deseru'd displeasure: Haue mercy on my Sinns exceeding measure, For full of feares, my Soule is vexed drearly. Saue it (O Lord) Almightie-most Supernall, Saue it (alas) from the'uer-neuer Dying: For who in deep Hell (and fierce Torments frying) Shall sing thy praise, or can extoll th'Eternall?

LOng haue I Lan- guisht, Long haue I Languisht in my grieuous Sor- row's: My Bed and bosom, with my tear's I water: My foes Despight hath plow'd my face with furrow's: My foes Despight hath plow'd my face with furrow's: hath plow'd my face, hath plow'd my face with furrow's: But now my Soule, my Soule, let th'ungod∣ly Scat- ter: Hence, hence ye wicked, Sith God so gratio'us, Sith God so gratio'us, God so gratio'us, God so gracio'us for vs: Hath heard my moan, and doth regard my mat- ter. and doth regard, regard my mat- ter.

Quintus. SONGS OF 3. 4. 5. and 6. parts. BY THOMAS TOMKINS: Organist of his Maiesties Chappell ROYALL in Ordinary. LONDON: Printed for Matthew Lownes, Iohn Browne, and Thomas Snodham. Cum Priuilegio.
TO THE RIGHT HONOrable William Earle of Pembroke, Lord Herbert of Cardiffe, Lord Par and Rosse of Kendall, Lord Marmion and St. Quintin, Lord War∣den of the Stanneries in the Counties of Deuon and Cornewall, Captaine of his Maiesties Towne and Castle of Portsmouth, and the Isle of Portsey, in the County of Southampton, Lord Lieutenant of the Counties of Wilts and Somerset, Chancellor of the Vniuersity of Oxford, Lord Chamberlaine of his Maiesties most Honourable Houshold, Knight of the most Noble order of the Garter, and one of his Maiesties most Honourable Priuie Councell. My very good Lord; THough it may seeme a presumptuous and improper thing for me to present your Honour with a Song, who are daily busied in the great and waighty Counsells and affaires of the King and Kingdome: Yet haue not my thoughts been wound vp to this height, without an ap∣pearing reason to my selfe, of excuse, and pardon at the least, if not of fittingnesse, and hope of acceptation. For though your Lordships imployments be daily, yet hath the Day many houres, and if you should bestow all of them on sad and serious matters, you might shorten them, and depriue vs too soone of the benefit both of your Counsels and Actions. Besides, (if I may presume to giue your Lordship any account of my poore selfe) I first breathed, and beheld the Sunne, in that Country, to which your Lordship giues the greatest lustre, taking the Title of your Earledome from it, and euen therefore haue alwaies (I know not by what secret power of naturall affection) euer ho∣noured and wished your Lordships prosperity. To which considerations may be added that goodnesse of nature, eminent in your Lordship, which was euer a friend to Musicke, and the knowne vertues of your minde, which seemes to be best in tune, in those who loue Musicke best, as being least distrad with low cogitations, and your often frequenting and fauourable atten to the Musicke in the Chappell, which vseth sometimes to raise the soule aboue her Companions, Flesh, and Bloud; as also the place you hold vnder his Maiesty, which consequently renders you, a Patron and Protector of Musicke. Concerning the Songs, if they shall be found answerable to the desire and affection of their indulgent Parent: I beseech your Honour to consider, that as there are few men absolutely perfect, saue onely in contemplation; so neither is more clearenesse to be ex∣pected in the Riuers, then in the Spring, nor more perfection, in imperfect mens contem∣plations, or workes of this kinde. For the lightnesse of some of the words, I can onely pleade an olde (but ill) custome, which I wish were abrogated: Although the Songs of these Bookes will be euen in that poynt, sutable to the people of the world, wherein the rich and poore, sound and lame, sad and fantasticall, dwell together. Lastly, I doe againe most humbly beseech your Lordship to pardon my presumption, and to accept of these my imperfect offers, who will offer my prayers to God for your Lordship, that you may enioy a happie and blessed Harmony in the whole course of your life, (betweene your selfe and your friends, your body and minde) to the end that you may haue content (which is the best kinde of Musicke) here, and the Musicke of Angels hereafter. This is, and shall be, the prayer of Your Honours most humbly deuoted in all obseruance and duty, THOMAS TOMKINS.

Bassus. SONGS OF 3. 4. 5. and 6. parts. BY THOMAS TOMKINS: Organist of his Maiesties Chappell ROYALL in Ordinary. LONDON: Printed for Matthew Lownes, Iohn Browne, and Thomas Snodham. 1622.
TO THE RIGHT HONOrable William Earle of Pembroke, Lord Herbert of Cardiffe, Lord Par and Rosse of Kendall, Lord Marmion and St. Quintin, Lord War∣den of the Stanneries in the Counties of Deuon and Cornewall, Captaine of his Maiesties Towne and Castle of Portsmouth, and the Isle of Portsey, in the County of Southampton, Lord Lieutenant of the Counties of Wilts and Somerset, Chancellor of the Vniuersity of Oxford, Lord Chamberlaine of his Maiesties most Honourable Houshold, Knight of the most Noble order of the Garter, and one of his Maiesties most Honourable Priuie Councell. My very good Lord; THough it may seeme a presumptuous and improper thing for me to present your Honour with a Song, who are daily busied in the great and waighty Counsells and affaires of the King and Kingdome: Yet haue not my thoughts been wound vp to this height, without an ap∣pearing reason to my selfe, of excuse, and pardon at the least, if not of fittingnesse, and hope of acceptation. For though your Lordships imployments be daily, yet hath the Day many houres, and if you should bestow all of them on sad and serious matters, you might shorten them, and depriue vs too soone of the benefit both of your Counsels and Actions. Besides, (if I may presume to giue your Lordship any account of my pooreselfe) I first breathed, and beheld the Sunne, in that Country, to which your Lordship giues the greatest lustre, taking the Title of your Earledome from it, and euen therefore haue alwaies (I know not by what secret power of naturall affection) euer ho∣noured and wished your Lordships prosperity. To which considerations may be added that goodnesse of nature, eminent in your Lordship, which was euer a friend to Musicke, and the knowne vertues of your minde, which seemes to be best in tune, in those who loue Musicke best, as being least distracted with low cogitations, and your often frequenting and fauourable attention to the Musicke in the Chappell, which vseth sometimes to raise the soule aboue her Companions, Flesh, and Bloud; as also the place you hold vnder his Maiesty, which consequently renders you, a Patron and Protector of Musicke. Concerning the Songs, if they shall be found answerable to the desire and affection of their indulgent Parent: I beseech your Honour to consider, that as there are few men absolutely perfect, saue onely in contemplation; so neither is more clearenesse to be ex∣pected in the Riuers, then in the Spring, nor more perfection, in imperfect mens contem∣plations, or workes of this kinde. For the lightnesse of some of the words, I can onely pleade an olde (but ill) custome, which I wish were abrogated: Although the Songs of these Bookes will be euen in that poynt, sutable to the people of the world, wherein the rich and poore, sound and lame, sad and fantasticall, dwell together. Lastly, I doe againe most humbly beseech your Lordship to pardon my presumption, and to accept of these my imperfect offers, who will offer my prayers to God for your Lordship, that you may enioy a happie and blessed Harmony in the whole course of your life, (betweene your selfe and your friends, your body and minde) to the end that you may haue content (which is the best kinde of Musicke) here, and the Musicke of Angels hereafter. This is, and shall be, the prayer of Your Honours most humbly deuoted in all obseruance and duty, THOMAS TOMKINS.
