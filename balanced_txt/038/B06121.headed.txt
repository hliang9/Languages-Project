To the Kings most Excellent Majesty. The humble Address of the Magistrates and Council of Your City of Glasgow in Scotland, for themselves, and in name of the Inhabi∣tants. AS we Your Majesties most Dutiful and Loyal Subjects, could not but in a very special manner, have a deep sense of, and be much afflicted for the inexpressible loss of our late Gracious Monarch, by whose Care and Protection, we were so well Defended from the Dangers that did constantly Threaten us from Disorderly Neighbours, for which loss, each of Your Majesties Subjects is truly grieved; so this grateful and de∣cent Sorrow does not at all hinder us from blessing Almighty God, and having our Hearts filled with sincere Joy, for Your Sacred Majesties Succession to the Throne of your Royal Ancestors, by by whom we and our Predecessors have been so long Protected, and from whose extraordinary Experience, as well as Wisdom and Courage; We have just reason to expect that this Kingdom will be again reduced to Quiet and Happiness; And the Trade by which this Place is only Supported, will be secured, and encouraged by that extraordinary Skill which Your Sacred Majesty has in Affairs of that Nature; In return of all which, we shall endeavour with Hearts far more Loyal than any Professions we can make, not only to concur our selves in our own Stations, in Your Majesties Service but be very Exemplary to others, in spight of all Dangers and Oppo∣sitions; though we have very good reason to hope that none of those will threaten Your Majesties peaceable Reign, which that i may be as happy as Your Majesties great Virtues deserve, and as our sincere Loyalty should inspire us to wish, shall be the constant and ardent Prayers of May it please Your Sacred Majesty, Your Majesties most humble, most Faithful, and most, Dutiful Subjects.
