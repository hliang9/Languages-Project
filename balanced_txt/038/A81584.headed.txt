Doctor LAMBS DARLING: OR, Strange and terrible News from Salisbury; BEING A true, exact, and perfect Relation, of the great and wonderful Contract and Engagement made be∣tween the Devil, and Mistris Anne Bodenham; with the manner how she could transform her self into the shape of a Mastive Dog, a black Lyon, a white Bear, a Woolf, a Eull, and a Cat; and by her Charms and Spels, send either man or woman 40 miles an hour in the Ayr. The Tryal, Examination, and Confession of the said Mistris Boden∣ham, before the Lord chief Baron Wild, & the Sentence of Death pronounc'd against her, for bewitching of An Stiles, and forcing her to write her Name in the Devils Book with her own blood; so that for five dayes she lay in cruel and bitter Torments; somtimes the Devil ap∣pearing all in black without a head, renting her cloaths, tearing her skin, and tossing her up and down the cham∣ber, to the great astonishment of the Spectators. APpointed to be printed and published, as a Caveat and War∣ning piece for England, Scotland, and Ireland. July 25 James Bower, Cleric. London, Printed for G. Horton, 1653.
HIstory often speaks, and common observation assures Us, that Bees gather exeellent honey out of the bitterest herbs: So, were we wise, we might make good use of this ensuing Re∣lation: Wherein we may consider how the Devil guls and deceives the soules of the sons of men, He (without doubt) to bring them into such an unhappy league with himself, promiseth them to be no Inferiors to the greatest in the world. But to the subject of my Dis∣course. There was lately arraigned at Salisbury, before the Right Honorable the Lord chief Baron Wild, Judge of the Assise, one Anne Bodenham, formerly servant to Dr. Lamb, for her strange and wonderful Diabolical usage of a Maid, servant to M. Goddard, by name Anne Styles; who having lost a silver spoon, went to the foresaid Witch, to discover the person that had stoln it; whereupon this cunning woman put on her spectacles, demanded 12 d. which she had, and then o∣pened a book, in which there seemed to be the picture of the Devil, to the Maids appearance, with cloven feet and claws; after which, the Witch took a green Glass, and shewed the maid the shape of many persons what they were doing in her Masters house, and said, that the spoon should be brought again shortly by a little boy; but said, she would have occasion to come to her again very sud∣denly;
and accordingly, within two dayes after, her Mistris being afraid of being poyson'd, sent the Maid again to the said Witch, to know if there were any such thing intend∣ed, and the maid going, a little black Dog, to her appre∣hension ran before her over Crane-bridge, and brought her to the Witches house, being dark, where the doors flew o∣pen, without knocking, and the Witch met her at the se∣cond door, and told her she knew wherefore she came, and that it was about poysoning; for, said she, on Friday night there shall be a cup of spiced Ale prepared, with poyson in it; but be sure you give your Mistris notice of it. The next day being Saturday the maid was sent again to the Witch to get some example shewn upon the Gentlewoman that should procure the poyson; and the Witch gave her a powder, Dill leaves, and the paring of her own nailes; all which the maid was to give to her Mistris; the powder was to be put in the young Gentlewomens Mistriss Sarah and Mistriss Anne Goddards drink or broth, to rot their guts in their bellies; the leaves to rub about the brims of the pot, to make their teeth fall out of their heads, and the paring of the nails to make them drunk and mad. And told the maid that when they gave it them, they must cros their breasts, and say, In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ grant that this may be. But the maid coming again on the Munday following, asked her whether she approved of her journey for London; the Witch replied, Wilt thou go to London high or low? To which the maid answered, What do you mean by that? She said, If you will go on high, you shall be carryed to London in the Air, and be there in two hurs; but if you go a low, you shall be taken at Sutton towns end. Yet be∣fore she departed, the Witch desired the maid to live with her, and she would teach her a more stranger Art: What's that, said the maid, she answered, you shall know present∣ly,
and forthwith she appeared in the shape of a great black Cat, and lay along by the Chimney: at which the maid being affrighted, she came into her shape again, say∣ing, But before you go, you must seal unto me your body and blud not to discover me; which she promising to do, she forth∣with made a Circle, and called Beezebub, Tormentor, Luci∣fer, and Satan, appear; then appeared two spirits in the likeness of great boys, with long shagged black hair, and stood by her, looking over her shoulder; then the Witch took the meids fore-singer of her right hand, and pricked it with a pin, and squeezed out the bloud, and put it into a pen, and put the pen into the maids hand, and held her hand to write in a book, and one of the Spirits laid his hand or claw upon the Witches, whilest the maid wrote, and when she had done writing whilest their hands were together, the Witch said Amen, and made the maid say Amen, and the Spirits said, Amen, Amen; and the Spirits hand did feel cold to the maid as it touched her hand, when the Witches hand and hers were together writing; and then the Spirit gave a piece of silver (which he first bit) to the Witch, who gave it to the maid, and also stuck two pins in the maides head-cloathes, and bid her keep them, and be gone, saying, I will now vex thee far worse, then ever I did the man in Clarington Park, which I made walk a∣bout with a bundle of pales on his back all night in a Pond of wa∣ter, and could not lay them down till the next morning. Thus having ended her diabolical speech, immediatly after the maid were exceedingly perplexed with inward Tor∣ments, crying out, O the Devil, the Witch, and the two ragged boyes are pulling me a pieces! Oh very damnable, very wretched: this hand of mine writ my name in the Devils book; this finger of mine was pricked, here is yet the hole that was made; and with my bloud I wrote my own
Damnation, and have cut my self off from Heaven and Eternal life; the Devil came, oh! in a terrible shape to me, entred within me, & there he lies swelling in my bo∣dy, gnawing at my heart, tearing my bowels within me, and there is no hopes, but one time or other will tear me all in pieces; O hold me, hold me, or else the Devil will tke me: I see him now standing on the top of the house, with glittering eyes, looking on me, and will carry me away. Thus was she miserably tormented, for the space of five dayes, many times being pulled from those that held her, which made the people in the Room run away from her for fear; the maid being thrown from the low bed whereon she lay, to the top of the high bed, and her cloathes torn off her back, and a piece of her skin torn a∣way, the Candle in the Room, standing on a Table, was thrown down, and put out; at which time, there being a little boy that was almost asleep, but with this noise be∣ing frighted, had not power with the rest, to go out of the room, staid there, and saw a spirit in the likeness of a great black man, with no head, in the room souffling with the maid, and took her and set her into a chair, and told her she must go with him, he was come for her soul, she had given it to him: But the maid answered, that her soul was none of her own to give, it belonged to her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who had purchased it with his own precious blood; and although he had got her blood, yet he should never have her soul: Whereupon after tumbling and throwing the maid about the Devil vanished in a flame of fire. After many such like cruel Torments, sometimes lying in a trance; sometimes foaming at the mouth; and sometimes being tossed from the lower bed to the high bed; and from thence to the top of the Tester; yet at last (when news was brought that the Witch was executed) it pleased the Divine providence
of the great Jehovah of Heaven, to restore her to her for∣mer state and condition, crying out, Oh what a loving God have I to break me off with this league from the Devil! Oh what a sweet Saviour have I that hath ransom'd my poor soul from the infernal Lake, & brought me even from the very brinks of Hell: Blessed be his name; he hath wrought my deliverance, and dispossessed the evil spirit. Many other strange and diabo∣lical actions, the foresaid Witch both practised and put in execution; namely, by her several Charms and Spels, she would convey either man or woman 40 miles an hour in the Air, she was one that would undertake to cure almost any Diseases by the said Charms, but somtimes used phy∣sical ingredients, to cure her abominable practices; she would undertake to procure things that were lost, and restore goods that were stoln; she could transform her self into any shape whatsoever, viz. A Mastive Dog, A black Lyon, A white Bear, A Woolf, A Monkey, A Horse, A Bull, And a Calf. She had likewise the marks of an absolute Witch, ha∣ving a Teat about the length and bignesse of the Nipple of a womans breast, and hollow and soft as a Nipple, with a hole on the top of it, on her left shoulder, and another
likewise was found in her secret place, like the former on her shoulder, which was given in to the Court upon evidence by Molier Damely, Alice Cleverly, Grace Stokes, for which, she was arraigned and condemned to be hang'd; no sooner was sentence denounced, but she skriek'd out with a most hideous noise, and desired to be buryed under the Gallows and coming to the place of execution, she ran up the ladder, and the rope being put about her neck, she went to turn her self off; but the Executioner staid her, and desired her to forgive him: she replyed, Forgive thee! A pox on thee, turn me off; which were the last words she said. Thus, dear hearts, you see, those that forsake God in their lives, shall be forsaken of him in their deaths. FINIS.
