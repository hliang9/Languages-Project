AN HVMBLE Petition offered to the right reuerend, honourable, and vvorshipfull estates of this present Parliament assembled at Westminster Pallace: Wherein the wan∣dring Ghost of the late Pyramis demolished lately in Paris, discourseth his hard fortunes, trauailes, and strange accidents to the new Brittaine Monarchie, to whom he wisheth all peace, wealth, and prosperitie. Written by Philopatris, pittying his downfall, and perswading his new erecting, and building vp againe in Westminster. At London Printed for Matthew Lownes. 1606.
To ancient and famous Troynovant. WIth sunburnd Afrike Europe bore debate, And France with fertile Egipt did cōtend; With Memphis old Lutetia stroue of late, For Monuments; but now that strife hath end: The Pyramies of Paris doo decay, But Memphis stones remaine & stand for aye. Shall Afrike thus tryumph in Europes shame? Can Brittaine braue, endure so great disgrace? No, Troynovant; flie thou on wings of fame, From Memphis both, and Paris take thou place: Build monuments, in spight of Popish fire, Which Afrike both, and Asia may admire.
To the high Court of Parliament. AFter that my suddaine down∣fall & vnexpected overthrow (most ancient and famous great Brittaine) was plotted secretly in Rome, prepared cunningly in France, and ex∣ecuted ignominiously not long since by pub∣lique aucthoritie in the chiefe Cittie of the French Kingdome. This favour yet I had for my continuall and faithfull service done to so great a King and State, that some of my dea∣rest friends and favourers (whose long plea∣dings in Lawe, strong reasons in equitie, and earnest sute in Court nothing prevailing for
the saving of my faultlesse and innocent life) should bee permitted at last after my death, to gather together the fatall reliques and ruines of my sumptuous builded corps, to be secret∣ly laid vp in some sure place, there to be shrou∣ded vnto a better and more favourable age following, from the cruell persecution of my bloudie Esauiticall enemies, seeking and pur∣suing (like vnto Herod through all Iuda) from corner to corner for the anatomie of my bru∣sed bones, to be offred vp as a sweete smelling sacrifice to that Antichristian & bloudie Dra∣gon, who daily thirsteth for the poore lyues of such harmlesse creatures as I am, manifesting to the world his foule shame, and monstrous parts. But may it not seeme ouer-strange and meruailous to the eyes and eares of the world, that dumbe and insensible creatures should speake and crie out of cruell iniustice vsed a∣gainst them? Mervailous indeed it is, because against nature, but not therfore vntrue nor yet vnlikely, considering what the Prophets haue truly fore-told, howe in the latter dayes there should many miraculous thinges fall out, and wonderfull visions appeare, both in heaven & earth. And surely (thou new Monarchie) the
eclipse of the Sunne seene here of late, with the new starre, but more likelie a prodigious Cō∣met in thy Hemisphere, the extraordinarie red∣nes of the firmament like to bloud, the conti∣nuall raines and land flouds, the monstrous births of children, and beastes on the earth, and of fishes in the Sea; but more notable, that a new and vnknowne Astrologer in his Progno∣stication set out in our Cittie of Paris, should fore-shew such strange and incredible matters to come to passe, three moneths before this wonderfull accident was knowne among you, to wit, that this yeare 1605 heere should bee a turbulent Parliament, a black Christmas, and a bloudie Lent. Did not all these things agreeing as it were, and conspiring together speake and fore-warne you (beloved great Brittaine) even as they had beene reasonable creatures, of the great disastre likely to fall out, comming to my eares. Mervaile not then, if I that had my ere∣ction established by the sound advisement and firme decree of the gravest, wisest, and most learned Parliament of the world, & perfected by the sacred influence and infusion of all the Muses through every member of my bodie, & life given to mee by my Soveraigne King, to
witnesse the safetie of his life, should not as wel speake, at least my Ghost, as did the counter∣fet spirit of Samuel, and rather to bee better thought of, then it, because both my warrant and cause is approovedly good. But while I stoode long time in a muse, pondering betwixt hope and dispaire, what should become of my wandring soule, and at length, thinking with my selfe, to finde out some Pythagorean Philo∣sophers (if anie were yet aliue) for consulting, what bodie should be fittest for my receptacle; certaine my loving friends in this time, inspired (as the sequell shall testifie) with some divine instinct, convayed me safely to great Brittaines Ocean Sea: where Neptune receaving me cour∣teouslie at their hands, commaunded Aeolus with his fairest and readiest windes safelie and speedilie to transport me from that dangerous shore I was on, to the famous Microcosme of ancient Brittaine, the great Conquerour, som∣time of my ingrate Countrie, as to the chiefe harbour of all poore distressed Pilgrimes. But while Aeolus was preparing all things necessarie for my safe conduct, Neptune willed me, brief∣lie to report the causes of my suddaine flight and departure from my native Countrie,
which though at first I was in doubt what to doe, as fearing that hee might either bewray me to mine enemies, when I had told him all, or might stop my passage, if I told him not, at last I resolved vpon all hazards that might fol∣low, to satisfie his demaund, as farre foorth, as the shortnes of the time, and perill of the place would permit. Then thus I spake vnto him. The causes that haue compeld mee (O great Neptune, thou great God of the Oce∣an) to seeke thy favour in this my miserie, are trulie and vpon my alleagiance vnto thee, the extreame and more then inhumane persecuti∣ons of my bloudie enemies the Iesuites both before, and since my lamentable and vndeser∣ved death & overthrow, procured for no other cause, then for truly witnessing to the world, but more particularly to true Catholique Hugo∣nets, and to all forraine Strangers who might dailie beholde mee in the prime of my tryum∣phant estate, in the most famous Cittie and place of the vniuersall world, how this mightie King & martial Monarch Henry the fourth, that now raigneth, was treacherously wounded, but yet miraculously preserved of his life, frō the Esauitical plot executed by Chattell one of the
novices, trayned vp in their tragicall Schoole erected latelie for teaching of bloudie pre∣cepts, for the killing of all such Kings and Prin∣ces, as being either Romanists or true Christi∣ans, shall be stumbling blocks to hinder the po∣litick courses of their new established Machia∣villian Government. Me miserûm vox faucibus haeret I cannot vtter the one halfe I would say, such hast I haue to be gone for the feare & dan∣ger I am in, by the furious pursute of my pro∣fessed enemies, who tyrannouslie triumphing in mine overthrow, mangled all the members of my bodie as was pittifull to see, and yet not so satisfied, will not suffer my broken bones, no, nor my verie Ghost to remaine in rest or safetie within anie part of this ample Kingdom. These men (or to speake more properly mon∣sters of men) being iustlie (and as deservedlie, as ever anie the most haynous malefactors that ever were) bannished out of this Realme by a generall decree of Parliament, without hope of being ever recalled home, or to creepe a∣gaine into anie grace or favour of my great Soveraigne, which they had so foulely forfai∣ted, are nowe againe (a wonder it is to heare) after a few yeares exile, come not submissiuely,
but triumphantly home, glorying in the spoiles of my heauie and sad fall; dying; and lying pro∣strate at their proud feete. And thus are they growne into great credite and aucthoritie by the distraction of my Soveraignes late singular favour towardes mee, which I surelie hoped, should, nay could never haue been withdrawn, being so fast tied and conglutinate to my per∣son, as a publique decree of the wisest humane wits could devise, and ingraven besides in let∣ters of Gold and Azure, for the more honour and ornament to vs both. But what shal I say, Nibi sub coelo durabile, et Regum gratia saepe mu∣tabilis: For my craftie enemies had so closed vp and stopped the princelie eares of my So∣veraigne (which should haue beene open alike to all Complayners) with a fine and subtil kind of black Cotton cunningly wrought by the fi∣nest and most expert Esauiticall Artificers that were in all Italie and Spaine, who bore his Ma∣iestie in hand, that my brused bones broken all to peeces would bee the most effectuall preser∣vatiue for resisting all pestilent venome of such Hereticks, as should oppose thēselues against the wholesome and sound reestablishment of the Iesuites, adding moreover (no small false∣hoode)
that these would prooue heereafter the most profitable and serviceable people vnto him, that were vnder his obeysance. So my dread Liege being fully possessed by little and little with the slie insinuations of this counterfet Cotton, neither the credite of sundrie of his faithfull Counsailors, neither the waightie ar∣guments of the most graue and iuditious Pre∣sidents of his Parliament, nor the eloquence and smooth reasons of learned Advocates, nei∣ther the subtile inventions and scholastick So∣phistrie of the Sorbonist Doctors, nor the pit∣tious plaints of poore Schollers, who delighted their eyes, refreshed their mindes, and filled their papers and bookes with the learned Mu∣ses that guarded my square bodie; all these my favourers, I say, and continuall intercessours could prevaile nothing with my dread Sove∣raigne, whose pittie my enemies had captiua∣ted wholy to their crueltie and malice, that no place was left for prayers, nor meanes anie longer for my continuance there, but Discere dura pati, and comfort my selfe with that en∣couragement that vertuous Aeneas gaue to his Sea-beaten Souldiours. Durato et temet re∣bus seruato secundis.
Pluck vp thy heart, and driue from thee both care and feare away: To think of this, may pleasure bee to thee another day. Thus remained then no other comfort to me, neare halfe dead before hand through di∣spaire, but that of necessitie (as I well percea∣ved) it behooved one to die for the sinnes of this people, and who should that be, but even I poore Pyramis, who not long before, had life with the promise of a long life, (but what mor∣tall men can promise life to another, that are not assured of their owne) given vnto mee, for recording their barbarous crueltie, and now a∣gaine must loose my life, even in that place, alas, where I first receaved life, and for no other thing, then for testimonie of the truth, and to giue them a surer and longer life by my spee∣die death, and withall a greater honour and credit by my downefall, then ever they had since their first originall, or ever could hope for themselues in this worlde. And thus is the worlde there turned topsie turvie: The good and faythfull are taken away, and
and the wicked and vngratious are hoysted vp in their roomes. O scelus, O mores, O tempora perversa in quibus vixi. O poore and misera∣ble wretch that I am, what haue I committed, that I should suffer so cruell a punishment? I haue continued there but a small time, consi∣dering the eternitie of yeares I should haue in∣dured, erected also in the most eminent place of our Monarchie, to the amazement of my professed enemies; where I indured dailie op∣probrious railings and infamous Pasquils on my frontispice, taxing both King, Counsell, Parliament, and State for my sumptuous buil∣ding in so famous a place, besides my nightlie danger (for witnessing the decree of their ban∣nishment for so infamous a fact) to be dismem∣bred, and by the Sturre & tumults of their ad∣herents pulled downe before the morrow, & that not perchance without the shedding of innocent bloud. All this and much more it behooved me to indure, yea and much more would I patiently haue suffred, so as I might haue continued there, vntill I had either re∣ceaved some recompence for my faithfull service, or had beene bestowed in some other famous place, to haue served for a perpetuall
memorie of that infamous treacherie, that can never be forgotten. Nec tamen annorū series, nec flamma, nec ensis, Aeternum poterit hoc abolere scelus. Thus ending my discourse to Neptune, and craving his favourable ayde for my passage to great Brittaine, my last and onelie refuge left vnto mee. The God smiling spake with a gra∣tious countenance vnto me, Fauet fortuna vo∣tis. And so by the favour of Aeolus and the swift winges of his windes, I was vpon the suddaine (before I could bethinke my selfe where I was) set vpon the white & pleasant Brittaine Coast, where vpon a greene mountaine, not far from the place of my arrivall, was first presented to my view, a goodly companie of frollique Shep∣heards, who as they drew somewhat neare me, cast off their mourning garments, which they had worne (as seemed) before, for the great & horrible daunger they apprehended by their long experience, knowledge, and insight of the heavenlie constellations & caelestiall signes, of some great fatall coniurations plotted by Plu∣to and his Stygian furies, for the totall subuer∣sion of this ancient Kingdome and State, and
were all presentlie cloathed in white, playing and singing sweete and melodious congratula∣lions, for the happie deliverie both of their na∣tive Countrie from that great imminent perill, as also for my fortunate arrivall in so fit a sea∣son, wherby I might not onelie testifie to them my Countries crueltie, and her ingratitude towards mee, but that I might likewise in short successe of time eternize my name, by offering my service in publishing by open testimonie both to the great and little World, a more hor∣rible and damnable fact, then before I served for. And so being a little comforted and put in some good hope by this their newes, my faint spirit begins to take fresh courage, and to strengthen my weake limbes, so that I be∣gan to march a faster pace, then before I was accustomed to, with desire to learne more certaintie of this newes, which yet was a my∣sterie vnto me: and casting mine eyes round about mee, to see if I could discerne anie thing, I perceaved betwixt mee and the skie, beeing then the dawning of the day (before Phoebus had sent abroade his rayes for the clearing of the ayre with vniuersall light) the whole companie of the sacred Muses ador∣ned
with their ever flourishing greene Lawrel Garlands, who holding in their hands sundry & severall instruments of musique, made the hils, valleyes, and groues to resound with their hea∣venly harmonie, melodious Songs, sweet son∣nets, and shrill Ecchoes of their learned Poeti∣call inventions in all languages; and all this they did to signifie the exceeding ioy they had late∣ly conceaved of the thrice happie deliverance of that their great friend, darling, & favourer, the most wise, prudent, learned, mightie, wor∣thie, and in all heroicall vertues and valour, the most rare and great Apollo, whom Mars that sterne God of bloudie battaile evermore en∣vied and hated even to the death, for no other cause (as can bee coniectured, or as I could learne out of their rare Ditties and Sonnets) then onelie, for that he was entred into a sin∣cere league and sweete societie of the caele∣stiall Graces, the devine Muses, and sacred Peace, (whereto hee was preordayned at the verie houre of his nativitie) and thereby, and by meanes of the common tranquillitie there∣of ensuing, had brought and deduced from aboue, into this little world, & from thence de∣rived to all the most famous parts of the great
world, such manifold and exceeding rich gifts, bounteous favours, and invaluable benefits & blessings, as the like had either seldome, or not at all beene enioyed in anie former age, for which he was (as he well deserved) vniuersallie admired, honoured, and blessed over all. And therfore the greater indignation boiled in the breast of angrie Mars, who ever more grudg∣ing at humane felicitie, left no meanes or waies vnsought or vnattēpted, whereby to bring our great Patron & Benefactor, and consequentlie this little world to confusion. And such was his innated hatred against him, even when he was yet in his Mothers bellie, knowing by the fa∣vourable aspects of Sol & Venus, that he should proue a most potent, prudent, wise, & blessed Prince of Peace, beloved both of Gods & mē, that he this wicked Mars set on his cruell Ser∣geant the elder Gowrie to haue murdered that most noble Heroine the Queene his mother, & this blessed fruit of her womb, at one stab. And being prevented by divine providence of his malignitie, in this his abhominable intention, after manie other mischievous plots and prac∣tises (all of them, as all other shall ever be made frustrate by the high hand of iust Joue) he con∣spired
with that variable Aeolus GOD of the windes (who either by faire meanes, or sharpe menaces of anie great Power is lightlie wonne to worke the worst mischiefe he can) to giue full scope and free licence to his turbulent and vnrulie windes, at such time, as our bright day-starre Apollo having accomplished the notable solemnitie of those famous nuptialls in the strong Dacian Kingdome, the middle Region of Europa, with his peerelesse Paragon, of all rich perfection the divine Cynthia (otherwise then by himselfe immatchable) had imbarqued him with his most lovelie beloved above all o∣ther, sailing from thence through the Ocean, towards his ancient Kingdom the lesser Albion, lying to the north of Albion maior, (now both by his Highnes happilie reduced to one Mo∣narchie) then was seene the boisterous rage of blustring Boreas and his rude companions, do∣mineering with might and maine vncontroled in Neptunes maine dominion, (but without that great Gods assent or knowledge) as somtime by the like permission of their flexible Master Aeolus at the request of angrie Juno, they pra∣ctised the like peremptorie pranks (vnwitting to Neptune) vpon the vertuous and valorous
Prince Aeneas in the Tyrrhene Seas. So that colleaguing themselues with that great Sorce∣resse Circe, and a great number of her most im∣pious and detestable impes, all practising to drowne and destroy our Apollo and his fairest Cynthia with all their noble traine (as after vp∣on their conviction they freely confessed) they sturdilie heaved, tossed, and tumbled the feare∣full billowes, hoysing one while his drearie ships vpon the high-raised waues almost to the azure skie, and then throwing them downe a∣gaine as lowe as the foundations of the earth. Yet notwithstanding all their furious tumults, and violent commotions, Almightie Joue (whose name be therefore magnified for ever) beholding this outragious tempest, and kno∣wing the wicked occasion thereof; brought them safe and sound to their own desired con∣tinent & Country. Which, when Mars vnder∣stood, he stāped & stared, foming at the mouth, and his eyes sparkling like fire for verie anger, that his conspiracie prevailed not, he fared like a mad man, and vowing still to pursue him with immortall hatred, swore by the black river of Stix, that his day of Mars wheron he was born, should ever proue the most fatall day of all o∣ther vnto him. And for that purpose he combi∣ned
himselfe with Pluto that dreadful Prince of Erebus, who complotting together, brought it so to passe vnder cunning pollicies and faire shewes of great matters, that cōcerned his own person, state, and Kingdome, to bring him by the earnest labour of one of his deare favou∣rites, to the dishonourable and disloyall house of the other Sergeant of Mars the younger & last Gowry, the bloudie nephew of a cruel tray∣terous Grandsire, where having locked him vp in a close roome in the hands of their sworne friends, his mortal enemies, he had no way nor meanes to escape, but even miraculously by his own stout manhood, or rather Heroick magna∣mitie, & the succour of a few of his faithful ser∣vants, but chiefly againe by the almightie pro∣vidence of high Joue, waiting over him, at all times and places for his safeguard, hee was also delivered out of that danger. Then were Mars & Pluto more enraged then ever before, gna∣shing their teeth, and cursing and banning the fiends and furies, that had no more pollicie or power to accomplish their infernall plot, they were almost at a point to haue giuen over anie lōger pursuit of their cōspiracies, but that Pluto bethought himselfe of his deare son the red & bloudy Dragon, who throgh long & continual practise
for manie ages, of all sorts of hellish stratagems, horrible massacres, blacke murders, deceitfull lies, and false miracles was growne to bee as much famed and feared in the world, as him∣selfe, so as it might be a question disputable in Schooles, whether Sathan the roaring and de∣vouring Lyon, or his sonne the Pope, that red & bloudie Dragon was to be held for the grea∣test and chiefest lier and murtherer. Pluto therefore crying out, Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta mouebo, they began to be recomfor∣ted in his deare sonne, of their wicked hopes & divellish drifts for the acting of their bloudie Tragedie, (as the last hope of all their mis∣chiefes). And so adioyning themselues to this other great enemie of mans welfare, who was exceeding proude to haue the mannaging of that action referred to him, wherein the Prince of Devils had failed, conceaued presently a more horrible plot, then all the Stygian furies called together in a common Counsell could haue devised, not onely against the sacred per∣son & life of Apollo, but also his divine Cynthia, and all their Godlike progenie, & all the He∣roes, Prelates, Nobles, Statesmen, and chiefe Gentrie vnder his Domination; all whom, and
manie moe, by force of his invention, he made sure account to haue destroyed vpon that omi∣nous day of Mars, with one blow of his fatall engine. Which complot hee gaue in charge for the more suretie to certaine of his trustie Enginers the Esauiticall band (whose charge, profession, and practise, is nothing else but the vndermining and blowing vp of Princes, great States, and Kingdomes) to see the same with all secret conveyance and diligence put in ex∣ecution. Never before was heard of, the like inhumane stratagem, though manie cunning & cruell conspiracies proceeding from this terri∣ble Dragon, had often been attempted against our Apolloes Predecessour, his most honoured and hallowed virgin sister, the great & migh∣tie Diana, whom hee most maliced and hated deadlie aboue anie other Potentate on the earth, for that she as a most vertuous and cou∣ragious Princesse, and Faiths valorous Cham∣pionesse, had not onelie given to him a wide & dangerous wound, that still, & still shall ever to his dying day put him to most grievous paine; but also destroyed a great number of mischie∣vous monsters that were conceaved and crept forth out of his foule mouth. All his practises
notwithstanding, and though he did the verie worst he could, could nothing prevaile against her most blessed life, raigne, state, & governe∣ment, but that for 44 yeares together and vp∣ward, while she ruled the famous Kingdome of Albion maior, to the high pleasure of Almighty Joue, a more flourishing and blessed estate was there seene, then was ever heard of in those times, when divine Astraea lived and ruled a∣mong earthly men. And in this meane time, while as the Almightie God perceaving this earthly Kingdome of her most happie and gra∣tious Maiestie, to bee compassed and clogged with so many daily conspiracies and dangers, and that her sacred person having by the due course of nature runne out, & ended the glasse of her thrice happie and most renowmed go∣vernment; than it pleased him in his great and loving favour and mercie (most happily and peaceably without anie danger or disturbance to her well long governed Kingdomes) to translate her hence to the highest Emperiall heaven, there to live and raigne in the greatest glorie with his Angels to all eternitie. Consti∣tuting in her place this our Apollo, whom hee hath predestinated to vanquish, and finally de∣stroy
this monstrous red Dragon, whereby he shall purchase so much the greater glorie and immortall renowme to himselfe, then did the olde Apollo, by killing the huge serpent Py∣thon, by how much this Dragon is a thousand folde more great, virulent, violent, terrible, strong, and horrible then that was. This is the great cause indeede, why Mars fretteth, Plu∣to fumeth, the Dragon rageth, and all iointlie conioyne and conspire with all their forces a∣gainst the life and state of Apollo, for whose most happie preservation from all their inten∣ded mischiefes; the melodious Muses sang Jo Pean, with manie heavenlie notes (swee∣ter farre then the concentfull harmonie of the sphericall Orbes) full of ioy and tryumph. But reserving the residue of the rarest and secretest matter of their divine songs, vntill I shall see the end of my travailes, I will briefelie shewe, what further befell mee. Thus being heere∣by somewhat more confirmed of the trueth of so woonderfull newes, and advauncing my steps forward to see the end and successe of these strange incounters, I cast my sleepie eyes here & there (the day being all spent, and
blacke and raynie clouds covering the bright starres in the firmament) when loe in an instant, there appeared to me, as it were Vulcan in fi∣erie sparkes & shining flames of great burning fires, environing me on all parts, where I went. I misdoubting at first, that Vulcan and Pluto had conspired the burning of the whole Island I was entred into, resolved with my selfe (if it were possible) to returne and escape so great and imminent a danger. But being soone ad∣vertised, that the matter was nothing so, as I supposed, but that these fires were kindled on∣lie for ioy, according to the commendable cu∣stome of this Island, when any good newes hap∣peneth to the State, or Countrie: Behold, I was no sooner rid of this feare and perplexitie, but that I might see three severall Currors of sundrie nations (as appeared by their cogni∣zances on their brest) going for France, Spaine, and Jtalie, and seemed to bee verie passionate and sad by their countenance and cariage, whi∣ther it were for the ill successe of the plot then discovered, or for that they feared, the passa∣ges were all stopt, so as they could not giue the first advertisement to their Maisters, I leaue them to your good and friendly consideration
(great Brittaine) who can better iudge in their matters, and tell by the Weathercocke what quarter the wind holdeth, thē I poore Pilgrime. Yet thus farre I can say of them, that their cour∣tesie and favour was such to me a poore stran∣ger, that they could not afford me one Aue, but making sighes, and crosses vpon their faces and breasts, looked and beckened so on me, as to a Hugonet. But I sore fearing, that they had beene Sergeants at armes sent after me for my apprehension, where soever they might finde me, was glad to make a low curtsie, and passe by them, with as much speed as my wearie feet could carie mee, and having posted a mile fur∣ther (without once looking backe) It was my good hap to meete with two English Postes, bearing the red rampant Lyon on their brests; who were so full of indignation, as that after my double salutations, they could not for an∣ger speake vnto me, and shewing a sad & sor∣rowfull countenance, whither it were, that the stranger Postes had got the start of them, or fearing that thorough favour they might get passage before them, to carrie the first newes to their Maisters, and other forraine Princes, or for what other cause I know not, nor was it
fit for me, being a stranger and a bannished Pil∣grime to be nimis curiosus in aliena republica. Yet staying, and viewing one another more nearlie, I began to remēber my selfe, that I had seene these two English Postes oftentimes not onely passe by me in their going to the Pallace of Paris, but that they had bin also accustomed theretofore, in pointing out their fingers to me, as to a rare myracle, to shew to their Coū∣trie men newly come over, my whole Genea∣logie, birth, & memorable storie: And on the other side, one of thē being well travaild in all Countries, by his imployment in the service of the late renowned Queene your Ladie, & gi∣ven withall to the observations of antiquities abroad, drew out his bookes of those matters, which hee ever caried about him into forraine parts, and turning the leaues over, he finds the whole discourse of my life, which pondering to and fro in his mind, he begins to looke on mee more nearly & circumspectly, & (the architec∣ture of my stately building being yet fresh in his memorie) he fell somwhat to blesse himselfe, & after to craue pardon of the oversight, (as hee said) of his duty to me, by whō he had receaved so many curtesies for his Country mē, & other
strāgers while I stood aliue, & in credit with the great Princes & Peeres of the Realm of France, then both of thē with a laughing countenance striving which of them should first embrace & welcom me, were so astonished at my presence, as they stood in doubt, whither they should re∣ioyce at my cōming over, or lament for my ex∣ile and hard fortune, I was fallen into. But yet vpon better advise, they reioyced rather, that it had pleased the mightie Jehouah, to bring me safe into this famous Island, and that I had arri∣ved in the best opportunitie, that ever could haue beene wished, affirming that Gods great and miraculous providence was so favourable vnto me, that wheras my sworne & cruell Esa∣uiticall enemies hoped to haue triumphed in my late down-cast, & consequently haue buri∣ed me in everlasting oblivion, they should now be frustrate of their vngodly hopes, saying thus vnto me. Be of good comfort renowned Pyra∣mis, thou shalt bee more welcome to this our newe Monarchie, then were thy enemies to their home-caller and restorer; and whereas thou wert permitted there to stande scarce the space of the fourth part of an age, in thy glorious Trophee, as a witnesse of two teeth strucken out of the mouth of the Lordes
annointed, and for preserving one King, which their novice and parricide Chattell had inten∣ded to haue killed, and for putting but one Kingdome in danger of forfaiture to the Pope their Creator, which before in colour of a false presupposed right, hee pretended he had given to the holy Leaguers, and their coniured adherents, by excommunicating that your sa∣cred Monarch; we doubt not, but heere thou shalt shortly serue for a greater vse, and more glorious end, to bee erected as a witnesse and perpetuall Record of the wonderfull & thrice happie deliverie of our great and sacred King the rarest & most learned King that ever bare Scepter either in this Island, or in any age pre∣sent, or past; of his most gratious Queene that shall be by the loving favour of the Almightie, the ioyfull and blessed mother of many Kings & Queenes; his tender & deare sonne & heire, a Prince of the greatest hope of his age; the rest of his royall Progenie, all the reverend Bi∣shops, graue Counsailours, and Iudges, all the ancient Nobility, Gentillity, & Burgesses cho∣sen and deputed for Commissioners to a so∣lemne Parliament, and of many thousand moe that were attendant to that solemnity, and of a
number of forraine Embassadours, if they had come thither, as was supposed, they should; All these, and many moe, which were all in a mo∣ment to haue beene blowne vp, by a false and cruell Foxe, (for so was his name) sent forth out of some of the Popes dennes, or rather Plu∣toes dungeons, to kill, rent, and blow vp all the innocent & simple sheepe of Christes Fold, in this new established Monarchie, at one blow. This was one of the Popes Cannons, that hath been making this yeare & halfe, by his finest & most subtile-pated Artificers, which he had hi∣red for this horrible worke of his, and this blow should haue beene given by such a small Can∣non, that was charged with no more then 34 great barrels of pouder, and with 24 stone of gad Iron for her bullet. All the thundring Cānons forged & made in the bloudie Coun∣sell of Trent were not so dangerous, as this one was. And yet true it is, that a few of these Can∣nons of Trent blew vp in Paris in one night, & one morning tenne thousand people, besides 20000 they blewe vp in other Townes a little after, where one barrell of powder furni∣shed all those Cannons. But the greatest diffe∣rence was this, they there killed but thousands
of poore Hugonets, but heere they aymed their murdring shot against King, Queene, Prince, Dukes, Earles, Barons, Prelates, Counsailours, Iudges, and Gentillitie of the Land; there they preserved Houses, Pallaces, Chappels, and Schooles; but here they would haue blowne vp the most statelie buildings, Churches, Pallaces, and Schooles that pertained to the Crown, yea the treasure and Records of the Kingdome; there they spoiled the living onely, but heere they would haue burnt and blowne vp the sa∣cred and dead bodies of the famous Kings, Cō∣querours, Queenes, & Princes, sleeping in their sumptuous Toombs, as the rich and costly beds of their last honours they had heere vpon the earth. There they imagined by killing of King Henry the third, and wounding the fourth Henry, to haue wrought the overthrow & de∣solation of one ancient Kingdome; but here of three severall most ancient and warlike King∣domes of Christendome. But having not lea∣sure to stand on more particulers, what shall I say to thee (O thou thrice happy exiled Pyra∣mis) of these their never before invented cru∣elties. Talia horret meminisse animus. O this wic∣ked treacherie, and false periurie of theirs! O
cruell conspiracie, and Graecian perfidie! O Sa∣thanicall enimitie, & more then Neronian cru∣eltie! O Scythian barbarity, and Iudaisme infi∣delity! O Gentilisme vanity, & more thē Hea∣thenish impietie! and finally, O poysoned Pa∣pisticall idolatry of theirs, proceeding frō their blind & devilish devotion, the ground of their abhominable & hellish treasō. The treacherous conspiracie of wicked Hāmon that he wrought against the Iewes, to haue had them all killed in one day, wheresoever they should be found in the vast Dominions of the great Monarch Assuerus, is not cōparable to this: Nor the cru∣eltie of Mithridates, who in one night & a day killed thirtie thousand Romanes: Nor the ty∣rannie of wicked Nero who killed his mother, his master, & that burnt almost whole Rome the chiefe Citie of the world, with a number of o∣ther cruelties that hee committed: Nor the bloud-thirstie mind & wicked desire to raigne of Caligula, who wished the whole Senate and chiefe men of the Romane Empire, to haue had but one necke, that hee might haue struc∣ken it off at one blowe: Neither the secret and bloudie conspiracie of treacherous Ca∣tiline, who had privilie plotted not onelie the
death of the whole Senate, and chiefe men of name in Rome, but also had destinated the most of his owne kindred to that cruell slaughter: Neither the damnable Sicilians evening sacri∣fices committed by them vpon the French men: Nor the Mattens of Paris performed by the French themselues in massacring their owne Country men and dearest friends, can in no degree be matched with this vnnaturall cruel∣tie of theirs. And which is most strange how it could be, all this their whole pernitious & de∣testable enterprise of our tyrannous Traytors and cruell bloud-sucking Papists, that had been more then a yeare in hatching, was so cunning∣lie & secretly contrived and mannaged by the subtill and Machiavillian practises of some few maleconted Gentlemen ioyned to the Iesuites and Seminarie Priests, who had the chiefe im∣ployment for matters both of Counsell & ex∣ecution, that it was brought forward vnknown & vnrevealed even to the space of a verie few houres, before the time of putting the same in execution; & according to the relation of the chiefe Counsailours of our Estate, if the Al∣mightie God had not miraculously made our gratious Soveraigne, by divine inspiration ra∣ther,
then by humane wisedom and fore-sight, to cause diligent inquirie to bee made of such suspect places of the Parliament house, as his Maiestie greatlie misdoubted after the reading of a misticall & strange letter, out of the which, his Highnes collected & apprehended more, then a great part of his Counsell could, doubt∣lesse this monstrous contrived treason would haue sorted to that wicked destinated event. Therefore O glorious, wise, and ever famous King, preserved wee hope, for a greater worke of God, that by thy providence and sacred ex∣periences hast saved thy selfe, thy succession & Kingdomes, a worke which time and memorie shall never deface, but shall be eternized to the worlds end, to thy immortall glorie and re∣nowme. But O thou mightie Iehouah, to whom the highest glorie shall be ascribed, that so mi∣raculously hast preserved thy own annointed, and with him thy deare Church, which was en∣vironed with such incomparable daunger that never was heard of before, neither was ever hatched the like by all the cursed brood of Sa∣than, vntill this never before expected wicked time. Thus ending his tragicall discourse, I became so astonished and amazed thereat, as I
became speechlesse, and as halfe dead, vntill these Currors began friendly to comfort mee: assuring mee, that the Almightie of his great providence had brought me here, that where∣as my enemies the Iesuites & Seminary Priests, and their bloudie associates and followers, ho∣ped to haue gotten credit and eternall repu∣tation by the downe-cast of me poore Pyramis at home in Paris, that now I should be in a sure way of preferment, by the gratious assistance of the most High, and the favour and pietie of the great, mightie, and religious Monarch, and this estate of the new Monarchy, & little world, to receaue heere a greater glorie and honour by my newe erection in so famous an ancient Countrie, and place, then the disgrace I had in France by my overthrowe: and that where my enemies intended to haue raced out vtterly all remembrance of me, they should make me Jp∣sis invidis etiam nolentibus, to be more renow∣ned then ever I was before, and more infamie to redound to them in the succeeding ages, thē did to Erastratus that made himselfe infamous to this day, by burning that rare & sumptuous temple of Diana in Ephesus, held for one of the seaven mervailes of the world; and whereas I had continued there scarce the quarter of a
mans age, they hoped, that I should stand heere and, indure to the worlds end: & whereas I was builded there in the ruines of a Merchants house, that heere I should be erected in the ru∣ines of Plutoes destinated Pallace, to stand as a witnesse of their damnable plot for the perpe∣tuall ruine & downefall of many hundred faire houses of Nobility & Gentrie: and that where my erection was there decreed by one Court of Parliament of Paris, consisting only of Pre∣sidents & Lawyers, that here I should be ordai∣ned & confirmed by the Soveraigne Monarch, and three Estates of Parliament, solemnlie to stand in Amphitheatrick forme, after the anci∣ent Romane manner. PROPTER REGEM, REGNVM, ET SVBDITOS SERVATOS. For preserving the King, Kingdom, & Subiects, in that same place where the fact & cruell conspiracie was intended to haue beene put in execution. And thus having discoursed vnto me this strāge conspiracie, (of all conspiracies that ever were the most capitall) & incouraged me vpō an as∣surance of my advancement, they courteouslie took their leaues, after they had directed me to the famous Abbey of Westminster, whitherward I hied me fast, that there I might cōplaine & la∣ment among the graues of the dead, therby to move
all zealous and well affected Brittaine Com∣missioners of all the three States in Parliament, that detest the crueltie of so great & horrible a crime, & hate the mischievous plotters of such haynous treason, to be intercessors and petiti∣oners to their dread Soveraigne, for my erec∣tion and advancement to the Office of High Recorder of the preservation of this new Mo∣narchie of great Brittaine, and that place no longer to be a Parliament-house, that was de∣dicated to Pluto and his infernall Furies, but that I may succeede thereto, (after that it shall by a generall decree bee cast downe) as a iust demolisher of that Stygian field. I say no more now for very faintnes, but Misericordia Dei su∣per omnia opera, giving thankes in the meane time to the Author of my first life, and to him next, whosoever he be, that hath preserved my reliques and broken bones to so happy a time, thereby to giue me a second life, as if I were a new Phoenix rising out of my burnt ashes, to make the world hereafter wonder at, & detest more and more the crueltie of the Pope that bloudy Dragon, and his divelish children, and from terrifying such miscreants ever hereafter in any age subsequent, to attempt the like a∣gainst
the Lords annointed & his Church, fully perswading my selfe, that this great worke of the Lord in discovering so horrible a fact, by which, they promised to themselues a finall & infallible overthrow of Christs Church, and true religion in this Island, shall be the meanes by Gods wonderfull favour & iudgement, that out of this Isle shortlie shal march that mightie and fearefull Lyon, that beares in his Scutchion that martiall poesie Parcere subiectis, et debellare superbos, who shall overthrowe the bloudie Dragon, that Antichristian beast, with all his whelps in his devouring denne, and shall esta∣blish Gods word there, which they purposed to haue extinguished heere. And I thinke verily, that this is their last blow, that ever they shal be able to strike, and which by the reverberating force of it shall be the most dangerous & dead∣lie to themselues, & for their owne overthrow, yea sorer then Luthers, that was the greatest wound that the Romish Antichristian Church receaved in our memorie, and which (as I trust) shall drive them in time to acknowledge their wickednes and blindnes, and to embrace the true faith in humilitie, and to craue me pardon for my downe-cast and bannishment from my
native Countrie. And thus having made rela∣tion to thee (O renowned Monarchie of great Brittaine) both of my passed and present for∣tunes, and of the strange accidents that haue hitherto happened vnto me, I implore thy gra∣tious ayde & accustomed bountie never deni∣ed to any oppressed stranger, in vouchsafing to become an earnest intercessor for me, to the high & most sacred Maiestie of thy great Sove∣raign (in whose potencie, & your authority, the hope not onely of my preferment, but the cer∣tain accomplishment of all those great matters before spoken of, assuredly consisteth) that I may be receaved and brought to the presence and most comfortable favour of his princely mercies, that by thē I may haue a new life brea∣thed into me, and be preferred to that eminent place, where I may best performe (as dutie and thankfulnes shall binde me) both to his High∣nes and thy excellencie, that worthie and faith∣full service, that shall neuer be but exceedingly well thought, & highly comended to all poste∣rity. And to my auspitious mind, no fitter place for demōstration of my dutifull seruice (I speak not I protest out of ambition, or anie vicious humor) can be assigned me, thē that Parliament
house, which these Monsters of mankinde, the Pope & his miscreant crue had meant to haue subverted & demolished by Plutoes & Vulcans violent and boystrous fires & flashing thunder∣bolts, and so to haue made & consecrated it as a ruinous & fit Pallace for the habitation of the black infernall Prince, & his damned spirits and Ministers of darknes. But that I may with the greater right, and without cavill of curious or captious heads stand there aucthorized, Let me also request this favour at your handes (most mightie Monarchie) to move & stir vp the wel affected mindes & fierie zeales of the States of your Parliament, that at the next Session, I being as yet but an Alian heere, may by Sta∣tute & decree be naturalized, and infranchized as a borne subiect within your territorie, & so thereafter to be erected and stand in the place that was destinated for Plutoes Pallace, as a per∣petuall monument and Record of this horrible conspiracie, & of thine, & our Monarchs most happy cōservation, & as a caveat to the ages fol∣lowing of the Papistical treasons of the Romish Church, which I hope shall shortly inferre an end to that long vsurped tyrannicall raigne. And so perswading my selfe, that if neither
my poore and pittious distressed estate; neither the fine eloquence of the bannished Pyramis it selfe, speaking to you in his owne French lan∣guage: newly set forth in your owne tongue, cannot perswade you to immortalize your own deliverie from the greatest apparant daunger that ever befell to you. I say, if this above men∣tioned reason, cannot move you to testifie in some measure, the earnest desire you haue to make this notable deliverie of GOD to bee knowne to the ages subsequent by my publike erecting again in a glorious Pyramis, by testify∣ing your inward thākfulnes to him by this out∣ward monument for your preservation: Yet I beseech you, although I seem perchance a strā∣ger in outward shew, suffer me neverthelesse as a loving Patriark & simpathizing Christian, in the common cause, that these two great & won¦derfull works of the Almightie God, (may at least move and touch your hearts, from the highest degree to the lowest, from the head to the bodie, and so to all the members of this your Monarchie) I meane his great mercie to∣wards you all, and his fearefull iudgement a∣gainst your enemies in this never to be forgot∣ten thrice happie and admirable deliverie. His
mercie, I say, appeares not onely in discoverie of your danger, but in disappointing of their cruell Parricide, and in preserving your lyues from the snares of the bottomlesse Locusts of hellish Babilon, his iudgement againe in the o∣ther part is to be admired, in suffering a great part of them to bee apprehended, and made a perpetuall spectacle to all posteritie, by a iust and most severe punishment, and the chiefest of them to haue suffered that same crueltie of punishment, by Gun-powder, which they or∣dained for your death.Psal. 17. Blessed therefore be the Lord of Hostes in all his workes, for his mercies be everlasting, and his iudgements vnsearchable. And let this againe be your morning and eve∣ning sacrifice, recommended to all Christians of mercie and of iudgement both, O Lord,Psal, 10. my song shall bee: But if all this cannot perswade you to erect mee for a publique Monument of your deliverie, yet let the godlie example of Abraham, Jsaack & Jacob, stir you vp to this, who in their often deliveries & favours recea∣ved at the hands of God, erected both Altars and Monumēts of stones, as witnesses of Gods inestimable favours & blessings towards them, to their posteritie; and seeing also that, that spi∣rituall
Monument of publique prayers religi∣ouslie ordained by his sacred Maiestie to bee celebrated through all his Kingdomes, for stirring vp of all mens affections in thank∣fulnesse to GOD, appeares almost in the verie beginning to bee neglected, both in Court, Countrie, and Citie; at least permitte then the erection of this temporall and ma∣teriall Monument, to bee an occasion and a meanes not onelie to lifte vp your externall eyes to GOD, but also rather to lift vp the eyes of your mindes and hearts to the memo∣rie of GODS mercie towardes you all, and of his iudgement vpon your enemies. I could speake farre more in this so ample and wor∣thie Subiect, if I should not bee thought too forward in so good a cause: but howsoever I, or the Pyramis that hath made mee thus to speake bee liked of, so that I haue preserved my selfe farre from Joue et fulmine, I care the lesse the censure of the rude, and vnlearned that knowes not, but extra crepidam, nei∣ther would I wish the covetousnesse of the rich, nor the envie of the malecontent, nor the partialitie of the indifferent, neither the
favourer of Poperie, hinder so good a worke, neither dislike of mee the Patronizer there∣of: adding onelie this short caveat, with your good leaue and friendlie favour, that if the least countenaunce of clemencie shall bee showne to the Romaine conspiratours and their associates, either nowe or heere∣after: it is to bee feared, that your clemen∣cie shall bee called crueltie, and your cou∣rage cowardnesse, and your loue hatred: And last of all, your Religion and Zeale to∣wardes Christes Church and your Countrie, shall bee thought Atheisme and Poperie. Which GOD forbid should ever come to passe in such a Christian and flourishing Mo∣narchie, where Christes word is so vniuersal∣lie & religiouslie preached. And if that you ei∣ther saue any of the greatest or meanest sort of those coniured Traytours that bee nowe in hands; but especiallie the Iesuites and Semi∣narie Priests, the chiefe inventours of all those pestilent plots, & ringleaders of the rest to this damnable Rebellion, either for feare, favour, or for anie other worldlie or politick respect: I feare not onely all such that feares God truly at home, but all sincere and faithfull Christian
neighbours abroad shall suspect you as betray∣ers both of Christes Church, his true religion, your gratious King, Countrie, yea your owne lyues, to your verie enemies: and to this end surelie the eies and eares of all those which be bound by the band of Vnitie in true religi∣on in all forraigne Kingdomes, are bent to at∣tend and heare of the good successe of so great a worke, put in your hand at this time; so per∣swading themselues in this meane time, that seeing it had pleased God to haue blest you by all other Nations and Kingdomes of the earth, with so wise, learned, and religious a King, so graue, godlie, expert, & foreseeing a Parliamēt, wherein I wish, Abrahams faith, Salomons wise∣dome, Davids zeale, Jonathans faithfulnes, Io∣suahs courage, and Judiths spirit and resoluti∣on, may appeare in everie one of you at this present, having also so faithfull and obeysant Magistrates and Subiects to execute, what∣soever your sacred King and three Estates shal decree in this present Parliament, expecting in this meane time at your hands, such godlie, necessarie, and strict lawes, with their due exe∣cution without delay & acception of persons, as Christes Church and true religion, may be
without all feare of danger; and on the other part the Papists your enemies, may be in such sure guard, with a care to disarme them, and in∣able them of all such meanes whatsoever, as in anie way heereafter may giue but the least su∣spition of anie thing, that may indanger his Ma∣iesties persō, succession, & Kingdoms, either by thēselues heere at home, or otherwise abroad, by their favourers and associates. And so con∣sider with thy selfe (beloved great Brittaine) the singuler goodnes of thy God towards thee, and thine annointed King, in delivering you both (who were appointed as Sheepe to the slaughter) from that most barbarous & savage imminent massacre, and vnnaturall conspiracie (no age ever yeelding example of like cruelty) & that thy deliverie & safetie came not of thy merit, but of Gods great mercie, not thy fore∣sight, but his providence, not thy loue to God, but his to thine annointed King and his chosen people. Forget not therefore, to praise, thank, and glorifie the Lord of Hostes continuallie, for his mervailous and most mercifull work of thy preservation and safetie, for his mercie en∣dureth for ever. Which that thou, and thy faith∣full people, and their seed after them, may not
onelie the better remember and be taught to doe, but learne also to abhorre the odious hai∣nousnes of so foule a fact: Let it be (as it is most worthie to be) written and engraven in my Pil∣ler of lasting Marble ad perpetuam rei memori∣am. And so praying the most High to blesse our good proceedings and well intended inde∣vours with happie & prosperous successe to his glorie, the good of his Church our owne com∣forts, and the conversion (if it may be) or else the confusion of his and our enemies; I con∣clude with this my last request, that such obdu∣rate & stiffe-necked Papists, as will not be yoa∣ked or reclaimed from their grosse & abhomi∣nable idolatries and wicked superstitions, but still like Swine swill and swell themselues with the filthie dregs, that the great whore of Ro∣mish Babilon giveth vnto them, refusing to be cured by the healthie and wholsome potion of Gods most holie truth, may not bee suffred to dwell together with mee in this land; for nei∣ther is it lawfull for such to liue amidst Gods chosen Heritage, to defile the Land with their filthines, nor (if they should) can my life bee without continuall hazard and danger, by their secret and villainous attempts. Call vpon thy
King therefore, to execute iustice & iudgment in cutting off these workers of iniquitie, whose religion is rebellion, whose faith is faction, whose pietie is wicked pollicie and practise of murdring both soules & bodies of Kings, and all estates of people, and to roote and rid them cleane out of the confines and limits of thy whole Monarchie, which being clearely pur∣ged of them, may ever heereafter growe vp, prosper, and flourish in quiet safetie, sound health, and invincible strength in everie mem∣ber of the whole bodie of all true and truly devoted subiects, with their righteous and religious Head and Sove∣raigne. Deo soli gratia & laus.
