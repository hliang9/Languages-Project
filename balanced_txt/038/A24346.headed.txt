AN ACCOUNT Of a Late, Horrid and Bloody MASSACRE in IRELAND, Of several thousands of Protestants; procur'd and carry'd on by the L. Tyrconnel and his Adherents. Which Occasioned the English, under the Conduct of the Lords Gre∣nard, Mountjoy, &c. To seize and secure the said Tyrconnel, in the Castle of Dublin, in order to be sent for England. FRom the death of the late King Charles the the Second, of blessed Memory, the Irish date their Happiness; and from the first Promo∣tion of Mr. Talbot, to the Earldom of Tyr∣connel, they conclude on the continuance of it: the crafty Priests to raise the Natives Zeal to the Cause, having Insinuated, by way of Prophecy, into their Minds, That one of that Title should free them from the Slavery of their Conque∣rors, and render that Kingdom free and in
dependent of all other Nations: And that as I have been credibly inform'd, made the now Governour Sue to the King for that particular Title, by which he did not only satisfie his own Ambition, but rais'd his Reputation so among the Irish, as they look'd upon him now no otherwise than their Guardian Angel and Deliverer. And now being Commissioned by the King, first to be Check∣Master General to the Army, and presently af∣ter Lord Deputy, and General Governour (though directly contrary to an Act of Parliament, which admits of no Irishman born to that Office) his first business was to new Model the Army, which in one Years time he did so effectually, that of seven or eight thousand, there was hardly one Hundred Officers and Soldiers of the English left; the Name of Protestant or Englishman, being a Crime too great to be suff red in any Military or Civil Imployment, he having the whole disposal of all the first, and most of the other. Having now secured, and rendered himself Formidable to the
Protestants, his next care was to ruine the In∣terest and Estates of all the English throughout the Kingdom; which he struck at by making Irish Papists Judges, in the Courts of Judicature, by dissolving the Charters▪ by packing of furies, Sub∣orning Witnesses, discountenancing the Protest∣ant Councils, &c. So that in most Causes, espe∣cially in the court of Exchequer; not the Right, but the Religion of the Defendant was chiefly considered: By this time Matters grew to such a Head, that His Lordship thought it necessary to disarm the Protestants throughout the King∣dom; but this Resolve not proving very ef∣fectual, he prceeded to weaken the English first, and afterwards to provoke them by publick ca∣lumnies and reproaches, branding all protestants promiscuously, with the title of whiggs and rebels; the commonalty threatning daily what they would do if the King should Die, protesting with bitter execrations, that they would never part with the sword now they bad it, and daily marking out to
themselves such and such proportions of the Eng∣lish Estates: All this notwithstanding, the Eng∣lish patiently bore, making no other return than by applying themselves to some of the English Nobi∣lity, who represented their Case to the King, though without Redress: But now the apprehen∣sions of the Prince of Orange's Coming to Eng∣land, being made known, Tryconnel presently takes the Alarm, and resolving on all the Injuries done to the English, made no doubt of their in∣clination to revenge; therefore no sooner the News of the Dutch landing arriv'd, but he sends his Emissary's to exasperate the Irish, by telling them that the English bad sent for the Dutch to cut off the King, and destroy the Ca∣tholicks throughout the three Kingdoms; so that in several places the Irish rose and destroyed se∣veral Families; the Deputy Issuing out at the same time, an Order to disarm all the Protestants; resolving that if matters miscaried bere in Eng∣land, to cut them all off, and set up fo himself,
aecording to the Sham-prophecy aforementioned. But the Earl of Grenard, a very Noble and Worthy Protestant, and one exceeding powerful in the North, where the chief of the English strength lies; hearing of this Order, went boldly to the Deputy, desiring to know if he had Order from the King to disarm the Protestants, and de∣siring to see it, was refus'd: whereupon he told his Lordship plainly, it should not be executed, if he could hinder it; and communicating presently the Design, to the rest of the Protestant Nobility and Gentry; then forthwith sent Intelligence to all parts, with Advice to stand in their own de∣fence to the utmost: which we hope, with some speedy Assistance from England, will preserve that Interest in the Kingdom, which the Prote∣stants with their Blood, have dearly bought. For this seasonable Intelligence, being well di∣gested, by the Nobility and Gentry of the English Interest; they presently importune the Earl of In∣chiqueen, to make an early provision against the
palpable, and now no longer doubted designs of the Irish; who thereupon immediatly summons his party, already, though privatly prep r'd for the business, so that in less than Ten days time, he had well nigh Eight Thousand Men, well ap∣pointed, and resolv'd to oppose the common E∣nemy: in the mean time the Lords Grenard and Mountjoy, were not idle in Dublin, in making parties, and securing the English Militia, or Trained-bands to their designs; not doubting that if they could secretly and seasonably seize the Lorà Tyrconnel, they might with very little effusion of Blood, secure the whole Kingdom; so that now there seem'd nothing wanting, but a good pretence to send away all, or most of the Army, remaining in, and about Dublin, nor could this be long wanting, considering the necessity of quelling the growth of Inchiqueens party; for matters being come to a head, and my Lord Mountjoy's Re∣giment being ordered to march towards the Ene∣my, before they were well got fifteen miles from
the City, the Militia at an hour appointed, rush unanimously into the Castle of Dublin, seizing immediatly all the Gates, Ports, Avenues and Guards; while the Lords Grenard and Mount∣joy (who upon some feigned pretence) staid a while behind his Regiment with others, laid hold on the Lord Tyrconnel, putting him immediat∣ly under a strong Guard; and leaving a sufficient number to keep the Castle and City: the Militia, with what additional Forces they could appoint, out of the Protestants, that came in voluntari∣ly to assist in the Business, made up a formidable Body, to resist the Irish; who upon the News, were coming back to the rescue of the Deputy; but perceiving such an unexpected number, ready to oppose them, they presently dispersed, so that the Castle and City were without much noise secured to the English, and the Lord Tyrconnel ready to be delivered into the Hands of Justice: the consequences of this Action are greater, than can readily be supposed; for beside the disabling that
pretence of Authority by which they might then seem justly to act, we have weakned the hopes and expectations of those who reposed on Tyrconnel as an Insallible power. So that with those For∣ces that are said to be raising in the North, by the Interest of the Lords Grenard, Mazarine, Mountjoy, and others; by the Lord Inchi∣queen, and the English Nobility and Gentry of Munster, and the Protestants in and about Dublin; It is not doubted, but by the help of God, that Kingdom may happily be relieved in a very short time, with as little loss of Blood, or otherwise, as England; which we hope and heartily pray for, &c. Printed in the year 1689.
