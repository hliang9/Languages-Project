A DECLARATION By JAMES Earl of CARLILE, LORD of the Caribee Islands, or Province of Carliola. Manifesting His care of, and affection to, the good and wel∣fare of the Inhabitants of the Island of BARBADOES, and of all other People under His Government. TO all Christian people to whom this present Writing shal concern, sendeth greet∣ing. Whereas divers people have been transported from the Kingdom of Eng∣land to my Island of Barbadoes in America, and have there remained a long time as Servants in great labour for the profits of other persons, upon whose Account they first were conveighed thither, expecting after their faithfull service, accord∣ing to the Covenants agreed upon at their first entrance, there to make some advantage to them∣selves by settling of Plantations for their own use, but by reason of the great number of people who repaired thither, and who by the blessing of God have multiplyed thee; the land is now so taken up as there is not any to be had but at great rates too high for the purchase of poor ser∣vants: In confideration hereof, and out of a hearty affection towards the wellfare and happi∣nesse of all such people as have left their native Countrey to settle under my Government in so Remote parts, I have thought fit to declare, that each freeman who is unprovided of land, & shall therefore desire to go off from the Barbadoes shall have a proportion of land alotted to him in my Islands of Nevis Antigua, or any other Island under my Command according to the Cu∣stome of the Countrey. And whereas Complants have been made concerning the miscarriages of some of my Governors, & of the oppressions of the people under their charge, I shall God willing suddenly repaire thither▪ and by my self, or Leivtenant Generall authorized by me, take such course as shall be for the ease and satisfaction of all parties, and for the settling of all my Islands in a peaceable and happie condition; and in particular, seeing my Island of Antigua is looked upon by divers knowing persons as a place of great concernment if it were well peopled, by reason of the convenience of Harbours which are wanting in my other Islands, I shall take care for a constant supply of ships twice every yeer, to bring Provision from England thither, and to take of the Commodities of the Countrey there: & because divers factious people have of late endeavored to estrange the affections of the Inhabitants of my Islands from me, and to suggest intentions of disignes by me to their prejudice: I do hereby solemnly professe, That the honour and glory of God, and the promoting of his worship and service, according to the established Lawes of the Kingdome of England have the first place in my thoughts, and I do as earnestly desire the happinesse of those people under my charge as of my self, and shall not any way endeavour the advantage of my own interest further then may conduce to the settling of such differences as have already been raised: And the removing of all doubts, scruples, and jealousies, which hereafter may arise betwixt us. Given under our hand and Seale, at London this 22 day of November Anno Dom. 1647.
