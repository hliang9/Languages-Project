THE Established Test, In order to the Security of HIS MAJESTIES Sacred Person, AND GOVERNMENT, AND THE Protestant Religion. AGAINST The Malitious Attempts and Treason∣able Machinations of ROME.

THE Establisht Test. WHAT a Tempest should we have had, if this Black Italian Cloud had bro∣ken over our Heads? Never was Hurricane so double charged, with Death and Destruction: It would certainly have Rain'd Fire and Fag∣gots, and all Instruments of Cruelty, upon the In∣nocent Heads of Poor Protestants. But GOD have the Praise, That we are in hopes to see it not only Blow over, but that the Storm is likely to fall up∣on the Heads that raised it. Some of these treache∣rous Dealers, who have dealt so very treacherously with us, are already fallen into the Pit which they had digged for Others, and are ensnared in the mis∣chievous
Works of their own Hands; and it is to be hoped for the Rest, That their violent dealing will fall upon their own Heads; for He who is Truth it self, in whom we trust, whose we are, and whom we serve, has assured us, That Wicked and Bloodthirsty Men, shall not live out half their Dayes; for he who is the God of all Mercy, abhors the cruel and decoitful Man. In a Concern of so common and universal Near∣ness, I cannot conceive any Person so little or incon∣siderable in a Nation, but since he must participate and have a share in the common Happiness or Mis∣fortunes that shall happen; he must also have a Right, if not a Duty, to endeavor to do what service he can to the Publique: Every Mans Oar may, and ought to be in the Boat, to preserve her from sinking; and though possibly I may value my endeavors in this little Scrole, as cheap as any can desire, yet the good Intention of it being the only thing that can give it a Recommendation, that may also procure it Par∣don; and if it be demanded why I write? 'tis an∣swered, Not to increase the Croud of Pamphlets, which at such Times fly about the Streets like Chaff before the Wind; so that one is obliged to take some Pains to find the Wheat; which some able and industrious Hands have winnowed from the Dross; but it is perfectly out of Charity, and for the Information of such who will not be at a greater Charge than such a Trifle. And therefore I do not pretend to Instruct the great Managers of the Affairs of State; or to meddle with the Needle and Com∣pass of the Publique Bottom; 'tis dangerous med∣ling with the Helm of State, even sometimes for the
Publique Pilots; I am no Dictator of Politicks, or Pretender to give Unerring Rules for our future Settlement, or present Security; but a Plain, Ho∣nest, Well-meaning Englishman, who heartily Honor my Prince, Love my Church, and Wish well to my fellow Subjects. And to manifest that I am so, I will endeavor in short to shew to those of my own Sphere, the com∣mon Danger under which we lie, whil'st we are in∣fested with these concealled Semenaries and Jesuites; the probable Way to Detect and Discover them, notwithstanding their Protean Faculties of Dissimu∣lation, Perjury, and Putting on so many Shapes; and the great Interest that every Man has, to do his ut∣most, to clear the Nation of such Secret Scorpions, as Poyson both Mens Souls and Bodies. It is in vain for us to hope to be free from Earth∣quakes and Convulsions of State so long as these Men of Tempestuous Principles are continually ma∣king their Fireworks in our very Intrals; the Pa∣pacy is fitly resembled by the dreadful Aetna, or Vesuvius, which take Trace sometimes with the neighbouring Plains for many Years; but when the sulphurious Mass of their Intrals, is recruited, then do they break out in horrid Flames, to the terror of the Country round for many Leagues; which they ruine and cover with barren Pamites and Ashes; thus will the Romanists when one of their Plots is dico∣vered and prevented, give us a little breathing; not out of any Charity to us, or Remorse in their own Consciences, but to make us more secure till another Design is ripe for Execution: We have often through
Gods goodness escaped their treacherous Mines, even when they were ready to Play; but who is able to say, We shall always be saved by Miracles? if the Red Sea be divided for our sakes, we must walk through it; if we will escape to a Shoar or Safety, something we must do, and endeavor to promote our own Peace, Safety, and Security. It cannot be doubted, but the Roman Dragon has been and ever will be industrious and vigilant to regain this Hesperian Garden of England, which in times past was wont to yield him such Plenty of Gol∣den Fruit, that one of the Popes was used to say, That England was Putens inexhaustus, A Spring of Treasure, which could never be drawn dry; and if the Italian Gulph, which they Term the Apostolick Chamber could not do it, he had some reason to say as he did. We need not give our selves much pain, to trace this Leviathan the crooked Serpent, in all his windings and turnings, by which he has endea∣vour'd, to wrap and embrace us again in his painted, but mortal Folds: There has past no Princes Reign since the Reformation, but what has been plagued with the pernicious Counsels, or mischeivous Strata∣gems of these Sons of Matchiavel: and they have all ways been endeavouring either by open Cruelty, or secret Conspiracies, to re-establish the Roman Ty∣ranny among us. To these inveterate Enemies of our Peace, were our Ancestors obliged for all the Treasons and the Wars of Queen Elizabeths Reign: Catena, who writ the Life of Pope Pius the Fifth, gives a full Narra∣tive of the secret Counsels of that Pope and the King
of Spain, and attributes all those consequent Trou∣bles in England and Ireland, to the warm Zeal of that Pope, to restore us to the Catholique Faith. To these we owe, that most barbarous, hellish, and detestable Design of the Gunpowder Treason, in the beginning of King James his Reign over Eng∣land. But that upon which they had grounded so much confidence, and which they intended should be one deciding Blow for all, proving an Abortive Monster; and the long-fancied Monarchy of the West, to which the ambitious Spaniard had made so many years court in vain, coming to decline into a mighty Nothing; and that Nation having little left of all their aspiring Graspings after Em∣pire, besides the Pride that too commonly attends it; there was a necessity of changing the measures of their Policy. For Spain being by the help of the Inquisition, the Cruelties of the Duke d' Alva, and the Assistance of the English, dismembred of so great a Strength as the seven Maritine Provinces of the Neather∣lands; and the fatal Eighty Eight having clipt her Pinions of Power at Sea; Portugal revolting to the Family of Braganza; they judged, that even Hope of Assistance from so crazie, maimed, and dis∣jointed a Crown, was a vain Impossibility. France was full of Civil Broils, occasioned by the Preten∣sions of the House of Guise, and the Princes of the Blood to the Regency, during the Minority of Francis the Second, and Charles the Ninth; and in danger of becoming totally Hugonot it self, had not
the Bloody Vespers of St. Bartholomew in the Year 1572. by the Parisian Massacre, as they thought, let out the most dangerous and Feavourish Prote∣stant Blood in the Body; and after that, had it not been rescued from that danger in the Head, by the more than Roman, the Roman Catholique cou∣rages of Clement and Ravilliac, by whose Assassi∣nating Hands the Two Henries, the Third and Fourth fell; so that little hope of help was to be expected from that Quarter, to regain England to Obedience to the Catholique Faith of Rome. Germany was at too great a distance, and too much Lutheran, and compo∣sed of too many jarring and perpetually jealous Inte∣rests, to expect any Succour from Ratisbonne; nor was it well able to defend it self from the furious Shock of the Warlike Gustavus King of Sweden; who in probability had he lived any considerable time, would have made good the Anagram of his Name, and changed it to Augustus. These Circumstances of Affairs, and the posture in which Europe then stood, obliged the Sons of limping Loyola, to put off the Lyons Skin, and be∣gin to play the Fox; and to try if Art, and Arti∣fice would not repair what their unsuccessful Trea∣sons and improsperous Arms had in vain attempted. And now the After-game they had to play for so great a Stake, was to be managed with their most refined Skill: from henceforward Divide & Impera must be the Word; the secret Spring that must move the mighty Machine, by which they were to com∣pleat our overthrow. All their Arts were used to sow Dissentions, Sects, Schisms, Fears and Jealou∣sies
among us; and by pretending a danger and fear of Popery, really to make the way easie to intro∣duce it. The first crop which they reaped, and the early Earnest of their future Harvest, was the loss of the Palatinate, by which the Protestant In∣terest in Germany sustained a most dangerous Blow, and the Catholique received a considerable accession both of Power and Proselytes: for by this time, they had so infected England with Fears and Jealousies, that King James could not get a Parliament to part with a Penny of Money for the Relief of his Son-in-Law the Elector, unless he would pawn his Crown and Prerogative for it. Nor could his Suc∣cessor King Charles do any thing towards Resetling that unfortunate Prince in his rightful Inheritance; nor in conclusion to preserve his own. Flusht with this lucky Hit, and the succeeding loss of Rochel, they now resolve closely to follow the Blow, and pursue their point; and by making the Popish Party in England appear good and loyal Subjects, zealous for the Crown, and opposite to the Factious of the several Sects, they were resolved by this one Artifice to ruine the Heretiques, by their own Divisions: for by this means the Papists began to appear quiet and innocent, and not only so, but Loyal Subjects and Friends to the Crown: this they knew would disarm the Penal Laws in force against them, of their usual severity; and that would at once increase the number of their own Proselytes, and that of Dissenters too; and whilst many were recalled whom the fear of Persecution had stagger∣ed from the Romish Religion, the Indulgence which
was shewn them, gave such Apprehensions and A∣larms of the growth and fear of Popery, that it aug∣mented the number of Dissenters, and gave a co∣lourable pretext to the Factions and Disloyal among them to manage their Designs with the greater fa∣cility. For this unmerited Clemency of our Princes, na∣turally tender of the Lives and Fortunes of their Subjects, so long as they saw no appearance from them, but of Innocence, Kindness and Loyalty; they constantly perverted to this ingrateful use, se∣cretly to instil a Jealousie into the Minds of their Protestant Subjects, of their dis-affection to the Pro∣testant Religion: insinuating that the Suspension of the Penal Laws in force against Roman Catholiques, was the effect of the Princes inclination to Popery. Now the Court was certainly making a tack towards the Coast of Italy, and it would not be long be∣fore they came to an Anchor in Tyber: for what could make it more clear and manifest, than the Kindness, as well as Indulgence which was shewn to those of that Perswasion? This deadly Poison, thus sweetned and guilded over, went down with the Querulous and Credulous Multitude of dissent∣ing Protestants, and was not a little forwarded by those Factious and Discontented Promoters of the late Rebellion, as the most serviceable Engine, to batter down both the Crown and the Church. What unconceiveable pleasure was it now for these con∣cealed Romanists, to stand behind the Scene, and prompt both Parties, to Act the bloody Tragedy which they had composed? Without all doubt,
this intoxicating Jealousie, made great Numbers of innocent and undeserving Persons stagger into the other Extream; and the extraordinary fears and cry of Popery, drive Men so far from that, that at last by the violence of the increasing Storm, they threw over-board all their Loyalty, and in a manner all Religion. Had not that great Man Archbishop Laud, been one of the Jonahs that was first heaved over the Decks to allay the Tempest, we had certainly had then a full discovery of the whole Design; as most fully appears by the Letters now lately Printed of Sir William Boswell,The ground Design of the Papists in the Reign of King Charles the First, &c. the English Ambassador in Hol∣land, to the Archbishop, Andreas ab Habernfeilds, the Archbishops to the King, and his Majesties An∣swer; together with a particular of the whole De∣sign of the Papists, who are therein by Name men∣tioned, to ruine the King and Archbishop, and with them the Church and State by Civil Wars, which were begun by their contrivance in Scotland. But it was too much the Interest both of the Papists and Rebels, to suppress those Papers, and the further discovery of those Designs by his hasty death; for had he lived to compleat the Discovery, all the After-game of both Parties, had been counter-plot∣ted; and though possibly the Rebels knew nothing of the Design till after his death, and that his Pa∣pers fell into their hands; yet, then they were too far imbarqued in the Civil Wars, to sound a Re∣treat, and to proclaim themselves Murtherers, for taking away the Archbishop as a Papist, whose Inno∣cence would thereby have been fully vindicated,
and their Guilt made notorious, to the ruine of all their Esteem with the People, and the utter confu∣sion of their Ambitious Design of Soveraignty, and erecting a Commonwealth upon the Ruines of the Monarchy. So that nothing can be more clear and evident than this; That from the subtil Practices of the Je∣suites, those Diversities in Opinion, and Differences in Practice among Protestants, received their En∣couragement, if not their Rise and Original: and while every new Sect pretended still to out-do others in the Purity of Reformation, and a further escape from the Superstition of the Romish Babylon, they were all made Instrumental to undo the Pro∣testant Religion; and a thorough Reformation be∣came the Apple of Contention between the Prince and the People: the King was accused of favour∣ing Popery, and designing to introduce it; and with it, Arbitrary Tyranny, the Natural Child of that Religion, because he would not comply with the Zealous Fury of some Popular Spirits, to throw down the Hierarchy of the Church; which is one of the Fundamental Pillars of our Government. The other by their disobedience to the known and Establisht Laws of Church and State, became guilty of Disloyalty, and were not without just cause sus∣pected of Dangerous and Treasonable Designs against the Royal Person and Government, which they did endeavour to conceal under the specious pretences, and taking shews of Zeal against Popery, and eager forwardness to promote the pretended Reformation.
Thus did these subtile Foxes, like Sampsons, while their Heads lookt several ways, carry those Fire∣brands between their Tails, with which they set us all at last into a Flame; continually fanning with their pestilent Breath, those Jealousies and mutual Animosities, between the Soveraign and his Subjects, till they had reduced three of the most potent and flourishing Kingdoms in Europe into Ashes, and had fill'd us with Blood and Confusion. Thus far they had succeeded in their Enterprise, that they had ab∣solutely ruin'd the Monarchy, and pull'd down the old Cathedral, without Establishing, or so much as ever intending, so far as any body could conje∣cture, any Church at all; and while in Policy they tolerated all Religions, they fairly opened a way for us to have none at all; and which was the thing the Jesuites aimed at, to work us from our own Divisions to destroy one another, and at last, either by Force or Policy, to reduce us to the Ʋnity of the Roman Church: And doubtless they were in hopes in a little time to have accomplished this great Design; when unexpected Providence, what by the Peoples general weariness of the Tyranny of those many Governments, and by the Loyalty of the Re∣mainders of the Church of England, whom no Cru∣elty nor Oppression could remove from their firm Principles of Allegiance; brought back with the ge∣neral Joy of the People, their long Desire, our Ba∣nished Soveraign, Restoring Him miraculously to a Peaceful Throne; and with Him, Restoring to these Languishing Nations their Antient Government and Laws, their long-wanted Liberty, and Religion.
Now were the Roman Conspirators at a loss again, seeing their hopes defeated, and their expectations gone; and therefore encouraged by former Suc∣cesses and Experience, they begun to play their old Lessons over again; and we had scarcely taken breath after our violent Revolutions, when they be∣gan again to trouble our calm Waters, that so they might fish with more advantage: But by the Loylty of the Parliament, and Vigilance of the Ministers of State, that being like to prove a Work of too long time for Men of so much impatience; and though they had made so great a progress as to raise some Disorders in Scotland, for which two of them were under the disguise of Presbyterians executed there; yet the generality of the English were too sensible of the goodness of their present Condition, and sufficiently instructed in the Calamities of a late Civil War, to enter into a second; and above all, this great City manifesting upon all occasions great Testimonies of their Loyalty and Fidelity to His Ma∣jesty and the Government, they were forced upon new▪ and more precipitate Counsels. How they have managed their Affairs, and with what cruelty they had laid their Designs, is by the Goodness of God already in a great measure, and it is to be hoped will be fully discovered; it was in short a Design against His Majesties Sacred Person, and the Government, our Laws, Lives, Liberties, and the Protestant Religion; a Design as univer∣sally laid, as it was to have been tragically execu∣ted: The present Race of our Kings, were either to have been wholly extirpated, or become vile
Tributaries to the Triple Mitre. One would think it impossible that such barbarous and savage Actions should proceed from any of Human Race; or that there would be found any, who have so far lost the Native Generosity of Englishmen, which in the Times of the Papal Monarchy, durst bid defiance to his Encroachments, as to prostitute the Imperial Crown of these Realms to Vassallage and Slave∣ry. A stolen smile will part from me, to think how all this while these Purblind Conspirators could not see how short an Enjoyment they, and their great Three Crown'd Master, must have had of the bloody Spoils of England. There is a certain great Neighbor of theirs, who has told a Pope, That he does not va∣lue his Witness the Column erected at Rome in dis∣grace of the Pope, for a Petty Af∣font offer∣ed his Am∣bassador tere.Holiness at a Farthing; and who would certainly have made the Moral of old Aesop's Fable good upon them; the Lion, Fox, and Bear, had made a Hunting Match; the Fox and Bear, Subtilty and Cruelty took the Prey; but the Lyon, as most pow∣erful, challenged it wholly for himself, and had it without a Murmur from his fellow Hunters, who were glad at that rate to compound with his armed Paws, for the security of their own Skins. I canot believe, but that the whole World will entertain this discovery with Horror; and though the Jesuits will with the greatest Effrontery deny, or mitigate it, yet certainly their Religion will receive the Blow which they intended for ours: for who that is not resolved to quit Humnity it self, can be∣lieve that Religion to be true, which is to be propaga∣ted with Treasons, Murders of the most Purple-dye,
violation of all that is Sacred in Human Society, Law, Justice, Equity, the most Solemn Oaths, Promises, and Covenants? Who can believe the Pope the Suc∣cessor of St. Peter in Faith and Doctrine, when he shall under his most Authentique Hand and Seal, Absolve the Subjects of any Prince from their Natu∣ral, Civil, and Religious Allegeance to their Lawful Soveraign; when he shall grant Pardons to whoso∣ever shall Murder him, and dispence with all the Oaths that have been, or can be taken, to secure the Royal Person, or the Government by Law esta∣blished? Nero that Monster of Nature, from whom he claims a Succession at least of Practice, set Rome on fire, slew his Friends, made Cruelty his diver∣tisement, and became a Parricide out of Curiosity, Ripping up his Mothers Belly, that he might see the Nest that had brought that Viper into the World. Flaming London is a witness that the second Rome can equal, if not exceed the First; and the Pope scorns to come behind Nero, since he can Command, Authorize, and Pardon the Murder of those who are the common Parents of our Country; and more than that, who wear the Sacred Character of the Eternal Majesty, being Gods to Men, though but Men to GOD. How God Almighty does and will resent this Af∣front and Indignity put upon him by this Usupa∣tion upon Heaven and Earth, is in some measure vi∣sible already; and 'tis to be hoped, will yet be more, to the Shame and Confusion of such pretended Ca∣tholick Religion, but real Atheism, and most Diabo∣lical Impiety; and how far the rest of the Crown∣ed
Heads of Europe, will by this example become sensible of their own danger, and the common in∣jury herein offered to all the Royal Masters of the Ʋniverse I cannot tell, but Cum proximus Ardet Ʋta∣legon; When their Neighbors House is threatned to be fired over his Head, it is time for them o look about them: No Prince can live in security, so long as there is Poison, Pistol, or Ponyard in the hands of such Desperadoes, as not valuing their own are, for the Interest of the Catholick Religion, Masters of other Mens Lives; so long as the Pope may for Heresie Arraign, Condemn, Excommunicate, Depose, and Deprive Soveraign Kings in the Consistory, and Arm both their own, and the Subjects of Foreign Nations against them; gives his Benediction, with Rewards and Promises both of Heaven and Earth, to take away the lives of the Heirs, that so he may seize upon the Inheritance; and so long as he chal∣lenges to himself the boundless Prerogative of being the Sole and Supreme Judge of what is Heresie, and by virtue of that ower, may define whatsoever is contrary to his Grandeur and Interest, to be that damnable and Capital Sin. But this is not our Concern, our Neighbors may do as they shall please themselves, and Nurse this Mitre till it shall devour the Crown; we have some∣thing nearer home to employ our thoughts, consi∣derations, and most industrious endeavors upon; and with that Charity which begins at home, to take care how we may secure our selves. That all Degrees, Ranks and Conditions of Men, are possessed with a real detestation and abhorrence
of such a villanous design, there can be no reason to make a doubt; their own Interest will oblige them to it; had the Net of this great Roman Fisher∣man been drawn up upon us, all had been Fish that had come to the Net, all would have been involved in the common Calamity; for had the Mischief been formed into perfect Monster, had it come to its growth and strength, all Sorts and Degrees of Men, with∣out difference or distinction, who would not have abandoned the Protestant Religion, and submitted to the Roman Yoak, must have fallen as Sacrifices if not to their Religion, yet to that Policy which necessarily attends Cruelty and Usurpation, the Deities which now the Romans worship. Nor could these ambitious Zealots, have ever believed their unjust Dominion sufficiently secured from the danger of future Relapses, but by the intire destru∣ction of all those, whom they could not trust, or might either suspect or fear, & by seizing their Estates, to enable themselves with Force and Arbitrary Pow∣er and Tyranny to take away the Liberties and Op∣portunities of opposing them, from such as they must permit to survive the general Massacre; that so they might be out of fear from those whom they intend∣ed to make, and treat like Slaves. Had the Royal Oak fallen under their treacherous designs, what favour or mercy, could either the lofty Cedars, or the humble Shrubs and Plebeians of the Wood have expected from their hands? They who were grown so hardned in Mischief, to attempt first upon the Scepter, would never in their Consciences have scrupled at the Sheephook: They
who could not blush to shed the Blood of the So∣vereign, would never have disputed to let out whole Rivers of the Subjects. If this had been the Project of a few Zealous Re∣cluses, or managed by the hot Brains of some Sha∣ven Heads; or had it been the undertaking of some few Discontented Laicks, there might have been some colour of excuse for the Religion in general, there being ill Men of all Religions, and even a∣mong those who profess the Truest: When there were but Twelve Apostles, one of them was a Devil, a Traitor, and covetous Murderer: But when He, who stiles himself the Vicar of Christ, the Successor of St. Peter and St. Paul, the Infallible Head of the Catho∣lique Church, who cannot Err from the True Faith, the Supreme Judge of Controversies, the Keeper of the Keyes of Heaven and Earth, Hell and Purgato∣ry, when he shall be the Principal Instigator, Pro∣moter and Encourager of Murder, Ʋsurpation, Trea∣son, and Rebellion, sure no Man can believe, but that either the Faith of Rome is not the Catholique Faith, or that the Church of Rome, if this be her Faith, is no true part of the Catholique Church. For if we may Judge of the Tree by the Fruits, such horrid and infamous Practices, seem to make the Pope ap∣pear, the Successor of Iscariot, who betray'd his Ma∣ster to be Crucified, rather then of St. Peter, who was himself Crucified for Planting and Propagating the Faith of Christ by Rules of Meekness, Tenderness, Love to all Men, and particular obedience to Kings as Supreme, and to Magistrates as Gods Vicegerents and Ministers of Justice upon Earth; and indeed,
whoever shall consider these Actions of the Pope and the Jesuits, will think them to be expected only from the fierce Cannibals of the West Indies, who have neither Morality, Law, nor Religion; and not from those who stile themselves the Pillar and Ground of Truth, the only Professors of the true Faith and Religion. It is certainly therefore the interest of every Man who is not a Papist, and I doubt not the wishes and desires of all Men, to be secured from the attempts of such inhumane and cruel Men, who would make no more difficulty to cut the Throat of a Heretique Protestant, than to dash out the Brains of a Mad Dog; and above all the rest of England, it is the more particular concern of this great and populous City of London to be secured from them: Her-pre∣sent Glory may be a sad Testimony of their infa∣mous Treachery, and hellish Malice; Her Beauty is raised upon those Ashes to which they had reduced her, one of them confessed and died for it; and in which we have reason to think they designed to bury her for ever: the damp, that he put upon her in her present Trade, which is deservedly the ge∣neral complaint, is from their Practices; and that insecurity in which we live to fall into the hands of these merciless Assassinates, makes Mens lives un∣easie, their dayes unquiet, and their nights tedious, and both expensive, beyond the proportion of their present Trade, whil'st they are obliged by such strong and constant Guards, to purchase their se∣curity at the expence of their Mony, Time and Health. That His Most Sacred Majesty, and the Honou∣rable
Houses of Parliament are Assiduous and In∣tent, both to discover and punish the Authors of these Treasons and Mischiefs, is obvious to all Men; that they will take all the care that mortal Men can do, both to secure us for the present, and establish us for the future upon the best Foundations of a lasting Safety, no person can doubt: But when they have done their part to the utmost; when they have wound up their Justice and their Counsels to the highest pitch of Wisdom; when they have made the Fence of the Laws impregnable in all appearance; yet unless every Subject in his Place, will contri∣bute something towards the common Security, these pernicious Foxes will either lurk undiscover'd a∣mong us, or creep through and escape the hands of Justice, though it pursue them never so close∣ly. For if we can suppose the strongest Bonds of Oaths of Allegeance, Supremacy, Tests, Abrenunciati∣ons, Declarations, or what Human Wisdom can de∣vise; let the words be as plain and perspicuous as the Beams of Day; let all the care imaginable be taken to obviate them in their Equivocations, Mental Reservations and Evasions; let them declare that they believe that the Pope has no Power to Absolve them; or that such Oaths are not null and void from the beginning, because there was not Bona fides ab initio: All this will not be sufficient; for the most Crimi∣nal among the Papists will be the least scrupulous of any Oath that shall be tendred to them; nor will think this Perjury, or if it be, will they therefore decline it, so long as they are before-hand armed
with an Antidote from Rome, which can expel all the Poison and the danger of such Oaths, and not only so, but render them meritorious, as being part of the Persecution which they suffer from Heretiques, in defence of the Catholique Religion; and they who fear the Pope more than God, and believe that he has power to remit all Sins of this Nature, if they esteem them Sins, will think themselves secure from the stroak of Divine Vengeance due to perjured Heads; and which is all they have to look too, they imagine themselves hereby sure to escape the danger and severity of Human Laws. And thus eluding the Tryal and Discrimination of an Oath, they will securely enjoy their Lives and Liberties, and remain Masters of all the Opportu∣nities of still contriving, and managing their mis∣chievous Counsels, and Treasonable Attempts: For this we are to assure our selves, that so long as they can escape the danger of punishment, they will ne∣ver give over the Enterprise. And though God Al∣mighty may not permit them to run to the full ex∣tent of their Malice, which terminates in nothing short of our utter Ruine, the Subversion of the Go∣vernment, and Extirpation of the very Name and Religion of the Protestants; yet will they give us many Disturbances as to our Peace and Quiet, and be able to do us many private Mischiefs, both at home and abroad: for they are a Generation of Men too learnedly malicious, and too well acquaint∣ed with the Italian Genius of Matchiavel, and Caesar Borgia, not to be able to do us all possible Injuries; and they are too inveterate not to be feared at all
times; but more especially when they either flatter us, or seem asleep, and not to regard us. Manet altâ mente repostum; The hatred and animosity which they bear us, is successive and eternal; the Quarrel is Immortal, and made an Intail like that of Hannibals against Rome; the old rigid Carthagi∣nian his Father swore him before the Altars of his Country Gods, that he should be perpetuus Romani nominis Osor, and to espouse an Eternal hatred of the very Roman Name; nor need we much doubt but they have taken the same Oath before their Al∣tars, to hate the Name of Protestant. Not all the Clemency, Indulgence, or Humanity that can be shewn them, is capable of taming this bequeathed Fierceness against us; and let poor Protestants treat them with all the Christian meekness, temper, and compassion, as becomes the noble profession of their innocent and Heavenly Religion; they will upon the first opportunity, repay them with the blackest ingratitude, and most incompassionate Cruelty; two Crimes, which cannot be outdone by all the Vices of Nature and of Hell. That these men have been the great Masters who have improved all our Dissentions, few judicious and observing People have for many years doubted, and it is now apparent from the Voluntary Confessi∣on, of those who have had sufficient Reason to know Mr. Oats and Mr. Bedow. and whoever Considers how much it was their In∣terest to dash us one against another and so to break us in pieces, and what large advantages they have made of our mutual discords; to what Extremities by this single Artifice they had reduced us; while
with our own Swords, we did all we could, and almost all they could desire of us to undo our selves, and ruine both the Reputation and Prote∣stant Cause it self; I say, whoever will bring these things together, will be easily induced to believe, that they have been the prime Actors in, as well as contrivers of our Divisions. Thus did we give them opportunity to enter among us with secu∣rity; and while, as the late dying Archbishop Laud in his Speech upon the Scaffold prophetically ob∣served, the Cry of Veniunt Romani the Romans are coming in upon us, went among a Credulous and abused People, these very Romans whom we so much feared, under other names came in reality upon us, and had almost taken away our Place, &c. Nation. Thus did we furnish them with Conveniency and Arguments to gain Proselytes to their boasted Ʋnity, while they in return, furnisht us with mutual Animosities, Jealousies, and Arms to destroy our selves. Nor is this the onely fruit which they have al∣ready reaped, and do hope still to reap from those Seeds of Discord which they have sown, and so in∣dustriously cultivated among us: Here likewise they post themselves as in a wood, and lie in Ambuscade, ready to annoy us; and in the mean time remain secure from being attaqued themselves, or so much as known or discovered; and being able to trans∣form themselves into any shape, like Highwaymen who have committed Murder and Robbery, 'tis but turning the Coat and changing the Peruque, and they face and laugh at the Hue and Cry which does pursue them.
How dangerous their Company is in this Town, several tragical Examples have lately convinced us; nor can we be secure from Fire, Sword, and Poi∣son, so long as these Mortal Enemies Lodge within us. Now it is morally impossible, and they know it, and for that very purpose have been so very in∣dustrious to promote our divisions, I say it is im∣possible so long as those continue, either to disco∣ver them, or get quit of them; since when they find themselves closely hunted by the Laws, they will undoubtedly Herd with some Sect or other and so Escape. His Majesty by his Proclamation has commanded all Papists who are not Householders, Travellers, &c. to depart from this his Imperial City: but who believes that there are not great numbers of them, and Jesuits and Priests especially still in Town? and in probability, those who are most guilty, and most desperate: for here in the Crowd they think them∣selves secure, which they could not hope to be in the Country, where the Jealous peasants, not ac∣quainted with any but their fellow Cottagers, are all in an uproar at the sight of a strange face, and read Firebals and Treason in his very Countenance; and therefore will not fail to carry him before his Worship the next Justice of the Peace; and the Ju∣stice for his own security is bound to secure such persons as appear suspitious, unless they can give a very good account ot themselves. Whereas here in Town, a Priest or Jesuit takes a Lodging at a Quakers, can thou and thee, and yea and nay, as well as the best of them; goes to the Silent meeting with
his Landlord, and it may be upon occasion, if the Spirit moves, he can disgorge himself against the Priests of Baal, the Hirelings; the burden of Tithes, the uselesness of humane Learning, he can talk of the light within him, and the witness of God, and vili∣fie the Scriptures as a dead and carnal Letter; and such Common-places of discourse as are grateful to the People; and so he passes for one of their Friends. Our Jesuit incognito passing thus under the Masque of a Sectary, the Constables of the Parish, as is their duty, and pursuant to the publick Or∣ders for the Common security, come to my Neigh∣bour the Quakers to know what Lodgers he has in his house; he straight informs them such a person, and gives in the false name by which he goes; they inquire what he is? he tells them he is one of their Friends who has lodged there so long; the Officers it may be only in drollery tell him they sus∣pect he is a Priest of the Roman Church; Nay verily that he is sure he is not, for he hates the Beast and the Scarlet Whore, he has heard him say so, in the Meeting. Well! the Lodger himself, it may be if within, is so confident as to face the Officers, who tell him he must take the Oath of Obedience; Nay, replies he, Friends, I cannot swear, the light with∣in me witnesses to the truth, which says, Swear not at all, but let your Yea be Yea, and Nay Nay, and be∣gins an Harangue against all Oaths. The Officers imposed upon as well as the Good man of the House, by the fineness of the stratagem, leave him, onely entring his borrowed name in the List, without
suspition that he is a Papist, and much less, a Priest or Jesuit. Thus does he scape Scot-free, and is at liberty; and when in a place remote from his quar∣ter, he rendezvouzes with his fellow adventurers in Masquerade, they laugh at all the World; and in de∣spight of all Laws and the strictest search, as if they had King Gyges his enchanted Ring, they walk in∣visible and secure; and want neither freedom, nor opportunity, to contrive, carry on, and execute their horrible designs, of firing our City; assassina∣ting such as are active in opposing them; endanger∣ing as much as ever the Royal Person, the Govern∣ment, and Religion. I do not particularize in this Sect, as the onely shelter or secure harbor for these Popish Conspirators, though it may be, their esteeming all Oaths unlaw∣ful, their deriding and disusing the holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper, their Contempt of the Scripture, their state of perfection in this life, and several o∣ther of their Tenets, so agreable to the Romish Do∣ctrines and designs, qualifie them more then many others to be deceived by the Jesuits, and are more proper to afford them shelter and security. Not that this will excuse any other Sects from the same danger; and I see no reason why we should not suspect, that several stickling Itinerant Teachers, who travel as Apostles among the Independents, Ana∣baptists, &c. may not as well be Jesuits under these disguises, as those two Executed in Scotland, who went under the Notion and Character of Presbyteri∣ans; who yet, as Mr, Oats has deposed, had their Commissions to Preach Sedition and Rebellion, from
the Rector of the English Colledge of Jesuits at Do∣way, and he from the Pope. The is no question but a Jesuit can put on any dress of Religion, to serve the Interest of the Catho∣lique Cause, and will not scruple to take up the pa∣tronage even of the good old Cause, and appear an eager Separatist in any shape, the better to accomo∣date himself with a Capacity of promoting our Ruine by our dissentions and divisions: this gives him a certain opportunity to unhinge people from their Allegiance to the Crown and Obedience to the Esta∣blished Order and Government of the Church, the two butts against which he levels all the arrows of his poisoned quiver: and all the while he seems so fierce against Popery, and Ceremonies, he gains one point more of the Compass by which he sails, which it is pass undiscovered, and under that disguise to help to blow up the Coals of misunderstandings, Jealousies, and Animosities, between the King and his Subjects; with which at last he hopes to set them into a blaze, and to warm his own hands at the fire which shall consume them. And to further this design, it is to be known that a Jesuit can be of any quality, Trade or profession, a Gentleman, a Merchant, a Lawyer, a Solicitor, a what you please: for the Romish Janizaries are the tribute Children of all Europe, of the most pregnant Genius and universal Capacity that can be gleaned up in any Schools; and these besides their Learn∣ing in which they are trained up suitably to their Inclinations, are also instructed in all such arts, as may accomplish them, and render them agreable in
conversation to all sorts of people; and in order to their being serviceable to their Concealment. Who would have believed Mr Price, Steward to my Lord Marquess of Worcester to have been such an eminent Jesuit, as to merit the Character of one of the most ingenious and wisest men in orders in the World? in all companies he passed for an ingenious man and a Virtuoso, and I have heard a worthy Gen∣tleman and famous Lawyer say, he thought he was one of the ablest Solicitors in England; but he, as well as others were, I dare be confident far from suspecting him to be what he is now charged with, or the wise man upon whom the Conspirators so much relied for his Counsels and Conduct of their late Hellish Conjuration? and in such a crowd of peo∣ple of all sorts as inhabit this Spatious City, and over grown Suburbs, how easie a thing is it for great num∣bers of them to settle themselves as Inhabitants, espe∣cially the secular Jesuits, who apply themselves to Civil affairs, as Factors and Merchants Trading to Foreign parts? and how impossible is it to discover them to be what they are, detestable Conspirators who maintain a secret Correspondence with all Courts of the Roman Religion to our prejudice, and principally with the Court of Rome, so long as they publickly own themselves to be of some sect or o∣ther, and pass under the Characters of Presbyterians, Independants, Anabaptists, or any thing but of the Church of England: for that is their mortal hatred; that, is what they do above all things covet to destroy; as being the frontier and Bastion of the Protestant Religion: and could they intirely ruine
that, which is the thing they labor for night and day, with all the application imaginable, velis & remis, tooth and nail, and for the accomplishment of which great work they transform themselves into se∣cure these various disguises, they make themselves se∣cure of the Rest; whom they would play at one another, till they worried and devour themselves; and at last, fall an easie Conquest to the Roman Mi∣tre. Whoever he was that writ that discovery made to the late King and Archbishop Land, he assures us that of the four Orders, of Ecclesiasticks, Politicks, Se∣culars, and Intelligencers, scarcely all Italy, Spain, and France, afforded so great a number of Jesuits, as the City of London then did, and that there were more than fifty Scottish Jesuits then, who had con∣spired against the King and Government, by raising a Civil War among us: and we have no reason to be∣lieve that their numbers are lessened, when their con∣veniencies are increased. Under these disguises they do more effectually carry on their wicked designs of keeping up and increasing our disorders and di∣visions; for it is the close Cabal that does the mischief; and poisons the Common people of any Sect with principles of disloyalty and faction; when they are under the Rose then do they vomit out all they can to enrage people against the Government both in Church and Stale: whereas the publick discourses of most dissenters, either out of Ingenuity or fear of punishment, are managed with more Caution, and less violence.
I am not so vain as to believe, that these Truths or at least dangerous probabilities should gain in∣tire Credit even with those whom they do so near∣ly concern; I am but too sensible that the impressi∣ons which some men have received into their minds, are so firmly rivetted into their belief, that they will not be perswaded to abandon them, though that be they only probable way to establish their own, and the Common safety and security of our Nation, one may almost with the same ease remove Black-heath, as perswade some people that they are secretly man∣aged by Romish Priests and Jesuits; that they are accessory to the dangers of introducing Popery; or that they secure them from discovery, and that pu∣nishment which in the opinion of all men they have justly merited. But certainly they who wish well to their Native Country; to the publick peace and security of the Nation; to their own lives, Liberty, Property, or Posterity; if they will act according to the natural principle of self-preservation, or the Dictates either of Law, Reason, or Religion, must do it these two ways. Either first, they must contribute all they can actively, towards the discovery of these dangerous Conspirators; by all lawful ways and means. Or secondly, if that comes not within their pow∣er or knowledge to effect, they must do all they can not to obstruct their discovery, or be accessory to their Concealment; and they ought with the same Caution to avoid the sheltring, or even unwil∣ling securing of them from the hands of Justice, as
they would avoid the Common mischiefs, dangers, and Calamities, which they and the whole Nation, may fear from them, or suffer for want of such a discovery. Now how willing soever any people may be to pursue at once their duty and great Interest, by the first, yet in regard it will be difficult, hazzardous, and uncertain how they shall succeed; and the no∣torious cunning and dissimulation of these Malefa∣ctors protecting them, not only from vulgar discove∣ry, but many times from the most Criical, and piercing Eyes of the wisest Statesmen; there can therefore be nothing left for all true and honest Englishmen and real Protestants, but to clear them∣selves; and by such a Touchstone as will certainly di∣stinguish, the Papist and Jesuit from the Protestant, to vindicate themselves and discover the other. It may be some persons will think me very Con∣sident in offering such a Shibboleth as may certain∣ly detect these Ephraimites, if all Protestants would make use of it: but I am not sollicitous what any persons may think: if it be such an easie Expedient as will do the work, so effectually, that the Ene∣mies of our Peace, Religion, and Country, cannot avoid being discovered by it; and if it be such a Method as all true Protestants may and ought to make use of; it will be the opinion of the best and wisest men, and that is only valuable, that they who re∣fuse such a Test and way of Trial, must, either be Accomplices and Confederates with Papists and Je∣suits; or however accessory to all the Mischiefs which may happen, by their obstructing and frust∣rating such a Discovery.
It has before been intimated, and is notoriously observable by all people, how they do, and may elude all Oaths which may be offer'd them as a way of discrimination; for the greatest Criminals, ha∣ving the greatest concern to lie conceal'd, will not scruple in their extreme danger and necessity, any or all the Oaths that can be framed or offer'd them to take: and being before hand arm'd by dispen∣sations and pardons from their Omnipotent Pope, they will consult their own safety and the good of the Catholick Cause, without fear of swearing, or for∣swearing themselves; so that such Oaths will prove but Cobwebs to take the lesser Flies; while the Wasps and Hornets who carry the sting and the poyson will break through them and escape. Nay, possibly, they would not scruple to joyn with us in our Publick Service and Solemn Worship, which as much as some people account Popish and Superstitious, the Papists do detest and abhor; Nor would they refuse to hear Sermons in our Churches; though so long as there are so many Meetings of se∣veral sects they will be secured from those hardships too: for it is but joyning themselves to some of those of the Separation, and they both avoid that way of Tryal, and are more able successfully to prosecute their great design of overthrowing the Established Government both Civil and Ecclesiasti∣cal. But that which they abhor, and esteem so dam∣nable and deadly a sin as cannot be capable of any Dispensation, Pardon, or Indulgence, is to Commu∣nicate with Protestants, whom they believe and e∣steem
the greatest Hereticks, that ever were in the World; both in respect of their disowning Transub∣stantiation, and because we are all under the Popes Curse and Censure of Excommunication. This is that which will in all probability distinguish the Papist and Jesuit from the true Protestant; for whatever they may be allowed to do to secure themselves in other particulars, they will never, so far as we yet know, be compelled by us, or allowed by their Superiors to partake with us in the Holy Sacrament of the Lords Supper. I do not speak this to oppose any way of Publick proceedings against them by Oaths or Tests decla∣ring their believing that there is no Transubstan∣tiation of the Elements of Bread and Wine at or afer the Consecration of them in the Lords Supper, &c. if their Consciences can swallow and digest Perjury, much good may it do them; I am assured it can do us no injury, but will certainly render them obnoxious to that Vengeance which must and will infallibly fall upon perjur'd heads, and how sudden or severe that will be, let them look to it, for it nearly concerns them, whatever they may think. What I offer, is only in a private way, and to private persons, that they, in their sphere may be assistant to the Publick Ministers of Justice, and of State in the discovery of these dangerous and cunning sort of Men; and thereby contributing what lies in our power, to our own particular and the general security of his Most Sacred Majesty (whom God long preserve!) the Government, our Lives, Liberties, Laws, properties, Religion, and
Posterity, from the outrages, violences, treasons and Conspiracies of these our inveterate and mortal Enemies. And certainly would all people be perswaded to be Ʋnanimous in this duty of coming three times at the least in every Year to celebrate and pub∣lickly receive the Holy Sacrament of the Lords Sup∣per; and an account taken of all such as refuse and absent themselves; it would be impossible upon strict enquiry into their manner of life and other Cir∣cumstances, and especially tendering it to them on some Lords day next after such their Examination, that they should escape being discovered. One would think, that the proposal, were so ra∣tional so easie and so Religious, that none but the very Criminals themselves, or their Accessories and Confederates should refuse this way of Tryal and dis∣crimination; nor is it possible for any impartial per∣son to consider and deliberate of it, but he must in his Judgment accuse such as shall refuse it, as mani∣fest favourers of Papists and Jesuits. The Law E∣steems all such as aid, conceal, and comfort Trai∣tors, or protect them from discovery, to be Trai∣tors themselves: and though they may plead for themselves that they do not know them that are such, and that may free them from the Penalties and danger of the Laws of Men; yet this Ignorance being perfectly voluntary, and proceeding from their wilful neglect of the way and means they had to detect them, it will not excuse any persons in foro Conscientiae, before God and their own Consciences, from being guilty, not only of the Murders and
mischiefs that have already happen'd, but of what∣soever may or shall happen hereafter, for or by rea∣son of their escaping undiscovered: the true Maxim, qui non probibet cum post, jubet, will infallibly lie against them at the great day of accounts: He who has a possibility of preventing a Mischief, and either neglects or refuses to do it, most certainly in the sight of God the Righteous Judg, is guilty of it. I cannot tell what arguments to make choise of, in such a Crowd of them as come thronging into my mind, to persuade people to be willing and ready to perform a duty they owe to God and Man, in order to the securing our Peace and Religion, in their private Capacities, as well as the Govern∣ment is, to do all that can be done or devised in order to it: but however in short I will offer these following, as to me appearing most pressing and considerable: and if any other person can suggest more or more proper Motives it will become them, considering the present necessity, in charity to them∣selves and the Publick of offer them to the view and consideration of the people of these Na∣tions. First therefore I heartily wish that all people would consider with themselves, that what I offer is no Innovation; here is nothing proposed to them or imposed on them, but what the wisdom of our Ancestors, and of King James, esteemed one of the wisest Princes in the World, with the advice of his Parliament thought fit to pass into a Law; and I hope that very Name will oblige people to believe the owe a duty of obedience to it: all the diffe∣rence
seems to be this, that when that Statute was made, all Protestants in general received the holy Sacrament, and onely the Papists were they who refused to do it; whereas now it is to be feared through the industry of the Jesuits among us, many who call themselves Protestants will refuse it as well as Papists: however to shew the duty and the ad∣vantage of it, especially were it a little accommo∣dated to our present Circumstances, and because it does not lie in the way of every person to consult the Statute at large, I will faithfully set down so much of it as concerns our present Case and purpose. Tertio Ja∣cobi cap. 4. An Act for the better discovering and repres∣sing Popish Recusants.Forasmuch as it is found by daily Experience that many his Majesties Subjects, that adhere in their hearts to the Popish Religion, by the Infection drawn from thence, and by the wicked and devillish counsel of Jesuits, Seminaries, and other like persons, dan∣gerous to the Church and State, are so far perverted in the point of their loyalty and due Allegiance unto the Kings Majesty, and the Crown of England, as they are ready to entertain and execute any treason∣able Conspiracies and practises, as evidently appears by that more then barbarous and horrible attempt to have blown up with Gunpowder the King, Queen, Prince, Lords and Commons in the House of Parlia∣ment assembled, tending to the utter subversion of the whole State, lately undertaken by the Instigation of Jesuits and Seminaries, and in advancement of their Religi∣on, by their Schollars taught and instructed by them to that purpose, which attempt by the only goodness of Almighty God was discovered and defeated: and
whereas divers personsObserve that they judged all such as would not receive the Sacrament, to be Po∣pishly af∣fected.popishly affected do neverthe∣less, to cover and hide their false hearts and with more sufety to attend the opportunities to execute their mischievous designs, repair sometimes to Church, to avoid the Penalty of the Laws in that behalf provi∣ded. For the better discovery therefore of such persons, and their evil affections to the Kings Majesty and the State of this Realm, to the end that being known their evil purposes may be better prevented, Be it en∣acted by the Kings most excellent Majesty, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal and the Commons in this pre∣sent Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, That every popish Recusant convicted or hereaf∣ter to be convicted, which heretofore hath conformed him or her self, or which shall hereafter conform him or her self, and repair to the Church, and continue there during the time of Divine Service, according to the Laws and Statutes in that behalf made and provi∣ded shall within the first Year next after the end of this Session of Parliament, or within the first year after that he or she shall after this Session of Parliament so conform him or her self and repair to the Church as a∣foresaid, and after the first Year, once in every Year at the least, receive the blessed Sacrament of the Lords Supper in the Church of that parish where he or she shall most usually abide, or be within the said Year, where∣in by the true meaning of this Statue he or she ought to receive. And if there be no such parish Church, then in the Church next adjoyning to the place of his or her most usual abode. The forfeiture for the first year twen∣ty
pounds, for the second Year forty pounds, and for every Year after threescore pounds. And the Offi∣cers are therein by rewards incouraged to present the Monthly absence of all Recusants from the Church; and for default of performing their duty are to be fined, as in the Statute more largly ap∣pears. Were this Statute with a little variation fitted for our Circumstances, and duly put in Execution, it would be impossible but that all Recusants must in a small time be detected; and by consequence those dangerous Jesuits and Seminaries, whose whole design is to contrive, plot and execute, their horri∣ble Treasons against both Church and State: and un∣less people can be brought to comply with their own Interest as well as duty, the Excellent Method of that Law will be wholly impracticable; and it will be impossible to effect or attain the end, for which it was so wisely intended: for so long as such numbers of people who call themselves Protestants, shall wilfully absent themselves from their Parish Churches, under the shew of Religion; and by their Exam∣ple so many who have no Religion at all, but per∣fectly out of Idleness, looseness and debauchery, shall stay at home, or do worse abroad; these Traytors and Conspirators will expect and find Security, by pretending to be dissenters: and so long as there are so many who never regard any Laws of God or Men, Civil or Ecclesiastical which enjoyn them to receive the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, these will also pass undiscovered among the throng: for
it is all one to a Jesuit, whether he pass for a se∣paratist, Libertine, or Atheist, so long as he believes himself a good Catholique; and so long as there∣by he has the opportunity of concealment, and thereby to prosecute the main Affair of propagating the Popish interest and Religion, by the Ruine of Protestants and Protestant Religion. And therefore, in the second place, I wish that all people would seriously reflect with themselves at whose door the guilt will lie if by their means mischief either publick or private overtake us? If the glorious Light of the Gospel, the Lamp of Eter∣nal Truth should come to be extinguished by the Superstitious darkness of Rome; if by the Subver∣sion of England, the whole Protestant Cause should suffer and be ruin'd, as in all probability, if that Bullwork were blown up, it must; or however suffer a persecution as Sharp and cruel, as all those ten of the Primitive ages put together; the Pagans being nothing so ingenious and wittily Cruel as the Jesuits: if Millions of souls should by a false Re∣ligion come to perish Everlastingly: if our streets and fields should blush with the blood of Massa∣cred Protestants, our houses be reduced to ashes, and our miserable posterity, with such as should survive the Common Rage and desolation, should be made and sold for bondslaves: certainly there must be a strict account given to Almighty God by whose default all this came to pass? he gives us the means of securing our selves and if we neglect, the fault and guilt will be wholly theirs who do obstruct it; our blood will be upon their heads
who hear the Trumpet and see the Sword coming and are so far from taking or giving the All-arm, that they joyn with ours and their own Enemies, if they be not secret Papists, and put a Sword into their hands to slay us: when God to whom vengeance belongs, shall make Inquisition for blood he will not forget the cry of the poor; he will not forget those who have been the occasions, no more then those who were the Actors of cruelty; and how it is pos∣sible for those who obstruct the discovery of Popish Priests and Jesuits, not to be in the sight of God and men guilty of all the Miseries and mischiefs which may be occasioned by their concealment, I must protest my self to be utterly ignorant. If there can be found any persons so incredu∣lous as not to be apprehensive of these dangers from them, and who may that way think to evade the necessity that lies upon them to contribute their utmost towards this Discovery: I will in short endeavour to convince them from Former Exam∣ples. Let the horrible Massacre in France be re∣membred, in which according to the Relation even of Popish Historians, there perished near a hundred thousand Protestants of all Ages, Sexes and Condi∣tions: among which, twenty Lords of Eminency, twelve hundred Gentlemen, persons of great Con∣dition in the City of Paris, besides what fell in o∣ther places: The subtile Contrivance and deep dis∣simulation with which it was managed, and the Exquisite and ingenious Cruelty with which it was Executed, may sufficiently Instruct us, what we are to trust to, from such Murderers, as glory in what
is the shame and reproach of humane Nature, and render the most propitious and merciful Divinity, a cruel and sanguinary Being, while they pretend to please and do him acceptable service by such bloody sacrifices, as even heathens generally by the light of mere nature thought he abhorred: and who en∣courage one another in mischief, as if the Heavenly Paradice, were an Aceldama, and to be purchac'd with the price of blood: making such actions of orror and Cruelty as even exceed belief, merito∣rious performances capable to enrol them in the Catalogue of their Calender Saints: though we know none shall ascend the holy Hill, but they who have clean hands as well as a pure heart. If this were not sufficient to convince us at the expence of our neighbours, that which comes near∣er to us, is the Rebellion and Massacre of the English Protestants in Ireland; the fatal Flambeau, which kindled our English Flames; the Cruelties which were then exercised are beyond Expression and belief, three hundred thousand souls perished by most, cruel deaths, according to computation, and God onely knows how many more, who could never be brought into account: and both in this and the Parisian Massacre how many of those who escaped the barbarous Rage of these merciless Butchers, perished afterwards with cold, hunger, nakedness, and all the hardships that attend the miserable Condition to which they were exposed? Whither to fly they knew not, but generally to the Woods and Forrests, nor there, how to supply the necessities of Nature, having nothing left them
but their lives, and no way of securing those long from the importunities of Cold and Famine; thus did they languish out a few miserable hours till faint and weary, they became a prey to the Wolves, or fell into the paws of the Tories, the less merci∣ful beasts of the two. How many mournful and desolate Widows, how many distressed and misera∣ble Orphans were then exposed to all the mise∣ries of lif, before they knew what it was to live, and compelled to suffer all Extremities before they had done good or evil? Oh Injustice and uncomiserating Cruelty! Oh more then brutish In∣humanity! And if the Romish Religion, command, encou∣rage and reward such execrable barbarity, to be exercised upon the Innocent, what kind of Re∣venge can we imagine will they nor invent for those, who dare oppose them? what torments, what lingring and retail deaths would they think e∣nough for such grand Heretiques as have slain their Apostles, whom they have employed to convert us to the Catholique Faith? Suetonius reports of Tiberius Caesar, one of the Popes predecessors in the Roman throne, that he was a person so extraor∣dinary cruel, that when a condemned person made it his importunate request that he might be dis∣patched quickly, he gave him this bitter Sarcasm in answer, Nondum tecum redii in grtiam, No Sir, by your favour, you and I are not yet come to be such good friends. Certainly not onely Romulus, but Rome her self, her Kings, Emperors and Popes have been nursed by Wolves; for sure the breasts
of any thing that has humane shape, must instill sentiments more tender and compassionate. There is not the most guilty head, that shall suffer deserved Death for this Execrable Conspiracy, but will be esteemed a Saint and Martyr in the Romish Church. Their great St. Thomas of Canter∣bury, so famous for his Shrine and Miracles, and the infamous Prayers made to him, as a Rival of the Son of God, who was by the account we have of Him in our History, as ungrateful a Rebel to his Prince as can be imagined, may abundantly satisfie us in that particular: and if ever they come to reckon with us for such precious blood; it may be easily conjectur'd, at what rate we must pay for those Canonizations: let us be assured that a thousand fold would not be look'd upon as a Compensation for the lives of such, as though we justly think Monsters, they believe to be Mi∣racles of men while they lived, and would per∣swade their blind Votaries, that their very shrines can do▪ Miracles after their Death. The Pope and his Ministers of Cruelty will never be so far reconciled to any Protestants that shall come with∣in their power as to let them die at once; but would be as gratious to them as Caligula another Heathen Pope or Emperor was to such as by his Tyranny were condemned to die; and that as the Historian relates was, that he was used to com∣mand them to be so executed ut se sentirent mori. He would not have them lose their lives by Le∣ger de main and a slight of hand, but they must die by inches, and be sensible of every slow degree of approaching death.
What pen can describe the terrible dresses of uncommon deaths which would be invented for us? What tongue is able to express its ghastly shapes, and the new fashion'd garments of Cruel∣ty, or the rage of prevailing Popery? What heart can think of them, and of suffering them without the extremest horror? If death in his mildest and most natural appearance be so dreadful, as to de∣serve the title of the most terrible of all Terribles, what must he be when he is accompanied with all the Inventions of Tyranny? Who that saw them, or that heard the sad Relation, can remember Lon∣don in her raging Flames without astonishment? who can think upon her dismal Ruines and ashes without amazement? how did all faces gather blackness? how were they pained? what trem∣blings of heart at the flying Rumors of a Massacre then intended? What horror, Confusion and asto∣nishment would lay hold upon us, if we should see our Enemies break in upon us like an over∣flowing fire; a fire devouring before them, and be∣hind them a flame burning, the land as the Garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness? and no possibility of Escaping, but they who fled from the fire must fall upon the glittering Sword; they who escaped the drawn sword; must perish by Famine: and is it possible there should be any persons who will not contri∣bute all they can to prevent these, which are not only imaginary, but real dangers? Can it be look'd upon as a thing so indifferent, that people should run all these hazzards, that a
whole Nation should lie at Stake and perish, ra∣ther then they will abate a foolish scruple, or a ri∣gid opinion to preserve them; rather then go to the places dedicated to the service of God and re∣ceive the holy Sacrament, thereby to dec are their own Innocence, and detect the Authors of our dan∣ger, the Enemies of our Peace and Safety? Sure it is much easier to kneel at the holy Table, out of Re∣verence, not adoration, of the Bread and Wine; then to have the choice either to kneel and adore a Consecrated Wafer, or to kneel at a Stake in Smithfield? Is it not far better to wash our hands in innocence, and offer unto God the sacrifice of thanksgiving; then to be guilty of the blood of so many as should suffer by our being accessory to the accomplishment of the Traiterous designs of the Jesuits; and Sacrifice a Nation and many succeed∣ing generations, many people of other Nations to the Romish cruelty, meerly out of obstinacy to our own prejudices, and it may be Fancies, which these very Jesuits and Seminaries have put in our heads? Certainly all those who would not be thought, and in the Eye of the Law Esteemed Re∣cusants and Papists, ought not to make the least scruple to use this or any other lawful and neces∣sary expedient, that shall by the publick Wisdom be thought necessary for our common preservation: Nor will it be satisfactory that they shall in words disown the Church of Rome, and declaim against it, or disavow all Confederacy or Complotting with the Papists: the arrantest Jesuit in England will do this upon occasion, to save his own life and en∣danger
ours: and if they hinder the building up of the Walls of our Jerusalem, what does it sig∣nifie how much they either say they do, or hate the Church of Rome, since whether they conspire with the Papists, or not, if they assist them in accomplishing their intended Design of Ruining the Protestant Religion, it is the same thing? on∣ly with this difference, that what the one par∣ty does with Design, the other does with their folly. And though men should not value their Estates, Lives, or Liberties, which some people seem wil∣ling to part with, rather then assist the Govern∣ment, manifest their own innocency and detect the guilty, by endeavouring to promote the Common Security; yet one would think that which they call their Religion and Conscience, should oblige them to submit to this or any other way of Tri∣al and discrimination: they may hope for in∣dulgence from Protestants though of differing opi∣nions, but they must not hope for the least crums of Indulgence or favour from Papists; not all the services they have done them will be remembred with the least gratitude or tenderness; no conside∣ration of tender Consciences is able to soften those hearts who are more obdurate then Marble and Adamant, and as Charles the Ninth of France, in whose Reign the Massacre of Paris was executed, said to the Prince of Condé, Mass, Death, or the Bastile, so would they say to all Protestants, whe∣ther Dissenters or others, Turn, or burn. For un∣less they be secret Papists, which no body can tell
but they are, if they will not submit to a way of Trial, and unless they resolve to be open and professed ones, upon the first opportunity; they cannot expect any favour or Clemency from pre∣vailing Popery; it is stream so rapid and vio∣lent, that it drowns all that will not swim down the furious torrent; and should that inundation break our banks, all Protestants must either make Shipwrack of their Lives and Fortunes, or of their Faith and a good Conscience, for they would ve∣rifie their rule to a letter, Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus, No safety in any sence is with them to be found, expected, or so much as hoped for, out of the Ark of their Church. For though the Church of England, as that which stands the main pil∣lar of Truth, be what they chiefly hate, and en∣deavour to ruine; yet in the fall thereof they would certainly crush all other Pretenders to Reformation of what names or distinction so∣ever. In extraordinary Cases of such impendent dan∣ger, people do not use to be so critically scrupu∣lous, whatever they may be at other times; but every mans fear is his own Pope, and can grant dispensations for matters of greater scruple then this can be: if any persons can think themselves secure or out of danger, not onely at this time, but at all times, so long as England is infested with such Wolves and Tygers, it must be such peo∣ple as either have no Religion, and so care not what is uppermost, but like empty clouds can ride upon any wind, and change into any form; or such
as desire the Romish Religion may again prevail and be established in these Nations; or else such as are not sensible that the Doctrines and Pra∣ctice of that Church teach and authorize, Sediti∣on, Rebellion, Murder, and the utter extirpation of all Heretiques, by all or any ways or methods whatsoever. To convince people of this, there is nothing more clear and evident, not onely from the Wri∣tings of private Doctors among them, but from several Bulls of former Popes, and from the De∣crees of their Councils, which would be too long here to insert, and are already notoriously known to all learned men; and for those who want ei∣ther opportunity or ability to peruse their Wri∣tings, they may read enough in the Bloody Ru∣bricks of their Actions to convince them of the reality as well as greatness of their danger, nor need they seek for Foreign Examples, who will not credit those before given; our own Coun∣try, and this City Renowned over all the habi∣table World, will afford the most unlettered Peo∣ple instances more then enough, both of former times, and yet fresh and bleeding date; Smith∣field will never forget the cruel Bonfires of Queen Maries short life and Reign; and what treatment our Fathers were to have received from the In∣vincible Armada of Eighty Eight, had it proved more then an unluckly boast, the whips, chains, shackles, knives, daggers, and other Instruments of cruelty with which, and Savage Butchers that Navy made the Ocean groan, are certainly able to
instruct the dullest, or the weakest capacities. Nor are the Jesuits grown more mild or gentle by the f equent disappointments, which our merciful and gracious God had in compassion to us given them; but rather more furious and exasperated: and since Heaven refuses to favour their Treasons, they have made a Covenant with Hell, and an agree∣ment with Death to take their part. I will not repeat the confident, and beyond all former things audacious Murthers, which they have com∣mitted, even since the discovery of their intend∣ed Conspiracy; there is not a child in the Streets but can give a Narrative of the Tragedy: so un∣relenting and incorrigible are they even when the Rod of God is upon them, and so blinded with the rage of cruelty and revenge, that they will not see that the hand of God is gone out a∣gainst them; and what would they do then, should God permit them to ride in triumph over our heads? certainly their proud waters would have gone even over our soul, they would have swallowed us up quick when they were so wrathfully displeased at us. And whenever the bottom of this dark de∣sign shall be opened; when these chambers of Death and habitations of Cruelty shall be exposed to the light of the Sun, which it is to be hoped a little time will do; the whole World shall be witness, that there is little reason to doubt a syl∣lable of what I have written. There is but one thing more which at present I would propose to the Consideration of People,
and especially those of this City, which is justly celebrated as the most noble Emporium or Mart of the World. That our greatness, strength and power, our Riches and trade, and in a word, the well-being plenty and prosperity, as well as the Peace of our Nation, does in the greatest measure depend up∣on our Maritine strength, there will not be found any who can deny. That this strength at Sea, depends upon the encouragement and support of Traffick and Navigation will likewise be agreed on all hands. That it is therefore and ought to be the design of every good Subject and Citizen as well as it is of the King and Government, to pro∣mote these, will by an undeniable Consequence follow from these premises. How invidiously all our Neighbours, especially those of the Roman Religion, look upon this great power of our Nation at Sea; and how ingrate∣ful that Ʋniversal Traffique which we maintain throughout the World is to them, is easily to be observed by their endeavouring to come in with us for a share: they know little of the affairs of France, who do not take notice how industrious that Monarch and his great Ministers of State, and particularly Monsieur Colbert are, to encourage and extend the arms of their Foreign Trade, and to discourage all besides the Natives of France, and how Considerable within this few years they have have themselves in comparison of former times;
and whoever shall view the Ports of Thoulon, Marseilles, Brest, Rochel, &c. And see them proud with their stately Castles of Wood, heretofore strangers to the Tydes of France: whoso shall withal reflect upon the actions of Tobago in the West-Indies, and Palermo in Sicily, where the Heer de Ruyter, who had saved Holland from the pow∣er of England fell under the rising Arms of France: he that will bring these propositions together, shall be able to draw a Demonstrative conclusion from them, that France, will in a few Years strug∣gle hard for the Dominion and Sovereignty of the Seas. Nor will they make any Scruple, if Interest did not animate them to it, upon the account, or at least the pretence of Religion, to disturb and weaken us Heretiques, in our Trade, and Naviga∣tion, especially in the Levant, where by the Com∣modiousness of their Ports, they will have all the advantages to do it: and if once they come not to dread our power, or be able to grapple with us in the Streights, and make themselves Masters of that important place of strength and situation Tangier, they will either totally exclude us if they can, or however come in with us for the greatest share of the Commerce of the Mediterranean; and if they shall gain their point so far, as to cut off one Limb of our Traffique, our Navigation and by consequence our Power at Sea, will by degrees decline apace: and what we lose, they will certain∣ly gain; and if they arrive to that degree, to
ride Admirals of the Ocean, of necessity we shall be permitted only to truckle under them, and shall have just so much trade, as we steal, or they are not able to mannage. Now the most probable way that can be proposed to ruine our Traffique and Navigation, and thereby to secure and increase their own; is to discourage Foreign Merchants, and oblige them to withdraw their Effects, and to starve ours for want of Trade: for by this means they will in a few Years be able to give new Laws of An Island in France, where the first Maritine Laws were made.Oleron to the Seas. The ready way to Effect this, is to keep us in continu∣al broyls among our selves: for what a damp must it of necessity give to all Merchants, both English and Foreigners to be in such an insecure Conditi∣on, that they must have not onely the hazards and damages of Winds and Seas, Rocks and Pi∣rats to venture upon, but that they must be every moment in fear of suffering Shipwrack on the shoar? The Change I doubt not is sufficiently sen∣sible of this truth at present; and if one sees a full morning Change, it is more to barter news, then to drive bargains; and that trade brings in no Cu∣stoms to the Crown, nor Riches to the Nation; and so long as we cannot be secure, but that by the treachery of these Jesuits and Seminaries, our City may again be reduced to ashes, our persons secret∣ly murdered, that we know not who to trust, nay the Royal Person and Government destroyed in a moment, and mens Estates given to the ravage of the Murderers, what encouragement can Merchants
have to trade? so long as there are so many poi∣sonous Spiders laying their cunning nets and toyles to take and destroy them: what courage can the Innocent and industrious Bees have to gather Hony for the Common Hive? Besides it is worth our Consideration, how de∣fenceless so great an Island as this is, and how li∣able to Foreign Invasions, and Depredations, if ei∣ther their own Shiping and Naval power decays, or does not exceed or at least equal that of our Neighbours: and should any of them grow so po∣tent at Sea, as either out of Ambition, or Zeal to propagate the Catholique Religion to attempt an in∣vasion upon us; how dangerous is it to have a party within ready to joyn with them, to com∣pleat a Conquest upon our Ruine? Assuredly, so long as there are so many Semi∣naries and Jesuits among us, they will constantly be gaining Proselytes among us to their own Church, and making factions and divisions in ours: where∣as were we clear of them, we might hope in time the number of Papists would decrease, and cer∣tainly many of the more simple and innocent Pa∣pists, startled with the blackness of this horrid trea∣son, or for fear of the penal Laws, will return to their Allegiance and duty; and many more would, if they were not buoy'd up by the imaginary dangers with which their Priests affright them, or encouraged by the meritoriousness of that obsti∣nacy, in which they do all they can to confirm
them: But so long as the Romish party can by our Divisions shelter their Priests from discovery and the just punishment of the Laws, they will not on∣ly be confirmed in their pertinacy, but they will be always ready to receive such impressions of dis∣loyalty from them, and upon occasion to throw off, not only all duty and Allegiance to their Sovereign, but all morality, and even humanity it self, in de∣fence, and for the promoting of the Catholique Interest: and so long as we have so many sorts of Protestant Dissenters, who will not submit to any certain way of Discovering who are Jesuits, and who are not; we must certainly be contented, whether we will or no, to have these Amorites and Jebusites in our Land, as Goads in our sides, and thorns in our Eyes: we must sit down with our fears and dangers, and only have the feeble power to know and lament our misery, but not to help it. To conclude, If either our Lives, our Liberties, our Religion, our Interest, our Duty or our Danger, the glory of our Nation, or the natural affection we owe to our Posterity, have any power or Influence upon the people of these Nations, to be unanimous in detecting the Authors of our present fears, or fu∣ture apprehensions; they all call aloud upon evey man, to use all lawful ways and means to clear them∣selves from the dreadful guilt of being Accessories and Confederates to our own, and the ruine of the Reformed Apostolick and truly Christian Religion; and if nothing of all this will move the hearts of men to compassionate themselves, God have com∣passion
upon us! And if we must suffer, permit us to fall into his hands, for his mercies are great; lt us not fall into the hands of Men, and of all Mankind, not into the hands of these Wicked and Blood-thirsty Men, whose Tender Mercies are Cruelty it self. Exurgat Deus, dissipentur inimici. FINIS.
