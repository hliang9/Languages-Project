A Pindarick ODE, ON New-Year's-Day, &c. I. BEHOLD, how all the Stars give way; Behold, how the Revolving Sphere, Swells to bring forth the Sacred Day; That ushers in the Mighty Year; Whilst Ianus with his double Face Viewing the present Time and past, In strong Prophetick Fury sings, Our Nations Glory and our King's. II. See England's Genius, like the dazling Sun, Proud of his Race, to our Horizon run To welcome that Coelestial Power, That of this Glorious Year begins the Happy Hour: A Year from whence shall Wonders come; A Year to bafle France and Rome, And bound the dubious Fate of Warring Christendom. III. Move on with Fame, all ye Triumphant Days, To Britain's Honour, and to Caesar's Praise; Let no short Hour of this Year's bounded Time, Pass by without some Act sublime: Great WILLIAM, Champion of the Mighty States, And all the Princes the Confederates:
Ploughs the Green Neptune, whilst to wast Him o'er, The Fates stand smiling on the Belgick Shoar: And now the Gallick Genius Trembles, How e'er she Pannick Fear dissembles; To know the Mighty League, and view the Mighty Pow'r, So when the Persian Pride of old, Disdain'd their God the Sun, With Armies, and more powerful Gold, Did half the World o'er run, Brave Alexander chang'd their Scorn to Awe, And Came, and Fought, and Conquer'd like NASSAU. IV. Then welcome Wondrous Year, More Happy and Serene, Then any ever did appear, To bless Great Caesar and his Queen: May every Hour encrease their Fames; Whilst Ecchoing Skies resound their Names. And when Unbounded Joy, and the Excess Of all that can be found in Humane Bliss, Fall on 'em, may each Year be still like this, Health, Fortune, Grandeur, Fame, and Victory, And Crowning all, a Life, long as Eternity. CHORUS. Come ye Sons of Great Apollo, Let your charming Consorts follow; Sing of Triumph, sing of Beauty, Sing soft Ayres of Loyal Duty; Give to Caesar's Royal Fair Songs of Ioy to Calm her Care; Bid the less Auspicious Year Adieu, And give her joyful Welcomes to the New. FINIS.
